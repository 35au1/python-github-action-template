            "article_content": "A lot of AI tools promise something like magic. Just write down all the stuff you need to do, or better yet, just let the tool record every second of your life, and presto manifesto, it\u2019ll do\u2026 something. Buy plane tickets, maybe, or magically reorder your calendar to maximize your flow state. The idea is huge and enticing, that you could just live your life and your AI assistant will make everything happen on your behalf. But hardly any of it works.\n\nThe developers of the app Twos are taking a much more cautious and, as a result, much more actually useful approach. Twos is an app for taking notes, managing to-dos, and generally making lists of any and every kind \u2014 Parker Klein, the app\u2019s creator, just calls it \u201ca place to write things down.\u201d Klein has been working on the app for nearly a decade, first as a tool just for himself and most recently as a true startup. I\u2019ve been using Twos off and on for a couple of years, and there\u2019s a lot to like about the app.\n\nThe Twos AI approach, which Klein and cofounder Joe Steilberg call \u201csmart suggestions,\u201d is to use AI to help you simply take the first step in getting something done. If you write down the name of a movie, Twos might offer you a link to a JustWatch search or the IMDb page for that movie. If you write a person\u2019s name and phone number, it can add them to your contacts with one tap. If you\u2019re making a grocery list, it\u2019ll send you to Amazon or Walmart or Instacart to buy it.\n\nThe logic behind all these suggestions is really simple: Twos looks for certain words and phrases to determine what you\u2019re trying to do and which integration makes the most sense. (You can pick and choose, too \u2014 I never use Uber Eats, for instance, so I turned that off entirely.) All the smart suggestions really do is take the first step. They\u2019re definitely not perfect \u2014 when I type \u201cbake blueberry muffins,\u201d it offers me an Allrecipes link, which is helpful and relevant, and a Google Maps search for \u201cblueberry muffins around me,\u201d which is not. But even in the feature\u2019s early days, I\u2019ve found it way more useful than almost every other, vastly more ambitious productivity tool.\n\nLike any to-do list app worth its valuation, Twos now has an AI chatbot. Image: Twos\n\nTwos also has a built-in chatbot, which you can use to ask questions about your notes. If you use your note-taking app like a journal, this can be really cool \u2014 \u201cwhat was the name of that Thai food place we went to a few weeks ago?\u201d is a surprisingly common question in my life. Lots of apps have something like this, and they all suffer from the same problem: if you don\u2019t put everything in the app, the search isn\u2019t that useful. But whether it\u2019s Notion or Dropbox or Twos, the AI integrations reward the heaviest users.\n\nAI turns Twos into not just my to-do list but the jumping-off point for all my tasks. Since the app works across platforms \u2014 it\u2019s fundamentally a web app, but there are versions for Android and iOS, Windows and Mac, and more \u2014 it\u2019s easy to just dump information into. Then, when it\u2019s time to leave for the restaurant I wrote down and promptly forgot the name of, I open Twos, tap the sparkles that appear next to any item with a smart suggestion, and it opens Google Maps and directs me there. You can store and organize things inside of Twos, but I find myself using it transiently, just for the small things in day-to-day life. I need to make bread: click the sparkles, bread recipes appear. Remember to buy those Sesame Street bath toys for the kid: click the sparkles, Amazon search done. Ollie\u2019s birthday is December 7th: click the sparkles, in my contacts.\n\nFor now, the Twos smart suggestions are only available in beta testing, and there\u2019s a waitlist for new users. (Though Klein did tell me that if you sign up and use the code \u201cVerge,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to skip the line.) Klein and Steilberg are working on more integrations and more ways to do even more with just a few words of your writing. They\u2019re obviously enticed by how far this might go. Why not automatically buy the toys or start the grocery delivery and take a cut for themselves? It\u2019s an age-old idea, that one. Any.do tried it years ago; there was even a frenzy of apps like Magic that would do it all via text message. Even the Alexa business model used to depend on you being willing to just shout \u201cbuy toilet paper\u201d at your speaker and trust it to do the rest.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the idea: it doesn\u2019t work. There are too many logistical questions, too many ways to screw it up, and too many consequences for getting it wrong that it\u2019s not going to work anytime soon. If ever."

            "article_content": "Imagine unlocking the full potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionize your social media marketing strategies. In this exclusive Q&A, insights from founders and Marketing leaders reveal groundbreaking ways AI is being used creatively in the industry. With nineteen expert opinions, the discussion kicks off with using AI for cultural bridge-building and concludes with tailoring GPTs for platform-specific content. Discover how these innovative approaches can elevate your brand\u2019s online presence.\n\nUse AI for Cultural Bridge-Building\n\nElevate Engagement with Hyper-Targeted Content\n\nCreate Hyper-Personalized Content for Audiences\n\nCraft Real-Time Trend Hijacking Campaigns\n\nLeverage AI for Dynamic Personalized Ads\n\nTurn Reviews into Testimonial Videos\n\nEnhance Human-Centered Design with AI\n\nStreamline Content Creation with AI\n\nRevolutionize Marketing with AI Copilot\n\nBrainstorm and Tailor Messaging with AI\n\nSpeed Up LinkedIn Post Creation\n\nAutomate Blog-Based Social Media Posts\n\nUtilize AI for Campaign Planning\n\nMonitor Conversations with AI Sentiment Analysis\n\nRestructure Content Strategy with AI Insights\n\nCurate Content for Multichannel Engagement\n\nCreate Stunning Visuals with Canva\u2019s AI\n\nIdentify Micro-Influencers with AI Analysis\n\nTailor GPTs for Platform-Specific Content\n\nUse AI for Cultural Bridge-Building\n\nRather than chasing viral trends or relying on AI-generated content, we\u2019ve revolutionized our social media strategy by using AI as a cultural bridge-builder. Our proprietary sentiment analysis system doesn\u2019t just track mentions\u2014it identifies cultural nuances and regional preferences across our markets. This insight helps our human team craft authentically localized content that resonates deeply in each region.\n\nFor instance, we discovered that our East Coast audience engages most with sustainability-focused content early in the week, while our West Coast followers respond better to innovation stories shared during evening commute hours. AI helps us optimize these timing patterns while our creative team develops market-specific narratives that feel native to each region.\n\nThe results speak volumes: 47% increase in cross-regional engagement and a 3x boost in qualified lead generation. Most importantly, we\u2019ve built genuine connections with diverse audience segments who now see us as a brand that truly understands their unique perspectives and values.\n\nThe key is using AI as an insights engine to empower human creativity, not replace it. Let AI handle the heavy lifting of pattern recognition while your team focuses on crafting authentic, regionally relevant stories that forge real emotional connections. This approach transforms social media from a broadcast channel into a powerful tool for building genuine relationships.\n\nSolomon Thimothy\n\nPresident, OneIMS\n\nElevate Engagement with Hyper-Targeted Content\n\nWe used AI to elevate a client\u2019s social media strategy by creating hyper-targeted, engaging content at scale. One specific campaign leveraged AI-driven sentiment analysis to craft personalized replies to hundreds of customer comments. The AI analyzed tone, intent, and keywords in comments, allowing us to respond with tailored messages that resonated on an emotional level, boosting engagement by 40% within a month.\n\nIn another instance, we trained an AI model to generate short-form videos from existing long-form content. For a fitness brand, this meant repurposing webinar footage into bite-sized clips optimized for Instagram Reels and TikTok. The AI identified key moments, added subtitles, and suggested captions based on trending keywords. This approach not only saved hours of manual editing but also increased video reach by 300%, proving how AI can amplify content creation while maintaining relevance and authenticity.\n\nBrandon Leibowitz\n\nOwner, SEO Optimizers\n\nCreate Hyper-Personalized Content for Audiences\n\nWe\u2019ve used AI to make social media marketing more effective and engaging by creating hyper-personalized content for different audiences.\n\nThis involved launching a campaign to promote our data analytics platform to marketers from various industries, such as retail, tech, and finance. We used AI to analyze large sets of audience data, including interests, demographics, and past engagement patterns. Based on this, we identified what each audience segment cared about most. For instance, retail marketers wanted insights on customer behavior trends, while finance teams were focused on ROI tracking.\n\nNext, we fed this data into an AI-powered content generator to create customized social media posts tailored to each segment. For retail marketers, the posts highlighted features like predictive analytics for customer behavior. For finance professionals, we focused on how our platform tracks and boosts ROI. AI also helped suggest optimal hashtags, posting times, and even visual styles to increase engagement.\n\nHowever, we didn\u2019t stop there. We used AI-driven sentiment analysis, to track real-time responses to the campaign. This allowed us to quickly tweak the messaging or visuals for underperforming posts, ensuring every part of the campaign stayed relevant and engaging.\n\nThe result? A significant increase in engagement rates and higher-quality leads from social media. By using AI, we transformed our digital marketing efforts into a smarter, data-driven process that spoke directly to the needs of different audiences. It showed how AI can take personalization to the next level in a creative and impactful way.\n\nIra Prevalova\n\nGrowth Marketing Director, Adverity\n\nCraft Real-Time Trend Hijacking Campaigns\n\nAs a Social Media Marketer, I used AI to craft a \u201creal-time trend hijacking\u201d campaign for a food brand. The AI tool tracked trending keywords and memes, then came up with witty, brand-relevant content within minutes. For instance, during a viral meme trend, the AI created a post featuring our signature burger with the trending meme format, which we quickly shared. The post went viral, gaining 150K+ engagements in 24 hours and driving a 40% increase in web traffic to the brand\u2019s delivery page.\n\nShalu Sharma\n\nSocial Media Manager, BigOhTech\n\nLeverage AI for Dynamic Personalized Ads\n\nWe leveraged AI to create dynamic, personalized content for social media ads. Using AI tools like ChatGPT and Canva\u2019s AI design features, we crafted tailored captions and visuals based on user demographics, browsing behavior, and past purchase history. For example, we ran a campaign showcasing product recommendations, where AI analyzed customer preferences to generate hyper-personalized ad copy and visuals. This creative use of AI allowed us to automate A/B testing for ad variations, optimizing performance in real time. The campaign increased click-through rates by 25% and boosted engagement by fostering a more personalized connection with our audience.\n\nMuhammad Nurul Afsar\n\nSEO Manager, Numinix\n\nTurn Reviews into Testimonial Videos\n\nRecruitment marketing is where we really get to have fun with AI for social media. We took our best Glassdoor reviews and turned them into testimonial videos using AI avatars. It took 5 minutes each, and we were able to highlight great employee comments that would otherwise never have been seen. We also promote specific jobs with AI avatars. Finally, we made some fun songs to promote specific jobs.\n\nBrooke Browne\n\nMarketing Director, Smartbridge\n\nEnhance Human-Centered Design with AI\n\nAs the visual designer leading marketing at a WOC-led digital design agency, we\u2019ve taken a thoughtful approach to AI integration, using it to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014our human-centered design process. Recently, we experimented with AI to help streamline our content versioning across platforms while maintaining our commitment to authentic, inclusive representation.\n\nWe use AI tools to help us quickly adapt our design messaging for different platform contexts\u2014taking a LinkedIn post and suggesting variations that would resonate better with our Instagram audience, for instance. However, we always ensure these AI suggestions go through our team\u2019s cultural and inclusivity lens before implementation. This hybrid approach has allowed us to maintain our authentic voice while increasing our content efficiency by about 32%.\n\nThe key lesson? AI works best as an enhancement to human creativity, not a replacement. We\u2019ve found the sweet spot lies in using AI for the heavy lifting of content adaptation, while keeping the core storytelling and inclusive design decisions firmly in human hands.\n\nAlexandra Brown\n\nVisual Designer, Oak Theory\n\nStreamline Content Creation with AI\n\nOur absolute favorite strategy is done in 4 steps:\n\nFirst, after we return from travel, we sit down and have a conversation about the trip and record it using Claude AI. With Claude, you can record up to 10 minutes, which can end up being around 1,000 words.\n\nThen we ask Claude to format the conversation into a blog post. We normally rework this draft further, moving sections around and generating components that will add maximum value to the reader, but we always ask the tool to retain our original wording as much as possible. This is very important.\n\nNext, we prompt the tool to give us recommendations on the existing content, and suggestions for additional content. As with all prompts, we make the tool aware of the audience we are writing for, and our goal, which is always to provide the best UX.\n\nAfter acting on the best recommendations, we then prompt the tool to create 5 posts for the various social media platforms we are on (e.g., Instagram and Tik Tok), getting inspiration for our style, voice, and language from the original transcript.\n\nWe begin the process with real experience followed by a real conversation. This is key because where you source content is critical for originality and uniqueness.\n\nThen, we use AI for efficiency, organization, and ideation. Our conversation becomes a blog, which is enhanced by an AI editing process. Our enhanced article becomes 5 distinct ideas for multiple social media posts.\n\nIdeation, efficiency, organization, and even creation (properly sourced) are all great uses of AI and this process has nearly eliminated the fatigue from writing, overthinking, and having to do some of these things manually, which allows us to put our energy into accumulating more experiences and ensuring our content is true to those experiences and delivers the most value to our readers.\n\nBrian Gorman\n\nOwner, BrianShio\n\nRevolutionize Marketing with AI Copilot\n\nOur organization has creatively implemented AI to revolutionize our social media marketing. Using our AI solution, OfficeIQ, we developed an AI copilot trained on our brand\u2019s specific tone, style, and marketing data. This copilot generates tailored social copies, articles, campaign ideas, and email drafts, all aligned with our brand voice, saving significant time and effort.\n\nAdditionally, our AI tool helps with sentiment analysis to evaluate the emotional impact of each post and track engagement metrics. By understanding the sentiment our content generates, we refine our strategy to create content that resonates more effectively with our audience.\n\nLata Tewari\n\nChief Marketing Officer, Webuters Technologies Pvt Ltd\n\nBrainstorm and Tailor Messaging with AI\n\nMy company has embraced AI in a big way to take our social media marketing efforts to the next level. One of the most impactful ways we\u2019ve used it is through tools like ChatGPT to help brainstorm post ideas, write captions, and even tailor messaging for different audiences. This has been a lifesaver during those inevitable creative blocks or when we needed a lot of content ideas quickly to keep our campaigns fresh and engaging. Using ChatGPT allowed us to stay consistent with our posting schedule and focus on strategy rather than spending endless hours coming up with concepts from scratch.\n\nOn top of that, we\u2019ve utilized tools like CarouselMaker.co to streamline the creation of carousel posts, which can typically be time-intensive to design. These tools sped up production significantly, making it easier to create visually engaging content without overloading our team or our budget.\n\nWhile we did sometimes sacrifice a little quality by relying on AI, the trade-off was worth it. It allowed us to produce content at scale, stay cost-effective, and meet the high demands of a fast-paced social media environment. For us, it\u2019s been all about striking the right balance between quality and efficiency, and AI has been a critical piece in making that happen.\n\nKyle Morris\n\nCEO / Founder, LawTurbo\n\nSpeed Up LinkedIn Post Creation\n\nAI has been an extremely valuable tool for our marketing team. While content writing itself is still best done by human hands, having an AI creative \u201cassistant\u201d has opened the door to new ideas and expedited workflows. Our strongest social media channel is LinkedIn. Using the OpenAI API platform, our marketing team created a LinkedIn Social Media assistant armed with the knowledge and training of our LinkedIn strategy. We use the assistant chatbot to grab key points from our high performing blog articles to repurpose them into LinkedIn posts. This was something we used to do manually, but the workflow is now significantly faster. Just plug in the article, make some quick edits to give it that human touch and ensure accuracy, and then your post is ready to go on your content calendar.\n\nJack Perkins\n\nFounder and CEO, CFO Hub\n\nAutomate Blog-Based Social Media Posts\n\nWe used AI in social media marketing by leveraging it to analyze our blog sitemap and generate new social media posts. The AI tool read through our existing blog content, identified key themes, and crafted posts along with relevant hashtags, making it easy and quick for us to promote our existing blogs.\n\nThis approach simplified our social media strategy by automating the process of content creation while ensuring each post stayed aligned with our brand and messaging. It saved us hours of manual effort and helped maintain a steady stream of engaging posts.\n\nMark London\n\nPresident/CEO, Verity IT\n\nUtilize AI for Campaign Planning\n\nWe don\u2019t use AI to generate content for our social media campaigns. However, we find it very helpful at the planning stages of our campaigns. For instance, we used AI for data analysis related to user behavior to figure out what kinds of content users find the most attractive on LinkedIn. Ultimately, these insights show what content people are more likely to engage with.\n\nWe saw that although LinkedIn is a more professional platform, unlike Instagram, for instance, users still tended to click on content that had elaborate visual elements. That\u2019s why I started making posts that would include aesthetically pleasing infographics, pictures, or even short videos. Because of this, engagement rates significantly increased.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes I really need to make a post to stay consistent, but I just can\u2019t come up with anything valuable. That\u2019s when I turn to AI and kind of brainstorm with it. It gives me ideas, and I spin them and give them a personal touch. Because social media is really all about authentic human connection, so using solely AI-generated content is a bad idea.\n\nRuslan Halilov\n\nCMO at Bluedothq, BluedotHQ\n\nMonitor Conversations with AI Sentiment Analysis\n\nWe used ChatGPT for social media listening, an integral aspect of social media marketing. For its natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, we incorporated ChatGPT to monitor social media conversations about our services through AI-driven sentiment analysis. It helped us understand consumer behaviors and perceptions to craft our marketing strategies accordingly.\n\nTrend detection is another feature that allows us to identify emerging trends and topics within our industry. By analyzing these trends, we can create timely, engaging content that aligns with our audience\u2019s demands.\n\nBusinesses who want to use ChatGPT for social media marketing should regularly update and refine training data to achieve accuracy in social media listening. Always assist with automated responses to improve personalization and experiment with different prompts to maximize their potential.\n\nSoubhik Chakrabarti\n\nCEO, Canada Hustle\n\nRestructure Content Strategy with AI Insights\n\nWe have been early testers and adopters of AI in social media marketing and have found prompts effective for organizational restructuring of content based on performance analytics. Proper prompts can give greater visibility to your competitors\u2019 social media content strategy, and you can revise your content strategy accordingly.\n\nMany mistakes we see as a digital agency are when individuals and executives try to use AI-generated content directly, replacing their own point of view. AI-generated content ranks differently, and human readers, who are familiar with large language model-generated content, can spot it. When content is thought out and represents new viewpoints or continues a narrative of executive points of view, an audience is engaged.\n\nThink of the visibility of competitors in a larger landscape, and about what their brand is \u201csaying\u201d digitally; this is what AI can capture in moments. It would take hours to compile this information, and the labor would also need to be trained. Use AI to compile data and provide a rough analysis through prompts, then base more complex strategy and content around the findings.\n\nMatthew Capala\n\nCEO, Alphametic\n\nCurate Content for Multichannel Engagement\n\nWe leverage AI for content curation. Maintaining an active presence on multiple social media platforms can be overwhelming. However, at the same time, you need to ensure a multichannel presence to engage your target audience, as you never know which platform they may prefer to explore the required information. AI-powered solutions come in handy here. They help us curate meaningful content from relevant information sources and acknowledge high engagement. Thanks to AI, we are able to share valuable information and insights consistently, generating more traction through social media platforms that align with the preferences of our target audience.\n\nThomas Griffin\n\nCo-Founder & President, OptinMonster\n\nCreate Stunning Visuals with Canva\u2019s AI\n\nWe\u2019ve been diving headfirst into Canva\u2019s AI tools, and let me tell you, it\u2019s been a game-changer for our social media visuals. It\u2019s incredible how AI can take a simple idea and transform it into stunning graphics. We recently used Canva\u2019s AI image generator to create a series of visuals for a social media campaign promoting a client\u2019s new product. We simply fed the AI a few keywords and descriptions, and it generated a variety of images that were not only relevant but also incredibly eye-catching.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive is how Canva\u2019s AI allows us to customize these images to perfectly align with our brand and messaging. We can tweak the colors, adjust the composition, and add text overlays\u2014all within Canva\u2019s user-friendly interface. It\u2019s like having a personal artist on demand, but without the hefty price tag. This AI-powered approach has allowed us to create visually compelling social media content that truly stands out from the crowd. It\u2019s not just about pretty pictures; it\u2019s about using AI to amplify our creativity and connect with our audience on a deeper level.\n\nMichael Lazar\n\nCEO, Content Author\n\nIdentify Micro-Influencers with AI Analysis\n\nWe used AI to analyze thousands of influencer profiles to identify micro-influencers with the highest relevance and engagement for our clients\u2019 campaigns. This went beyond simple follower counts, factoring in sentiment, audience overlap, and niche appeal. The curated partnerships led to authentic collaborations that resonated deeply with audiences, driving both brand awareness and trust. AI helped us shift from broad reach to meaningful, targeted impact.\n\nJason Hennessey\n\nCEO, Hennessey Digital\n\nTailor GPTs for Platform-Specific Content\n\nIn my Web3 marketing agency, we\u2019ve used custom GPTs creatively for social media marketing by tailoring each model to reflect our clients\u2019 unique voices across different platforms. Each GPT is trained on the client\u2019s brand messaging, tone, and past content, enabling it to generate optimized posts for specific channels like LinkedIn, Twitter, or Instagram.\n\nFor example, for a Web3 client targeting thought leadership on LinkedIn and casual community engagement on Twitter, the custom GPT crafted professional, data-driven posts for LinkedIn while creating shorter, conversational tweets for Twitter. This allowed the client to maintain consistency in their messaging while adapting to the distinct audience expectations of each platform. The result was increased engagement and a streamlined content creation process, freeing up resources for strategy and analytics.\n\nvictoria olsina\n\nWeb3 SEO Agency Founder, VictoriaOlsina.com"

            "article_content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize various industries, the demand for AI-powered apps is increasing rapidly. Whether it\u2019s chatbots, predictive analytics, or personalized experiences, businesses across sectors are leveraging AI to stay competitive. However, one of the most common questions that arise during the planning phase of app development is: how much does it cost to make an app?\n\nIn this blog, we will break down the key factors that influence the cost of developing an AI app and provide insights into what businesses can expect in 2025.\n\n1. Complexity of the AI Features\n\nThe first and most significant factor that affects the cost of developing an AI app is the complexity of the features you want to integrate. AI apps can range from simple to highly sophisticated systems, and the cost varies accordingly.\n\nSimple AI Features:\n\nBasic functionalities like natural language processing (NLP) or simple chatbots can be implemented with off-the-shelf AI models. These are less costly and can be developed within a few months, making them more affordable.\n\nAdvanced AI Features:\n\nApps with deep learning, computer vision, or real-time AI analytics will require more time, expertise, and resources. For example, an app using computer vision for object detection or an AI-powered recommendation system will need custom models, vast data sets, and training processes, which significantly increase development costs.\n\n2. Development Team and Expertise\n\nThe expertise of the development team plays a critical role in determining the cost of AI app development. In 2025, you can expect the cost to vary based on the location, experience, and specialization of the team.\n\nAI Developers : Developers with experience in AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras will be essential for building advanced AI features. The higher the expertise, the higher the cost.\n\n: Developers with experience in AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras will be essential for building advanced AI features.

Data Labeling : For machine learning models, data labeling is an essential task. It involves categorizing data to help the AI understand and learn from it. Depending on the volume of data, this task can be labor-intensive and costly.\n\n: For machine learning models, data labeling is an essential task. It involves categorizing data to help the AI understand and learn from it. Depending on the volume of data, this task can be labor-intensive and costly. Data Storage and Cloud Services: AI apps require powerful infrastructure to store and process large datasets. Cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure are commonly used, and their pricing depends on the amount of data stored and processed.\n\n5. Integration with Third-Party Services\n\nMany AI apps require integration with third-party APIs or services to provide additional functionality. For example, integrating AI with payment gateways, voice recognition services, or mapping tools can increase the overall cost.\n\nAPI Costs : Some third-party APIs, such as those for NLP or speech recognition (like Google Cloud AI or IBM Watson), charge based on usage. These costs should be factored into the development budget, especially for apps with high traffic or usage.\n\n: Some third-party APIs, such as those for NLP or speech recognition (like Google Cloud AI or IBM Watson), charge based on usage. These costs should be factored into the development budget, especially for apps with high traffic or usage. Cloud AI Services: Instead of building AI models from scratch, you can use cloud-based AI services from providers like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. These services can help reduce development time, but they may come with a recurring cost depending on usage.\n\n6. Maintenance and Updates\n\nThe cost of developing an AI app doesn\u2019t end once the app is launched. AI apps require continuous monitoring, updates, and improvements to ensure they continue to perform effectively and accurately.\n\nModel Optimization : As AI models are exposed to more data, they need to be optimized regularly to improve their accuracy and performance. This requires ongoing development and data processing, which adds to the long-term cost.\n\n: As AI models are exposed to more data, they need to be optimized regularly to improve their accuracy and performance. This requires ongoing development and data processing, which adds to the long-term cost. App Updates and Scaling: As your user base grows and new features are added, the app may need to be scaled. This involves not only technical updates but also potential infrastructure upgrades to handle more data and traffic.\n\n7. Security and Compliance\n\nSince AI apps often deal with sensitive data, ensuring robust security is critical. For industries like healthcare, finance, or legal, the app must comply with regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, or other data protection laws.\n\nSecurity Features : Implementing advanced security protocols like encryption, authentication, and secure APIs adds to the overall cost.\n\n: Implementing advanced security protocols like encryption, authentication, and secure APIs adds to the overall cost. Compliance: For AI apps that need to comply with industry regulations, the cost of ensuring compliance through audits, documentation, and security measures can increase significantly.\n\nEstimated Cost of Developing an AI App in 2025\n\nGiven all the factors above, the cost of developing an AI-powered app in 2025 can vary greatly depending on the complexity and requirements. Here\u2019s a rough estimate of what you can expect:\n\nBasic AI App : $50,000 \u2013 $150,000\n\n: $50,000 \u2013 $150,000 Intermediate AI App with Custom Features : $150,000 \u2013 $500,000\n\n: $150,000 \u2013 $500,000 Advanced AI App with Complex Models and Data: $500,000 \u2013 $2 million+\n\nConclusion\n\nDeveloping an AI app in 2025 is a significant investment influenced by various factors like complexity, data requirements, and team expertise.

            "article_content": "I love a good show about teenagers fighting supernatural entities while also facing the mortifying ordeal of being a high school student. So Netflix\u2019s Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld, which not only sees a superpowered teenage girl battle demons but also draws from Chinese mythology, seems like it was created in a lab just for me. From the first trailer, I had high expectations. With bright, bold colors and character designs, compelling character relationships, and some very funky monsters and action sequences, it really checked all my boxes.\n\nBut there\u2019s one specific scene that I can\u2019t stop thinking about, because it so perfectly exemplifies the tone of this show and why it works so well.\n\n[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld.]\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld kicks off when 16-year-old Jentry (Ali Wong) learns that a demon is after her for the powers she\u2019s suppressed for most of her life. She must return to her hometown in Texas with her great-aunt Gugu (Lori Tan Chinn) in order to close a portal to the underworld and prevent more monsters from wreaking havoc in the world. All the while, she tries to fit in with her new (old?) classmates and slowly learns more about her own past and Gugu\u2019s refusal to reveal more about her parents.\n\nAbout halfway through the show, Jentry discovers that Kit (Woosung Kim), the new boy at school with big, dreamy eyes, is actually a Painted Skin demon from Chinese mythology. This means that he\u2019s actually a long-limbed shadowy demon who must construct elaborate disguises out of human skin to conceal his true form. Jentry is initially hurt by this revelation, but she eventually seeks his help to create a skin form in her image for a heist.\n\nCue a montage where the two of them carefully sew together a Jentry skin in Kit\u2019s dimly lit workshop while a soft romantic song plays. Kit cuts into a roll of flesh so that it best replicates Jentry\u2019s body, and gently tilts her face up so he can measure her chin. Jentry is mildly disgusted when Kit rifles through a bin of body parts and asks him to warn her when he picks the eyes, to which he replies he already knows the exact match for her eyes, because he\u2019s imagined them so often \u2014 and Jentry blushes.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt\u2019s a bit gross. It\u2019s incredibly intimate. It\u2019s uncanny, yet super romantic. It\u2019s adorably reminiscent of a budding high school romance, and also like something out of The Silence of the Lambs. But it\u2019s emblematic of how showrunner Echo Wu has marvelously leaned into the wonderfully weird, both with the paranormal elements and the more grounded stakes.\n\nThe show leans pretty hard on the more terrifying aspects of Chinese mythology, like a trip to Diyu, the Daoist version of hell, where souls are tortured for eons. The bright colors and cartoonish character designs keep the show firmly planted in PG territory, but it does get a bit freaky, in a good way. At one point, for instance, the house ghosts need to generate some more ectoplasm, so one of them volunteers to be brutally maimed \u2014 off screen, but with some screaming \u2014 in order to generate just a splash of magical ghost fluid. And even with those darker elements, the tone never gets too dire, and a lot of the fun comes from the weird situations and paranormal entities that Jentry and her friends encounter.\n\nAnd because Wu is tapping into a cultural mythos that American animation hasn\u2019t fully explored, none of the supernatural plotlines feel overdone (do we really need another broody vampire when we can have a Painted Skin demon?). American cartoons have long flirted with Chinese mythology, without actually delivering. American Dragon: Jake Long and The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, two animated shows that aired in the mid-2000s, also featured a young Chinese American protagonist guided by an elderly relative to battle monsters \u2014 but both shows primarily prioritized Western mythology, only incidentally pulling in Chinese legends. Jentry Chau does the reverse: By default, everything Jentry encounters is from Chinese mythology, mixing in other cultural perspectives without assuming that the default is Western. It\u2019s a unique lens, and one that really lets the show shine and avoid any trite cliches.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld. Ali Wong as Jentry in Jentry Chau vs the Underworld. Cr. COURTESY OF NETFLIX \u00a9 2024 Image: Netflix\n\nBut even with the fun paranormal side, Wu never loses sight of the show\u2019s more realistic threads. At the end of the day, Jentry is a teenage girl who just wants to be normal. Her relationships with her friends, her secretive great-aunt, and her own self might be colored by the paranormal, but they all feel very rooted in realism. The scene with Kit works so well because even though it\u2019s a demon making a skin costume, it\u2019s also about teenage crushes and complicated feelings (and the fact that those complicated feelings stem from your crush actually being a demonic creature). Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld certainly isn\u2019t the only high school supernatural romp out there, but Wu takes care to balance the fantastical elements with the real ones.\n\nStill, the show works so well because Wu isn\u2019t afraid to get weird. As both a coming-of-age story and a supernatural show, Jentry Chau could easily fall into some cliched genre pitfalls. But Wu doesn\u2019t let that happen, simply by embracing the funkier beats and really letting them sing. It\u2019s in the little details in the background, like Jentry\u2019s Lisa Frank leopard poster and Gugu\u2019s crocs. And it\u2019s also in the bigger scenes, like that romantic moment between Jentry and Kit, set against the sewing of a flesh suit. Now that\u2019s something special \u2014 and the whole show is a special, weird gem that sparkles with neon intensity.\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld is available to stream on Netflix now."

Then combine warm water and dry ice. That will turn the solid ice into a gas. Pour the gas into the tank. The bubbles will float, and a cloud will form above a layer of clear gas.\n\nWhat It Teaches: This experiment teaches kids about phase changes, combustion reactions, and gas laws.\n\nDiscovery Lab Director of Education, Chip Lindsey said, \"You get iridescent rainbows on the bubbles, so what causes that? You see that the bubbles begin to float down through the carbon dioxide, what causes that? All of those questions are like an entry point to really talk about basic properties of physics, chemistry, and even biology.\"\n\nHow Can I Learn More?\n\nThe Discovery Lab will be doing these fire and ice experiments and activities daily in its Science Lab. There is also single-day Winter WonderCamps for kids from Pre-K through 6th grade on January 2, 3, and 6. Register for camp at https://www.discoverylab.org/camps."

            "article_content": "\u201322 new to Guyana, 23 potentially new to science\n\nTHE University of Guyana (UG) has played a pivotal role in a groundbreaking biodiversity survey of the Acarai-Corentyne Corridor in southern Guyana, led by the Field Museum.\n\nAccording to UG, this extensive survey led to the discovery of over 600 plant species and 713 vertebrate species, with 22 species recorded for the first time in Guyana and 23 potentially new to science.\n\nThe findings, revealed at an event held at the Umana Yana on Monday, underscore the Acarai-Corentyne Corridor\u2019s ecological significance.\n\nThis 1.3-million-hectare expanse boasts some of the most intact and diverse ecosystems in the Guiana Shield, home to thriving species populations critical to maintaining ecological balance. The survey documented over 1,300 species, including apex predators and keystone species.\n\nThe rapid inventory, commissioned by Guyana\u2019s Protected Areas Commission, involved an interdisciplinary team comprising 25 biologists, three social scientists, and one geologist from six Guyanese and seven international institutions.\n\nThe Guyanese field team included members from the University of Guyana, the Protected Areas Commission (PAC), Conservation International (CI-Guyana), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS-Guyana), South Rupununi Conservation Society (SRCS), Kanashen Amerindian Protected Area, Masake\u00f1ar\u00ee, and Parabara.\n\nIndigenous expertise was also key to the success of this endeavour, with more than 50 Amerindian experts from the nearby communities of Masake\u00f1ar\u00ee, Parabara, and Cashew Island working alongside the research team.\n\nThese Indigenous experts shared a wealth of ecological knowledge about the region\u2019s biodiversity, geography, and history, contributing valuable insights not previously documented in Western science.\n\nThe collaborative approach with Indigenous communities also highlighted the importance of preserving traditional knowledge systems, which encompass generations of observations and practical ecological understanding.\n\nUG scientists played an integral role throughout the project. Mrs. Kaslyn Collins collaborated with the plant team to describe vegetation types and catalogue specimens.\n\nMrs. Devya Hemraj-Naraine was instrumental on the fish team, helping to document aquatic species, including previously unrecorded fish in Guyana. Dr. Arianne Harris made invaluable contributions to the mammal team\u2019s efforts, which included studying the area\u2019s medium- and large-bodied mammals.\n\nDr. Gyanpriya Maharaj worked with the environmental DNA (eDNA) team, facilitating the processing of eDNA samples at the University of Guyana. For the first time in Guyana\u2019s conservation history, the entire process of eDNA extraction to sequencing was conducted locally to produce a species list that supplemented the findings of the other teams. This represented a transformative step for scientific research in Guyana, enabling the country to tackle conservation challenges with homegrown expertise.\n\n\u201cCompleting such a large-scale rapid inventory is a feat in and of itself. To have such a diverse team with so many of our very own scientists integrally involved and adding eDNA analyses to our local skill repertoire is awe-inspiring and an extraordinary accomplishment for biodiversity conservation in Guyana,\u201d said Dr. Maharaj, Director of UG\u2019s Centre for the Study of Biological Diversity.\n\n\u201cThis remarkable biodiversity survey demonstrates the power of collaboration among local, national, and international stakeholders. It provides a critical foundation for informed conservation strategies that can protect Guyana\u2019s natural treasures for future generations,\u201d the university said, adding: \u201c[it] remains committed to advancing scientific innovation and environmental stewardship, ensuring that its work continues to benefit both Guyana and the broader global scientific community.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Recently, Amazon announced a multi-year partnership with Orbital Materials to use their \u2018proprietary AI platform\u2019 to develop new materials that help decarbonise their data centres. Orbital is synthesising and designing advanced materials for data centre-integrated carbon removal and cooling technology for Amazon.\n\n\u201cTogether, AWS and Orbital will evaluate the scalability and performance of these new technologies in removing carbon and increasing efficiency,\u201d said Amazon in the report.\n\nOrbital, like any other materials science lab using AI, said that the development of new materials has \u2018traditionally been a slow process of trial and error in the lab,\u2019 and generative AI has significantly improved the timeframe for discovering these materials.\n\n\u201cOrbital has achieved a 10x improvement in its material\u2019s performance through the use of its AI platform\u2014an order of magnitude faster than traditional development and breaking new ground in carbon removal efficacy,\u201d the startup announced. The company also plans to deploy and test these carbon removal technologies by the end of 2025.\n\nOrbital\u2019s claims of a \u2018radical\u2019 improvement in the speed of material discovery are also backed by research findings from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), suggesting we\u2019re living in a golden age of material discovery.\n\nThe Golden Age of Materials Science?\n\nRecent research from MIT outlines the potential of AI technologies and their assistance to scientists, specifically those working on materials science. The author revealed statistics after handing over \u2018new materials discovery technology\u2019 to 1018 scientists in an unnamed \u2018R&D lab of a large US firm\u2019.\n\nThe data showed a 44% increase in new material discovery, a 39% increase in patent filings, and a 17% increase in product prototypes that incorporated these newly discovered materials.\n\n\u201cTrained on the composition and characteristics of existing materials, the model generates recipes for novel compounds predicted to possess specified properties,\u201d said Aidan Toner-Rodgers.\n\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that 82% of scientists reported a reduced level of satisfaction with their work, as they found that leveraging AI decreased creativity and skill underutilisation.\n\nThe advent of AI revolutionising materials science began last year, when Google DeepMind released research titled \u2018Scaling deep learning for material discovery\u2019, where they discovered 2.2 million new crystals, equivalent to 800 years of work of knowledge. Out of which, 380,000 materials were stable materials.\n\n\u201cFor example, 52,000 new layered compounds similar to graphene have the potential to revolutionise electronics with the development of superconductors,\u201d said DeepMind in the announcement.\n\nGoogle DeepMind went beyond discovery and also published another research stating that 41 out of 58 selected materials were successfully synthesised in just 17 days.\n\nMeta marked its foray into material size by releasing a massive data set called Open Materials 2024, or OMat24. The dataset contains over 118 million examples of material simulations and structures, focusing on a wide range of inorganic bulk materials to improve AI-enabled material discovery.\n\nNew Materials, Really?\n\nDeep learning has amplified materials research and discovery for a few years now. However, if there\u2019s one way AI can save humanity, it lies in not just discovering new materials, but also finding ways to synthesise and manufacture them in commercial capabilities.\n\nWhen Google Deepmind made the announcement last year, the company did not take long for contradictory results to come into the picture, where a researcher said that many of the materials discovered weren\u2019t truly novel and were just minor variations of known compounds. It also said that Google Deepmind mostly focused on the stability of the materials, overlooking functionalities that are required for practical applications.\n\nMoreover, Google\u2019s claim of synthesising these newly discovered materials using an autonomous lab is also facing scrutiny, thanks to a study from Princeton University. The researchers here outright deny Google Deepmind\u2019s claim. They said that none of the materials produced by the autonomous lab were new and that the majority were misclassified.\n\nThe authors also say that a majority of the synthetic products were wrongly characterised. It failed to distinguish between materials with random and organised atomic arrangements. In short, the authors said that AI can generate predictions but will struggle to interpret experimental results accurately.\n\nWhen Do I Use It\n\nPresuming these challenges are overcome in discovering and synthesising new materials, but when can we hold these new materials?\n\nIt is indeed a very long journey. Benjamin Reinhardt, CEO at Speculative Technologies, puts it best in his work: Getting materials out of the Lab.\n\n\u201cYou can think of lab-scale materials as the most artisanal products in the world, painstakingly handcrafted by people with advanced degrees. Like any artisanal product, lab-scale materials are expensive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTrying to mass-produce these materials by simply increasing the number of fume hoods, test tubes, and pipette wielders would make them cost billions of dollars per kilogram.\u201d\n\nMass-producing or scaling these newly discovered materials remains a challenge. From analysing the materials\u2019 failure modes in controlled conditions to setting up an industrial-scale factory, following regulations, and justifying the choices to investors and customers, one is surely set to turn into Sisyphus.\n\nScientists, mostly working in universities, have strong incentives to focus on novelty and one-off demonstrations because these can lead to publications and positive media attention.\n\n\u201cStart-ups commercialising a new material face many headwinds, including often-unavoidable relationships with larger companies, trade-offs between speed and profit margins, and capital constraints,\u201d said Reinhardt.\n\nMoreover, newly discovered materials need to go through a lot of testing, and the world has seen quite a few tragedies when they\u2019re put out in the real world. For instance, carbon fibre, and composite materials are all the rage. We don\u2019t need to look far behind in the history books. In the recent OceanGate\u2019s tragic implosion, the Titan submersible was using an \u2018experimental carbon fibre composite hull\u2019. It was the first instance of the material being used in a submersible.\n\nAn investigation revealed that the hull may have been prone to micro buckling and delamination under deepsea pressures. Small manufacturing imperfections in carbon-fiber material could amplify such issues.\n\nIn 2017, the Grenfell Tower fire in London, claimed 72 lives owing to the building\u2019s exterior cladding. It was made of aluminium composite panel panels with a polyethylene core and flammable insulation materials. The combination led to a rapid spread of fire, and investigations revealed that manufacturers exploited loopholes in regulation.\n\nTherefore, there will be an increased sense of caution before these materials come to life. In the essay, Reinhardt also provided a dataset that visualises the timeline from when materials were discovered and fully commercialised.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. The next time it seems exciting when AI has discovered new materials, it\u2019s time to give ourselves a reality check. There\u2019s no doubt AI has the potential to speed up the manufacturing process as well, but we\u2019re yet to see how.\n\n[This story has been read by 210 unique individuals.]\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "\u201cThe web is a collection of data, but it\u2019s a mess,\" says Exa cofounder and CEO Will Bryk. \"There's a Joe Rogan video over here, an Atlantic article over there. There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.\u201d\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren\u2019t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can\u2019t do that, says Bryk: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.\u201d\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn\u2019t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it\u2019s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user\u2019s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven\u2019t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today\u2019s AI search engines as a sandwich with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nMore than keywords\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here\u2019s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users\u2019 queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nA screenshot of Websets showing results for the search: \"companies; startups; US-based; healthcare focus; technical co-founder\"\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa\u2019s search engine predicts the next link. Type \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa\u2019s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That\u2019s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn\u2019t see this as a problem: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embed the whole web to be useful,\u201d he says. (Fun fact: \u201cexa\u201d means a 1 followed by 18 0s and \u201cgoogol\u201d means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)"

The study identifies the most widely used free and open-source software (FOSS) as application libraries. Among its key insights, the study underlines the ongoing importance of open source collaboration.\n\nCensus III is the third study investigating the widespread use of open source software and provides the most comprehensive aggregation of data to date. Derived from over 12 million observations of FOSS libraries in production applications at more than ten thousand companies, the report highlights critical trends shaping the open source ecosystem.\n\nThe Census III effort was conducted in partnership with Harvard University and leading software composition analysis (SCA) organizations, including Black Duck, FOSSA, Snyk, and Sonatype. This collaboration advances the state of open source research by combining insights and resources to better understand the value and security of the OSS ecosystem.\n\nKey Findings of Census III Report\n\nThe report highlights several key trends and insights, such as: The use of cloud service-specific packages is increasing. There is an ongoing transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Maven packages continue to be widely used, and there is an increased prevalence of NuGet and Python packages. Use of components from Rust package repositories has increased considerably since Census II. There continues to be a need for the use of standardized naming schema for software components. Much of the most widely used FOSS is developed by only a handful of contributors. Individual developer account security is increasingly important. Legacy software persists in the open-source space.\n\nCensus III is authored by Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School; Kate Powell, Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard; Richie Zitomer, Harvard Business School; and David A. Wheeler, Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), The Linux Foundation.\n\nTo read the report, download the Census III of Free and Open Source Software\u2014Application Libraries research study on the Linux Foundation website.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\nLinux Foundation\n\n\"Understanding the health and security posture of open source software is a critical step to ensure its sustainability. Census III underscores the importance of identifying and supporting widely used open-source components, complementing Linux Foundation projects, initiatives, and security-focused research, and it comes at a critical time as we navigate regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act. These insights are vital for prioritizing resources in our efforts to steward a secure and resilient open source ecosystem.\"\n\n-Hilary Carter, SVP Research, The Linux Foundation\n\nOpenSSF\n\n\u201cFOSS is now ubiquitous, serving as a foundational infrastructure of society. However, its success has also made it a target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. This study provides valuable insights that will help individuals and organizations worldwide prioritize their investments to significantly reduce both the recurrence and impact of vulnerabilities in FOSS\u2014both unintentional and malicious. This marks a critical step in safeguarding our software supply chains against attacks and ensuring they deliver reliable, high-quality results.\u201d\n\n- David A. Wheeler, Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security, Open Source Software Foundation (OpenSSF)\n\nHarvard Business School\n\n\u201cFree and open source software has become the backbone of the digital economy. However, understanding which projects are critical to sustaining the FOSS ecosystem is difficult since there is limited ability to centrally measure the most widely used packages. Census III provides deep and broad insights into this problem as it measures which FOSS packages companies are most heavily reliant on and offers guidance for organizations and individuals who want to invest to support and secure this essential public good.\u201d\n\n- Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School\n\nBlack Duck\n\n\u201cThe ubiquity of FOSS as both foundational software and as an innovation engine demands that companies understand that the health of the FOSS they consume is a business risk just as any other supply chain risk. If there are only a handful of contributors to a critical component or if the supplier is effectively one anonymous GitHub user account, the cybersecurity and software hygiene decisions of those individuals could introduce unexpected business risks.\u201d\n\n- Tim Mackey, Head of Software Supply Chain Risk Strategy, Black Duck\n\nFOSSA\n\n\u201cThis third multi-party open-source census from the Linux Foundation and Harvard is an important examination of the FOSS ecosystem, and I'm proud FOSSA was asked to contribute again. The report clearly reaffirms the ubiquity and continued growing influence of open source on the economy, but more than that, it plays a material part in the trend towards greater transparency. Government regulations, industry initiatives, and research like this are all instrumental in improving the software supply chain through open communication, which ultimately builds trust. On behalf of the thousands of organizations who use FOSSA and share our love of open source, thank you!\u201d\n\n- Kevin Wang, CEO, FOSSA\n\nSnyk\n\n\"Free and Open Source Software forms the backbone of modern technology, yet its decentralized nature presents challenges in understanding its true impact and vulnerabilities. Efforts like the Free and Open Software Census are pivotal, combining community-driven data with analytical rigor to help the industry identify critical dependencies and prioritize investments. By sharing data and fostering collaboration among developers, organizations, policymakers, and academia, we can secure and sustain the health of this invaluable ecosystem for the digital economy\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n- Danny Allan, Chief Technology Officer, Snyk\n\nSonatype\n\n\"Sonatype is proud to contribute to the Census III effort as part of our commitment to strengthening the open source ecosystem. By providing critical data and insights into FOSS usage, we aim to empower organizations to make informed decisions about securing their software supply chains.\"\n\n- Brian Fox, Co-Founder and CTO, Sonatype\n\nBackground on Census Projects I & II\n\nThe original Census Project (\u201cCensus I\u201d), conducted in 2015, centered on identifying critical software packages within the Debian Linux distribution that are essential to server operations and security. This initial effort provided a foundational understanding of the most vital components of the FOSS ecosystem, helping stakeholders prioritize their security and maintenance efforts.\n\nCensus II expanded the scope to include a broader analysis of language-level FOSS packages commonly used in applications developed by both private and public organizations. By broadening the lens beyond Debian, this phase captured a more comprehensive view of how FOSS is integrated into diverse applications and infrastructure, providing deeper insights into the dependencies that organizations rely on for their day-to-day operations.\n\nBuilding on these efforts, Census III takes the initiative even further by leveraging anonymized usage data from leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) partners. This collaboration allows for a more robust and data-driven understanding of FOSS adoption and security trends. With this enhanced dataset, Census III offers actionable insights to help stakeholders better prioritize resources and address critical security challenges within the FOSS ecosystem. This progression underscores the growing need for collaboration and coordination across the industry to sustain and secure the vital infrastructure that FOSS represents.\n\nAdditional Resources"
