A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

            "article_content": "You\u2019ve no doubt noticed artificial intelligence finding its way into every app, service, and hardware device. It\u2019s now unusual to see a tech product launch where AI isn\u2019t the main talking point. Meta is one of the companies pushing AI the hardest, with its own set of AI models, and a selection of AI bots and tools inside its own apps. (Experts and critics also say Meta may be taking their AI too far, which Meta responded to by removing multiple AI profile accounts.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram recently, then you may have spotted a new Meta AI bot, ready and waiting to be of assistance. Here\u2019s how you can make use of it\u2014and what your options are in terms of security and privacy.\n\nHow to find Meta AI\n\nYou\u2019ll find Meta AI front and center in Meta\u2019s apps: In the Facebook Messenger app, for example, tap Chats and you\u2019ll see a Meta AI input box right at the top, above your real life friends and family members. Tap inside that box, and you can start chatting about whatever topic you like. You can also tap Meta AI on the tab bar at the bottom.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the WhatsApp app (you\u2019ll see the Meta AI logo on the Chats tab), and in the Instagram app (tap the message button, in the top right corner of the home tab, and Meta AI is at the top). The Meta AI logo is a glowing blue and purple circle, and it\u2019s hard to miss as you use the apps.\n\nMeta AI is prominently displayed in your chats. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get Meta AI up, inside one-to-one or group chats with real people: Tag @MetaAI in your conversation, type out a prompt, and you\u2019ll get the same response as you would if you were chatting to the AI bot directly\u2014except, of course, the other chat participants will be able to see the message and response.\n\nThe AI bot chats all use the same underlying model (called Llama), but your chats aren\u2019t synced between the three apps. Unfortunately for AI skeptics, there\u2019s no way to hide or turn off Meta AI: You just have to ignore it if you don\u2019t want to use it. However, you can delete, mute, and archive Meta AI chats just like any other conversation\u2014just long press on the AI chat in the main conversation list.\n\nHow to use Meta AI\n\nIf you\u2019ve used an AI chatbot like Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the way these tools work: You can ask Meta AI to look up facts from the web, write poetry, or suggest ideas for something. You can get recommendations for podcasts, inspiration for a birthday party, or suggestions about how to fix a faucet leak.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can ask Meta AI for advice and instruction on just about any topic\u2014though as usual with generative AI, be careful of putting too much trust in the answers. These AI bots are built to imagine new text, and that can lead to hallucinations. Sometimes Meta AI will reference the web (when looking up facts, for example)\u2014and when this happens you\u2019ll see web links within the response. Tap on these links to check the facts.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions about just about anything. Screenshot: Meta\n\nImage generation is included here: Just ask Meta AI to create or draw an image of whatever you like. It could be a cat sat on a wall, a cabin in the woods, or a person exploring the surface of Mars. The more detail you can add, the more closely the result is going to match your original vision\u2014and you can specify the style of the image too, whether it\u2019s a photo, a painting, or something else.\n\nThere are some interesting image-related tricks you can try: For example, you can use it to create a new profile picture for yourself. Two suggestions from Meta are \u201cimagine me as royalty\u201d or \u201cimagine me in a surrealist painting\u201d, so you can see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019re also able to edit an AI-generated image by tapping and holding on it, then typing in your additional prompt.\n\nMeta AI can generate images for you as well. Screenshot: Meta\n\nMeta itself splits what you can do into three main sections: learn (\u201csummarize the history of the Universe\u201d), create (\u201cimagine dogs playing chess\u201d), and connect (\u201cplan a game night with friends\u201d). That gives you some idea of what\u2019s possible, and you can now interact with Meta AI with your voice if you want\u2014just tap the sound button to the right of the input box.\n\nOne of the features recently added to Meta AI is the ability to use photos in your chats\u2014either picked from your phone\u2019s gallery or taken through the camera. You can identify objects and landmarks, create AI images based on existing photos, and more: Try snapping a picture of a cake and asking how to make it, for example."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nWinter always throws my fitness habits off track. The weather gets colder, the holiday treats show up, and the drive to stick to my usual workout routine falls off a cliff. The winter months are hard for the home-gym-goer, with no one but yourself to offer encouragement and accountability. And while I do okay at keeping myself on track for most of the year, once the snow hits the ground, I need to call in reinforcements.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve used this time to shake things up\u2014trying new workout apps or finding fresh ways to inject novelty into my regimen. One app I experimented with is Zombies, Run!, which immerses users in a post-apocalyptic narrative where they run from zombies rather than just calories. With its engaging writing, voice acting, and sound design, it offers a unique running experience and even features a Marvel superhero expansion.\n\nBut here's the thing: Zombies never did much for me. And I also want to be able to customize my workouts in pretty specific ways, adapting to the equipment I have, the goals I'm pursuing, and the narratives I'm interested in. What if I want to add in some dumbbell exercises, or some jump rope? What if I need to focus on my core as much as my arms or work around an injury?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a long time, I just assumed that level of customization was too much for any app to deliver. The knowledge of a professional trainer, the creativity of a writer weaving workouts into stories, and the immersive voice acting seemed unattainable for my niche Monday workout.\n\nTo some extent, I was right. I can't replicate the movement tracking, the professional sound design, or the slick app to run it all. But I can get a heck of a lot closer than I ever imagined by using the latest AI tools.\n\nWith a combination of AI-powered research, generative writing, and AI narration, I'm creating customized workouts that double as thrilling adventures, set in any narrative I can imagine! Let me show you how I'm using AI to put myself in the story and get fitter while I do.\n\nThe Tools: Perplexity, ChatGPT and ElevenLabs Reader\n\nTo create these AI-powered workouts, I use three different tools. They're all free, though jumping between them takes a bit of effort. Why this combination? Because I wanted a workout that was accurate, engaging, and completely personalized. These tools make that possible.\n\nFor putting my workout together, I'm using , a search-focused tool that's sort of like a mashup of Google search and ChatGPT, where it summarizes real-world search results to offer informed answers to your questions. It's not perfect, but I find that it's a better tool for getting fact-based answers with fewer hallucinations than ChatGPT. There are several different out there, but Perplexity has found its way to the top of my preferred tool list.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm also using ChatGPT to take that workout plan and turn it into an immersive narrative. The brainstorming and creative writing uses of ChatGPT make it a great fit for this, turning a simple 8-exercise routine into an extensive step-by-step guide, and then weaving those exercises into a customized story.\n\nFinally, I'm using to give voice to my new workout adventures. ElevenLabs specializes in AI text-to-speech, using AI voices to provide computer-generated narration that sounds surprisingly lifelike, with natural cadence and inflection. And the Reader app (available for and ) lets me do that for free on my phone, making it perfect for this workout project.\n\nSpeaking of tools, there's one more essential item for this AI workout adventure: a good old-fashioned note-taking document. Why? Because juggling information between different AI tools can get messy. A central document lets you easily copy, paste, edit, and refine your workout plan and story without losing track of anything.\n\nThis will be helpful as you pull together research, draft workout guides and stories, and prepare the final text for audio narration. For this project I actually recommend using two documents: One for the workout and instructions and another for drafting the final narrative text.\n\nThe Walkthrough: From Research to Audio Workout\n\nOpen your notes document and jot down any specific thoughts you have before planning anything. Getting your own thoughts clear about your exercise goals, your equipment and resources, and any unique needs or concerns that you have will help you know what you need to discuss before you do any research at all. When in doubt, start with notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my most important advice about doing bigger projects with AI: Tackle things in bite-sized pieces. That means generating outlines before you ask it to write full stories, and do your brainstorming before you're in the thick of a long narrative script. LLM tools are great at small, discrete tasks (even complex ones!), but throwing multi-step projects at them can lead to frustrating results due to small miscommunications or problems you don't catch when trying to focus on the bigger picture.\n\n1. Research and Design Your Workout With Perplexity\n\nWhen putting together a workout routine, I worry a lot about having accurate information. So, while there are plenty of guides out there for using ChatGPT to build a custom workout plan, I actually prefer to use a different tool: . Because Perplexity combines LLM capabilities with online search, it pulls from high-quality information sources, and then answers the question, resulting in higher-quality information, drastically fewer hallucinations, and a better overall result.\n\nPerplexity's basic user interface is also very easy to use: Ask a question, and you'll get a nuanced answer, complete with cited sources. But many people don't realize that you can also enter more information in each prompt, letting you specify things like what exercise equipment you have, what parts of the body you want to target, and any additional information, like injuries or conditions that might require you to adjust your workout plans.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can also ask for information in different formats, and when dealing with lists and detail-rich data, I often ask for the response in table format. In this case, I can ask for a list of recommended exercises, but also add columns for the muscle groups worked, the equipment used, and more.\n\nFinally, you don't need to settle for whatever the first answer says. You can engage Perplexity in a back-and-forth conversation, tweaking and refining answers to your needs, or expanding on things if you need more information. A little back and forth goes a long way when the AI can also pull in research materials, making it really easy to zero in on exactly what you need. I spent some time tweaking things to my liking, but the end result is a simple but effective workout, tailored to my equipment and needs.\n\nOnce I'm happy with the workout plan, I copy it into my notes for future reference. There's no need to reinvent that wheel once it's done. And as I go from one tool to another, I can pull that info from my notes and feed it to whatever other tool I'm using.\n\nI will also ask for instructions on how to perform each exercise properly. This information is especially helpful for moves I might not be familiar with, but even the moves you know well should get some attention paid to correct form, and the information will come in handy shortly. This is also another instance where Perplexity's search-based AI is best, since you don't want a hallucination about exercise technique leading to an easily avoidable injury down the line.\n\nI paste the workout, the individual exercises, and the exercise-specific instructions into a document and save them for use in our next step, which uses ChatGPT.\n\n2. Script Your Guided Routine With ChatGPT\n\nNext, I'll switch to , since I'm more comfortable using it to generate content in different styles. For this, I'll attack the workout piece by piece, focusing on one exercise at a time. The first exercise will get the most time and attention, because it will be where I define what I want in terms of tone and format.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere's the prompt I used, with information pasted in about each specific exercise:\n\nAfter which I simply pasted in the relevant workout instructions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt took some revising and refining to get the cadence right for an exercise that's done fairly quickly, but it wasn't hard to make those tweaks.\n\nMaking corrections to either the first or second part of the text also makes it easier to iteratively adjust the phrasing and flow to something you think will work during your workout.\n\nHere's the script section I got after just a few tweaks:\n\nNow, all that you need to do is paste in the information about the next exercise, and ask ChatGPT to follow the same format. Doing all of this in the same conversation makes it very simple to get consistent formatting across each exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPaste these sections together into a document, and you'll quickly have your workout written out, with guidance and counted reps. If a guided workout is all you wanted, you can skip step 3 and jump right to step 4, where we'll use AI to narrate your workout. But don't skip it, because this is the fun part.\n\n3. Craft Your Immersive Experience With ChatGPT\n\nSo far we've researched a workout and generated a script to walk you through your routine. That's cool, but it's pretty basic in terms of generative AI. Here's where things get a little more interesting.\n\nInstead of doing a standard workout, with nothing but boring instructions and monotonous reps, I wanted my workout to be a little more fun. That's where the fiction-writing capability of ChatGPT really shines. With your workout already mapped out, with instructions and rep counts, it's simply a matter of adapting that information to fit into a larger narrative.\n\nTo do this, I used a two-step prompt, first to prime the concept of the exercise-within-a-story idea, and then followed up with the rough idea, asking ChatGPT to outline a story for the setting I imagined, which in this case is a secret agent mission to sneak in and out of an enemy compound.\n\nThe second prompt is story-specific, and can be adjusted to whatever setting or adventure you want. And ChatGPT, once it understands what you're asking for, will easily generate that story outline as many times as you want, with as many variations as you want. And changing a detail here or there is pretty simple in the outline stage, when the content is short and easy to digest.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith a rough outline in hand, I have the foundation for a story-driven workout that can be adapted to whatever exercises I want to do. Using a mix of my own creativity and ChatGPT, it wasn't hard to come up with in-story actions that matched each exercise. My planks became the action to crawl under some barbed wire. My offset overhead march with dumbbells? Carrying surveillance equipment. In short order, I had transformed my exercise list into a series of actions that fit within the frame an espionage mission.\n\nSince I already have a basic workout script written, all I need to do now is ask it to adapt each set of instructions into the story outline and in-story explanations that we've already discussed.\n\nGiving ChatGPT the scenario, the exercise descriptions, and the explanation of how each movement would fit into the story made it easy for ChatGPT to craft a story around this sequence of moves. But if you aren't feeling like doing the work of coming up with these specifics, you can always ask ChatGPT to do so \u2013 it's great at brainstorming!\n\nFinally, for an added bit of polish, I added the idea that all of this was being said to me through an earpiece, instructions from a handler that was observing me actions through satellite footage and hacked surveillance cameras. With their guidance and encouragement, I made my way through the mission.\n\nIs it a little goofy? Yeah, but so is exercise. If I'm going to crank through 30 minutes of repetitive motions, I much prefer doing it this way. And there's so many different stories I could insert myself into!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMaybe spies and secret missions aren't your thing. But you could put yourself into pretty much any scenario you can imagine. An astronaut on Mars. A pirate on a ship at sea. A vampire hunter in a monster-infested city. A superhero in battle. A certain Italian plumber that stomps on turtles while saving a princess. If there's a game or movie or other scenario you can imagine, ChatGPT can write it, or even help you brainstorm new settings and adventures you've never seen elsewhere.\n\nAnd since it's building these stories and actions around the workout you already put together, the story can change, but the exercise is still tailored to your workout goals and equipment requirements.\n\nAs you finalize your story workout, just copy and paste into a new document, until you're happy with the overall narrative. Once you're done, save the document as a PDF on your phone.\n\n4. Generate Your AI Workout Audio With ElevenLabs Reader\n\nWe've got one more ingredient needed to take this imaginative exercise routine into the gym with you, and that's audio. Now, I can only speak for myself here, but I don't have the budget to hire voice actors to read stories and workout instructions to me. But AI has a solution to that problem too!\n\nWith an app called Reader by ElevenLabs, we can get audio narration of whatever text we give it, including our guided workouts and crazy ChatGPT-written stories. When using the phone app, you can generate audio for as much text as you want, all for free. (If you opt for a premium membership, you can even customize voices, use multiple voices, and record and save audio.)\n\nTo feed your document to ElevenLabs Reader, you'll need to save the document to your phone. The app supports multiple file formats, but I've had the most success with PDF.\n\nHit the big plus button at the bottom of the main screen, then select \"Import File\" and select the saved document from your Google Drive or your phone's file storage. Once it's uploaded, you'll be able to find the document in the Reader app library.\n\nSelect the voice you want from the app's library of voices (which has options for gender, accent, and general tone), and you're off to the races. Or the recon mission. Or the dragon's lair. Or wherever your immersive audio workout takes you.\n\nNow that all the work is done, you can listen to that same workout anytime you want. And since it's all saved into a document you can edit, you can easily make changes to adjust the flow and pacing of instructions, fix irritating details in the story, or rewrite it in a new story entirely.\n\nWho knew that AI could transform my home gym into a thrilling spy adventure? But this experiment revealed that with a little creativity, today's AI tools can not only help you make an effective workout, they can turn it into an immersive, game-like experience that can be endlessly customized.\n\nCombine AI Tools and Create Amazing Things\n\nAny one of the tools I talked about above opens up all sorts of clever uses. Perplexity, for example, is an incredible tool for research and learning, with applications ranging from homework and study to professional fact-finding and upskilling. The combination of search and an LLM chat interface is surprisingly powerful, and I barely scratched the surface of what it can do. Everything I did in this story uses the free version \u2013 a premium membership unlocks all sorts of advanced capabilities.\n\nChatGPT's text generation is more well known at this point, but OpenAI is adding new functions and capabilities all the time. As of this writing, the company just announced that Canvas, a drafting tool for writing and programming, is now available to all users, including free accounts. With multimodal capabilities that include image generation, machine vision, and conversational voice interactions, ChatGPT is a powerful collection of tools on its own, and growing more powerful at a rapid clip.\n\nFinally, it's worth remembering that AI is a lot more than just text and image generation. ElevenLabs has created some really sophisticated AI narration tools, giving people access to quality spoken language that used to require voice actors and an expensive recording setup. That means that regular users can use it for everything from reading articles and papers, while creators can use the same voices to bring life to game characters, narrate videos and presentations, and more. One new feature in the Reader app lets you generate podcast-style discussions of the text you upload, similar to Google's NotebookLM.\n\nPerplexity, ChatGPT, and ElevenLabs each have unique strengths, but together they can do even more. And all of this was done using the free versions of these apps. No paid premium accounts, no expensive features.\n\nThis same combination of tools could be used for all sorts of applications beyond creative fitness routines.\n\nPersonalized bedtime stories for kids\n\nEngaging study materials and customized review\n\nPersonalized news briefings\n\nCustomized guided meditations\n\nFrom fitness to parenting, academics to personal development, there are myriad uses for AI when you start combining one tool with another.\n\nHow do you use AI to make your life easier?

They have been visiting the local hot spots of haunted encounters in the area. After investigating, which usually consists of staying a night in the so-called \u201chaunted houses\u201d Sanders then posts videos of the experience on to his Youtube channel, which can be found through the social media handle: CLS Paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a friend who lives out here and I came out here to visit him. I actually drove from Arizona and he asked me, because he watches my show, if I wanted to do a couple of ghost hunts out here. I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we\u2019ve done quite a few places,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander\u2019s visited such spots as Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \u201cintrigued\u201d by him than \u201caggressive\u201d Sanders said that was fine with him. He\u2019s still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of these places I\u2019ve done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they\u2019re more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I\u2019ve been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost-hunting places. Here in Lockport, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what\u2019s unknown \u2014 the big questions like, \u201cWhat happens when we die?\u201d \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There are millions of ghost-hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \u201cspirit dice,\u201d as well as white noise boxes and light-up \u201crem pods\u201d that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he\u2019s trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\u201cYou usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cA residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that\u2019s almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\u201cI walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014 but I asked them. I said, \u2018I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?\u2019 They all started laughing,\u201d he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \u201csomething\u201d in the attic.\n\n\u201cWe set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating, have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camerawoman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children who were haunting the second floor.\n\n\u201cShe was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \u201chaunted\u201d in the meantime.\n\n\u201cI will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they\u2019re off (for more ghost hunting trips),\u201d he said."

Wolfe went to a relative's home on N. 5th Street where he was arrested, police said. On Saturday morning, Wolfe was arraigned by District Judge Rachel Wiest-Benner. He is being held without bail.\n\nSunbury Police Chief Travis Bremigen said Sunbury Officer Trey Kurtz arrived at the 5th Street home after being called by the homeowner. Bremigen said Kurtz spoke with Wolfe who told him he drove with White to a friend's house on Court Street and smoked what he thought was marijuana, police said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWolfe told Kurtz he was unsure what he smoked was marijuana, according to court documents. He also told police that he used a paranormal meter to check a statue for energy and received a high reading of paranormal activity, which made him feel scared, police said.\n\nWolfe then told Bremigen that \"in that moment\" he believed his friend was trying to put a white rag with something on it over his mouth with the intent to harm him, police said.\n\nWolfe told police he thought his friend and White were all trying to kill him so he panicked and ran out of the house to retrieve his handgun from his vehicle, according to court documents. Police reported Wolfe said he grabbed a gun and put a live round into the chamber, police said.\n\nWolfe told officers that's when White opened the front passenger door of the vehicle and Wolfe fired one shot in what he said was self-defense, police said. White was struck in the chest. By the time medical personnel arrived she could not be saved, Bremigen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBremigen first arrived at the scene with other officers and attempted to save the victim, he said.\n\nNorthumberland County Coroner Jim Kelley arrived at the scene and pronounced the woman dead, Bremigen said.\n\nWolfe said that after the shooting he drove to his relative's house on N. 5th Street. The relative called police immediately, Bremigen said.\n\nBremigen secured a search warrant from Wiest-Benner and officers were able to recover a small black 9mm handgun lying on the floor of the N. 5th Street home, according to police.\n\nWolfe was interviewed a second time at the Sunbury Police Department and Bremigen said Wolfe gave the same statements. Wolfe added he did not see any weapons on White when she approached him at the vehicle, police said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWolfe told police he concealed a loaded 9mm handgun in his vehicle without having a concealed weapon permit, police said.\n\nKurtz and Officer Gary Bregensir asked Wolfe if it was possible White was entering the vehicle to leave with him and Wolfe took a deep breath and said \"that's a good question,\" police said.\n\nBregensir said he asked Wolfe why he did not render aid to White, his girlfriend of seven years, to which Wolfe allegedly responded, \"I was too messed up,\" according to court documents.\n\nPolice said they also searched a Market Street home because Wolfe said he had lived there, and officers were able to allegedly retrieve a large amount of suspected synthetic marijuana and multiple smoking devices.\n\nWolfe was sent to Northumberland County Jail and will now appear before Wiest-Benner for a preliminary hearing at a later date."

            "source": "Far Out Magazine",
            "article_content": "Stephen King\u2019s favourite horror character from his books\n\nTo hit a debut novel out of the park like Stephen King did with Carrie in 1974 is to instantly establish yourself as one of the premier writers of the day. However, perhaps more impressive than simply getting a good book out to the public is that it was a uniquely poised piece of horror fiction.\n\nThe celebrated genre may be one of the most ardently mythologised, with fandoms strong enough to make Taylor Swift blush, but it isn\u2019t always the most marketable to a widespread audience. Stephen King changed all that, and his books became some of the most successful novels ever written. And, as cinema exploded into a new phase in the latter parts of the 20th century, King\u2019s books would be routinely leant on for inspiration.\n\nFew authors can boast as many movie adaptations as King\u2019s 65. The writer has given the cinematic world classics like The Shining and The Shawshank Redemption as well as It and Stand By Me, a range of stories that not only celebrate the unique talent of King but the widespread range of characters within them. The narrative may be what attract most filmmakers to his work, but it is the characters within them that make those movies unforgettable.\n\nWhen asked to pick out his favourite character from his oeuvre, King was quick to land on his favourite. Naturally, it came from one of his scarier books, but still, that\u2019s about the only thing one might have predicted. Many would have thought The Shining protagonist Jack Torrance would be number one, especially considering his issues with Stanley Kubrick over his portrayal. You might also be persuaded into thinking that Pennywise, the demon clown from It might be the writer\u2019s favourite.\n\nHowever, the character King called his favourite to write during a keynote speech at George Washington University was Annie Wilkes from Misery. The picture was directed by Rob Reiner, who had previously directed King\u2019s novella The Body into the definitive coming-of-age classic Stand By Me four years earlier, with stars James Caan and Kathy Bates playing a writer and one of his obsessed fans, respectively.\n\nBates steals the show as Annie Wilkes, the maniacal fan in question who not only engineers the near-fatal crash that leaves Caan in her carer but then proceeds to begin the battle of wits to try and keep him in her home. The movie and the book operate as a brutal reflection on fan culture, which may well have been drawn from King\u2019s heightened experiences of a new life under the spotlight as more and more of his books became global hits and cinematic spectacles.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Wilkes would become his favourite character. Not only is King\u2019s character an irredeemable villain, but she is able to deliver this terror through a less than usual presence. Previously, King\u2019s monsters would be either animalistic, paranormal or twisted men. Here, with a woman as the lead character, he was able to change the narrative entirely.\n\nThe movie would not only become a commercial success but also achieve the only Oscar that has been given for a Stephen King adaptation as Bates picked up \u2018Best Actress\u2019 in 1991, giving Wilkes a slightly more questionably vulnerable spin. While King would likely resist picking favourites too often, for the most part, it is easy to see how Wilkes may win out every time he is asked."

There are even a couple of graves which have almost been swallowed up by tree trunks.\n\nThe land was developed as a cemetery in 1847 but the area has been left to become more of a wildlife haven in recent years. That has added to the mystique of the area.\n\nREAD MORE: Coronation Street legend announces they're leaving the ITV show\n\nREAD MORE: Five places to eat out in Hull this year - From vegetarian restaurant to pretty cafe\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are the Quaker graves, the memorial to cholera victims and many strange tales behind the headstones. There are also plenty of fairy doors and other bizarre items if you look closely. But there is one tree which is truly curious.\n\nDeep in the grounds is the \"Penny Tree\", where hundreds of pennies are stuck to the trunk in long lines. The coins have been placed quite high up in the tree so you would need to be agile or have a ladder to get to them.\n\nThere are hundreds of the coins just below where the branches begin in a spiral form. But many of the coins appear to have been plucked out or have fallen out over time.\n\nThe Penny Tree in Hull General Cemetery\n\nAccording to this legend, anyone who climbs up and removes a penny will suffer bad luck. The story is a hoax, however, created by a local paranormal group and local artist Lee Sendall in the early 2000s who also etched a number of faces on some of the trees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther people have since used the tree to etch their own names and pictures into it. There are a number of faces and figures and even a dancing fairy.\n\nLee was also responsible for \u201cLittle Doug,\u201d a strange artefact put on display in Hull Maritime Museum in 2006. It looked like some alien foetus which was inspired by the mermaid exhibits of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe ''Little Doug'' exhibit by Lee Sendell at the Maritime Museum, Queen Victoria Square in Hull\n\nLee even created a back story to say it was brought over by a soldier from North Africa during the Second World War and was preserved by being buried in an allotment in Hull.\n\nHe is a colourful character who also threatened to sue the organisers of the London Olympics after claiming designs he submitted for an arts competition run by Olympics chiefs were ripped off by director of the opening ceremony Danny Boyle.\n\nHe submitted plans for a spiralled mound and a similar hill was then used in the opening ceremony which was supposedly based on Glastonbury Tor."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery by scientists at Japan\u2019s RIKEN Center for Brain Science has revealed an unexpected link between dopamine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

Law enforcement experts and data analysts provide several reliable methods for accessing and interpreting local crime statistics, emphasizing the importance of using official sources for accurate information.\n\nOfficial data sources\n\nLocal police departments serve as primary sources for accurate crime information. Most departments maintain public websites featuring detailed crime reports categorized by neighborhood or zip code. These resources typically include annual reports, current crime statistics, and specific details about homicides and other violent crimes within their jurisdictions.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies often provide sections labeled \u201cCrime Statistics\u201d or \u201cAnnual Reports\u201d on their websites. These comprehensive documents include detailed information about homicides, property crimes, and arrests within specific timeframes, allowing residents to track patterns and trends in their areas.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Crime Data Explorer provides comprehensive nationwide statistics. This federal database allows users to filter information by location and specific crime types, offering valuable insights into local safety patterns and trends over time. The platform\u2019s design enables detailed analysis of murder rates and other violent crimes across different regions.\n\nCity resources\n\nMany metropolitan areas maintain public crime dashboards that display current statistics. These platforms often provide interactive maps and regular updates about criminal activities within specific neighborhoods. City officials emphasize the importance of these tools for maintaining community awareness and safety.\n\nThese dashboards typically offer real-time or near-real-time updates, allowing residents to monitor recent criminal activities in their areas. Many systems include features for comparing crime rates across different neighborhoods or zip codes, providing valuable context for understanding local safety conditions.\n\nThird-party platforms\n\nSeveral independent organizations aggregate crime data into user-friendly formats. NeighborhoodScout compiles information from multiple sources to create detailed safety profiles for specific areas. The platform includes crime rates, risk indexes, and comparative analysis tools that help residents understand their neighborhood\u2019s safety level.\n\nCrimeMapping.com utilizes official police data to generate interactive maps showing recent criminal activities. Users can customize searches to focus specifically on homicides or other violent crimes within their zip codes. The platform provides regular updates and historical data for comprehensive analysis.\n\nSpotCrime offers another valuable resource, featuring interactive maps highlighting recent crimes, including violent offenses. The platform allows users to set up alerts for real-time updates about criminal activities in their areas, helping residents stay informed about potential safety concerns.\n\nUnderstanding statistics\n\nCrime analysts emphasize the importance of proper data interpretation. Population size significantly affects crime rates, particularly in smaller communities where few incidents can dramatically impact statistical representations. Experts recommend examining murder rates calculated per 100,000 residents while considering the community\u2019s total population for context.\n\nLaw enforcement experts recommend examining trends over extended periods, typically five to ten years, rather than focusing on isolated incidents or short-term fluctuations. This longitudinal approach provides more accurate insights into community safety patterns and helps identify meaningful trends in violent crime rates.\n\nContextual analysis\n\nSecurity specialists stress the importance of comparing local statistics with surrounding areas. This broader perspective helps residents better understand their neighborhood\u2019s relative safety within the larger community context. Experts recommend evaluating multiple adjacent zip codes to gain a comprehensive understanding of regional safety patterns.\n\nCrime prevention experts note that not all incidents appear in official records. Understanding these limitations helps residents make more informed decisions about their safety and security measures. They emphasize the importance of using multiple data sources to create a more complete picture of local safety conditions.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nLaw enforcement officials encourage resident participation in safety initiatives. Many police departments host regular community meetings to discuss crime trends and prevention strategies. These gatherings provide opportunities for direct interaction with local law enforcement and often include detailed discussions of recent criminal activities and prevention efforts.\n\nNeighborhood watch programs often maintain additional crime tracking resources. These community-based initiatives frequently offer detailed insights into local safety concerns and prevention efforts, complementing official data sources with ground-level observations and reports.\n\nDigital resources\n\nModern technology provides various tools for staying informed about local crime. Many communities use alert systems like Nixle to share real-time updates about criminal activities and safety concerns. These platforms often allow users to customize notifications based on location and crime type.\n\nSocial media platforms have become increasingly important for tracking local safety information. Law enforcement agencies regularly use these channels to communicate with residents about ongoing investigations, safety concerns, and crime prevention strategies.\n\nPractical applications\n\nUnderstanding local crime statistics supports various decision-making processes:\n\nInformed decision-making becomes crucial when relocating or choosing schools. Property owners can implement appropriate security measures based on specific crime patterns in their areas. Community organizations can develop targeted safety initiatives addressing local concerns.\n\nMoving forward\n\nAccessing and understanding local crime statistics represents an important step toward community safety. Regular monitoring of crime data helps residents stay informed about safety trends while enabling proactive participation in local crime prevention efforts.\n\nThis knowledge empowers residents to make informed choices about their safety while contributing to broader community security initiatives. Through consistent monitoring and engagement with available resources, community members can work together to create safer neighborhoods for everyone.\n\nThis story was created using AI technology."

This will help you decide what's in and what's not based on runway trends seen at Ala\u00efa, Miu Miu, Gucci, Valentino, Fendi and more.\n\nThe good thing with trending colours is that there's something for everyone. For example, if you're trying to step out of your comfort zone, you will be surprised to see how certain shades of pink, orange and yellow will continue to be present in Spring-Summer 2025 fashion. If you're determined to dress in a more practical, comfortable and versatile way, you will surely welcome shades such as champagne beige, black and white.\n\nWhat are the trending colours of 2025?\n\nChocolate Brown (Mocha Mousse)\n\nDeep Black\n\nScarlet Red\n\nButter Yellow\n\nMandarin Orange\n\nChampagne Beige\n\nPink (flamingo to pastel)\n\nMoss Green\n\nWhite\n\nWine (Burgundy)\n\nChocolate Brown (Mocha Mousse)\n\nGucci WWD/Getty Images Max Mara Victor VIRGILE/Getty Images\n\nCoach WWD/Getty Images Dries Van Noten Courtesy Dries Van Noten\n\nPantone declared Mocha Mousse as the colour of the year for 2025, \"a rich brown hue infused with the refinement of the earth\". Chocolate coffee is associated with nature and a feeling of warmth and indulgence.\n\nThis is a common shade in leather and suede fabrics. Although, this year it will be seen in light garments such as chiffon, in dresses as shown by Gucci, but also in skirt designs ideal for the office, as confirmed by Max Mara.\n\nTraditionally, in fashion, chocolate brown has been associated with pants, but in 2025 it will also be worn in asymmetrical dresses, as seen at Ala\u00efa, in miniskirts as at Coach, or in trench coats over dresses, as seen on Dries Van Noten's first runway without the Belgian designer at the helm.\n\nDeep Black\n\nAltuzurra Altuzarra Chanel Victor VIRGILE/Getty Images\n\nVictoria Beckham Valentino Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images\n\nBlack is a classic and elegant colour for all four seasons. Although it is preferred for evening events, it also becomes a wild card for the day, because you can always count on it to avoid any misstep. The protagonist of the little black dress, defines the codes of sophistication and hedonism.\n\nThis year it continues to be worn in tailored suits as well as in long and short dresses. We saw it both at Valentino and Victoria Beckham. And while many people might find it uninteresting, the reality is that it can always be quite the opposite through silhouette and textures."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery by scientists at Japan\u2019s RIKEN Center for Brain Science has revealed an unexpected link between dopamine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

            "article_content": "A handful of NFL teams are sitting their key starters in Week 18 with nothing on the line, including the Eagles, Chiefs and Rams.\n\nThe Bills are somewhere in the middle.\n\nWhile Buffalo might not be going full-throttle against the Patriots in Week 18 now that they are locked into the AFC's No. 2 seed, Josh Allen still got the start as he looks to cap another outstanding season.\n\nAllen remains a prime MVP contender, but the race isn't the reason he was briefly under center when the Bills started their regular season finale on Sunday.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Buffalo's decision to start Allen.\n\nNFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\nWhy is Josh Allen starting vs. Patriots in Week 18?\n\nAllen played just one snap to begin the game against the Patriots to keep his consecutive starts streak alive.\n\nThe Bills star has now started 105 consecutive games, the longest active streak among NFL quarterbacks and one of 14 in NFL history spanning at least 100 games at the position.\n\nBills coach Sean McDermott told reporters earlier in the week that Allen emphasized the streak when the two spoke after Week 17.\n\nMORE NFL WEEK 18:\n\n\"It was the first thing that he shared was, that that was important to him,\" McDermott said. \"I think it's pretty cool when this type of stat, if you will, is one of the top things on his mind.\"\n\nStill, McDermott doesn't plan on going all-out with the playoffs ahead. \"You'll see some starters out there playing, and you'll see some other players who we want to take a good look at,\" McDermott said. \"So it'll be a blend of both.\"\n\nOnce Allen played his snap to the start the game, backup Mitchell Trubisky took over. The Bills cannot move up or down in the standings, so their focus was mainly to be on gearing up for a first-round playoff game, whether it's against the Broncos, Dolphins or Bengals.\n\nMORE: Updated NFL playoff picture\n\nMost consecutive starts by an NFL QB\n\nHere are the consecutive starts streaks by a quarterback spanning at least 100 games, excluding playoffs:\n\nQB Consecutive starts Seasons Brett Favre 297 1992-2010 Philip Rivers 240 2006-20 Eli Manning 210 2004-17 Peyton Manning 208 1998-2010 Matt Ryan 154 2009-19 Russell Wilson 149 2012-21 Matthew Stafford 136 2011-19 Joe Flacco 122 2008-15 Ron Jaworski 116 1977-84 Tom Brady 112 2009-15 Tom Brady 111 2001-08 Tom Brady 110 2016-22 Joe Ferguson 107 1977-84 Josh Allen 105 2018-present\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: Packers, Steelers, Falcons fall; Commanders, Bengals, Bucs climb for Week 18\n\nAllen's streak is now 13th-longest in NFL history by reaching 105 games, but the record might be unbreakable. Brett Favre made 297 consecutive starts over a span of 19 seasons, 57 more than the NFL's second-longest streak.\n\nTom Brady, meanwhile had three different streaks of at least 110 games, with the latter two separated by only his \"DeflateGate\" suspension.\n\nOne of the biggest impediments to consecutive starts streaks in this era is the concept of resting players in Week 18 if nothing is on the line. For example, Patrick Mahomes hasn't missed a start since 2019 but has seen his streak reset to zero at multiple points because the Chiefs decided to sit him out of their final regular season game.\n\nAllen, who has played through a hand injury this season, certainly seems like he plans to keep rising up the all-time leaderboard as long as he avoids major injuries.\n\nJosh Allen contract incentive\n\nWhile Allen did not have an incentive tied to games played or the streak that remained intact, he does have one major performance-based incentive.\n\nAhead of Week 18, ESPN's Adam Schefter pointed out that Allen is in line for a $1.5 million bonus if he is named the NFL MVP. With limited action in Week 18, Allen is unlikely to add to his MVP case but the consecutive starts streak certainly adds to he narrative of his MVP-caliber season.\n\nWinning MVP is more important to Bills quarterback Josh Allen than most.

            "article_content": "Researchers have discovered that a machine learning (ML) model, using dynamic ensemble selection (DES), outperforms experienced pulmonologists in cancer lung diagnosis. Lung cancer is the cause of cancer deaths in the world, mainly due to late detection. Improving survival rates is dependent on the early detection approach. A recent study was conducted by Ricco N. and colleagues which was published in the journal of Scientific Reports .\n\nThis was a retrospective analysis of data from 38,944 patients suspected to have LC within the Region of Southern Denmark from 2009 to 2018. The study included 9,940 patients with complete data, with 2,505 (25%) diagnosed with LC. The DES model involved smoking history and key blood biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, total calcium, sodium levels, leukocyte and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein. It was compared against the performance of five pulmonologists in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and others.\n\nKey Findings:\n\nModel Performance:\n\nThe DES model resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77\u00b10.01.\n\nSensitivity: 76.2%\u00b12.04%, 6.5% better than the average pulmonologist.\n\nSpecificity: 63.8%\u00b12.3%.\n\nPositive predictive value (PPV): 41.6%\u00b11.2%.\n\nF1-score: 53.8%\u00b11.0%.\n\nComparison with Pulmonologists:\n\nDEs model outperformed all the five pulmonologists, while sensitivity was exceptionally high, particularly for early-stage detection.\n\nSignificant Biomarkers:\n\nSmoking status, LDH, serum calcium levels, low sodium levels, leucocytes, neutrophil count and CRP values were the strongest predictors of LC.\n\nThe DES ML model clearly outperformed pulmonologists in detecting lung cancer with higher sensitivity and identification of critical biomarkers for risk stratification. These findings show the ability of ML in changing the current landscape of early detection strategies for improving outcomes for patients at risk of LC. ML-driven models integrated into health care could provide decision-making support to clinicians and may decrease the rate of late-stage cancer diagnosis.\n\nReference:"

            "article_content": "Such searches may also reveal new types of variable stars: free-floating planets which fled their host stars and perhaps even rare classes of supernova. Looking for weird anomalies can also reveal problems with the instruments we are using, which is extremely important. We don\u2019t want to claim to find something exciting and it turns out to be a faulty camera!\n\nThe work I am carrying out with my colleagues uses machine learning to help astronomers reveal unknowns lurking in their data. In the coming new era of astronomy, there is going to be an incredible amount of data; no human can ever get through this data on their own. For example, the Vera C Rubin Observatory, which is soon to open for science, will produce 20 terabytes (20,000 gigabytes) of data every night! We hope that machine learning can help us to find and recommend what objects an astronomer should spend their time looking at and examining in more detail.\n\nThe Vera C Rubin Observatory is one of the most exciting projects in astronomy right now. It is named after one of the greats of the field, Vera Rubin, who provided some of the best evidence for dark matter, the ever-elusive matter that permeates the universe but which scientists still have yet to directly detect. Rubin will snap the observable night sky in its entirety every three nights, repeating this three-day cycle for 10 years, night-to-night, using the largest camera ever made.\n\nWhat Rubin is looking for is differences in images it has previously taken; like the largest game of spot the difference you could ever imagine, built-up into a 10-year video. Over its lifetime, Rubin will take 500 petabytes (500 million gigabytes) worth of images \u2013 which is enough to fill close to four million iPhones. It promises to be one of the best movies ever produced (at least for astronomers!).\n\nEach night Rubin will alert astronomers to 10 million changes in the sky. The changes detected in images are objects like asteroids \u2013 Rubin will find more than has ever been recorded \u2013 or variable stars that change in brightness during their lifetimes, and supernovae, the extreme and violent explosions of stars in the last moments of their lives. It will also do many other things, especially in helping our understanding of dark matter and mapping the contents of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nMachine learning can give great insights into the data scientists are interested in, but it is the scientist who must decide what to do next. But I don\u2019t think the use of machine learning has been maximised.\n\nThere are many possible futures and excitingly, the tools for future searches are currently being built. There are large spectroscopic telescopes in preparation like the dryly named Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). These telescopes can analyse the light from planets and determine the makeup of their atmospheres and have the potential to reveal biosignatures \u2013 tracers of life \u2013 in the atmospheres of these planets.\n\nNaturally, some researchers are interested in finding even more sophisticated compounds that cannot arise from nature which would be a sure sign of something interesting brewing in these distant worlds.\n\nThere are also new radio telescopes being built, including the impressive Square Kilometre Array, which will be of great interest to researchers looking for interesting radio signals, natural or not, and Breakthrough Listen are preparing the next generation of hardware and algorithms on new telescopes to continue the search for life.\n\nI have always been interested in astronomy, and the challenge of looking for the most unusual and interesting objects in the universe was an offer I could hardly refuse.\n\nWhen I look at a starry sky, I tend to wonder. I look at the planets shining brightly, without wavering through our atmosphere, and I think about how Jupiter must look with its magnificent moons. I see the fast-moving satellites above and think about all the important stuff up there including astronauts, communications and telescopes, and the ingenuity it took to get it there.\n\nI watch the stars flicker and imagine what life would be like around them, likely they are something unimaginably different from what we know, but perhaps there are places that resemble our own world. For astronomers, the lofty goal of understanding the universe can be the most humbling of pursuits, and it always starts by looking up.\n\nDo you have a story to tell or opinions to share about this?

This score edges out the certified world record of 4,723 points set by AMD's EPYC 7713 chip with a similar number of cores.\n\nGiven these figures, it's no surprise that the Astra also excelled in Blender rendering workloads. Geerling specifically highlighted the system's impressive 1.7 TFLOPS of double-precision compute power.\n\nWhen it comes to the overall package, this is far from your average pre-built desktop. The entry-level $3,299 model already packs a serious punch with 64 cores, 64GB of RAM, and an RTX A400 GPU. However, the top configuration Geerling tested \u2013 priced just shy of $7,000 \u2013 pulls out all the stops with 128 cores, 512GB of octa-channel RAM, 40TB of storage capacity, and an RTX 6000 Ada GPU.\n\nAll this hardware is housed in a sleek, quiet tower, which again is a surprise considering the near server-grade specs. Patriots will also be pleased to know that it's an American-made system, coming straight out of System76's Denver facility.\n\nGeerling did highlight some downsides with the system though. Beyond its ultra-premium pricing, single-threaded performance is underwhelming and barely inches past AMD's 2017 Threadripper 1950X in the same Cinebench test. That's sad considering the prodigious multi-core muscle.\n\nThere are also platform limitations to consider. The system is restricted to PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 RAM, which may feel outdated to some. Geerling was also less than thrilled with the lack of front I/O ports and noted some rattling from the PCIe brackets. And if you're thinking about gaming on this machine while running Windows, think again \u2013 Nvidia has yet to release Arm-compatible drivers.\n\nBut then again, the Thelio Astra isn't designed to be a gaming rig or a general-purpose desktop PC replacement. System76 is squarely targeting developers, with a particular emphasis on the automotive software industry, where it shines as a platform for \"rapid dev prototyping.\"\n\n\"System76 and Ampere ride together to make Thelio Astra the driving force behind AV development,\" the company notes on its website. If you're in that niche and have cash to burn, this could be the latest must-have Arm toy for you."

            "article_content": "As Oman positions itself as the Middle East's digital gateway, connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, the nation is witnessing an unprecedented transformation in its business landscape. This strategic evolution, backed by substantial infrastructure investments and clear government vision, is creating remarkable opportunities for businesses and professionals alike.\n\nOur nation's geographical advantage, with its extensive coastline outside the Strait of Hormuz, has become a powerful asset in the digital age. The network of 21 submarine telecom cables and five landing stations provides direct access to over 46 countries, creating a robust digital highway that's attracting global technology companies and empowering local businesses.\n\nThis digital infrastructure is revolutionizing how Omani businesses operate. With 13 state-of-the-art data centers and a growing cloud services market, companies of all sizes are finding new ways to digitalize their operations cost-effectively. The impact is particularly significant for our small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which can now access world-class digital services without massive capital investments.\n\nThis strategic evolution is creating remarkable opportunities for businesses and professionals alike. Image for illustration only.\n\nThe numbers tell a compelling story. Our ICT market is projected to grow from US$5.02 billion in 2023 to US$8.33 billion by 2028, while the e-commerce sector is expected to expand at an impressive 13.54% through 2028. These figures represent more than just market growth \u2013 they signify thousands of new opportunities for Omani entrepreneurs and businesses.\n\nHigh-speed internet penetration, reaching 74.39%, is enabling our SMEs to compete globally. Local businesses are launching e-commerce platforms, implementing digital payment solutions, and leveraging cloud-based tools to streamline their operations. This digital accessibility is leveling the playing field, allowing smaller enterprises to compete effectively with larger organizations.\n\nThe employment landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation. New career opportunities are emerging across various technology domains, from digital infrastructure management to cloud solutions architecture, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Young Omanis are increasingly gravitating toward these technology-related careers, meeting the growing demand for digital expertise.\n\nOur government's Vision 2040 digital initiatives are providing crucial support for this transformation. With the Digital Transformation Program already achieving a 53% completion rate, we're seeing tangible progress in creating a comprehensive framework for digital growth. This includes streamlined business registration processes, enhanced e-government services, and robust support for technology startups.\n\nThe ripple effects of this digital revolution extend across traditional sectors. Manufacturing companies are implementing smart factory solutions, logistics firms are digitalizing their supply chains, and healthcare providers are embracing telemedicine. The retail sector is adopting omnichannel platforms, while educational institutions are developing e-learning solutions.\n\nFor entrepreneurs and investors, specific opportunities are emerging in digital payment solutions, cloud computing services, cybersecurity, data analytics, and IoT applications. The digital infrastructure is also attracting foreign direct investment, contributing significantly to our GDP growth and economic diversification efforts.\n\nLooking ahead, Oman's digital ecosystem will drive economic diversification through technology sector growth, digital service exports to the MENA region, and the development of digital entrepreneurship. The establishment of technology parks and innovation centers is fostering a startup culture and attracting international talent, creating a vibrant environment for innovation and growth.\n\nWhile Oman's digital transformation presents exciting opportunities, it's important to recognize the accompanying challenges. Businesses must proactively address cybersecurity risks, bridge skills gaps through training and development, and ensure compliance with evolving digital regulations. The government's proactive initiatives in establishing comprehensive frameworks and support programs are instrumental in helping businesses navigate these challenges and thrive in this new digital era.\n\nTo further enhance this progress, it's essential to leverage the potential of academic institutions and research centers in fostering innovation and driving technological advancements. These institutions play a crucial role in nurturing groundbreaking ideas and solutions. By increasing their focus on research and development (R&D), they can empower Omani students and youth to actively contribute to the nation's digital landscape. This includes providing them with opportunities to commercialize their research findings and develop homegrown technologies that address local challenges.\n\nThis approach not only reduces reliance on foreign technologies but also fosters a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship within the country. Academic institutions must prioritize R&D, allocate sufficient budgets, and collaborate with industry partners to translate research outcomes into market-ready solutions. This will accelerate Oman's digital transformation and create a sustainable ecosystem for technological innovation and economic growth.\n\nThe message for Omani businesses and professionals is clear: the time to capitalize on our digital transformation is now. The combination of world-class infrastructure, government support, and growing market demand creates an ideal environment for digital business success. As we progress toward becoming a leading digital economy in the region, the opportunities for growth, innovation, and success will only expand.\n\nThis digital revolution represents more than technological advancement \u2013 it's a comprehensive economic transformation that's reshaping our future. For businesses, investors, and job seekers, Oman's digital landscape offers a wealth of opportunities. Our digital future isn't just a vision \u2013 it's a reality unfolding today, creating new pathways for sustainable growth and prosperity in the global digital economy."

Magney State Park, with the falls nestled in a white pine tree-covered cove.\n\nDevil\u2019s Kettle Falls is located along the Superior Hiking Trail, Grand Marais, MN 55604.\n\nDiscover more Famous World Landmarks:\n\n22- Headwaters of the Mississippi River\n\nThe Mississippi River begins in Itasca State Park in Minnesota and winds across that state for 694 miles (1117km) before leaving the state.\n\nThe headwaters have become a popular location for state residents and tourists alike as they head to the state park to see where this famous river begins.\n\nMany visitors enjoy water sports in the calm waters of the first half-mile (0.8km) of the river, whilst those in the headwaters themselves can paddle and wade across the stream as it reaches a depth of a mere 18 inches (46m).\n\nMarking the spot is a post that dates back to the 1930s and has long been a popular location for visitors to have their photographs taken.\n\nHeadwaters of the Mississippi River is at 36750 Main Park Drive, Park Rapids, MN 56470.\n\n23- Peacebunny Island\n\nOne of Minnesota\u2019s more unusual attractions is Peacebunny Island.\n\nCaleb Smith, a teenager, purchased the island and several other small islands in the Mississippi River following living on a house boat by the island in 2018.\n\nCaleb filled the island with bunnies who are trained on the island as comfort animals.\n\nThe animals live nearby in Savage before being taken daily to the island by youth guardians who are learning how to care for the environment and care for the bunnies.\n\nCaleb trains the bunnies alongside a team of volunteers to turn rescued domestic rabbits into comfort animals used to comfort seniors, those in hospices, and at sites of trauma.\n\nThe island is fantastic during warm weather, where visitors can watch the bunnies roam freely in their downtime.\n\nThe island also offers picturesque views of the Mississippi River, making it excellent for an afternoon relax and picnic.\n\nPeacebunny Island is at Peacebunny Island, Newport, Minnesota, MN 55055.\n\n24- Niagara Cave\n\nJoe Flynn, Al Cremer and Leo Tekippe discovered Niagara Cave in 1924, and it has been open to the public since 1934.\n\nThe cave stretches for 1 mile (1.61km) underground at a depth of almost 200ft (61m).\n\nVisitors can see fossils of more than 450 million years old and learn about how the cave was geologically formed over centuries.\n\nWithin the cave is an underground stream and waterfall, making it a popular place for weddings.\n\nNiagara Cave is at 29842 Co Hwy 30, Harmony, MN, 55939.\n\n25- Eagle Mountain\n\nEagle Mountain is the state\u2019s highest peak at 2301ft (701m), a State Historic Site and a must-visit natural site of Minnesota.\n\nReaching the summit offers a pleasant climb taking around 2.5 hours up a 3.5 mile (5.6km) trail.\n\nWhen hiking to reach the summit, make time to stop by Whale Lake, which is situated about halfway up the mountain trail.\n\nEagle Mountain is at West Cook, MN 55604.\n\n26- Artists Point\n\nArtists Point is a true beauty spot in Minnesota because of its large number of jagged rocks on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nArtists Point takes its name from the numerous artists who set up their easels on the rocks to paint the scenery.\n\nArtists point was formed billions of years ago from grey basalt and are unusually formed in hexagonal shapes, making for an attractive shoreline.\n\nYou can reach the point by a narrow concrete walkway that passes small rock pools.\n\nFurther past the point is a lighthouse.\n\nArtists Point is at Grand Marais, MN 55604.\n\n27- Palisade Head\n\nAnother amazing rock formation on the shores of Lake Superior is Palisade Head.\n\nPalisade Head offers incredible views over Lake Superior from a height of 932ft (284m).\n\nThe edge of the cliff is sheer, with jutting rocks sticking out, making it highly popular with rock climbers who abseil down its face to experience the challenge and exhilaration of climbing back up.\n\nThe top of Palisade Head and the surrounding area is covered in a forest filled with white spruce and paper birch.\n\nThe head is also a must-visit location for bird watchers as Peregrine falcons make their nests here.\n\nPalisade Head is at Beaver Bay Township, MN 55614."

The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "A new breakthrough may help scientists solve some of the mysteries of the quantum realm.\n\nFor the first time, physicists have been able to measure the geometrical 'shape' a lone electron adopts as it moves through a solid. It's an achievement that will unlock a whole new way of studying how crystalline solids behave on a quantum level.\n\n\"We've essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn't be obtained before,\" says physicist Riccardo Comin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThe research was led by physicists Mingu Kang \u2013 formerly of MIT and now at Cornell University \u2013 and Sunjie Kim of Seoul National University.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWithin the physical Universe, matter behaves in ways that are well described by classical physics.\n\nHowever, on a more fundamental level of particle interactions and methods of measurement, things can get a little weird. On the finest of scales, precision must give way to a more fuzzy description represented by waves of possibility known as quantum mechanics.\n\nWe refer to objects like electrons as particles, and that conveys the impression that they are like teeny tiny little balls. Given their size, the properties and behaviors of electrons are far more accurately described by their wave-like quantum nature.\n\nTo describe the wave aspect of electrons, physicists use wave functions: mathematical models that describe the properties of the wave as evolving possibilities of finding the particle in a specific place with specific features.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome of these features we can think of as a kind of geometry, often not unlike a curve or sphere that rotates in an infinite number of directions. Other forms of quantum geometry, like those of electrons in a lattice of atoms, are as complicated as a Klein bottle or a M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nDetermining some aspects of the messy quantum geometry of an electron in a solid has previously involved a lot of guesswork based on properties that physicists can measure.\n\nTo measure the quantum geometry of electrons, Kang, Jie, and their colleagues sought the measurement of a property known as the quantum geometric tensor, or QGT. This is a physical quantity that encodes the entire geometric information of a quantum state, similar to the way a two-dimensional hologram encodes information about a three-dimensional space.\n\nThe technique they used is called angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in which photons are fired at a material to dislodge electrons and measure their properties, such as polarization, spin, and angle.\n\nTheoretical (j, m) and real (k, l) measurements of quantum geometry. (Kang et al., Nat. Phys., 2024)\n\nThis was directed at single crystals of a cobalt-tin alloy, a material known as a kagome metal \u2013 a quantum material whose properties the team had previously investigated using the same technique.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe results provided the researchers with the first measurement of the QGT in a solid, and from this, they were able to infer the rest of the quantum geometry of the electrons in the metal.\n\nThe team compared this to theoretically derived quantum geometry for the same material, allowing them to determine the usefulness of estimating the geometry compared to measuring it directly.\n\nAnd, they say, their technique will be applicable to a broad range of materials, not just the cobalt-tin alloy used for this study. It's a result that will have some interesting implications. For example, quantum geometry could be leveraged to discover superconductivity in materials where it is not usually found.\n\n\"The geometric interpretation of quantum mechanics underpins many recent advances in condensed-matter physics,\" an anonymous expert told Nature Physics.\n\n\"These authors have pioneered a methodology to experimentally access the quantum geometric tensor, which fundamentally characterizes the geometric properties of quantum states. The developed methodology is straightforward, applicable to various solid-state materials, and has great potential for boosting experimental activity in pursuit of geometric understanding of novel quantum phenomena.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe team's research has been published in Nature Physics.\n\nRelated News"

            "article_content": "Swami Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna |\n\nHaridwar, January 5: In the presence of Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj, the President of Patanjali Yogpeeth, and Acharya Balkrishna, the General Secretary, the 30th foundation day of the Patanjali institution was celebrated at the Yog Bhavan Auditorium, located at Patanjali Wellness, Haridwar. In the program, with the presence of more than 6,000 officials from the Patanjali Yogpeeth organization across the country, Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj gave an introduction to the 30 years of service, struggle, and dedication and shed light on the future plans of Patanjali Yogpeeth. While announcing the five revolutions after the success of the Yoga Revolution, he said that Patanjali will initiate significant work for freedom in education, healthcare, economy, intellectual-cultural freedom, and liberation from diseases, indulgences, shame, and frustrations.\n\nFirst Revolution: Freedom in Education\n\nHe said that today, 50 to 90, and in some places, 99 percent educated individuals are unemployed, addicted, characterless, and dull children, whose childhood, youth, and our lineage are in danger. We have decided that first in India and then in the entire world, a new education system will be introduced, and its leadership will be done by India. Patanjali Gurukul, Acharyakulam, Patanjali University, and the Indian Education Board will now establish new benchmarks. Our resolution is that in the next five years, we will connect 500,000 schools with the Indian Education Board. This will be an innovative revolution in education.\n\nWe want to give children not only literacy but also subject knowledge, self-awareness, truth-oriented patriotism, and awareness of their pride and glory. We will include knowledge from across the world in Hindi, English, and Sanskrit, keeping up-to-date with the world, but 80% of the content will be from Vedas, philosophy, Upanishads, Puranas, and the pride of India. It will include spiritual sciences, Sanatan awareness, and Indian pride. This will not be Macaulay\u2019s education system. When the Indian Education Board affiliates first 100,000 schools and then 500,000 schools, India's childhood and youth will be secure. This is the resolution for freedom in education. Through the Indian Education Board, we will not teach the false greatness of foreign invaders, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or the British, but rather the true history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, and revolutionaries.\n\nSecond Revolution: Freedom in Healthcare\n\n\"Disease is not our nature; Yoga is our nature.\" Today, around the world, due to the consumption of synthetic medicines, steroids, and painkillers, people\u2019s bodies are deteriorating. For healthcare freedom, through Patanjali Wellness, Yoggram, Niramayam, hospitals, and health centers, and modern research, we are advancing the legacy of sages and science. We have published more than 5,000 research protocols and 500 research papers in world-class international journals, presenting solutions to incurable diseases before the world. Our resolution is to prevent people from becoming diseased and to liberate them from diseases through Yoga and Ayurveda.\n\nThird Revolution: Economic Freedom\n\nToday, the entire economy is trapped in the cruel claws of a handful of people. Our goal is prosperity for service and wealth for welfare. So far, Patanjali has done charity worth \u20b91 lakh crore in education, healthcare, research, character-building, and nation-building. With over 10,000 centers, 2.5 million trained Yoga instructors, and 1 crore workers selflessly serving, this is the service work of nation-building and character-building. Our resolution is to make the Swadeshi movement so powerful that India can emerge from economic exploitation, slavery, and poverty, and become supremely prosperous. By eliminating diseases like BP, diabetes, thyroid, asthma, arthritis, stress, and depression and saving on medicines, we save \u20b9700 to \u20b92,000 lakh crore annually for the country.\n\nFourth Revolution: Intellectual and Cultural Freedom\n\nIndia, which first gave the message of spiritual world knowledge to the world, cannot afford to endure intellectual and cultural slavery. Today, India depends on impoverished countries for everything, which have nothing but paper money, dollars, or pounds. True wealth is not just money but also good health, a happy family, character, spiritual wealth, and divine virtues. We must liberate India from intellectual and cultural slavery. Hence, we aim to elevate Sanatan Dharma, Vedic Dharma, Sage Dharma, and Yoga Dharma as the new religion of the era. More than 500 crore people worldwide have faith in Yoga Dharma and Sanatan Dharma. If we walk together, we will end religious terrorism, political terrorism, and the terror being perpetuated in the name of education and healthcare.\n\nFifth Revolution: Freedom from Addictions, Diseases, and Indulgences\n\nA dangerous game of addiction is spreading worldwide. In India, addiction has destroyed lives through diseases, intoxication, and obscenity. Our resolution is freedom from diseases, addictions, and obscenity. On completing 30 years, Patanjali resolves to make the world Yoga-oriented and create ideal global citizens through character-building.\n\nRemarks by Acharya Balkrishna Ji Maharaj\n\nAcharya Balkrishna remarked that with Swami Ji's unrelenting and extraordinary efforts, Patanjali's contribution is inspiring the world. Patanjali runs campaigns for charity using profits from its business. Patanjali is not a market but a family for India. With a team of over 500 world-class scientists, Patanjali is making evidence-based Ayurvedic medicines like juices, herbs, and tablets accessible worldwide. By integrating India\u2019s ancient knowledge with modern science, Patanjali has brought Yoga from caves to the masses, reaching millions in over 200 countries."
