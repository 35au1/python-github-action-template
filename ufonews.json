Credit: James Fox\n\nThe report says 118 of the more than 700 cases were resolved during the reporting period. They were oftentimes attributed to being birds, balloons and other aircrafts. Many of the cases that weren\u2019t resolved may be due to a lack of photo evidence.\n\nNo reporters suffered any adverse health affects due to the spotted UFO\u2019s.\n\nAccording to the AARO, there is a geographical trend that shows many sightings are located near military bases.\n\nUtah study reveals the \u2018best\u2019 place for UFO sightings\n\nAbout 65% of reporters said they saw strange lights in the sky. Other reporters said they saw objects such as orbs, cylinders and triangles.\n\nOther reporters, who said the objects didn\u2019t fit into the aforementioned categories, said they saw things like a \u201cgreen fire ball,\u201d \u201ca jelly fish with [multicolored] flashing lights,\u201d and a \u201csilver rocket approximately six feet long.\u201d\n\nTo date, the reports states, none of the reports have produced \u201cevidence of extraterrestrial\n\nbeings, activity, or technology.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed the app's availability on X.\n\nThe Gemini app now gives iPhone users direct access to Google's AI chatbot through text, voice, or camera input. The best part is that it all happens without installing the main Google app.\n\nOne of the main features of Gemini is Gemini Live, which lets you chat naturally. That means it makes you feel like you're having a conversation with another human being on a call. You can pick from 10 AI voices and chat in languages like English, Spanish, French, German, or Hindi. I believe Gemini Live is Google's response to OpenAI's GPT4o. But I prefer the latter; it's more fluid than Gemini Live.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe app also offers extras such as AI image creation with Imagen 3, study help tools, and photo analysis features. It integrates with other Google apps through extensions, including YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Calendar. A Live Activity feature allows users to continue conversations while using other apps or when their iPhone is locked.\n\nThe Gemini has its limits on iOS. Unlike Siri, it can't tweak your settings or directly manage other apps, which was expected. Its functionality is limited to interactions within Google's ecosystem of apps and services."

We saw Google introduce its AI Overviews in Search earlier this year, and while we\u2019re sure many of you were scrambling to find ways to turn AI Overviews off, Google\u2019s definitely been working to make the case for their utility. Today we\u2019re checking out a new way to interact with AI Overviews that Google seems to be currently testing, letting you double-down on the AI analysis.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else.\n\nWe\u2019re checking out a tip from Eli_Blau on Telegram who shared with AA contributor Assemble Debug some interesting new behavior they spotted in version 15.45.33 beta of the Google app on a Pixel 7a. While getting an AI Overview at the top of your results is nothing new, Blau noticed that the app now lets you select a portion of that Overview to get further information on it \u2014 essentially, it\u2019s pulling up a new AI Overview from within an existing one.\n\nThe functionality only seems to work with text in the Overview itself \u2014 you can\u2019t just highlight any text on the results screen and run a second Overview this way. And before you get it into your head to follow this rabbit hole down to infinity with some Inception-style nested Overviews, the implement that we\u2019ve checked out only supports one level deep of this re-querying.\n\nAdding a feature like this makes enough sense, and we can appreciate the way the new results appear in a resizable card so that you can still read the original Overview. The one-level-deep limitation is also easy enough to understand, and if you still need more clarification at that point, you\u2019re probably better off starting a new search.\n\nWill you be giving this a try if Google ever gets around to making it available on your device? Or are you still avoiding AI-generated content wherever you can, and already wish we could roll the clock back a few years?\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

There's even deep integration with Gemini Extensions, so users can ask Gemini about their Gmail inbox, for example. The app is also open to older iPhones running iOS 16 or later, which means devices left out of Apple Intelligence get to access Gemini's powerful AI voice service.Well, it looks like the leak we covered a few days ago panned out\u2014Google was indeed launching Gemini Live (and Gemini Advanced) on the iPhone via a standalone app. We reported on a possible test launch of the app in the Philippines, but now the Gemini app is available on the App Store to users in Australia, India, US, and UK, as well. The app is already ranked #2 in the Productivity category at the time of writing.Prior to this, the best iPhone users could do to access Gemini was through a multi-step process in the Google app\u2014not very intuitive, of course, and lacked any sort of integration with iOS. With the dedicated Gemini AI app, users can interact with Gemini from the lock screen and Dynamic Island directly. The app and Gemini Live is free to download and use, but Gemini's more advanced features are behind the Gemini Advanced paywall, starting at $19 per month as part of Google's One AI plan.Using Gemini's Live free service isn't necessarily a dumbed down AI. Gemini Live helps with you with writing, learning, and planning via human-like conversations. Getting Gemini Advanced naturally opens up more complex Gemini AI functions. You have access to deeper AI integration across Google services (like Gmail, Maps, Docs, etc.), but also have a human-like conversation with Gemini when you need more abstract information, advice, or want to learn more about specific topics or ideas.Even though Apple has its own Apple Intelligence, only the iPhone 15 Pro and newer are able to utilize it. The Gemini app, on the other hand, is compatible with iPhones with iOS 16 and later, so even folks with an iPhone 8 can enjoy some powerful AI goodness. It must be said, however, that the Gemini app only works with an internet connection (for now, anyway)."

The crime was so horrifying it inspired a slew of movies and books dedicated to exploring the conspiracy theory that the property was left \"haunted\" by the spirits of the six family members who died inside it.\n\n\"The Amityville Horror\" has become part of true-crime lore over the years\u2014first brought to life in the pages of a book of the same name in 1977, before it was adapted for the big screen in 1979, starring Hollywood A-listers Margot Kidder and James Brolin.\n\nSince then, dozens of follow-up books and movies have been released, most recently in October 2024, which saw the premiere of the latest horror flick in the series, \"Amityville: Where the Echo Lives.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMuch of the pop culture references to the real-life murders that took place inside the five-bedroom, four-bathroom Dutch Colonial property center on the family who moved in after convicted murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot and killed his parents and four siblings on Nov. 13, 1974.\n\nDeFeo was tried and convicted of the murders of both his parents, Ronald Sr. and Louise, as well as his siblings Dawn, 18, Allison, 13, Marc, 12, and John, 9, all of whom were found dead in their beds having been shot with a .35-caliber lever action Marlin rifle.\n\nIt has been 50 years since mass murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr. brutally killed six members of his family inside their home in Amityville, NY. Realtor.com\n\nIn the five decades since the heinous crimes took place, the home has become a local tourist attraction for fans of the horror movie franchise inspired by the murders. Paul Hawthorne/Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeFeo was convicted of six counts of second-degree murder and handed six sentences of 25 years to life. He died in prison in March 2021.\n\nThree years after DeFeo murdered his parents and siblings, a book was written about the family that moved into his former home and claimed they were haunted by spirits. Amazon\n\nDeFeo, also known as \"Butch,\" was 23 at the time of the killings. He initially tried to blame the murders on a mob hitman\u2014however, police later found serious holes in his story and turned their attention to him as their main suspect.\n\nHe was tried and ultimately convicted of six counts of second-degree murder. He was given six sentences of 25 years to life, and later died in jail on March 21, 2021, at the age of 69. In the years before his death, he claimed that he had heard voices telling him to kill his family.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nHowever, his crimes continue to haunt his former home and his neighborhood, with the name \"Amityville\" now synonymous with horror films and ghostly conspiracy theories.\n\nThe home where he shot and killed his family members still stands to this day\u2014a sinister reminder of the horrors that once took place inside its walls, despite efforts to wipe its slate clean.\n\nFirst, the property's address was officially changed from 112 Ocean Avenue to 108 Ocean Avenue, a common practice in cases where homes have been involved in gruesome crimes.\n\nMORE FROM REALTOR:\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nJust over a year after the DeFeo family was murdered, George and Kathy Lutz purchased the Amityville property for the reduced price of $80,000 and soon moved into the home with their three children.\n\nHowever, they moved out after just 28 days, alleging that they had experienced numerous paranormal phenomena while living there\u2014from strange odors and slime oozing from the walls to George waking to find Kathy levitating over their bed.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThey even claimed that a priest who had been to bless the home had heard a voice screaming at them to \"get out,\" per Biography.com.\n\nGeorge also alleged that he suddenly began waking at 3:15 a.m., which was the exact time that DeFeo is understood to have begun killing his family members, all of whom were found in their beds.\n\nThat book served as the basis for the hit 1979 movie \"The Amityville Horror.\" The film did not feature the DeFeo's former home and instead used a lookalike property. YouTube\n\nThe movie starred Hollywood A-listers Margot Kidder and James Brolin as George and Kathy Lutz, who moved into the DeFeo home with their children and claimed it was haunted. YouTube\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn the years since the home became the source of pop culture lore, it has passed hands multiple times\u2014most recently in 2017, when it was purchased for $605,000. Stan Wolfson/Newsday RM via Getty Images\n\nIt wasn't long before the Lutz family fled the property, leaving all of their belongings behind.\n\nThey faced a barrage of skepticism from the public, with critics accusing them of fabricating a series of spooky stories in a bid to gain national media attention; however, their experiences served as the basis for a book, \"The Amityville Horror: A True Story,\" which was later source material for the popular 1979 movie.\n\nNeither the original movie or any of its many sequels and prequels were filmed inside the DeFeo's former home. Lookalike properties were instead used as filming locations.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIt would take more than a year for the home to sell again\u2014this time to Jim and Barbara Cromarty, who paid just $55,000 for it in April 1977, not long before the book about the Lutz family's experiences was released.\n\nAlthough Jim and Barbara never reported witnessing any paranormal activity, they were plagued by the home's history\u2014revealing that their house was besieged by unwanted visitors at all hours of the night, a nightmare that led them to change the address in a bid to throw people off.\n\nAfter a year, they put the home on the market for $100,000; but by this point, interest in the Amityville case had reached fever pitch, and no legitimate buyer could be found. So, they chose to embrace the home's heritage, speaking out about it publicly and working with the local authorities to figure out a way to manage the influx of fascinated visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad"

That's certainly the case of Poinsett Bridge, the oldest bridge in the state which also happens to be visually stunning. You'll find it in the northern mountains of Greenville County, near Landrum. It's a bit off the beaten path but it's well worth the adventure to witness this stunning slice of history.\n\nThe Poinsett Bridge was built in the 1820s and is therefore not only the oldest bridge of its kind in South Carolina; it's also among the oldest in the entire southeast. The bridge's design is attributed to Robert Mills, a dedicated South Carolina resident credited with other iconic landmarks including the U.S. Treasury Building and even the Washington Monument. He also designed the Greenville Courthouse, whose Gothic windows mirror the stone bridge's iconic archway.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo why was the Poinsett Bridge built? It was a crucial part of the State Road, which connected South Carolina to the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee. There were three bridges constructed at the time. Poinsett Bridge was built over Little Gap Creek and the other two were built over North Saluda River and Hodge\u2019s Creek. Today, Poinsett Bridge is the only one that remains.\n\nThe bridge was named for Joel Poinsett, who was the president of South Carolina's Board of Public Works at the time. Poinsett is also significant for his role as the first U.S. ambassador to Mexico and was responsible for bringing a certain flowering plant to the U.S., now known as the Poinsettia.\n\nToday, the bridge is visited by history enthusiasts and even some paranormal investigators. Those who have visited the bridge after sunset report some eerie, unexplainable phenomena. Local legend tells the tale of a local worker who contracted malaria while working on the bridge. His body is believed to be buried under the bridge\u2014though this claim has never been proven. Another more lighthearted story is that the ghosts of two Irishmen frequently visit the bridge because they are so pleased with their handiwork.\n\nParanormal or not, there's no denying the allure of this landmark. Standing at the bridge, you can imagine what it must have been like to travel over two centuries ago. Today, the bridge is owned by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. It continues to be assessed to pinpoint the best structural engineering so that it can continue to be enjoyed by visitors and locals alike.\n\nHave you ever visited the Poinsett Bridge in South Carolina?

        "article_content": "How many times must a phenomenon occur before it graduates from a coincidence to a pattern? Usually, the answer depends on how unlikely, how far from the ordinary, and how (seemingly) inexplicable the phenomenon is. The more so, the lower the threshold.\n\nI was very surprised (and pleased) to read of this year\u2019s winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics: John Hopfield, a professor of Molecular Biology and earlier of Chemistry and Biology, together with Geoffrey Hinton, a professor of Computer Science. Their affiliations name three major scientific fields, none of them being Physics! The scientific community was shocked, some physicists were upset, but for all of us in Computing the citation was thrilling: \u201cFor foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.\u201d Artificial intelligence (AI), an interdisciplinary field with Computing at its core, was the achievement being honored!\n\nAs if this was not enough, the next day came the announcement of this year\u2019s winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry: David Baker, a professor of Biochemistry, cited \u201cfor computational protein design\u201d; and Demis Hassabis, co-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind together with John Jumper, researcher at Google DeepMind, cited \u201cfor protein structure prediction,\u201d which was often elaborated in the more extensive press releases by \u201cusing artificial intelligence models.\u201d Both achievements advance our understanding of proteins, a central focus of (bio-)chemistry, the field of the award. Nevertheless, at the core of both were again computing and AI.\n\nWe were at center stage of two Nobel Prize announcements! Both events were so unexpected that I believe they are not a coincidence but form a pattern. Scientific walls and walls of prejudice are falling as Computing is becoming a fundamental discipline in the STEM family. These prizes put Computing and AI at the core of scientific discoveries, to the point that, as tools, they may be considered as worthy of recognition as the scientific results they produce. Unprecedented!\n\nWe have entered the era of the 5th Paradigm of Science and the study of nature. After the paradigms of empirical/experimental science (followed for millennia), theoretical model science (for centuries), computational science (for decades), and data-driven science as envisioned by Jim Gray (for about 15 years), the 5th paradigm has emerged: AI-driven science. It is not just the speed at which AI generates and analyzes data; even more valuable are the correlations (and sometimes the causations) that AI identifies that far exceed the reach of conventional research. Computing and AI are transforming our scientific discovery processes. Science represents an amazingly exciting frontier for AI, and AI represents the most exciting new instruments in the hands of scientists.\n\nAll of us researchers in academia and industry should be thrilled and proud of how Computing and AI have risen in prominence in the eyes of the entire scientific community.\n\nThe two Nobel Prizes also highlight the importance of interdisciplinarity between Computing and other fields. The mission of ACM calls for \u201c\u2026 advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of computing \u2026\u201d. With few exceptions, the application of computing, that is, interdisciplinarity, has been outside of ACM\u2019s radar. Given the centrality of our technologies in other sciences, ACM is now establishing collaborations with prominent sister societies to serve the needs of emerging areas formed as their corresponding disciplines meet with Computing and AI. Our community should seize the moment, redirect some of its efforts toward the uncharted territories that are opening before us, and conquer new frontiers!\n\nExcited by the current successes of AI in scientific discovery, some push further and raise intriguing existential questions: Can we expect AI to transform from a tool to an actual researcher itself, pose and investigate scientific hypotheses, and eventually write papers about its work? If the work is reviewed by human experts who say the research is correct, novel, and interesting, why should we reject it? Eventually, could AI become a full peer of human researchers? Even if we reach that point, should a human always be in the loop, validating the scientific discovery and reviewing the AI-written paper (or its AI-written reviews)? These are questions that we must debate as a community. No matter what the answers may be, even the fact that we contemplate the existence of AI scientists is fascinating and a driver of exciting research ahead.\n\nAll of us researchers in academia and industry should be thrilled and proud of how Computing and AI have risen in prominence in the eyes of the entire scientific community. A scientific revolution is happening before our eyes, powered by Computing and AI. We should join our fellow researchers in other sciences and harness the power that modern Computing and AI technologies offer to understand the secrets of nature. In parallel, we should join forces with policymakers, governments, and civil society to ensure that our discoveries will be used responsibly for the benefit of all."

        "article_content": "Tavrius/Getty Images\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (gen AI) is paving the way for everyone to become their own software developers. But at the same time, AI may render many extraordinary skills unnecessary.\n\nThat's the word from Thomas Davenport of Babson College and Ian Barkin, a venture capitalist, in their latest book, All Hands on Tech: The AI-Powered Citizen Revolution. For starters, they point out that with low-code and no-code tools, robotic process automation, and now AI, the gates of software development are open to all.\n\nAlso: Your dream programming job demands this language, every site agrees\n\n\"Technology is no longer owned by any one department of function,\" they explain. \"Data and its analyses are no longer the property of only the PhDs and the hard-core number crunchers. From now on, all employees have the ability to be system designers, data analysts, coders, and creators.\"\n\nDavenport and Barkin note that generative AI will take citizen development to a whole new level. \"First is through conversational user interfaces,\" they write. \"Virtually every vendor of software today has announced or is soon to introduce a generative AI interface.\"\n\n\"Now or in the very near future, someone interested in programming or accessing/analyzing data need only make a request to an AI system in regular language for a program containing a set of particular functions, an automation workflow with key steps and decisions, or a machine-learning analysis involving particular variables or features.\"\n\nAs the authors mention, part of this future -- not quite formed yet -- are specialized bots designed to perform specific types of work. \"There are digital workers from RPA vendors and other start-ups that claim to perform an entire job, although our investigations thus far suggest that they really perform just a few tasks and are certainly less flexible than human workers.\"\n\nAlso: Google survey says more than 75% of developers rely on AI. But there's a catch\n\nThis includes nascent software development bots, which vendors claim are \"able to write software programs from start to finish,\" Davenport and Barkin state. \"Our guess is that for the next several years, these bots will be capable of making human citizens more productive but won't replace them.\"\n\nGen AI will feel like the ultimate research assistant or programmer, they added, \"because it is generating code to this analysis. It will elicit what you want, work very quickly, and allow you to change your mind infinite times in specifying your app, automation, or model.\"\n\n\"Gen AI will also make it easier to find existing models, features, or software components that you can use to begin your citizen project,\" they conclude.\n\nAlso: How ChatGPT scanned 170k lines of code in seconds, saving me hours of work\n\nLooking beyond these early starts, with the growth of AI, RPA, and other tools, \"some citizen developers are likely to no longer be necessary, and every citizen will need to change how they do their work,\" Davenport and Barkin speculate. Gen AI will assume much of this work, including generating application code, automations, and data science analyses.\n\nDominic Ligot, CEO and CTO of CirroLytix, echoes Davenport and Barkin's observations in a recent HackerNoon article, noting how he enabled semi-technical individuals in a class to leverage data science tools:\n\n\"The participants, primarily CISOs who typically don't code, found the exercises, crafted with AI's assistance, to be intuitive and hands-on. My goal was to immerse them in working directly with data and code. They especially appreciated the chance to explore manually what modern cyberthreat surveillance and SIEM platforms typically automate, gaining insights into the processes happening 'under the hood.'\"\n\nAt the same time, Ligot also suggests citizen developers and data scientists may not necessarily need technical skills, as AI takes on much of this work. \"My key takeaway from the class was surprisingly counterintuitive: data science, as we know it, will eventually be replaced by AI,\" he said.\n\nAlso: Technologist Bruce Schneier on security, society, and why we need 'public AI' models\n\n\"The rise of AI-driven tools capable of handling data analysis, modeling, and insight generation could force a shift in how we view the role and future of data science itself,\" said Ligot. \"Tasks like data preparation, cleansing, and even basic qualitative analysis -- activities that consume much of a data scientist's time -- are now easily automated by AI systems.\"\n\n\"What's worse (or better, depending on where you stand) is that AI is faster, more accurate, and less prone to human error or fatigue.\"\n\nStill, getting to the point where development and data science are delivered seamlessly via AI will take time, Davenport and Barkin clarify. \"It seems likely in the future that gen AI and conversational AI broadly will be the front end to all citizen applications,\" they say. \"That's possible today with many tools, but it takes at least a modicum of sophistication to create prompts that will get you the first cut at an app, a data analysis, or an automation workflow that you want. That's also true with code generations, and it's one reason why experienced coders tend to have better luck than inexperienced ones.\"\n\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2024 (and what not to use)\n\nHowever, they continued, \"within a year or two, it will be possible to have an iterative discussion with a gen AI interface about a machine-learning analysis.\""

        "article_content": "Scaling a startup is one of the most exciting yet challenging phases for any entrepreneur. The key to successful scaling lies in the ability to manage growth efficiently while maintaining product quality and meeting market demands. This is where IT outsourcing comes into play. By partnering with a reliable IT staffing agency, startups can leverage external expertise, optimize their resources, and focus on what they do best\u2014innovating and driving the business forward.\n\nThe journey of scaling a startup is full of potential pitfalls, from limited resources to the need for specialized talent that can adapt quickly to changing demands. Entrepreneurs who understand the strategic value of outsourcing can sidestep these challenges, turning potential obstacles into opportunities for growth. With the right approach, outsourcing can be the secret weapon that propels your startup to new heights and sets the stage for long-term success.\n\nWhy IT Outsourcing is a Game-Changer for Startups\n\nIT outsourcing allows startups to access a global pool of talent without the time-consuming and costly process of building an in-house team from scratch. This is particularly beneficial for tech startups that need specialized skills but may not have the budget or time to recruit and train full-time employees.\n\nOutsourcing helps startups:\n\nScale Quickly : With an outsourcing partner, businesses can ramp up their teams as needed without lengthy onboarding processes.\n\n: With an outsourcing partner, businesses can ramp up their teams as needed without lengthy onboarding processes. Access Niche Expertise : Outsourcing provides access to specialized knowledge in areas like cybersecurity, software development, and data analysis that may be hard to find locally.\n\n: Outsourcing provides access to specialized knowledge in areas like cybersecurity, software development, and data analysis that may be hard to find locally. Control Costs: Hiring in-house employees comes with fixed costs such as salaries, benefits, and office space. Outsourcing allows startups to pay for services as needed, providing more budget flexibility.\n\nThese benefits are why outsourcing has become a fundamental strategy for startups aiming to scale sustainably and competitively.\n\nKey Areas Where IT Outsourcing Can Support Growth\n\nOutsourcing can provide a significant boost across various operational areas. One of the primary areas is software development, where outsourced development teams can accelerate the software lifecycle and bring products to market faster.

By outsourcing the management of IT systems, startups can ensure their platforms are reliable, secure, and scalable without needing an in-house IT department. This allows founders and internal teams to concentrate on core business strategies and market expansion.\n\nArea of Support Benefits for Startups Software Development Faster development cycles and expert input IT Infrastructure Management Reliable, secure systems with minimal downtime Cybersecurity Enhanced protection and risk mitigation\n\nLeveraging Outsourcing to Stay Competitive\n\nOne overlooked advantage of outsourcing is the ability to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. By outsourcing certain functions, startups can respond faster to industry trends and integrate new technologies without needing to build that expertise from scratch. This agility can be the difference between a company that thrives and one that struggles to keep up with competitors.\n\nIn addition, outsourcing partners often bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions. Working with external teams can lead to creative problem-solving approaches that may not have been considered by an internal team. This influx of new ideas is invaluable for startups that are looking to push the envelope and distinguish themselves in their field.\n\nBest Practices for Effective IT Outsourcing\n\nTo fully reap the benefits of IT outsourcing, startups need to approach it strategically. It\u2019s not just about delegating tasks but building a partnership that aligns with business goals. Choosing the right partner is crucial\u2014select an agency with a proven track record, strong client feedback, and expertise in your industry. Setting clear, measurable objectives ensures that your partner understands your expectations and can align their efforts accordingly.\n\nMaintaining open communication is also key.

In fact, our own Nadeem Sarwar took the original black version out for a spin in July. He loved it, pronouncing it the best Kindle alternative he\u2019d ever used. I have to admit, after using the fetching new white variant, he\u2019s absolutely on the money.\n\nThe key to the e-reader\u2019s success in his eyes, and increasingly in mine too, is the operating system. Unlike a Kindle, which uses a \u201cforked\u201d version of Android that basically just runs Amazon\u2019s software and nothing else, the Boox Go Color 7 runs a full Android 12 install. That means it has more in common with an Android tablet than an Amazon e-reader, with access to not only Onyx\u2019s e-reading platform, but the Google Play Store too. Yes, that same Google Play Store you\u2019ll find on your Android smartphone or tablet is available here, and it means you can download the same apps you use on your other devices.\n\nYou might assume that means it doesn\u2019t run much other than the most basic of apps, but you\u2019d be wrong. While traditional benchmarking software seems to be beyond its modest capabilities, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 nestled inside the plastic shell is actually surprisingly powerful. It ran Balatro just fine, without the processor struggling or giving any indication it wasn\u2019t up to the task.\n\nDoes that mean it\u2019s basically a tablet, then? Well, no. It ran Balatro, sure \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t great. While the processor was up to the task, the screen\u2019s refresh rate really wasn\u2019t, and the game looked a little bit like it was trudging through mud. Even with the card\u2019s gentle swaying motion turned off, it wasn\u2019t always easy to see what was going on while the game was in motion, and while it was playable, it wasn\u2019t a game I revisited on the Go Color 7.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter, because the Go Color 7 isn\u2019t meant to play Balatro. No, it\u2019s meant to read pretty much anything.\n\nYou can read anything\n\nThe Boox Go Color 7 has its own reader app and its own store for buying e-books, and by most accounts, it functions pretty well. I can\u2019t tell you from firsthand experience because, well, I didn\u2019t use it very much. And that\u2019s because I had access to the Google Play Store.\n\nAccess to the Google Play Store is a big deal for any e-reader. Amazon\u2019s walled garden means the Kindle is sleek and fast \u2014 but walls are still walls. The Go Color 7 has no such barriers.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you have e-books spread all over the place. You\u2019ve bought e-books from Amazon, there\u2019s that Humble Bundle you bought, that free e-book on Google Play Books \u2014 not to mention your dalliance with Barnes & Noble, back from your very first Nook e-reader.\n\nSo unless you\u2019re way more loyal to a single brand than me, you\u2019ve probably got a treasure trove of e-books spread around. I\u2019m an old hand at this now, so I know you can send books to the Amazon Kindle \u2014 but doing so can be a bit of a pain. Not so on the Go Color 7. Install the app, sign in, and you\u2019re ready to go.\n\nI\u2019ve been merrily book-hopping between apps for the better part of the last few weeks, and it has been delightful. No longer tethered to Amazon, I\u2019m free to explore where I want.\n\nThis extends over to other apps as well. I\u2019m a longtime manga reader, and the Go Color 7 is perfect for reading in the Shonen Jump app. I\u2019m not much of a comic guy, but I loaded a few up through the Kindle app, and they look great. The limitations of the e-ink display mean it\u2019s not as clear or crisp as it might be on my phone, but there\u2019s a beauty to the slightly washed-out colors and delicate grain. It\u2019s more like reading an actual comic than any other digital method, and that means I actually prefer it.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but that\u2019s why I love it\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, there are two types of smart devices; polished and refined ones, and buggy but charismatic ones. In Star Wars terms \u2014 because I can\u2019t do anything without relating it back to Star Wars \u2014 it\u2019s the difference between an Imperial Star Destroyer and the Millennium Falcon.\n\nThe Amazon Kindle is an Imperial Star Destroyer. It\u2019s backed by a massive organization, it\u2019s sleek and no-nonsense, and it\u2019s incredibly good at what it does. That\u2019s a good thing, obviously, but one Star Destroyer is much like another, and that also applies to Kindles. My Kindle Paperwhite is fantastic, but it\u2019s very much a plastic slab with no personality. I\u2019ve had it for years, but I\u2019m not particularly attached to it because it lacks charisma.\n\nBut the Boox Go Color 7 has charisma. It has it in spades \u2014 and it\u2019s because it\u2019s flawed.\n\nThat sounds strange, but I promise you it makes sense. Consider my example from earlier. What is it you remember most about the Millennium Falcon? It\u2019s certainly not that it worked flawlessly. No, it\u2019s that it had problems. The hyperdrive was peerlessly fast, but it was wonky. Sometimes she needed a bonk on the control panel to start up, but when she got going, she could outfly any Imperial bucket.\n\nThe Falcon\u2019s character was strong \u2014 so strong that I slipped into calling it a \u201cshe\u201d without thinking. And that\u2019s because charisma can be created by lovable flaws. Because the Kindle is so good, it doesn\u2019t leave much of an impression. It just works, to borrow a phrase, and that\u2019s sometimes a detriment.\n\nThe Boox Go Color 7 is an incredibly capable machine. But it has more than its share of problems. It\u2019s prone to ghosting. A lot of ghosting; certainly more than you\u2019re used to if you\u2019ve used Kindles. You can fine-tune how the display works to lessen this, but it never really fully goes away. The screen rotation also isn\u2019t great, and the color is a little washed-out. While it has a built-in speaker, it\u2019s difficult to use apps like Audible, because the speaker won\u2019t continue playing with the screen off. You can keep the screen open, but eventually it\u2019ll time out and playback will stop.\n\nIt\u2019s flawed in a way that I\u2019ve never found a Kindle to be, but I find myself loving it all the same. So, while those flaws are definitely present, they aren\u2019t bad enough to ruin the device. Instead, they bring my attention back to the Boox Go Color 7 in a way that\u2019s slowly increased my affection for it. It\u2019s an odd thing to admit, but I actually like the e-reader because it isn\u2019t as flawless as a Kindle.\n\nI might not feel this way if it only offered as much as a Kindle did \u2014 but because it offers way more than Amazon\u2019s e-reader ever has, I love it despite its flaws. In the same way Han Solo felt a connection to the Millennium Falcon because of the struggles they\u2019d been through together, I feel a stronger connection to this e-reader.\n\nIs the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 a Kindle killer?\n\nIt\u2019s time for the big question: Should the Boox Go Color 7 replace your Kindle? Well, that\u2019s a complicated question. The basic Kindle has a big edge in pricing, and I\u2019m not about to argue that anyone looking to buy a $100 Kindle should instead spend almost three-times that amount for the Go Color 7. The same applies to the Kindle Paperwhite, which also includes waterproofing for a much lower price.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what I came here to argue; at the price of $250, the Go Color 7 is a full $30 cheaper than the Kindle Colorsoft. And sure, it doesn\u2019t have waterproofing, and it doesn\u2019t have the casual slickness of Amazon\u2019s software \u2014 but it has everything else, and it\u2019s a darn good e-reader in its own right. Access to the Google Play Store is a major game changer, as it means the Go Color 7 is a universal e-reader in a way the Kindle simply isn\u2019t. If you only own e-books through Amazon, and don\u2019t read comics or manga through their own apps, then the Kindle Colorsoft is definitely still a good option.\n\nBut at $30 less, with access to all the e-reading apps you could ever need, and its own store and reader besides, the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 is a hard prospect to pass up. Even if you do have to live with some bugs, it\u2019s simply one of the best value propositions around."
