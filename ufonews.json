Fourth St.\n\nThese vehicles, which include things such as a replica of the 1960s Batmobile, a Delorean with a flux capacitor and even an \"invisible\" Boatmobile from the animated series \"Spongebob Squarepants,\" showcase a look at the most odd, weird and quirky things someone might see driving down the street.\n\n'Oddities' in Salina: A fun exhibition to curate\n\nMatthew Miller-Wells, the director of education for The Garage who worked on getting vehicles this exhibition, said it has been one of the more fun things to curate.\n\n\"There's just some weird, obscure stuff here,\" Miller-Wells said.\n\nIt's not only the 1995 \"ChewBaru,\" a Subaru Boxer covered with dental tools, dentures, toothbrushes and more, that excites Miller-Wells, but the rare vehicles that have gone out of style.\n\n\"The (K-Car) '83 LeBaron that's over there excites me just as much as like the (floating) Amphicar, because you just don't see those anymore,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the words that have already been used to describe this show, like odd and weird, he said one word is going to stick with him as people visit.\n\n\"I think 'polarizing' could absolutely be one,\" he said. \"There are cars here that people will love to see and ones that people will be really confused and don't like.\n\n\"That's the fun of it, is that what is strange is subjective. Someone may think it makes no sense that a K-Car is in here, because they remember a time when they were everywhere.\"\n\nThe Garage, an automotive museum in downtown Salina, opened its latest exhibition this week: \"Oddities.\" The exhibition, which features such vehicles as the Batmobile, a UFO and an amphibious car, will be on display through the end of the year.\n\nWhen is 'Oddities' on display in Salina? How much is admission?\n\n\"Oddities\" is now open at The Garage for people to come and see.\n\nDaily general admission for the museum is $15, with discounts for seniors, students and military being $12.\n\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nMemberships are also available beginning at $45 a year, with unlimited admission to the museum and other benefits included.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Salina Journal: Salina automobile museum's newest exhibit includes the weird and odd"

Everywhere you turn, there\u2019s a surreal riot of outrageous outfits, from over-the-top Beetlejuice-style attire to Ed Wood-ish 1950s dresses to paste jewelry in a rainbow of Pee-Wee tints.\n\nIn fact, a lot of the costumes found in Burton\u2019s movies were sourced from these very racks, along with outfits appearing in hundreds of other films. Forrest Gump, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Austin Powers, The Big Lewbowski, Don\u2019t Worry Darling \u2014 they all featured clothing that was pulled from Palace Costume, known among Hollywood stylists as \u201cthe Louvre of vintage.\u201d\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nOwner Melody Barnett in the 1970s with her cat Star Baby.\n\n\u201cIt started 60 years ago,\u201d says owner Melody Barnett, as she shuffles through room after room filled with fashion history. \u201cI found a box of Victorian clothes at a swap meet and became a rabid collector.\u201d Barnett opened one of L.A.\u2019s earliest vintage shops during the late 1960s \u2014 the storied Crystal Palace on Melrose \u2014 then, in 1976, purchased the first of four buildings on Fairfax Avenue that eventually would become her sprawling sartorial empire.\n\nOnly costume designers and stylists are normally permitted entry to Palace Costume, and the clothes and accessories on display are solely available for rent by professionals. Fortunately, though, there\u2019s finally a way the rest of us can glimpse inside Barnett\u2019s magic castle: a just-published book, Palace Costume: Inside Hollywood\u2019s Best Kept Fashion Secret, written and photographed by Mimi Haddon. \u201cPalace Costume is a living, breathing entity,\u201d says Haddon, who spent the better part of a decade working on the tome. \u201cIt\u2019s a pulsating ode to the art of storytelling through attire.\u201d\n\nPalace Costume: Inside Hollywood\u2019s Best Kept Fashion Secret\n\nMore like an epic saga than an ode. \u201cThis floor is turn-of-the-century clothes,\u201d Barnett says as she continues her tour through Palace\u2019s jam-packed halls, where crates of shoes line the walls, purses dangle everywhere, all grouped by style, then period. \u201cHere\u2019s the evening gown room, the sports room, the stylists\u2019 room, the children\u2019s floor, the denim floor \u2014 denim changes every year!\u201d she goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, but I actually know where everything is.\u201d\n\nMore shoes. \u201cSome are tiny. Bette Midler had the smallest foot. She\u2019s the only one who could wear them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll the clothing at Palace Costume is arranged by period.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palace houses some 500,000 items, including this 1920s dress. Says Barnett, \u201cYou could wear it today; it never goes out of style.\u201d\n\nNotes Barnett, \u201cWhen I owned the Crystal Palace vintage store in the early \u201970s, Diana Ross would come in all the time for her favorite, Bakelite bracelets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 1970s is my favorite period,\u201d Barnett says of these silver platform shoes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve collected jewelry from India, Mexico, Bali, South America \u2014 I love it all,\u201d she says.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Sept. 11 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

Officials attributed the higher CPI to an increase in food prices due to bad weather.\n\nBut the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by just 0.3 per cent in August, the slowest in over three years"

        "article_content": "We recently published a list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Science Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC) stands against the other not-tech AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been desperately searching for a safer way to play the AI boom that has swept the US stock market over the past few months. Prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs recently released an investor note detailing which sectors of the economy would benefit from the AI craze, replacing obvious bull cases in the technology domain by thoughtful insights on the long-term impact of AI on utilities, industrials, retail, and healthcare. According to analysts at Goldman, AI tools looked set to help companies outside of the technology sector improve productivity and reduce labor costs. The investment titan detailed the insatiable appetite for AI, evidenced by NVIDIA becoming one of the valuable firms in the world over the past year, and noted that the market was yet to reward companies that have downstream AI exposure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nDavid Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in the investor note that the AI boom was likely to play out in four key phases. The first phase, per the analyst, had been focused on NVIDIA, the chipmaker that is at the forefront of AI data center build. Kostin detailed that the second phase was likely to be about companies building AI infrastructure. Some examples of this include semiconductor, data center, networking, cloud, and security industries, as well as utilities. So far this year, the returns of stocks working in these industries have dwarfed the returns of the benchmark indexes. The third phase, continued the analyst, would be about companies able to put AI in their products and boost sales in the process. Kostin cautioned that these firms had lost ground against AI stocks in recent months.\n\nThe analyst claimed that firms falling in the fourth phase of the AI boom, ones who would enjoy productivity gains after adopting AI, had been ignored by the majority of the market so far. Kostin maintained that it was unclear when these downstream AI stocks, some of which are discussed in detail below, would rally and expand their earnings multiples, but stressed that this would happen eventually. The industrial sector highlights the Goldman theory in action. Since the start of 2023, industrial stocks have jumped close to 30% in value. Of these, the firms that are directly exposed to AI verticals have more than doubled in value. In the fourth quarter of 2023, over 30% of industrial firms mentioned AI in their earnings reports, up from just 10% in the same period the preceding year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected non-tech AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA DOD assistant presenting a portfolio of products and solutions from the company, highlighting its expertise in the IT sector.\n\nScience Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\n\nScience Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC) provides technical, engineering, and enterprise information technology (IT) services primarily in the United States. The company recently posted earnings for the second quarter of 2024, reporting earnings per share of $2.05, beating market expectations by $0.20. The revenue over the period was $1.8 billion, up more than 2% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating analyst expectations by $30 million. The IT firm increased adjusted diluted EPS fiscal year 2025 guidance to $8.10 \u2013 $8.30, and reaffirmed all other financial guidance for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nScience Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC) regularly does business with the US Army, specially in the IT domain. Recent news coming out from defense circles indicates that the US Army is planning to ask contractors to assist with the integration of artificial intelligence technology into its operations. As one of the biggest business partners of the US army, SAIC is in pole position to take advantage of such AI-related business contracts.\n\nOverall SAIC ranks 33rd on our list of not-tech AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of SAIC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SAIC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "source": "The Verge",
        "article_content": "Kudos to Plaud for one thing: in a year otherwise marred by high-profile failures and oh so much AI vaporware, it made an AI gadget that does exactly what it claims to do and does it pretty well. The gadget is called the NotePin, and it\u2019s a $169, pill-shaped voice recorder that can transcribe, summarize, and pull important information out of your audio. This is something current AI systems can actually do well! There\u2019s good and mature tech at every step along the pipeline here, from tiny microphones to speech-to-text transcription to natural-language processing and AI summarization. The NotePin does it well.\n\nBut the reason the NotePin works is also the reason I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying one. AI voice recording is great and handy and being commoditized at an absolutely blistering pace. With iOS 18 or macOS Sequoia, you get transcriptions and summarization built into the Voice Memos app. Google\u2019s Pixel Recorder app is terrific and is built into both the Pixel phones and the Pixel Watch. You can also get similar features from lots of apps. Do you need a dedicated voice recorder?\n\nThis is, of course, the eternal question about AI assistants as a whole. Are they a feature of your existing devices or a gadget category unto themselves? Plaud\u2019s argument for dedicated hardware is about the same as all the other AI startups: that ease of use is everything. The NotePin\u2019s accessories are core to its appeal: there\u2019s a braided lanyard so you can wear it around your neck, a wristband so you can wear it Fitbit-style on your arm, and a clip so you can put it almost anywhere else.\n\nPlaud\u2019s argument for dedicated hardware is about the same as all the other AI startups: that ease of use is everything\n\nIn my time testing the NotePin, I\u2019ve mostly had it around my neck, and I\u2019ve used it to note reminders while driving, ramble long ideas to myself while walking the dog, and summarize calls and conversations. It\u2019s certainly handy being able to just reach down, press the NotePin until it vibrates to indicate it\u2019s recording, and then yammer away at nothing while my necklace dutifully listens. Once, when I was particularly enjoying a podcast, I just played the whole thing on speaker so the NotePin would transcribe and summarize it. The NotePin is easier to access than my phone in my pocket, and it\u2019s definitely simpler than holding my wrist in front of my mouth for minutes at a time while shouting into my watch. The form factor definitely matters.\n\nThe NotePin\u2019s mic is perfectly fine: the audio it records never sounds amazing, but in every realistic scenario I tried, it was good enough for solid transcription. Plaud estimates the device\u2019s battery lasts for about 18 hours of recording or 30 days of standby time, and in my testing, I\u2019ve done about four hours of recording over about 10 days, and the battery just hit \u201cLow.\u201d The NotePin charges on a tiny pad, which I\u2019m confident I\u2019m going to lose very soon, and I wish it was just a simple USB-C plug. But look: the thing works. It does what it says on the tin.\n\nPlaud\u2019s transcriptions and summaries are mostly pretty good! But that\u2019s just not enough.

Once you\u2019ve made some recordings with the NotePin, you import them into the Plaud app, which is relatively quick and simple. But then you have to go into each recording and manually tell the app to transcribe it, pick a \u201ctemplate\u201d you want to use for how it\u2019s summarized, and then come back a few minutes later to see what it came up with. (You get 300 monthly minutes of transcriptions and basic templates for free, or for $80 a year, you get 1,200 and more templates and features.) That\u2019s too much busy work. Plus, how much effort am I really saving if I have to pull out my phone \u2014 twice! \u2014 anyway?\n\nThe transcriptions are good, and the summaries are helpful, and so far, I haven\u2019t had any huge mistakes or hallucinations. But once they\u2019re done, they just live in reverse-chronological order in the Plaud app. The app correctly noted that one of my recordings was a reminder to buy retinol; it didn\u2019t remind me of anything. It just made the title \u201cReminder to buy retinol.\u201d When I wandered my kitchen speaking a grocery list into the NotePin, the app accurately transcribed that list for me but just titled the note \u201cGrocery List with Various Food Items and Household Essentials.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not really the NotePin\u2019s fault that it can\u2019t do more than turn my nonsensical ramblings into text files. It\u2019s not Plaud\u2019s fault, either. It\u2019s just that what I really want \u2014 and what should really happen \u2014 is for it to take that grocery list and add it to the grocery list I already have on my phone. It should add that reminder to my to-do list. At the very least, the app should be able to combine my grocery list note with my other grocery list note, but it can\u2019t do that, either. Ultimately, no matter what you\u2019re recording, odds are you want to do something with it afterward, and Plaud simply can\u2019t do most of those things. Eventually, the Plaud app just began to feel like another inbox I needed to check.\n\nAll that is why your phone or smartwatch might be insurmountable foes in the AI assistant wars. They might be marginally less convenient \u2014 you have to pull it out of your pocket instead of just reaching down to your chest \u2014 but they\u2019re far more connected with the rest of your digital life. Building your whole world around a transcription app just doesn\u2019t make any sense."

        "article_content": "With technology playing an increasingly important role in our lives now, it comes as no shock that it is also changing the way we approach dating. We no longer rely on random encounters at coffee shops or friends playing matchmaker for us. Now, we are part of a society in which AI matchmaking and virtual connections are changing the way we seek romantic relationships.\n\nAI uses machine learning algorithms to constantly gather information about a user's preferences by analysing their interactions with the app. This may be as basic as the profiles they choose to match with or as detailed as studying the conversations they have and their reactions to various ways of communicating.\n\nFor example, if a person consistently interacts with profiles of individuals who like outdoor activities and value deep conversations, the AI will take note of these behaviours and begin recommending profiles that match these qualities. As the AI accumulates more data, it improves its ability to find matches that align with a user's preferences and personality over time.\n\nIn addition to the solid data, AI is also being trained to recognise emotional patterns in dialogues. Certain AI systems are developed to examine text conversations for the purpose of grasping the emotional aspects, communication patterns, and interaction levels among users. This enables the platform to anticipate the compatibility of two individuals by evaluating the alignment of their communication styles. This emotional intelligence is a major breakthrough in matchmaking, as it prioritises real-time interactions over static profile information when finding matches.\n\nPhoto: Collected / Nik / Unsplash\n\nCertain dating apps use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess the feelings conveyed by the words. The AI will make a mental note if the interaction is natural and both participants are enthusiastic and positive. However, if the communication seems awkward or one-sided, the system acknowledges the absence of a connection and refrains from recommending similar matches later on.\n\nAI-based matchmaking offers a major advantage by decreasing the sensation of \"dating fatigue.\" Numerous users of conventional dating apps often feel stressed by the constant swiping and empty conversations. AI reduces the uncertainty and improves the chances of users connecting with someone they truly resonate with by providing more accurate matches.\n\nSadia Alam, a 26-year-old corporate employee, personally experienced this as she has been using dating apps for some time. \"In the past, I was always swiping and conversing with people I didn't genuinely connect with. However, the app now takes care of that aspect for me. I am finally connecting with people who understand me, and now, I feel like being on dating apps is not that bad actually\" shared Sadia.\n\nThanks to these improvements, dating apps could eventually provide users with an experience similar to the instinctive nature of human matchmaking, transforming online dating into a more personal and efficient process. With the improvement of artificial intelligence in predicting successful relationships, users can expect to come across more enduring and substantial connections developed online."

Here are the key moments of what's happened so far\n\n16th May: Giovanni Pernice sensationally quits Strictly Come Dancing after nine years on the show.\n\n17th May: Giovanni becomes the centre of an official investigation after three former partners \u2013 believed to be Amanda Abbington, Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh \u2013 make complaints to the BBC.\n\n16th June: Giovanni releases an official statement vowing to clear his name and denies any wrongdoing.\n\n8th July: Strictly confirms Aljaz Skorjanec will return to the series, replacing Giovanni, after initially quitting the show two years ago.\n\n10th July: Amanda Abbington launches fresh legal proceedings to get the rehearsal footage from her time with Giovanni, after allegedly he refused to release the videos.\n\n13th July: Graziano Di Prima is axed from Strictly for \"gross misconduct\" after footage of his treatment of Zara McDermott is brought to the attention of the BBC.\n\nGraziano quickly broke his silence, apologising for his behaviour in a statement and saying he \"deeply regrets it\", adding his \"intense passion and determination to win might have affected his training regime.\"\n\n15th July: Strictly bosses implement new duty of care protocols, including having a chaperone present throughout all rehearsals.\n\n16th July: Zara McDermott speaks out publicly for first time. She states while the production team were \"amazing to work with\", she found the rehearsal room \"completely different\", confirming there's footage of \"certain situations\".\n\n19th July: Anton Du Beke is put under the spotlight for his \"1970s attitude\" and treatment of female celeb stars, particularly after allegedly referring to 2009 partner Laila Rouass as a \"p***\" after getting a spray tan.\n\n21st July: Paralympian Will Bayley, who has limb condition arthrogryposis, revealed he was encouraged to leap from a table during a dance routine, despite fears. The stunt caused an injury that forced him to withdraw from the show.\n\n22nd July: MasterChef's Gregg Wallace admits he broke down in tears and got a nasty stress rash on his face during his time on Strictly in 2014.\n\n22nd July: Despite ongoing issues, the Strictly professional cast begin rehearsals for this year's series.\n\n23rd July: Celebrity agent Melanie Blake claims she was sexually assaulted by an unnamed pro dancer while backstage on the show, and claims she witnessed ageism, rudeness and a rough treatment to the point of injury.\n\n23rd July: Strictly is forced to beef up security after 'an intruder scales the wall of the rehearsal studio'.\n\n23rd July: BBC boss Tim Davie breaks his silence on the ongoing allegations against Strictly, saying he is 'deeply sorry', adding: \"Hundreds of people, be they pros, contestants or crew have been part of it and had a brilliant experience.\n\n\"At the same time if someone thinks there was something wrong or they want to talk about their experience then of course we want them to raise that with us. Be in no doubt we will take it seriously, listen and deal with it as appropriate.\"\n\n24th July: Strictly 2023 star Krishnan Guru-Murthy holds a bombshell interview with Amanda Abbington on Channel 4 news, where she claims she was bullied, with some of the 'humilation being of a sexual nature'.\n\n27th July: Laura Whitmore releases a statement regarding her Strictly experience, saying \"I thought my experience was specific to me but I\u2019ve since learned I was wrong\".\n\nShe adds she is not part of the official complaint, but has come forward to support Amanda with the BBC, alongside others.\n\n28th July: Laila Rouass speaks out against the accusations regarding Anton Du Beke, saying she \"never felt pressured\" by him and \"personally insisted on six to seven hours training a day\".\n\n10th August: Graziano breaks his silence on his Strictly axe, saying \"these vile, false allegations have ruined my life.\"\n\nHe also told of the \"shocking\" end to his friendship with Zara McDermott.\n\nWe also revealed that Amanda Abbington was also quizzed for a second time as Strictly execs recruited 15 new staff to monitor rehearsals.\n\n11th August: Just as the investigation was expected to conclude, Amanda made a dramatic intervention. Giovanni was on the brink of being cleared until Amanda handed in more text messages.\n\n24th August: Graziano Di Prima called in top lawyers to sue the BBC and to try to clear his name. He recruited big hitters Whitestone Chambers to fight his corner.\n\nA source said: \"They\u2019ve also looked at his BBC contract and believe there are grounds to sue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC also delayed releasing the findings of the probe into Giovanni Pernice. The Sun revealed that the results of the three-month investigation were unlikely to be announced in August."

        "article_content": "Jupiter\u2019s moon Io, the most geologically active spot in the solar system, has gained a dramatic new volcanic feature that has left scientists astounded by its scale and complexity.\n\nKnown for its constant volcanic eruptions, Io continues to challenge our understanding of planetary geology with this latest discovery.\n\nJunoCam finds active volcano on Io\n\nRecent high-resolution images captured by the JunoCam instrument on NASA\u2019s Juno mission reveal a newly formed volcano.\n\nIt is complete with multiple expansive lava flows and surrounding volcanic deposits, spanning an area of approximately 112 by 112 miles \u2014 an impressive addition to Io\u2019s volatile surface.\n\nThis discovery not only marks the first close-up examination of Io\u2019s surface in over 25 years, but also adds to the ever-evolving story of this dynamic moon.\n\nJunoCam wasn\u2019t meant to be a scientific tool, but it\u2019s really become a standout feature of the Juno mission.\n\nOriginally designed to engage the public, JunoCam takes amazing pictures of Jupiter\u2019s swirling clouds, wild storms, and polar regions as the Juno spacecraft zooms close to the planet during its orbits.\n\nThe findings were presented this week at the Europlanet Science Congress (EPSC) in Berlin, offering exciting new insights into Io\u2019s relentless volcanic activity.\n\nMany changes discovered on Io\n\nThe newly spotted volcano is situated just south of Io\u2019s equator in a region previously thought to be inactive.\n\nWhile Io is well known for its intense volcanic activity, with hundreds of active volcanoes dotting its surface, images captured during NASA\u2019s Galileo mission in 1997 revealed no evidence of volcanic structures in this particular area.\n\nA comparison of JunoCam data from February 2024 with imagery from the Galileo mission of the same area in November 1997 (greyscale insert) reveals a new volcanic feature on the surface of Jupiter\u2019s moon, Io. Credit: NASA/ESA/Europlanet\n\nInstead, the region appeared as a smooth, featureless landscape, devoid of any signs of the violent geological processes that now define it.\n\nMichael Ravine is the advanced projects manager at Malin Space Science Systems, Inc., the team responsible for designing and operating JunoCam for the NASA Juno Project.\n\n\u201cOur recent JunoCam images show many changes on Io, including this large, complicated volcanic feature that appears to have formed from nothing since 1997,\u201d said Ravine.\n\nDistinct characteristics of Io\u2019s new volcano\n\nThe eastern side of the volcano is marked by a diffuse red stain, the result of sulfur vented by the volcano and later settling back onto the surface.\n\nOn the western side, two dark lava flows stretch across the moon\u2019s landscape, each extending about 62 miles.\n\nAt the edges of the lava flows, intense heat has vaporized frozen surface material, creating two distinct grey circles where the lava has pooled.\n\nJunoCam\u2019s unparalleled view of Io\n\nJunoCam captured the best images of this feature on February 3, 2024, from a distance of 2,530 kilometers.\n\nThe image, taken in low light conditions with illumination provided solely by reflections from Jupiter, offers an unparalleled view of Io\u2019s nightside. The new volcanic feature lies just east of a previously known volcano, Kanehekili.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of Galileo spacecraft imagery in November 1997 (left) with JunoCam data of the same area from February 2024 (right), reveals a new volcanic feature on the surface of Jupiter\u2019s moon, Io. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS.\n\nThe observations are part of three recent flybys of Io in 2023 and 2024, during which JunoCam gathered close-up images of nine volcanic plumes.\n\nThe camera also documented new lava flows and surface changes, highlighting the ongoing geological transformations on Jupiter\u2019s moon.\n\nUnderstanding the Juno Mission\n\nNASA kicked off the Juno mission in 2011 with the exciting goal of uncovering the mysteries of Jupiter and its moons, the largest and most intriguing planet in our Solar System.\n\nAfter a five-year journey, Juno reached Jupiter in July 2016, settling into a polar orbit that allows it to get up close to the planet\u2019s cloud tops every 53 days.\n\nWith a range of scientific tools onboard, Juno is all about exploring Jupiter\u2019s unique atmosphere, magnetic field, and gravitational dynamics, helping us understand how this gas giant came to be.\n\nSince arriving, Juno has delivered a treasure trove of data that has completely changed how we see Jupiter.\n\nThe mission has revealed massive, swirling cyclones at the planet\u2019s poles, mapped out its complex magnetic and gravitational fields, and hinted that Jupiter\u2019s core might be larger and more spread out than we thought.\n\nIt\u2019s also shed light on the complexities of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, filled with ammonia-rich upwellings and broad bands that reach deep into the planet.\n\nJunoCam\u2019s data is publicly accessible\n\nInterestingly, JunoCam\u2019s data is made available to the public almost immediately after being received on Earth. This means that anyone with an interest in space exploration can dive into the mission\u2019s findings.\n\nThe public is encouraged to access this data through the mission\u2019s website and create their own images of Jupiter and its moons, promoting a collaborative spirit that allows space enthusiasts to participate in the discovery process.\n\n\u201cJunoCam images are created by people from all walks of life, providing a way for anyone to join our science team and share in the excitement of space exploration,\u201d said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of NASA\u2019s Juno mission at Southwest Research Institute.\n\nScientific significance of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io\n\nOngoing observations of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io, particularly its volcanic activity, provide valuable insights into the internal processes of one of the most geologically active celestial bodies in the solar system.\n\nIo\u2019s extreme volcanic behavior, driven by tidal forces from Jupiter\u2019s gravity, helps scientists better understand how such forces shape the geology of moons and planets.\n\nThe new volcano on Io also offers clues about the moon\u2019s evolution and its unique volcanic landscape. Continued monitoring of Io will further reveal how its surface is constantly being reshaped by its fiery interior.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

They are each surrounded by an accretion disk of hot gas with material being ejected along their spin axes. Confined by powerful magnetic fields, the jets blaze across space at nearly the speed of light as devastating beams of energy. Credit: NASA, ESA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI).\n\nA new study has uncovered an astonishing pair: two supermassive black holes, separated by a mere 100 parsecs (or 326 light years). In the grand scheme of space, this is quite close. The discovery was made in galaxy MCG-03-34-64, 800 million light years away. And the finding is surprising because of how close the two black holes are. Most dual black holes are either much farther apart or challenging to detect because they\u2019re often obscured by dust and gas in late-stage mergers.\n\n\u201cWe were not expecting to see something like this,\u201d said Anna Trindade Falc\u00e3o of the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and lead author of the paper published in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThis finding is among the closest dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed to date. Using an impressive array of tools, including the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Very Large Array (VLA), researchers not only confirmed the presence of these two black holes but were also able to study their interactions and dynamics in unprecedented detail.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this galaxy?\n\nMCG-03-34-64 is a gas-rich, infrared-luminous galaxy, sitting about 78 million light-years away, identified as one of the most intense X-ray sources in the local universe. This \u201clocal universe\u201d is the group of galaxies in \u201cour\u201d corner of the universe, so to speak. This galaxy was already interesting for researchers due to its mysterious, heavily absorbed X-ray spectrum, indicating thick layers of material surrounding its central black hole. However, it was during routine observations with Hubble that the possibility of not just one, but two active nuclei came to light.\n\n\u201cThis view is not a common occurrence in the nearby universe and told us there\u2019s something else going on inside the galaxy,\u201d said Falc\u00e3o.\n\nA Hubble Space Telescope visible-light image of the galaxy MCG-03-34-064. Hubble\u2019s view reveals three distinct bright spots embedded in a white ellipse at the galaxy\u2019s center (expanded in an inset image at upper right). Two of these bright spots are the source of strong X-ray emission, a telltale sign that they are supermassive black holes. Their separation is about 300 light-years. The third spot is a blob of bright gas. The blue streak at the lower-right may be a jet fired from one of the black holes. The black hole pair is a result of a merger between two galaxies that will eventually collide. Credit: NASA, ESA, Anna Trindade Falc\u00e3o (CfA).\n\nMost large galaxies host supermassive black holes at their centers, which are crucial to their evolution. These black holes, millions to billions of times more massive than the Sun, grow by drawing in gas and dust. So, their growth is tied to the galaxy\u2019s development, influencing star formation. Meanwhile, they emit powerful energy as active galactic nuclei (AGN).\n\nIn the case of MCG-03-34-64, the discovery of two supermassive black holes suggests a galactic merger. Each galaxy likely brought its own black hole. As the galaxies merge, their black holes eventually combine, impacting the galaxy\u2019s future. This dual system highlights how black hole mergers play a key role in the growth and evolution of galaxies.\n\nChasing Gravitational Waves\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of dual AGN systems is also key for gravitational wave astronomy. The eventual merger of these black holes will send ripples through spacetime, detectable by advanced instruments like pulsar timing arrays. These signals could unlock new insights into the physics of black holes and the fabric of the universe itself.\n\nThis type of binary AGN structure was much more common in the early universe when galaxy mergers were more frequent \u2014 or so we think. This discovery provides a unique close-up example to study. Previously, we identified dual AGNs with separations of a few kiloparsecs. But systems with sub-kiloparsec separations remained elusive. According to the study, the discovery of a candidate system with only 100 parsecs of separation is especially significant because it sets a new benchmark for such observations.\n\nThe two supermassive black holes are now no longer at the cores of their respective host galaxies. Their proximity draws them to one another, ultimately leading into a merger. Well, perhaps in around 100 million years. If this does happen, it will rattle the very fabric of space, sending forth gravitational waves.\n\nThe National Science Foundation\u2019s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected gravitational waves from smaller black holes in the past. But the longer wavelengths resulting from a supermassive black hole merger are beyond LIGO\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThankfully, researchers are already working on the next-generation gravitational wave detector, called the LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). The mission will consist of three detectors in space, separated by millions of miles, to capture these longer wavelength gravitational waves from deep space. ESA (European Space Agency) will be leading the mission, partnering with NASA and other participating institutions, with a planned launch in the mid-2030s.\n\nJournal Reference: Anna Trindade Falc\u00e3o et al, Resolving a Candidate Dual Active Galactic Nucleus with \u223c100 pc Separation in MCG-03-34-64, The Astrophysical Journal (2024).

        "article_content": "Sunday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration honoring the contributions and histories of Americans with roots in countries including Mexico, Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe observance spans two months honoring a long-established community whose influence is felt throughout the country.\n\n\u201cIt celebrates a vast community of Americans who have made invaluable contributions to the United States for over 300 years,\u201d the executive director of the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico Margie Huerta said. \u201cHispanic and Latinx people are making important contributions to American arts, culture and humanities, and all aspects of society, every single day.\u201d\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWho started Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nFrom newly arrived immigrants to native communities that have called these lands home for centuries, the community has gained considerable cultural and political clout since the occasion began in 1968 as a weeklong commemoration under President Lyndon Johnson. The legislation was sponsored by California Rep. Edward Roybal of Los Angeles, an Albuquerque native whose family moved to California when he was 6.\n\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill sponsored by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon expanding National Hispanic Heritage Week to 30 days. Reagan used the moment to praise Hispanics and their cultural pillars of church and school, but most of all to extol the virtues of \"familia.\"\n\n\u201cAs the great poet Octavio Paz has said: \u2018In Hispanic morals, the true protagonist is the family,\u2019\u201d Reagan said in his address. \"I fear that too often, in the mad rush of modern American life, some people have not learned the great lesson of our Hispanic heritage: the lesson of family and home and church and community.\u201d\n\nWhen is Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nHispanic Heritage Month is between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15.\n\nThe month\u2019s starting date is significant because it\u2019s the independence day for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Mexico, Chile and Belize mark their celebrations on Sept. 16, Sept. 18 and Sept. 21, respectively.\n\nStarting in the middle of the month also encompasses, on the celebration\u2019s latter end, Oct. 12. Known as Columbus Day in the United States, the day is referred to in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries as Di\u0301a de la Raza, honoring the countries and peoples conquered by Spain and other European nations.\n\nHow is Hispanic Heritage Month celebrated?\n\nGabriela Baeza Ventura, a professor of Spanish at the University of Houston, previously told USA TODAY that Hispanic Heritage Month pays respect to a population with deep roots in the United States and a wide range of ancestral origins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful and important opportunity for the general public to visualize the contributions and presence of a community that has been in this territory since before the U.S. was formed as a nation,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that encompasses so many different nations, so many registers of Spanish and so many experiences.\u201d\n\nThough many celebrations revolve around fiestas, Mexican or Latin American food and popular images of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Day of the Dead, Ventura said it\u2019s time to commemorate other notable figures, both historical and those in our midst.\n\nShe cited Jovida Idar, an early 20th-century Mexican American journalist and activist from Laredo, Texas, whose image will be minted as part of the American Women Quarters Program, as well as Colombia-born Lina Hidalgo, who at age 27 became the first woman \u2013 and first Latina \u2013 elected as county judge in Texas\u2019 Harris County in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing other characters come to life,\u201d Ventura said."

        "article_content": "Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes \u2014 always a decade away! \u2014 to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.\n\nThe technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.\n\nThe bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what\u2019s known as scientific breakeven, and while it\u2019s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.\n\nFounders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Fusion startups have raised $7.1 billion to date, according to the Fusion Industry Association, with the majority of it going to a handful of companies.\n\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems\n\nWith a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls \u201ccommercially relevant\u201d levels.\n\nSparc\u2019s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.\n\nBacked by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in the early 2030s.\n\nGeneral Fusion\n\nNow in its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The company, based in Richmond, British Columbia, was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF).\n\nIn General Fusion\u2019s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.\n\nThe company is currently building its first demonstration plant, LM26, which it hopes will hit scientific breakeven by 2026. Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.\n\nHelion\n\nOf all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.\n\nHelion uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma\u2019s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor\u2019s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.\n\nBased in Everett, Washington, Helion has raised $607.64 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel\u2019s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.\n\nTAE\n\nFounded in 1998, TAE (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: After the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.\n\nTAE has raised $1.32 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Alphabet, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Venrock.\n\nZap Energy\n\nZap Energy isn\u2019t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.\n\nLike Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel."

I play my games alone, with a little music turned on in the background and plenty of volume to get me immersed. So, devices like the wildly popular Elgato Stream Deck never appealed to me.\n\nI could see the utility of having dedicated buttons for productivity purposes, but I couldn\u2019t justify actually spending money on a device. But then Cooler Master\u2019s Stream Deck competitor, the MasterHub, showed up on my doorstep.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe modular desktop control panel is squarely targeting the Stream Deck, but Cooler Master has a unique approach on a desktop control center. It\u2019s fully modular, allowing you to mix, match, and swap out different components instantly to make a command center uniquely suited to you. The MasterHub won\u2019t get me started on streaming, but it quickly became second nature for accessing some of my most frequent settings, files, and applications.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nWhat you make of it\n\nThe MasterHub is fully modular. The device itself is just a plastic base with a slew of gold-plated pins, and you add modules on top that secure themselves magnetically. That allows you not only to choose what modules you want on your MasterHub but also how they\u2019re laid out. I wrote off that second point when I saw the MasterHub earlier this year, but it makes a huge difference.\n\nI used the large dial module with an IPS display in the bottom-left corner of the device, and given that the MasterHub is set up on the right side of my desk, it\u2019s the closest control to my hands. If I were streaming, however, I might put the 15-key IPS display module closer to my hand, or if I was using Photoshop controls, I might use the precision fader module.\n\nThere are various different versions of the Stream Deck, but the MasterHub\u2019s modular approach is truly something special. You have to adapt your workflow to one of the Stream Deck\u2019s layouts, and although Elgato makes that easy to do, it\u2019s still a transition. The MasterHub adapts to your workflow. You set up the modules you want in the layout you want, and you can even double-up on modules if you need more controls of a specific type.\n\nYou can change the layout at any time, too. Cooler Master has done a great job of making the MasterHub feel responsive to changes. While writing this article, I swapped every module I had set up to go from a horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation, and everything populated to the correct orientation with my correct settings within seconds. You can store multiple profiles through the MasterHub software (more on that next), so it\u2019s not out of the question to completely change the layout for different purposes.\n\nI\u2019ve touched on a few of the modules here, but overall, Cooler Master has five modules for the MasterHub now. There\u2019s the large dial with an IPS display and the 15-key IPS display module, but Cooler Master also offers a module with dual scroller wheels, a module with three knobs, and a module with five mini faders. That\u2019s a solid starting lineup, but I suspect Cooler Master will design and release more modules over time. When I visited the company\u2019s headquarters earlier this year, for example, it showed off a dedicated display module that could slot into the MasterHub base.\n\nTactile response\n\nAlthough the Stream Deck and MasterHub are targeted at streaming, it\u2019s hard to overstate how nice it is having tactile knobs and buttons for digital controls. I can control my volume with a large knob, scroll webpages with a roller, and launch my frequent apps like Steam and Discord with a button. I even set up a couple of hotkeys I use commonly as buttons, including turning on HDR and opening the volume mixer in Windows.\n\nAll of this comes together with the MasterHub software, which is easy to use but a bit barebones at the moment. You\u2019ll find a list of commands on the right side, which you can filter by selecting a knob or button. Once you find the setting you want, you drag it over to the knob or button you want to assign it to. If it\u2019s a button, you can use one of several icons Cooler Master includes or upload your own, as well as rename the assignment.\n\nThe most powerful module is undoubtedly the 15-key IPS display, where all of the actions in MasterHub are available. There are dozens of settings for your system and getting around your PC, from launching websites or applications to triggering hotkeys to adjusting media. MasterHub has a multitasking option, as well, allowing you to trigger a series of actions with a single button press. And, if 15 keys isn\u2019t enough for you, you can store multiple pages and flip through them directly from the keypad.\n\nThere are a good amount of options for your system and MasterHub (as well as Cooler Master\u2019s MasterCTRL with a compatible cooler), but these types of control pads live and die by their integrations. And out of the gate, Cooler Master has a good suite of options available. For streamers, you have controls for both OBS Studio and Streamlabs. Both include options to start and stop streaming, transition between scenes, and control your various audio sources. There are definitely more options for OBS, though. You can control the virtual camera, apply a filter, and much more.\n\nOptions for Twitch are available, too, from triggering an ad to chat settings to making a clip. Cooler Master doesn\u2019t have controls for any other streaming platform, however. That\u2019s not going to be a big deal in most cases, but the Stream Deck has controls for just about every platform you could want.\n\nSomewhere the MasterHub has a leg up is Adobe apps, or at least Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Illustrator. You\u2019ll find controls for all of these apps in MasterHub, free of charge. The Stream Deck technically supports these apps \u2014 and even more Adobe apps \u2014 but you\u2019ll need to spend $15 for the hotkeys and icons for each if you don\u2019t want to set up the controls manually.\n\nAlthough Cooler Master has a solid number of options out of the gate, it needs a lot of work. There are so many tools that benefit from this type of control center, and Cooler Master doesn\u2019t have a system to integrate those tools yet.\n\nCooler Master needs to go further\n\nCooler Master could make the best Stream Deck alternative in the world, and it wouldn\u2019t matter. Elgato has had years to build up a large library of plugins from first- and third-party sources that you can download directly to the Stream Deck, and usually for free. Cooler Master doesn\u2019t have that yet. The company says it will launch a marketplace for plugins at some point, but it will really come down to community interest if that marketplace is worth investing in or not.\n\nThe other issue is price. The MasterHub kit is very expensive. You can pick up the basic streaming kit with faders, rollers, and the 15-key display for $299 on the MasterHub Kickstarter now, but it will be $399 when it officially launches. And if you want all of the modules, you\u2019ll spend $399 now or $549 when it officially launches. Meanwhile, the Stream Deck+ will run you $200, and you can get a basic Stream Deck for less than $150.\n\nThe MasterHub appeals to those who need a lot of controls, not just a few shortcuts. It offers some clear advantages over a regular Stream Deck, but it also comes in at a much higher price. Cooler Master has built a solid foundation, but I\u2019d hold off on investing in the ecosystem until we can see what the marketplace has to offer, as well as what Cooler Master plans to do with its modular system in the future."

        "article_content": "Last week, I was in Berlin with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold at the very start of my review period, and I wanted to write something about the camera ahead of it. I decided to do so by indulging in a photographic hobby of mine.\n\nWhen I travel, I like to take photos of cars, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was going to be my companion. It had better be up to the task, as other phones were waiting in the wings if it let me down.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCar-spotting in Berlin\n\nDespite the Pixel 9 Pro Fold having Pro in its name, it does not have the same camera as the Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 9. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5MP wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera for a 5x optical zoom. It\u2019s essentially the same as the Google Pixel Fold\u2019s camera setup, and on a technical level, it\u2019s not as impressive as the far less expensive (but much less foldy) Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nBut would it do what I wanted while in Berlin? I was in the city for the IFA 2024 technology trade show, and I stayed in close proximity to Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (or Ku\u2019damm for short), which is central, elegant, and packed with lovely places for coffee and food. It\u2019s also full of expensive designer stores, luxury watch brand boutiques, and all the cars accompanying those who shop there. Over the many years I\u2019ve stayed in this area, I\u2019ve always enjoyed some casual car-spotting, often to the chagrin of my colleagues.\n\nI\u2019m a car geek, so when I\u2019m in new places, I find it really enjoyable to spot cars I don\u2019t usually see at home. What makes Kurf\u00fcrstendamm enjoyable for me is the variety of cars you see cruising and parked up, ranging from supercars to modern classics in fantastic condition.\n\nA good car-spotting camera needs to take colorful, high-contrast, dynamic photos in all lighting conditions to highlight the metal. It really needs a telephoto camera, so you don\u2019t have to get right up close to the vehicle when taking a photo, keeping things more incognito. It also needs a robust editing suite and a big screen to make adjustments. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold should be a great choice, so how did it do?\n\nUsing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera\n\nOver the few days I was in Berlin, I took around 50 photos of different cars with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold \u2014 and I loved the results, regardless of whether I used the main, wide, 5x telephoto camera, or even the 2x non-optical zoom. I was consistently impressed with the speed of the camera, too, and although I didn\u2019t take many photos of cars on the move (more on that in a moment), I never missed a shot due to the camera or app being too slow.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I take photos of cars on the move? I had intended to try out Google\u2019s Action Pan mode, which adds a cool motion blur effect to moving objects, as I\u2019d enjoyed it on the Pixel 9 and Pixel 8. However, oddly, Action Pan is missing from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera app. Action Pan\u2019s sister mode, Long Exposure, is present though. There\u2019s no obvious technical reason why it\u2019s not included, and in this case, it was rather frustrating. Perhaps it\u2019ll turn up in a future software update.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes Maybach S680. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-AMG GT. Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz AMG G63. Wide-angle Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nWhat about the cars? It\u2019ll come as no surprise that two leading car brands dominate the Ku\u2019damm landscape: Mercedes Benz and Porsche. Porsches of all types are so prevalent that I stopped taking photos of 911s, as I\u2019d have spent most of my time capturing them if I hadn\u2019t done so.\n\nI didn\u2019t do the same with Mercedes as, despite seeing so many, the models were often highly unusual spots for me, as Ku\u2019dammers seem to love their high-performance Mercs. That said, on one day, the first five cars I considered photographing were all AMG GT models of various types, giving you an idea of how prevalent this particular car was in the area.\n\nThe cars and photos\n\nI didn\u2019t want to fixate on just supercars either, and I wanted to illustrate the variety of cars I saw, which I think speaks to the interesting car culture that I assume exists in Berlin and its surroundings. The convertible Mustang was a surprise, and although I didn\u2019t get photos as most were on the move when I saw them, the amount of Aston Martin and Jaguars, both new and old, illustrated that it wasn\u2019t solely about German cars either. Ferrari was notable in its absence, and the few I did see were easily outnumbered by Lamborghini and Bentley models. It was fantastic to see all these cars out and in use, particularly during the week.\n\nThe beautiful weather during my stay no doubt helped people bring out cars that may have otherwise been safely garaged, and it also helped out with my photos, as did the urban backdrop. I tried to incorporate Ku\u2019damm and its side streets into the photos, but there were times when a bit too much of it got in the way, and this is where the Pixel 9 Pro Fold became the ultimate companion for my car-spotting adventures on the move. For a start, opening the phone to view and then edit images on the large screen is amazing, and it simply can\u2019t be matched on a non-folding phone. Only editing on a laptop or tablet can compare, and I can carry neither in my pocket.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 6 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible.

Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz S Class. 2x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nOn the open screen I was able to make full use of Google Photos\u2019 Magic Editor mode, and wow, did it do some impressive things. My favorite is the wide-angle photo of the Mustang, which was interrupted by a street sign and some of the rental scooters that litter Berlin\u2019s streets when I took it.\n\nAmazingly, after a few careful swipes, Magic Editor took them all away without a trace. If I didn\u2019t point it out and show you the before image, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever realize. It also turned a photo I\u2019d have probably discarded into one I really like. I did the same with the background in the photo of the beautiful R129 SL, then removed the parked cars on either side of the white S Class, and was astonished by the clean, seamless result.\n\nNot a car-spotter?\n\nThis isn\u2019t our review of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or its camera, so all the photos you see here have been edited on the device using the tools found in Google Photos. Magic Editor has become incredibly adept at removing small distractions and re-creating backgrounds perfectly, and cleaning up the photos took just a few moments.\n\nBut I only wanted to edit the photos because they looked excellent to begin with, meaning I could tweak them to my taste rather than use the tools to try to reach an acceptable baseline. I\u2019ve managed to create a collection of photos I am really happy with that captures Berlin\u2019s obvious love of very powerful cars.\n\nWhen I came up with the idea of using car-spotting as the basis for my story on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold while in Berlin, it was with some trepidation. I take these photos for myself and fun, so I didn\u2019t want that to change. If the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a pain or didn\u2019t take the pictures I wanted, it would become an effort and effectively become work, with all the fun of car photography removed.\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen because the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a joy to hold and use. It\u2019s not annoyingly heavy, the software has been faultless, and I never wanted to reach for the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max I also had with me to take a photo. I enjoyed my occasional hobby of photographing cool cars I spot just as much, if not more than usual, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as my camera and Magic Editor at the ready.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a photo of a car and are wondering if all this is relevant to you, all the same principles and performance of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera and Google Photos apply to whatever you\u2019re photographing. I love the open screen when I want to see my photos after taking them, and the telephoto camera allows me to shoot my chosen subject in more visually exciting ways from a distance. The editing toolkit helped me easily create photos I wish had been possible in real life.\n\nRegardless of what you want to take photos of, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a great companion. My first few days with the phone and its camera have left me smitten, and it\u2019s looking like the start of a very positive review."
