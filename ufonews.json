        "article_content": "An Air Force base in Indiana has become the latest hotspot for mysterious UFOs after residents spotted swarms of fast-moving, glowing orbs in the skies.\n\nDozens of people in Kokomo, which sits just 13 miles south of Grissom Joint Air Reserve Base, reported seeing hovering flickering lights that vanished into thin air.\n\n'What is that,' shouted one local who filmed the lights. 'I think those are UFOs and I really don't feel comfortable going to sleep tonight.'\n\nThe uncanny sightings, most reported on October 7, echo recent UFO waves near military sites, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia where officials reported seeing 'flashing red, green, and white lights' that were 'moving at rapid speeds.'\n\nThe mysterious objects in Indiana, however, were shared by civilians online, where experts have weighed in to determine the source.\n\nSome suggested the lights were flares dropped from planes, possibly military craft \u2014 but one witness shared doppler weather radar evidence of a 'huge rectangle' UFO with a 'clearly defined vapor shock wave' seen the morning after, October 8.\n\nRed 'walking' swarms of UFOs - along with one fast, zig-zagging, gleaming white UFO - have terrified and confused residents of Kokomo, Indiana this October\n\nNo explanation has been publicly provided by US Air Force personnel for the UFOs, which appeared as both reddish-orange orbs that hovered in the sky as well as one white orb that zig-zagged in a fast maneuver.\n\n'I don't understand what those are,' Christina Sharp said in a TikTok as young children nearby were heard marveling at the glowing reddish-orange lights.\n\nOne anonymous local submitted a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) on October 8 of what may have been a related event.\n\nThe person stated that a brief incursion on doppler weather radar showed what looked like a large rectangle UFO speeding nearby, estimated to be about half as big as Disney World.\n\n'I've seen many easily explained radar anomalies over the years,' the witness said, 'but never a huge rectangle with a clearly defined vapor shock wave and trail.'\n\n'Judging by the image size, rectangle would be approximately 20 miles in length,' the witness added.\n\n'Compressed vapor trail appears to be in excess of 150-miles long.'\n\nWhile it's unclear if this bizarre radar return relates to the previous night's wave of strange lights in the sky, several seasoned analysts of UFO videos told DailyMail.com that Kokomo's citizens most likely saw military flares.\n\nOne anonymous witness who submitted a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) witnessed a baffling and potentially related event: a brief incursion on doppler weather radar (above) of what looked like a large rectangle UFO speeding nearby, estimated to be about half as big as Disney World (20 miles long). The radar UFO was seen the morning after\n\n'These look very clearly to be military flares,' said Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to tech start-up Enigma Labs, where he helps investigate witness submissions to the group's growing database of UFO sightings.\n\n'The tell-tale signs,' Rojas explained, 'are the lights being in a row and lighting up and disappearing in succession.'\n\nIn addition to the Grissom base to the north, Rojas noted several other USAF bases surrounding Kokomo that may have been responsible for the late night lightshow.\n\n'Kokomo is around 50 miles away from Camp Fort Wayne [Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base],' he added.\n\n'Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton is also about 150 miles away. These could be from either location.'\n\nRojas, who served for many years as the official spokesperson for the citizen-led Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), said that he has personally witnessed and videotaped just how eerie military flares can look under the cover of darkness.\n\nWhile it's unclear if the bizarre radar return relates to the previous night's wave of strange lights in the sky, one seasoned analyst of UFO videos told DailyMail.com that Kokomo's citizens most likely saw military flares: Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to tech start-up Enigma Labs\n\n'I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area and they often drop these flares while doing exercises at the Barry Goldwater Range,' he said. 'Sure enough they are also often mistaken for UFOs and sometimes the media will call me for a comment.'\n\nRojas, who has co-founded a new nonprofit to look into 'unidentified aerial phenomena,' UAP Discovery, said the night sky can obscure more obvious signs of flares, like smoke or the aircraft that dropped the flares in the first place.\n\n'Witnesses have argued that smoke can be seen from flares, but that is typically not the case,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I made this video to show that smoke often can not be seen,' he said. 'My video is similar to most of the ones being alleged to be UFOs. I was about 150 miles from the flares when I took this video.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the public affairs specialist at the Grissom base and also to the relevant staff with Indiana's Air National Guard. This article will be updated with any new information that they provide.\n\nFor now, a public affairs representative for the Grissom base has told DailyMail.com, 'Grissom has KC-135 Stratotankers [a large, Boeing-made, aerial refueling tanker aircraft], and they don't have flares.'\n\nThe strange cases in Indiana come just weeks after new government records surfaced about other UFO waves near military sites, including 17 nights in December 2023 when swarms of UFOs were tracked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\n\nThese brazen penetrations over Langley \u2014 home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighters \u2014 led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.\n\nTo date, Langley's mystery UFOs have eluded identification by the Pentagon, police and even NASA's high-altitude research plane, the WB-57F, called in to investigate.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck, the commander with North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD), who led the mission to takedown the infamous Chinese spy balloon back in February 2023, described that Langley wave as unlike any other known case.\n\n'If there are unknown objects within North America,' General VanHerck told the Wall Street Journal, 'go out and identify them.'\n\nSenior ex- Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last week that the UFOs were 'swarms of smaller craft' released by 'motherships.'\n\nHe explained that the episode last December was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' as Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

On March 13th 1997, thousands of people saw a stream of mysterious lights bathe the night sky across Arizona and Nevada for three hours. Being the largest and most reported UFO in history, it was only a matter of time before the incident inspired a movie adaptation.\n\nPhoenix Forgotten opens with Sophie discovering footage of her brother, who went missing during the Phoenix Lights sighting 20 years ago. Sophie starts analysing the video, hoping to learn the truth about her brother's disappearance.\n\nRather than being a straightforward found-footage feature, Phoenix Forgotten keeps cutting between the unearthed tapes and Sophie's own investigation, which is a great way to amplify the tension. The initial tape ends as the brother discovers a charred corpse, so the audience is desperate for Sophie to uncover the rest of the footage to learn more.\n\nEven though the found-footage angle has been done to death, few films in the genre seem more authentic than Phoenix Forgotten. The scratched frames and analogue defects make the footage look like it originated from a VHS camcorder, making it easier to remain invested in the story."

        "source": "AppleInsider",
        "article_content": "Apple Intelligence is the product of more than a year's worth of tireless testing. Here's what Apple engineers used to ensure the quality of their AI software.\n\nFor Apple, 2024 was undoubtedly the year of artificial intelligence. The company has long been working on machine learning features, with its most recent operating systems ushering in an entirely new set of AI-powered enhancements. They are known collectively under the moniker of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile the generative AI tools themselves were announced in June, at WWDC 2024, only a handful of them made their public debut with the first developer betas of iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1. Since then, Apple has rolled out more and more of the AI-powered enhancements with subsequent beta releases.\n\nAt the time of writing, the iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 updates are nearing the end of beta testing, while the first developer beta of iOS 18.2 has only just arrived. Months after the big announcement, some Apple Intelligence features are still only available on beta versions of Apple's operating systems.\n\nAccording to people who spoke with AppleInsider and accurately revealed many Apple Intelligence features months ahead of launch, the company spent a year working on its in-house generative AI tools before they were finally released to the general public.\n\nDuring development, Apple tried to keep the full scale of its AI endeavors a secret. Individual AI projects received their own codenames, as was the case with the email categorization feature, known as Project BlackPearl.\n\nApple Intelligence as a whole, however, was known by the codename Greymatter \u2014 an unmistakable reference to a type of tissue found in the human brain. Some of Apple's internal test applications also had names that concealed their overall purpose.\n\nDuring the development of Apple Intelligence, Apple used at least two dedicated test applications and environments to test its AI software.\n\nApple used multiple test applications during the development of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nThe two apps in question are known as 1UP, a reference to the ever-popular Super Mario series by Nintendo, and Smart Replies Tester. The name of the latter is self-explanatory, given that AI-powered Smart Replies have since made their way into release versions of Apple's operating systems, in the Mail and Messages applications.\n\nWe were told that internal distributions of iOS 18.0 and macOS 15.0 Sequoia featured many of the underlying Apple Intelligence frameworks used in the publicly available betas of iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1.\n\nThe frameworks were necessary for testing and were included alongside the standard development and configuration utilities found in Apple's internal-use operating systems.\n\nDifferent AI-related features could be toggled through feature flags, with the use of the Livability application. 1UP and Smart Replies Tester, the two known AI applications, were used by Apple's engineers to test the different aspects and use cases of Apple Intelligence.\n\n1UP \u2014 Text-generation testing with AI models\n\nFound even in the earliest internal-use builds of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, the 1UP application was used for testing text-related generative AI features. The application itself featured a variety of different test options and parameters, which could be adjusted as needed.\n\nThe 1UP app featured tests related to text-generation, and references to the Ajax large language model.\n\nPeople familiar with the application have told AppleInsider that it contains direct references to Apple's long-rumored in-house LLM or large language model, known as Ajax, which can function on-device.\n\nThe 1UP app features multiple test options, organized into different sections. One of the tests involves text generation. This part of the app was used to test \"autoregressive text generation from a prompt,\" people familiar with the app told us.\n\nIt allowed its users to choose between different AI models, including the aforementioned on-device Ajax LLM. The application also featured a setting to adjust the maximum number of generated tokens, which could be set anywhere from 30 to 100, the default being 48.\n\n1UP \u2014 Document analysis, topic analysis, and text understanding\n\nBased on what we were told, it's apparent that Apple placed significant focus on AI's document and file understanding. Some tests found within the 1UP app were focused on document and text analysis. Whether the user input consisted of raw text, a PDF, or a Word document, Apple's software was supposed to identify key information within the text, such as phone numbers, addresses, languages, and text author, if applicable.\n\nA mockup of the 1UP user interface, based on the information provided to us by people familiar with the app.\n\nWeb history from Safari and conversations from Messages could also be analyzed for keywords, or \"topics,\" as they were known within the app. This could include words that repeat often or those that appear to be the focal point of a text. Apple-specific terms are also recognized, and key sentences are isolated.\n\nThe app was also capable of cross-referencing the information found in a text or document with the user's information. For instance, whether or not a phone number was saved in the user's Contacts, or if an event was found in the Calendar.\n\nThe significance of the 1UP tests, and the clues about Apple Intelligence\n\nThe 1UP tests offered hints as to what would eventually become Apple Intelligence features, such as the upgraded Siri with personal context, and Writing Tools. With Apple Intelligence, it's possible to edit texts and generate text-based summaries of the user's conversations, where key details such as names, dates, and locations are highlighted.\n\nApple's own AI prompts also revealed that the company explored multiple levels of summarization, including summaries consisting of only 10 or 20 words. AppleInsider paraphrased many of these prompts before they were ever made public.\n\nThe tests within the 1UP are indicative of what Apple wanted to do with Safari as well, which was to have its AI use the information from web pages the user visits. This idea eventually led to the Intelligent Search feature, now known as Highlights.\n\nText generation and document analysis are now handled by ChatGPT rather than Apple's AI\n\nWith the first developer beta of iOS 18.2, Apple notably improved Siri through integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Requests and queries that Siri is unable to process are handed over to ChatGPT, albeit only with direct user approval.\n\nTests in the 1UP app seem to mirror the functionality made possible by ChatGPT integration in iOS 18.2.\n\niOS 18.2 also introduces a new splash screen outlining some of the key features made possible via ChatGPT integration, such as text generation in Writing Tools and document analysis.\n\nThe 1UP app features tests for virtually the same things, indicating that Apple had perhaps wanted to accomplish ChatGPT-like features independently, through its own AI models.\n\nAlong with the 1UP app, Apple used another internal application known as Smart Replies Tester.\n\nSmart Replies Tester \u2014 evaluating AI-generated responses\n\nWith iOS 18.1, Apple introduced AI-assisted Smart Replies, which are available in Mail and Messages. This feature makes it significantly easier to draft a response to an email or message within Apple's built-in apps.\n\nInternally, Apple used a dedicated app to test Smart Replies. It instantly generated multiple replies based on the input text.\n\nOn an iPhone, Smart Replies appear as response suggestions above the keyboard in Mail. Apple Intelligence can generate responses to direct questions the user may be replying to, but it is often less useful in other situations.\n\nSmart Replies Tester was seemingly built to test just that, how well Apple's AI can generate a response, and how quickly. The app measured the response generation time in milliseconds.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the internal application consists of multiple test menus where users can input text, and instantly receive several AI-generated Smart Replies. This occurs entirely on-device, and the responses change as soon as the input text is altered in any way.\n\nSmart Replies can be found in the Mail app on iOS 18.2.\n\nThe app also can be used with an image captioning model, which is downloaded separately. Mass image captioning was possible as well. As for similar features in the iOS 18.1 beta, the Photos application now contains a greatly improved search functionality, which lets people locate images containing specific objects or locations with relative ease.\n\nWhile Smart Replies Tester is distinctly AI-related, other internal applications also offer insight into Apple's approach and way of thinking in regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nMegadome \u2014 Your personal context, all in one app\n\nAnother of Apple's internal apps, Megadome serves as the perfect visual aid for Siri's upcoming personal context feature, powered by Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Megadome app aggregates user data and organizes it into different categories.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the Megadome application can gather relevant user information, sort it into categories, and present it in the form of neatly organized cards.\n\nThe app can display the most important details about its user, including their full name, significant locations, relationships, groups, contact information, organizations, installed software, and much more. Megadome seemingly gathers this information from system applications the user has interacted with.\n\nThis information can also be viewed in the form of a so-called \"Reality Graph,\" which visualizes the relationship between entities and locations in the form of a diagram.\n\nWhy Apple made Megadome, and the features it mirrors\n\nWhile the idea of an app that knows everything about you might seem nightmarish at first glance, the app is merely an internal-use tool, not something made for the general public. Its existence ultimately makes sense when things are taken into context.\n\nApple's Megadome app offers some insights about the company's thought process.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri will gain the ability to process natural language. The virtual assistant will also have a firm grasp of the user's so-called personal context, as a result of the AI upgrade.\n\nThis means that Siri will be able to understand facts about the user's life \u2014 the different people and places important to them. In many ways, the Megadome app is an embodiment of this idea. Apple wanted to build a tool that could understand the important aspects of someone's life, and use these details to help the user.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of Apple Intelligence?\n\nApple's internal applications often serve as an accurate indicator of things to come in the near future. Although they may feature various puns, memes, and obscure inside jokes, the company's test apps reveal quite a lot about in-development features.\n\nApple's test applications often contain tidbits about upcoming features, such as the ones powered by Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile names such as 1UP, GreyParrot, and Megadome don't mean anything to the average user, almost everyone has used the Calculator or tested Apple Intelligence in one form or another.\n\nThis phenomenon is hardly anything new. Even back in 2020, the internal-use app known as Gobi painted a pretty good picture of what would eventually become App Clips. Should any information about future test apps come to light, we will most likely be able to infer something about an upcoming feature."

A local business owner is standing out in a male-dominated space and is helping others save time and money.\n\nAdriana Lacy knows what it\u2019s like to be constantly busy. She runs her own consulting business, teaches at Brandeis University, and launched two apps to help small businesses and content creators.\n\n\u201cA lot of the clients that we have are very small and they definitely don\u2019t have the staff or the resources to have a full communications team,\u201d said Adriana Lacy, Cofounder and CEO of Adriana Lacy Consulting.\n\nWith a small team around herself, Lacy and her employees jumped into the AI world to help add more of what we all want---time and money. Her team created two apps---one, called Social Chime, helps with social media management.\n\n\u201cSo with this app, not only can they manage their social media profiles, but they can also use AI to help them with caption writing AI to help them with generating images, to really just help them increase their workflow.\u201d\n\nWith 4.9 billion people on social media, according to Forbes, businesses are searching for ways to make themselves stand out. Lacy explained how her app worked, including using the AI assistant button to write out a post and within seconds, a caption spits out. She said this helps drive traffic to a site, using minimal time and money. Her other app compiles data from multiple sources and issues daily reports.\n\n\u201cWhat I see with a lot of smaller business owners is they may never, you know, check their sales or their advertising on a daily basis, and they might just be losing out on money or on customers because they\u2019re not staying ahead of this and being able to deliver them,\u201d said Lacy.\n\nLacy says AI can help businesses make more informed decisions, but she\u2019s also focused on the ethical use of AI and double-checking what it spits out.\n\n\u201cEven though it is, you know, machine-controlled machine outputs, these outputs were created by humans,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cSo of course there\u2019s always biases that are baked into these models that can disadvantage people.\u201d\n\nAs a Forbes 30 under 30 honoree, she hopes her influence can break some barriers in the field of AI.\n\n\u201cYou look at some of the biggest AI companies right now, they\u2019re all run by men,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a really great time to have more women in the field really thinking and just providing more diverse perspectives.\u201d\n\nLacy created the apps to serve as a lifeline for small businesses that can\u2019t afford social media management tools that cost hundreds of dollars. Her Social Chime and Insight Analytics apps start at $33 a month.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW"

        "article_content": "Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR The Oxygen OS 15 update brings several AI features from OnePlus\u2019 AI Toolkit to existing devices.\n\nThese features include AI Speak, AI Summary, and AI Writer, and they join the new AI Reply feature as part of AI Toolbox 2.0.\n\nOnePlus technically debuted these three AI features in Oxygen OS 14.1, so a few devices have them already.\n\nEvery major tech company is infusing its products with AI features these days, and OnePlus is no different. Just this week, OnePlus unveiled its latest OxygenOS 15 software, which packs a number of AI tricks like reflection removal, unblurring, detail boosting, and more. The Oxygen OS 15 update also expands the availability of three of OnePlus\u2019 existing AI features \u2014 AI Speak, AI Summary, and AI Writer \u2014 to more devices.\n\nAI Speak is a simple feature that reads articles out loud in either a male or female voice. It\u2019s a bit like the read-aloud feature in Google Chrome, except it works with other web browsers like Firefox as well as with news apps like Google News. In the AI Speak window, you can change voices, restart playback from the beginning, move to the previous or next sentence, or adjust the playback speed between 0.5X, 1X, 1.5X, or 2.0X. You can minimize the window into a tiny pill that floats on the right side of the screen by tapping either the close button or by swiping down on the handle at the top. The pill can be moved up or down but not left or right, and it can be dismissed by tapping the X icon, which also ends playback.\n\nAI Summary is another simple feature that summarizes articles for you. It uses a cloud-based generative AI model (though we\u2019re not sure which one) to create a numbered list of sentences that summarizes whatever you\u2019re reading. Like AI Speak, AI Summary works with not only Google Chrome but also other web browsers as well as with news apps. The AI Summary window has buttons to regenerate the summary, give a thumbs up or a thumbs down for the summary, copy the summary to the clipboard, share the summary with another app, or save the summary to the OnePlus Notes app.\n\nAI Writer is a feature that helps you write some message you want to send to someone. It also uses some cloud-based generative AI model like AI Summary does, and like other AI writing assistants, it lets you generate responses in different tones. It works with many social media apps, shopping apps, email apps, and review editing pages. When you open the window, you first need to enter a prompt that\u2019s up to 1,000 characters long, next you choose whether you want the tone to be \u201cconcise,\u201d \u201cdetailed,\u201d or \u201cpolite,\u201d then lastly tap \u201cgenerate.\u201d After a few seconds, AI Writer will generate a response in the tone that you chose. If you don\u2019t like the generated response, then you can tap regenerate to have it try again. If you do like it, you can tap copy to add it to the clipboard.\n\nTo use AI Speak, AI Summary, or AI Writer, you need to enable the Screen Recognition feature under Settings > Accessibility & convenience. Screen Recognition uses Android\u2019s accessibility features to extract content from the screen for AI Speak and AI Summary to read and summarize, respectively. If you\u2019re wondering why it needs to capture screen content, it\u2019s because the content capture API that apps can use to provide content is not only rarely utilized but is also only accessible to the Android System Intelligence app. Thus, OnePlus essentially had to use a screen reading workaround in order to make its AI features work with a variety of existing apps.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve enabled the Screen Recognition feature, you can access AI Speak, AI Summary, or AI Writer by swiping open the Smart Sidebar while in a supported app. (The Smart Sidebar has to first be enabled under Settings > Accessibility & convenience.) You\u2019ll know one of these features is available when you see the Smart Sidebar glow blue for a few seconds after opening an app. If you\u2019re reading content in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Italian, Thai, or Indonesian, then these features will work, otherwise you\u2019ll get an error that the current language is not supported.\n\nAll three of these AI features are part of the AI Toolkit that OnePlus announced back in August. AI Toolkit was initially only available on the OnePlus Nord 4 and OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite because they ran Oxygen OS 14.1, the latest version of Oxygen OS prior to Oxygen OS 15. The features quietly expanded to the OnePlus Pad 2 (which also runs Oxygen OS 14.1) following an update earlier this month, and they\u2019re all now part of the rebranded AI Toolbox 2.0 feature in Oxygen OS 15.0.\n\nAI Toolbox 2.0 not only improves the AI Writer feature by letting you check or rewrite text instead of writing a new message, but it also adds a fourth feature called AI Reply. AI Reply, as we mentioned in our Oxygen OS 15 review, analyzes on-screen content to generate suggested replies in different tones while you\u2019re using messaging apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, or Snapchat. Like with AI Writer, the AI Reply feature lets you choose different tones to replies.\n\nAI Reply default tone AI Reply humerous tone AI Reply casual tone\n\nIf you have a OnePlus device, then these AI features are just some of the many new features coming in the Oxygen OS 15 update. The update, which is based on Google\u2019s Android 15 software, brings a number of other changes, such as a split notification shade, redesigned icons, Open Canvas, and much more.\n\nGot a tip?

        "article_content": "A major discovery in Iraq\u2019s historic Babylon Governorate is a significant breakthrough in better understanding the evolution of the ancient city.\n\nThere are parts of the excavation site that date back to the Sasanian Empire of the 3 rd through 7 th centuries, but a majority of the best-preserved parts of the site are remnants of the Old Babylonian era of over 3,000 years ago.\n\nthrough 7 centuries, but a majority of the best-preserved parts of the site are remnants of the Old Babylonian era of over 3,000 years ago. In addition to physical structures remaining from the ancient civilization, there were plenty of individual artifacts discovered, including ancient seals and cuneiform tablets.\n\nFor most archaeologists, discovering a single ancient artifact is probably a thrilling experience. Finding three? A monumental moment. 10? A dream come true.\n\nWhat about nearly 500?\n\nIs there a feeling that can even capture the magnitude? To find out, you\u2019d have to ask Quhtan Abbas Hassan Aboud, the lead on an archaeological excavation in Iraq\u2019s Babylon Governorate. In mid-October, the team\u2014working on a dig in the Al-Fayadiya district\u2014discovered a major section of ancient Babylon that spans two periods of the city\u2019s development. The find contained 478 artifacts from both periods, including ancient seals, cuneiform tablets, and more, according to Archaeology Magazine.\n\nThe team separated the discovery into two sections (A and B), according to a statement from the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. Section A covered about 6,000 square meters of the excavation site, and within it, archaeologists found remains that represented two distinct time periods. The top layer dates back to the Sasanian period, which stretched from 224 to 651 A.D. during the reign of the Sasanian Empire\u2014one of the last pre-Islamic empires of Iran.\n\nUnfortunately, because they\u2019ve spent a millennium and a half much closer to the surface of the soil, the ruins of the empire suffered plenty of erosion and deterioration. So, while the discovery is key in tracing the history of ancient Babylon, it pales in comparison to what the archaeologists found underneath it.\n\nThe second layer of Section A was much more well-preserved and much, much older\u2014experts traced it back to the Old Babylonian era, which stretched from 1894 to 1595 B.C.\n\nHowever, the excitement around Section B far outshone that for either layer of the first section. Section B was notably larger than Section A, at about 9,000 square meters, and contained a massive bounty of Babylonian antiquities. The whole section dates back to the same era as the lower layer of Section A, and\u2014in addition to the individual artifacts like pottery and cylindrical seals\u2014Aboud\u2019s crew was able to map out what they believed to be residential homes.\n\nRelated Story Archaeologists Find New Ancient Board Game Tablets\n\nTwo housing units that the archaeologists uncovered contained multiple, various-sized rooms that could have served as living spaces, work areas, or storage, providing significant insight into the living habits and conditions of Old Babylon\u2019s common residents.\n\nThe smaller, individual pieces of history\u2014the pottery, writing tablets, seals, and more\u2014that were part of the discovery are just as important as the structures unearthed in the area. The cylindrical seals, for instance, were in pristine condition despite being over 3,000 years old. Once used to sign documents and denote ownership, seals were an important person item and were often ornately decorated. While they served a functional purpose, they also now serve as crucial pieces of the history of aesthetics and symbolism\u2014not just in Babylon, but across ancient Mesopotamia and the rest of the world.\n\nJust as important a find are the various cuneiform tablets. The logo-syllabic writing style is one of the earliest in civilized history, and translations of the ancient Babylonian tablets are essentially windows into the civilization\u2019s commerce, government, and other facets of life. They provide a direct path to better understanding the ancient city.\n\nBut then again, so does the entire discovery. How lucky."

        "article_content": "Chicago is well-known for its tall buildings, deep-dish pizza, and rich history, but there\u2019s something else getting a lot of attention its exciting startup scene. Over the last few years, Chicago has become a hot spot for people with fresh ideas, bringing in entrepreneurs from around the world who want to kickstart their businesses.\n\nBut what makes Chicago\u2019s startup scene different from places like Silicon Valley or New York? Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes this city stand out.\n\nLots of Support for Entrepreneurs\n\nOne of the best things about starting a business in Chicago is the amount of support entrepreneurs get. In some cities, new businesses are on their own, but not here. There are tons of resources, like incubators, accelerators, and shared workspaces, designed to help startups grow.\n\nPlaces like 1871 provide mentorship, office space, and chances to connect with others, which helps people build their businesses. Chicago\u2019s universities, like The University of Chicago and Northwestern University, also offer programs to teach young people how to become entrepreneurs.\n\nAnd when it comes to funding, Chicago has a lot of investors and venture capital firms that want to support new businesses, so entrepreneurs don\u2019t have to go far to find financial backing.\n\nA Diverse and Inclusive Startup Community\n\nChicago\u2019s startup scene stands out because it\u2019s open to everyone. Unlike other cities where certain groups might dominate, Chicago welcomes people from all backgrounds. This focus on diversity brings different perspectives and new ideas to the table.\n\nOrganizations like Chicago Blend help promote diversity in the tech and startup industries, offering resources to support underrepresented groups. This inclusive atmosphere makes the startup culture more creative and innovative.\n\nA Strong Community\n\nIn some cities, startups see each other as competition. But in Chicago, there\u2019s a strong sense of community. Entrepreneurs often work together, share ideas, and help each other succeed.\n\nEvents like Chicago Startup Week and Techstars Startup Weekend bring people together to learn, network, and collaborate. It\u2019s common to see more experienced entrepreneurs mentoring newer ones, sharing advice and offering support.\n\nThere\u2019s also a tradition of giving back in Chicago. Entrepreneurs who have been successful often invest in local businesses, mentor new founders, and create programs to encourage more people to start their own ventures.\n\n4. Solving Real-World Problems\n\nChicago\u2019s startups focus on solving real issues that affect people\u2019s daily lives. Instead of chasing the next big trend, many entrepreneurs in the city work on businesses that improve things like transportation, education, and healthcare.\n\nFor example, SpotHero, a parking app, and VillageMD, a healthcare company, are just two examples of businesses that aim to make life easier for people in the city and beyond. This approach gives Chicago a reputation for being a place where people tackle real challenges.\n\nAffordability and Access\n\nStarting a business in cities like New York or San Francisco can be super expensive.
