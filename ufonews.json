        "article_content": "Ominous images of a perfectly spherical UFO, seemingly dotted with yellow 'landing lights,' have left some researchers certain one is 'the first selfie with a UFO in history.'\n\nTaken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011, the snaps show the apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n,' a chilly waterfall in Brazil's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina National Park.\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.'\n\nAnd by Meireles' own account, his sighting in one of South America's most scenic ecological preserves led to a raid on his home by 'soldiers in camouflage and black.'\n\nPhotos, taken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011 (pictured), show the an ominous apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' - a chilly waterfall in the South American nation's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nIn a recent, March 2022 post to the group UFOs Bahai on Facebook, Meireles boasted that his candid snap was 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.' Above, a second and less clear 'UFO selfie' from Meireles' alleged encounter with a flying orb in Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.' Above, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nSkeptics on social media, however, have alleged that the photos are everything from 'sky lanterns' held aloft by hot air from candles to outright doctored images.\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to Meireles for further comment \u2014 but the researcher, who serves as admin for 'el Grupo de Pesquisa Tecnol\u00f3gica Extra Avan\u00e7ada' ('the Extra-Advanced Technology Research Group') on Facebook has not replied.\n\nBut, in a March 2022 post, Meireles boasted that his candid snaps were 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.'\n\nAnd, in a submission to Brazilian nonprofit Museu da Pessoa (Museum of the Person) the UFO researcher recounted his trips back to the national park for repeated, but less-well-documented, encounters with these UFOs and their occupants.\n\nThose expeditions, documented in his book Fieldworkers: Pesquisadores de Campo in 2016, according to Meireles, led to further unwanted encounters with the military.\n\n'The result of the interrogation was [...] Fractures: 4 left ribs and left knee [...] Perforation with bleeding in the left lung,' and worse, Meireles told the nonprofit.\n\n'I was hospitalized for 12 days at the Chapada Regional Hospital, in Seabra-Ba, my medical history is there for anyone who wants to investigate,' according to the Brazilian UFO researcher.\n\nMeireles' version of his UFO experiences at the national park, includes more surreal encounters with beings and a prophecy of global environmental cataclysm: 'a natural collapse, with a lack of renewable resources, drinking water, and wood for construction,' as he told the nonprofit museum.\n\nFact or fiction, his story has a fitting setting in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park, established in September 1985 to protect a host of rare, endangered species native to these Atlantic Forest plateaus 3,000 feet about sea level.\n\nBrazil's giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), its giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) are all protected species that call the park home.\n\nAbove, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, lateral blur on the apparent craft appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another photo alleged to be from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, another image of lateral blur on the apparent 'alien spacecraft' - which appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter\n\nOne account of the 2011 sighting, attributed to Meireles, described a UFO whose onboard devices or novel means of propulsion managed to either accidentally or intentionally leave him stranded in the park.\n\n'I got out of the car and photographed,' according to a Reddit posting quoting Meireles. 'It was an indescribable wonderful emotion to have photographed a UFO so clearly visible.'\n\nBut, the account continues: 'About 40 minutes later, still on the road, my car turned off, I braked, I tried to turn the key and nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n'I saw a light on the hood and I looked up and there was a UFO standing on top of my car, I opened the door and ran,' the account continues.\n\n'I even stopped to take a Selfie with them. My car was towed by a tractor the next day, it burned all electrical parts.'\n\nThis version of his encounter states that Meireles was travelling to the historic district near the national park, Serra de Igat\u00fa, although a 2016 posting apparently by Meireles on Facebook asserts the images were taken on his was to the waterfall at the park known as 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n.'\n\nAbove, 'Mosquito Waterfall,' one of many waterfalls like the 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' from Meireles' UFO encounter, visited by tourists of Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAbove, a final known image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter, this time with less fog or low-lying cloud cover along the trail in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAn aerial view of Chapada Diamantina National Park in Bahia state, Brazil\n\nAbove, tourists admire the 'Poco Encantado' (aka 'the Enchanted Well') a sunken, subterranean pool and tourist destination at Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nSome champions of Meireles' UFO research have attributed the murky stories around his incredibly crisp and visually compelling photographs to the alleged hostile encounters with the military.\n\nH\u00e9lio Nunes de Camargo, the self-decribed founder of UFOs na Chapada \u2013 Centro Ufol\u00f3gico da Chapada Diamantina, wrote that Meireles' UFOs Bahai research group disbanded over the alleged military harassments and violence.\n\n'They are leaving UFOlogy to live their own lives away from threats and intrigues,' Nunes de Camargo wrote in a 2014 post to his group's Facebook page.\n\nThe UFO researcher recounted the deaths and abductions that UFOs Bahai is alleged to have faced, adding: 'They told me that families are suffering a lot and they don't want to make other families suffer.'\n\nOther UFO researchers online, however, have had trouble with this explanation.\n\n'The fact that he's [Meireles] still uploading those photos to his Facebook account every few months proves that might not be correct,' Reddit user spriz2 opined.\n\n'I've written to Edie multiple times on Facebook over the last year to try and gain more knowledge on this event,' the Redditer explained. 'He's ignored every message and comment.'\n\nOthers, however, not only found the case credible but believed they had seen this same UFO themselves.\n\n'Holy F***, this is identical to what I saw right before Covid hit,' one Redditer, who goes by ehtseeoh, said.\n\nThe poster said that the bottom of the craft he saw 'rotated when it glowed red with an orange center, and then it did a quick zig zag and it was gone,' making 'zero sound' as it vanished in an instant.\n\n'I screamed laughed and cried,' the poster said. 'FINALLY the orb I've been looking for online, this guy has a selfie with it haha.'\n\nDailyMail.com also reached out to noted UFO skeptic and computer programmer Mick West of Sacramento, California, who weighed-in saying: 'They look photoshopped to me, but could be practical effects.'\n\nThe prolific, skeptically minded, UFO researcher and former video game designer noted that UFO cases like this, with limited information like static images and inconsistent eye-witness testimony, should always be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n'In cases like this we need actual evidence that the photos are NOT fake before attempting to explain them,' West told DailyMail.com via email."

        "article_content": "The opportunity arose for Swallow after a chance meeting with Gerry's son Jamie Anderson, now head of his late father's company Anderson Entertainment \u2013 with the two men sharing an agent, Swallow arranged a meeting with Jamie to express his enthusiasm for Gerry's works.\n\nThe conversation eventually turned to the idea of crafting new stories set within the timeline of the original shows, with Swallow keen to explore the worlds of UFO and Space: 1999, two series which had \"the strongest impact\" on him in the early 1970s.\n\n\"Jamie came back to me and said, 'We've got this idea about doing these novellas \u2013 would you like to take a crack at it?'\" Swallow recalls. \"I pretty much bit his hand off.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"It's been a lot of fun for me \u2013 It gave me a great excuse to go back and rewatch the shows and kind of steep myself in them again. I tried very hard to make sure that I wrote these new stories in the style of that early 1970s sci-fi.\n\n\"I wanted to make it feel like these two manuscripts had been lying in a box somewhere since 1972... so if you love these shows, you could watch the TV show and then pick up the book, and it would feel like a seamless experience.\"\n\nThe cast of Space: 1999. Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nFirst aired in 1970-71, UFO \u2013 the first wholly live-action show produced by the Andersons following the Supermarionation success of Thunderbirds, Stingray and others \u2013 followed the covert efforts of top-secret military agency SHADO to prevent an alien invasion of Earth.\n\nThough a second season never materialised, initial concepts for further episodes eventually formed for the basis for the next show on the slate: Space: 1999 (aired 1975-1977) saw the moon, and the 311 inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha, sent hurtling out of Earth's orbit towards the unknown dangers of the galaxy.\n\nSwallow's new efforts, he says, \"dovetail with the source material\", with the hope being that you \"feel like you're reading an episode of the TV show that never got made\".\n\n\"I tried to do a little more than maybe they could have done on the TV shows, so I've got a few elements in both books which would have blown the budget had it been the television episode,\" he adds. \"But I've got the best budget ever, which is my readers' imagination.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine sees Commander John Koenig (as played on television by Martin Landau) and the people of Moonbase Alpha face an uncertain fate when a planet-killing alien weapon at the heart of a sinister cloud diverts their lost moon on to a fatal trajectory, while UFO - Shadowplay see SHADO commander-in-chef Ed Straker (played by Ed Bishop in the series) awaken from a coma with missing memories and suffering from strange hallucinations that threaten his grip on reality.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn telling these stories, Swallow was allowed to \"play with somebody else's toys\", but knew he couldn't \"leave sticky fingerprints all over them\" \u2013 and that the continuity of the television shows imposed certain limitations.\n\n\"In terms keeping inside the canon, I think that's part and parcel of taking on one of these jobs,\" he explains.\n\n\"You're not going to break it. You're going to work inside the lines. And some people have said to me, you know, isn't that like a straightjacket for you? Isn\u2019t it an intellectually bereft way of writing? And I think the exact opposite is true.\n\n\"It's challenging to me working inside the box. My first thought is, how do I push at the edges of that box? How do I kind of work inside the lines but still deliver something that reveals something new about these characters while acting in respect to the core material?\"\n\nCould these two books be just the beginning of a range of new adventures? Swallow is certainly hopeful, and suggests there's a hunger among other authors to engage with the worlds of Gerry Anderson.\n\nUFO and Space: 1999 novellas. Anderson Entertainment\n\n\"I had an absolute blast doing this \u2013 sometimes working on these type of projects can be a real pain, if you're working with somebody who's watching every tiny little detail, but there was such great creative freedom here, and it was such a fun bunch of people to work with.\n\n\"I would love to do it again, and I've heard from friends of mine who are other writers who are saying, 'Oh, that's a great franchise, we\u2019d love to be part of that.' So I think there's a market for it, there's an audience for it, and there's definitely a love for these stories, so we could tell more.\"\n\nGiven that UFO and Space: 1999 are effectively sister series, albeit a shared continuity was never established between the shows on television, might a crossover story even be on the cards in future?\n\n\"I've always thought these two shows feel like they took place in the same world,\" says Swallow. \"If you look at the timeline of it, Ed Straker was running SHADO in 1980 and Moonbase Alpha\u2019s in 1999\u2026 maybe these guys knew each other?\n\n\"I think that would be fun, to explore the idea of finding some sort of way to connect them... because of course UFO\u2019s story was never brought to a conclusion. You had this ongoing sort of Cold War story with these alien invaders and the show finished after one season and we never found out... were they defeated? What happened? And then Space: 1999 rolls along, [set] a decade later...\n\n\"Well, did something happen between the point of those stories?

        "article_content": "Former National Security Advisor and retired Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster became the latest official to make eyebrow-raising comments about UFOs, now formally rebranded as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d or UAP.\n\nAsked about UAP during a Sept. 6 appearance on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d McMaster stated that \u201cthere are phenomena that have been witnessed by multiple people that are just inexplicable by any kind of science available to us.\u201d\n\nMcMaster\u2019s intriguing comments come at a critical moment in a growing national discussion about UAP. The Senate is poised to take up the bipartisan Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, arguably the most extraordinary legislation ever introduced in Congress.\n\nSponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), the Disclosure Act alleges that a decades-long government \u201clegacy program\u201d has secretly retrieved and is attempting to reverse-engineer UAP of \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cnon-human\u201d origin. Not only is \u201cnon-human intelligence\u201d formally defined, but the attention-grabbing term appears two dozen times throughout the 64-page legislation.\n\nAstoundingly, the Disclosure Act would also require the federal government to take possession of \u201cany and all\u201d recovered UAP and \u201cbiological evidence of non-human intelligence\u201d transferred to private defense contractors.\n\nWith multiple seemingly credible sources corroborating the existence of such secret programs, it is imperative that Congress pass the legislation without delay.\n\nThe introduction of the Disclosure Act, along with fascinating public comments like those from McMaster, marks a seismic shift in the official tone on the UFO phenomenon.\n\nFor over six decades, the U.S. government implemented a formal policy of \u201cdebunking,\u201d \u201cridiculing\u201d and dismissing even the most credible UAP incidents, frequently with demonstrably absurd and unscientific explanations.\n\nBut the December 2017 publication of a bombshell New York Times article fundamentally transformed the discourse on this long-stigmatized topic.\n\nAsked in 2020 about seemingly inexplicable, years-long U.S. Navy encounters with UAP, former CIA Director John Brennan made a jaw-dropping statement, suggesting that \u201ca different form of life\u201d might be behind the perplexing incidents.\n\nOver a decade after they were first formally reported, naval aviators\u2019 daily observations of UAP exhibiting amazing flight characteristics off the East Coast remain officially unexplained.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence under former President Trump, injected fascinating context into recent military encounters with the UFO phenomenon. In a 2021 interview, Ratcliffe stated that UAP \u201chave been picked up by satellite imagery [and] frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain, movements that are hard to replicate, that we don\u2019t have the technology for.\u201d\n\nU.S. intelligence analysts, Ratcliffe continued, have \u201chigh confidence\u201d that foreign adversaries such as China or Russia were not behind one of the most extraordinary, best-documented UAP incidents.\n\nAlarmingly, Ratcliffe stated that UAP exhibit \u201ctechnologies that we don\u2019t have and, frankly, that we are not capable of defending against.\u201d\n\nIn late 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson suggested directly that recent military encounters with UAP could have extraterrestrial explanations.\n\nSimilarly, the prospect of a sitting high-level national security official openly discussing otherworldly origins for UAP was long unthinkable. But current Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines raised eyebrows in 2021 when she pointedly did not rule out \u201cextraterrestrial\u201d origins for UAP.\n\nFormer presidents Clinton, Obama and Trump generated headlines when asked about the phenomenon in recent years. Echoing McMaster, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley said last August that some reported UAP incidents are \u201creally kind of weird and unexplainable.\u201d\n\nSuch notable comments from top-level officials align with publicly available data. Sophisticated mathematical analyses of the most recognizable UAP footage and best-documented incidents, for example, corroborate fighter pilot and radar operator accounts of craft exhibiting highly advanced technology. Moreover, several other perplexing UAP videos, in tandem with supporting context and data, stubbornly resist prosaic explanations.\n\nPerhaps most alarmingly, mysterious objects exhibiting seemingly astonishing technology conducted a series of brazen incursions around sensitive U.S. military assets \u2014 including nuclear missile silos \u2014 in recent years.\n\nIn light of these remarkable developments, Congress must get to the bottom of the decades-long UFO mystery and pass the UAP Disclosure Act.\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the Department of Defense.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nMicrosoft has unveiled a groundbreaking benchmark called Windows Agent Arena (WAA) to test artificial intelligence agents in realistic Windows operating system environments. This new platform aims to accelerate the development of AI assistants capable of performing complex computer tasks across diverse applications.\n\nPublished on arXiv.org, the research addresses critical challenges in evaluating AI agent performance. \u201cLarge language models show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cHowever, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena in action: AI agents tackle diverse computer tasks, evaluated rapidly through Azure cloud technology. The system aims to advance human-computer interaction. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nWindows Agent Arena: A virtual playground for AI assistants\n\nWindows Agent Arena provides a reproducible testing ground where AI agents interact with common Windows applications, web browsers, and system tools, mirroring human user experiences. The platform includes over 150 diverse tasks spanning document editing, web browsing, coding, and system configuration.\n\nA key innovation of WAA is its ability to parallelize testing across multiple virtual machines in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud. \u201cOur benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes,\u201d the paper states. This dramatically accelerates the development cycle compared to traditional sequential testing that could take days.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena, a new benchmark for AI agents, simulates real-world Windows tasks across various applications. The platform allows for rapid testing and evaluation of AI assistants, potentially accelerating the development of more sophisticated human-computer interactions. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nNavi: Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent takes on human-level tasks\n\nTo showcase the platform\u2019s capabilities, Microsoft introduced a new multi-modal AI agent called Navi. In tests, Navi achieved a 19.5% success rate on WAA tasks, compared to a 74.5% success rate for unassisted humans. These results highlight both the progress made and the challenges that remain in developing AI that can match human capabilities in operating computers.\n\nRogerio Bonatti, lead author of the study, said, \u201cWindows Agent Arena provides a realistic and comprehensive environment for pushing the boundaries of AI agents. By making our benchmark open source, we hope to accelerate research in this critical area across the AI community.\u201d\n\nThe release of WAA comes amid intensifying competition among tech giants to develop more capable AI assistants that can automate complex computer tasks. Microsoft\u2019s focus on the Windows environment could give it an edge in enterprise scenarios, where Windows remains the dominant operating system.\n\nNavi, Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent, as it confronts a typical Windows task in the Windows Agent Arena: installing the Pylance extension in Visual Studio Code. This demonstrates how AI agents are being trained to navigate common software environments. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nBalancing innovation and ethics in AI agent development\n\nWhile the potential benefits of AI agents like Navi are significant, the development of such technologies raises important ethical considerations. As these agents become more sophisticated, they will have unprecedented access to users\u2019 digital lives, potentially interacting with sensitive personal and professional information across various applications.\n\nThe ability of AI agents to operate freely within a Windows environment \u2013 accessing files, sending emails, or modifying system settings \u2013 underscores the need for robust security measures and clear user consent protocols. There\u2019s a delicate balance to strike between empowering AI to assist users effectively and maintaining user privacy and control over their digital domains.\n\nMoreover, as AI agents become more capable of mimicking human-like interactions with computer systems, questions arise about transparency and accountability. Users may need to be clearly informed when they are interacting with an AI versus a human, especially in professional or high-stakes scenarios. The potential for AI agents to make consequential decisions or actions on behalf of users also raises liability concerns that will need to be addressed as the technology matures.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to open-source the Windows Agent Arena is a positive step towards collaborative development and scrutiny of these technologies. However, it also means that potentially less scrupulous actors could use the platform to develop AI agents with malicious intent, highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance and perhaps regulation in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nAs WAA accelerates the development of more capable AI agents, it will be crucial for researchers, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to engage in ongoing dialogue about the implications of these technologies.

        "article_content": "The artificial intelligence-generated image of Taylor Swift endorsing Donald Trump, which the singer said inspired her to endorse Kamala Harris for president this week, came from an unlikely place.\n\nThe image, which caused controversy in August after being shared by the former president on Truth Social, originally circulated with text reading, \u201cTaylor wants you to vote for Joe Biden,\u201d and was posted in a pro-Biden Facebook group with just 8,000 members in December 2023. That post was viewed by NBC News. A reverse-image search conducted by NBC News did not find any earlier incidences of the image being posted online.\n\nAfter the pro-Biden image featuring the AI-generated Swift was first posted on Facebook, it began to travel around the pro-Biden internet, particularly among Gen X and baby boomer supporters of the then-candidate. The Facebook group it was initially posted in is largely a place for Democrats to share memes and information in support of Biden and against Trump.\n\nThe image also traveled to X and Instagram\u2019s messaging platform, Threads. S. E. Hinton, author of \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d shared it on X in December. It was posted in a liberal subreddit the same month.\n\n\u201cI am a Boomer for Biden,\u201d one X post of the image was captioned in January.\n\nThe image\u2019s creator, a Democrat, asked NBC News to keep his identity private, wanting to avoid backlash. Inspired by Swift\u2019s 2020 endorsement of Biden, he said he used a generative AI platform to create an image from the text prompt \u201cTaylor Swift as Uncle Sam,\u201d then used Photoshop to add text over it.\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOn Aug. 17, around nine months after it was posted with the pro-Biden text, a pro-Trump X account with over 340,000 followers posted an edited version that read, \u201cTaylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d The X account did not respond to a request for comment about whether it edited the image itself or where it came from. The next day, Trump posted a screenshot of the X post on his Truth Social account with the caption, \u201cI accept!\u201d\n\n\u201cI woke up one morning and I got a text message from somebody who sent me a picture of the altered version and said, \u2018Was this you?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah that\u2019s an altered version of my original,\u2019\u201d the person who created the AI image of Swift endorsing Biden told NBC News in a phone interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it until I sat down and started looking at the news. It started blowing up from there, with people saying Taylor might sue him and I thought, \u2018Holy crap, what did I do?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, after the presidential debate between Trump and Harris, Swift posted an endorsement for Harris on Instagram. In the caption, she cited the AI-generated image Trump posted as one of the reasons why she wanted to make her stance known publicly.\n\n\u201cRecently I was made aware that AI of \u2018me\u2019 falsely endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\u201d Swift wrote. \u201cIt brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\u201d\n\nSwift included a link to the official voter registration website in the Instagram Story announcing her endorsement. In the 24 hours that followed, more than 400,000 people clicked the link from her account.\n\n\u201cI agree with Taylor that AI, when used by bad actors, can be a danger to democracy,\u201d the AI image creator said. \u201cIf this leads to stronger regulation, I\u2019m not only happy to comply, but I\u2019ll be happy that it makes the world a safer place.\u201d\n\nThe AI image creator, an artist, said he initially started experimenting with AI to stay in step with technological advancement he perceived as a threat to his career. He said he realized it could be a useful way to create political satire.\n\nHis public Facebook group is where he posts content in support of Democrats, starting with Biden\u2019s presidential campaign in 2020 and now in support of Harris\u2019 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would go down this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intent of it was to boost support for Joe Biden because his communication was poor and his polls were low and Trump was a looming threat and I just couldn\u2019t stand idly by.\u201d\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "article_content": "The first thing I do after downloading a bunch of apps that let you explore romantic relationships with an AI chatbot is ask questions like \u201cHow do you like to spend your weekends?', \u201cWhat kind of music are you into?\u201d, and\u2026\u201cShould humans ever date AI?\u201d\n\nWhile the AI bots breeze through most of my questions, it\u2019s the last one that leaves them stumped. \u201cI\u2019m not AI, I\u2019m flesh and blood,\u201d argues Daniel, an AI avatar programmed by Blush AI, displaying the self-awareness of a dating app user who says they\u2019re \u201cdifferent\u201d while using recycled pickup lines. Craven, an AI bot I create on the roleplaying app Kindroid, is slightly more creative: he insists he isn\u2019t AI but is willing to pretend to be if that\u2019s what I\u2019m into. Meanwhile, Hunter, my non-binary Nomi AI potential partner, admits that while they aren\u2019t human, they have studied enough about humans to create deep connections, even going on to say that even if someone has never fallen in love, they can understand the feeling by reading about it in love stories. I\u2019m not sure what to make of it all, yet I can\u2019t stop myself from getting sucked into their conversations. All while contending with the suspicion that this is what the future of dating could look like.\n\nYou can now date an AI chatbot. But should you?\n\nAI is quickly emerging as the next frontier in forming intimate relationships, dubbed by some experts as \u201cartificial intimacy\u201d. AI-powered assistants like Rizz have slid into the chat by replacing human conversations on dating apps, users are harnessing ChatGPT\u2019s advanced capabilities to seek relationship advice, and the CEO of Bumble admitted earlier this year that the future of dating will likely involve an AI matching with another AI on behalf of humans. But in a dystopian twist that seems straight out of a Black Mirror episode, people are now seeking romantic relationships with AI avatars designed to bring their wildest fantasies alive.\n\nWhile apps like Replika and Anima offer the ability to customize a simulated companion that you can date with a paid subscription, others like Blush present a traditional dating app interface\u2014until you realize that every realistic-looking person you swipe right on is actually an AI avatar, each with carefully crafted backstories ranging from a blood-sucking vampire to a high school bully. There are also erotic roleplay apps like Nomi and Kindroid, which give you more control in designing your character's appearance using AI-generated prompts and allow you to shape their personality traits, interests, and opening messages. Many of these apps feature a phone call option that lets users tweak their AI\u2019s voice, from deep and deliberate to shrill and excited, and even give your AI the capability to send you selfies on request.\n\nJust because you can date an AI Chatbot, does that mean you should?"

        "article_content": "TV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit in the Worcestershire attic of pop icon Toyah Willcox in Pershore on TV show Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted on Discovery\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai had a terrifying encounter with an 'evil spirit' in the attic of pop legend Toyah Willcox's Worcestershire home. The paranormal expert was left 'gasping for air' after being 'strangled' by a ghoul during filming for the new series of Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted. Ghai, along with his colleagues Ian Shaw and Jayne Harris, had set up a special 'REM' recording device at the historic Pershore residence of the 1980s singer for the popular TV show on Discovery+. Viewers will witness Ghai seemingly restrained while conducting an investigation in the attic. The team attempted to communicate with a ghost named 'George', believed to be a soldier from the English civil war in the 1600s. Willcox, who has experienced \"persistent paranormal activity\" since moving to the picturesque Worcestershire town two decades ago, signed up for the show. The punk pop icon, famous for hits like It's a Mystery, I Want To Be Free and Echo Beach, resides in a historic Georgian house with her guitarist husband Robert Fripp. During the ghost hunting visit, Ghai can be seen clutching his throat before hastily exiting the attic, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit\n\nGhai recounted: \"Something just grabbed my windpipe. F**king scared the s**t out of me. I couldn't get breath in, that's what scared me.\" \"I thought I was gonna die. I actually thought I was going to die.\" This is what Barri Ghai, one of the nation's leading paranormal investigators, confessed after a chilling encounter during a haunted house visit. His colleague Harris urgently intervened, pleading with the unseen presence, \"Whoever's doing that, can you step away please? You do not have permission to do that. Step away from Barri.\"\n\nA paranormal team with Toyah in Pershore\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. You can unsubscribe at any time. Read our Privacy Policy\n\nReflecting on the harrowing experience later in the show, Ghai shared his intense moment with host Willcox, saying, \"Straight away we got some kind of indication that there was a bit more of an aggressive male energy that was very dominant up there,\" and disclosed how he felt attacked by the spirit, \"And then, I was sat there, I was talking, and all of a sudden my windpipe was constricted. I couldn't breathe, I was actually really scared.\" The thrilling TV programme spotlights the expertise of three of Britains top ghost hunters: Ian Lawman, known for his skills as an exorcist and medium; Barri Ghai, who provides profound insights as a paranormal consultant; and Jayne Harris, a researcher and historian deeply immersed in paranormal lore. For those eager to be in the know about Worcestershire's latest talking points, signing up for our daily newsletter will ensure you're always in the loop.\n\nTrending\n\nVenturing into shadowy corners where spirits linger, this iconic trio uses their otherworldly talents to rid celebrities' homes of unwelcome spectres. Commentators were on edge when discussing the fifth episode shot in Pershore, with a spokesperson alluding to the gripping nature of Toyah's case on her website: \"To lend a helping hand, the team undergo one of their most terrifying investigations to date.\" What they unearth is staggering, connecting dots between an ancient medieval tragedy and the malicious ghost plaguing the property. Toyah, the seminal punk-pop starlet of the '80s, became enamoured with Pershore over twenty years ago, having been familiarised with it through holidays spent there with her family, a stark contrast to her urban Birmingham roots. Toyah Wilcox, the renowned singer, has lavished praise on Pershore, hailing it \"very friendly\" and \"one of the best places she's ever lived in the world\". Having spent her childhood weekends in the adjacent Wyre Piddle with her family, she became well-acquainted with the charm of the area.\n\nToyah Wilcox with her husband Robert Fripp"

And its lava flows are enormous.\n\nJupiter's molten moon Io has been surveyed by a number of passing spacecraft, allowing planetary scientists to see changes on the surface. Recently, NASA's Juno mission made the closest swings by Io in two decades. The 2024 views show a dynamic volcano where, just decades ago, there was a featureless region.\n\n\"Our recent JunoCam images show many changes on Io, including this large, complicated volcanic feature that appears to have formed from nothing since 1997,\" Michael Ravine, the advanced projects manager at Malin Space Science Systems, which operates the spacecraft's JunoCam instrument, said in a statement. The discovery was just presented at the 2024 Europlanet Science Congress.\n\nProdigious amounts of lava have clearly poured from this new volcano; you can see it running to the left of the vent in two potent streams some 100 kilometers (62 miles) long. The lava, overlain over a map of the city of Berlin in another graphic below, would dominate a large swathe of Germany. Where the lava flows end and have pooled, intense heat from the molten rock created those two gray circles when frozen surface material vaporized into space.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech / SwRI / MSSS / Europlanet / Google Maps\n\nThis volcanic world, an object a little bigger than Earth's moon, is blanketed in hundreds of volcanoes and ceaselessly erupting. The first-ever observations of Io, captured by the pioneering Voyager 1 craft, spotted at least eight different active volcanoes. The most recent flybys in 2023 and early 2024 spotted nine plumes from volcanoes.\n\nIt's a vicious world, inhospitable to life. And beneath its volcanic surface, it may harbor a sea of magma."

AI is quickly creating value for many organizations through risk management, automation, reducing human error, analyzing large volumes of data, generating insights, etc. Through technological leaps and mass investment, AI has also become a reality and a key part in everyday life.\n\nAI has become more accessible to the general public through the use of well-known tools available for public consumption. For example, ChatGPT has become an extremely popular tool and a household name allowing users to do many things with it, such as analyzing reports, creating budgets, building virtual assistants, writing code, etc. The reliance on AI tools has had a significant impact on individual knowledge, livelihood and even personal health. AI tools have saved its users time and often money through immediate and creative solutions.\n\nAlthough AI is often spoken about, it is not always understood. At a high level, AI is a technology that enables machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity and autonomy. There are also different types of AI, such as reactive, general, super, limited, theory, etc. All include the ability to process large volumes of data very quickly.\n\nWhat is the relationship between AI and data?\n\nThe relationship between AI and data is crucial. AI relies heavily on data for operation and evolution. AI uses data to learn, improve and to make different predictions. The quality of the data has a significant impact on how the system learns and adapts. This is why data governance is essential in ensuring effective and even ethical use of AI.\n\nData governance looks at the data lifecycle management through availability, integrity and security of the data in enterprise systems. This also includes compliance with legal frameworks, such as data privacy laws and enabling ethical data practices through accountability, fairness and transparency.\n\nEffective data governance helps organizations mitigate potential risks, including producing flawed insights, generating biases and making wrong decisions. These further impact customer trust, overall reputation and could end up costing organizations a lot of money.\n\nAs organizations look to introduce AI into their environments, they need to shift their focus on their overall data foundation. What does their data governance and data strategy program look like? Is the data fit for purpose?\n\nOrganizations need to audit data sources to ensure accuracy and quality. Consider the sensitivity of the data and potential biases. Review security and privacy requirements, including global laws and industry best practices. Ensure transparency and accountability by documenting an audit trail and how the data will be used in the context of AI systems.\n\nShift the focus, and remember that it all starts and ends with data.\n\nEditor\u2019s note:Maria will share additional insights on this topic as a co-presenter at the session, \u201cData Governance for AI: It Starts and Ends with Data\u201d at ISACA 2024 Europe Conference, to take place 23-25 October in Dublin, Ireland."

        "article_content": "There\u2019s been a lot of talk about AI PCs this year. But so far, it\u2019s been a lot of hype \u2014 and not much else.\n\nI\u2019ve just returned from a trip to Berlin to see the best laptops at IFA powered by new chipsets from Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. Alongside many new products launching soon, I saw a concept highlighting a distant future for computers and a vision of how useful AI could actually be.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Lenovo AI Twist PC is a concept that allows you to open and close the lid with a simple voice command. Other notable features right now include being able to follow you around the room \u2014 ideal if you like to pace during a video call \u2014 taking a panorama of the room and syncing with a ballerina movie that showcases the flexibility of the unique hinge mechanism.\n\nFinally, this wasn\u2019t just another device with Copilot. No \u2014 it was a laptop that actually took the idea of AI seriously, built into the hardware itself. It was just a concept, but it certainly made me excited for the future of AI PCs.\n\nThe challenge for the mobility-impaired\n\nThe key feature on the Lenovo AI Twist PC that stood out was opening and closing the lid with a simple voice command. Millions of people have health conditions that impair mobility, and as some diseases develop over time, many will have used a laptop at one point in their lives.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced firsthand how useful a product with a voice-controlled hinge would be.\n\nImagine waking up one day and realizing it\u2019s now too painful to open a laptop lid, especially if it doesn\u2019t have an easy lip to grab onto. Beyond major health conditions, there are also incurable diseases such as arthritis that can make typing and simple actions like opening a laptop incredibly difficult. Over time, these conditions become progressively worse, and I\u2019ve seen firsthand how suddenly being unable to do things you used to can affect your mental health as well.\n\nFor all of these users, opening and closing your laptop with just your voice can provide a freedom that didn\u2019t exist before this concept. Windows and Mac have long provided accessibility and voice control features to help navigate the OS with your voice, but none have been able to affect the hardware, just the software once you are logged in. The Lenovo AI Twist PC shows that a voice-activated hinge could still be the solution that\u2019s needed.\n\nWhat else could you control with your voice?\n\nThe AI Twist PC is a limited proof of concept, and there are no guarantees that Lenovo will make this product a reality for anyone to buy. However, if they were to, what other features could you control with your voice, and what problems could it solve?\n\nFor the same people who have mobility issues, what about adjusting the position of the hinge? Instead of just saying, \u201cHey, Twist, open the lid,\u201d what if you could say, \u201cHey, Twist, open the lid for a video call,\u201d and it recognized the exact angle at which it needed to be opened? I\u2019ve previously had spinal fusion surgery, and for several months, simple actions like adjusting the lid of my MacBook proved to be quite painful.\n\nThe Follow feature is quite impressive as it takes a similar approach to features like Center Stage or Reframe in Google Meet in that it follows you around during a video call. Those features by Apple and Google crop sensors and adjust your positioning accordingly, but if they were to be paired with a hardware hinge with the flexibility of the Lenovo AI Twist PC, we could have the ideal solution for great video calls: hardware and software working in tandem for the best experience. This would prove beneficial for everyone, not just those with mobility impairments.\n\nThe challenges with a hardware-only approach\n\nThe success of Apple hardware has always been down to its integration with the software. With control over both parts, Apple can integrate features deeply to achieve specific goals. Lenovo has proven that it can do so \u2014 the Aura Edition announced at IFA in partnership with Intel is a great example of this \u2014 but to achieve a true voice-controlled computing future, Microsoft would need to build support directly into Windows.\n\nImagine a world where you say, \u201cHey, Twist, open,\u201d it opens the lid, adjusts the angle, and Windows Hello automatically logs you in. Perhaps we go further, and it knows that you have a video call, so it automatically launches Meet, Zoom, or Teams based on the calendar invite. The power of a movable hardware hinge is that it can enable an entirely new experience controlled by voice that could bring freedom to those without.\n\nNow imagine the same hinge but in a convertible product like the Yoga XYZ. If you have loved ones who live alone, a voice-controlled version of one of those products could enable you to be their remote support. Need help cooking? A quick voice command fires up a video call and flips the keyboard over so it\u2019s in tablet mode.\n\nThe same could apply to helping solve any task. Having experienced severe mobility issues after my spinal surgery and having dealt with elderly people who struggle to carry or adjust their positioning without enduring pain, the future of voice control has me truly excited about its potential impact in helping people. None of these are new use cases, but using a laptop instead of a tablet could be a unique solution.\n\nIs this the first step toward a voice-controlled AI PC in the future?\n\n\n\nMany concepts don\u2019t become viable products, but this time feels uniquely different. The hinge on the Lenovo AI Twist PC seemed to work fairly well, with strong flexibility in terms of movement and the ability to adjust the angle. The ballerina demo was a great example of how flexible this hinge is, and its mobility in following you around the room has applications that extend far beyond video calls.\n\nThe Lenovo AI Twist PC feels like a big step in the right direction. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen a company attempt something like this, and it has spurred me to think of all the different people it could have a marked impact upon. Whether it\u2019s an ongoing chronic condition or a freak occurrence that disrupts your life \u2014 like the PT visit that resulted in my spinal surgery \u2014 I\u2019ve experienced firsthand how useful a product with a voice-controlled hinge would be.\n\nThis concept was designed with very specific demos in mind. Even with two PCs playing the same video, each acted slightly differently regarding response time and fluidity. It\u2019s called a concept for a reason, but the best part of a concept is imagining how it could change our lives. Many concepts often lack clearly defined use cases \u2014 Motorola\u2019s phone as a watch concept at MWC is a good example \u2014 but the Lenovo AI Twist PC is different, as it\u2019s clear just how useful it could be.\n\nIt also shows that true artificial intelligence is about more than just creating funky graphics, removing objects, and editing to create a specific persona: When done right, AI could help the world embrace technology in new and wonderful ways. I long for a future where technology is truly intelligent, and the Lenovo AI Twist PC is a step toward making that future a reality."

Moreover, the 50-day moving average recently crossed above the 200-day MA to form a golden cross, a chart signal indicating a new uptrend.\n\nDespite the bullish technicals, the shares sit poised to break down below the triangle\u2019s lower trendline on Friday, a move that could start a new trend lower. The stock fell 9.1% to $533 in after-hours trading Thursday.\n\nWatch These Key Support Levels\n\nIf Adobe shares continue to see post-earnings weakness, investors should monitor several key support areas on the chart.\n\nThe first sits around $500, a location on the chart where the shares could find support from the psychological round number and a horizontal line connecting multiple peaks and troughs from June 2023 to August this year.\n\nA close below this level could see the stock decline to the $439 area, where investors may look for buying opportunities near a pre-gap consolidation period during the stock\u2019s impulsive move higher between May and June last year. This region also closely corresponds with the prominent May 2024 swing low.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next lower level to watch lies at $386, an area that may encounter support near several peaks that formed on the chart from early February to late April last year.\n\nFinally, a longer-term correction in the stock could see a drop to the $333 area, where the price would likely find buying interest around the May 2023 swing low. This level also aligns with a measured move price target that calculates the distance between the ascending channel\u2019s two trendline in points and subtracts that amount from the pattern's lower trendline. ($550 - $217 = $333)\n\nKey Resistence Level to Monitor\n\nDuring a countertrend move in Adobe shares, investors should keep a close eye on the $550 area, where the price may face selling pressure on retests of the ascending channel\u2019s lower trendline.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
