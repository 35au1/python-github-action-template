The article notes that a Spirit Airlines pilot described a similar observation. The air traffic controller, on the other hand, didn't have a clue what the pilots were talking about. His radar, apparently, was spotless.\"Fort Worth ATC checked in with the U.S. Air Force about possible activity over two, nearby 'military operations areas' (MOAs) \u2014 at the pilot's behest \u2014 but neither MOA had craft in the skies that night, as confirmed on radar,\"reported.One of the pilots can be heard describing how the moving, lighted objects changed speeds and \"split positions.\"Also mentioned in the story is that video clips from near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on the same night as the confused pilot calls reveal streaking lights descending from the sky. Such clips started making their way around Reddit, TikTok and other social media sites pretty quickly, leading people to begin questioning what they had just seen, just as the aforementioned pilots had.The flights each continued without further incident, and there have been no updates about what the pilots may have seen.\"After their half-hour long UFO encounter, this American Airlines flight landed in Dallas-Fort Worth around 9:42pm local time,\" the report added.This isn't the only recent example of people near DFW International Airport spotting something curious in the sky. A few days before this case, on Nov. 25, Reddit users shared video of a streaking green-ish light suddenly appearing mid-air in a post titled \"Caught a meteor on dashcam just north of DFW Airport.\"One Reddit user wasn't so sure it was a meteor, however, commenting \"the real aliens have arrived.\""

            "article_content": "A lot of AI tools promise something like magic. Just write down all the stuff you need to do, or better yet, just let the tool record every second of your life, and presto manifesto, it\u2019ll do\u2026 something. Buy plane tickets, maybe, or magically reorder your calendar to maximize your flow state. The idea is huge and enticing, that you could just live your life and your AI assistant will make everything happen on your behalf. But hardly any of it works.\n\nThe developers of the app Twos are taking a much more cautious and, as a result, much more actually useful approach. Twos is an app for taking notes, managing to-dos, and generally making lists of any and every kind \u2014 Parker Klein, the app\u2019s creator, just calls it \u201ca place to write things down.\u201d Klein has been working on the app for nearly a decade, first as a tool just for himself and most recently as a true startup. I\u2019ve been using Twos off and on for a couple of years, and there\u2019s a lot to like about the app.\n\nThe Twos AI approach, which Klein and cofounder Joe Steilberg call \u201csmart suggestions,\u201d is to use AI to help you simply take the first step in getting something done. If you write down the name of a movie, Twos might offer you a link to a JustWatch search or the IMDb page for that movie. If you write a person\u2019s name and phone number, it can add them to your contacts with one tap. If you\u2019re making a grocery list, it\u2019ll send you to Amazon or Walmart or Instacart to buy it.\n\nThe logic behind all these suggestions is really simple: Twos looks for certain words and phrases to determine what you\u2019re trying to do and which integration makes the most sense. (You can pick and choose, too \u2014 I never use Uber Eats, for instance, so I turned that off entirely.) All the smart suggestions really do is take the first step. They\u2019re definitely not perfect \u2014 when I type \u201cbake blueberry muffins,\u201d it offers me an Allrecipes link, which is helpful and relevant, and a Google Maps search for \u201cblueberry muffins around me,\u201d which is not. But even in the feature\u2019s early days, I\u2019ve found it way more useful than almost every other, vastly more ambitious productivity tool.\n\nLike any to-do list app worth its valuation, Twos now has an AI chatbot. Image: Twos\n\nTwos also has a built-in chatbot, which you can use to ask questions about your notes. If you use your note-taking app like a journal, this can be really cool \u2014 \u201cwhat was the name of that Thai food place we went to a few weeks ago?\u201d is a surprisingly common question in my life. Lots of apps have something like this, and they all suffer from the same problem: if you don\u2019t put everything in the app, the search isn\u2019t that useful. But whether it\u2019s Notion or Dropbox or Twos, the AI integrations reward the heaviest users.\n\nAI turns Twos into not just my to-do list but the jumping-off point for all my tasks. Since the app works across platforms \u2014 it\u2019s fundamentally a web app, but there are versions for Android and iOS, Windows and Mac, and more \u2014 it\u2019s easy to just dump information into. Then, when it\u2019s time to leave for the restaurant I wrote down and promptly forgot the name of, I open Twos, tap the sparkles that appear next to any item with a smart suggestion, and it opens Google Maps and directs me there. You can store and organize things inside of Twos, but I find myself using it transiently, just for the small things in day-to-day life. I need to make bread: click the sparkles, bread recipes appear. Remember to buy those Sesame Street bath toys for the kid: click the sparkles, Amazon search done. Ollie\u2019s birthday is December 7th: click the sparkles, in my contacts.\n\nFor now, the Twos smart suggestions are only available in beta testing, and there\u2019s a waitlist for new users. (Though Klein did tell me that if you sign up and use the code \u201cVerge,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to skip the line.) Klein and Steilberg are working on more integrations and more ways to do even more with just a few words of your writing. They\u2019re obviously enticed by how far this might go. Why not automatically buy the toys or start the grocery delivery and take a cut for themselves? It\u2019s an age-old idea, that one. Any.do tried it years ago; there was even a frenzy of apps like Magic that would do it all via text message. Even the Alexa business model used to depend on you being willing to just shout \u201cbuy toilet paper\u201d at your speaker and trust it to do the rest.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the idea: it doesn\u2019t work. There are too many logistical questions, too many ways to screw it up, and too many consequences for getting it wrong that it\u2019s not going to work anytime soon. If ever."

            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch adds or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Attorney Pierre Dewitte, whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

So if you have an Android phone and have been wanting to make some music with Suno away from your computer, you now have the freedom to do so.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Suno AI, the company behind the app describes it as an AI music studio. Similar to how other generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, work, it\u2019s able to generate a result based on whatever prompt you submit. In this case, it can turn text into up to four-minute full songs.\n\nSuno AI isn\u2019t the only AI music generator out there, but it sets itself apart by being able to create everything from the instrumentals to the vocals and lyrics. In the clip below, you can hear an example of a song Rolling Stone made using the AI.\n\nRolling Stone \u00b7 Soul Of The Machine The AI-powered app first made waves back in December 2023 when it partnered with Microsoft to create a plugin for Copilot. Its ability to generate music that sounds as if it were created by a human artist helped jettison its popularity. Now, if you go into the Google Play Store and search for Suno AI, you\u2019ll find a listing for the app.\n\nIn addition to having the ability to create your own songs, you\u2019ll be able to browse creations from other users. You can also curate your songs and follow other creators.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about the app is the audio quality. However, Suno recently released an update that fixed this issue and introduced a new ReMi (pronounced \u201cray me\u201d) lyric writer that can produce edgier lyrics.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Nothing is releasing its own Gallery app with Nothing OS 3.0, which has now leaked ahead of its expected December release.\n\nThe Nothing Gallery app features a clean design with basic photo management tools.\n\nAI features are absent from the update and are expected to be added in the future.\n\nNothing was amongst the first few OEMs to jump onto the Android 15 platform update bandwagon with the release of the Nothing OS 3.0 betas for its devices. Nothing is targeting a general release of Nothing OS 3.0 stable for this month, and ahead of the release, we finally have a good look at the new Nothing Gallery app that is expected to arrive along with it.\n\nNothing smartphones so far have relied on Google Photos for photo management, which isn\u2019t a bad choice at all. However, users have long requested a dedicated stock gallery app, which Nothing teased was coming with Nothing OS 3.0. However, as we noted in our Nothing OS 3.0 beta hands-on, the update was missing the Nothing Gallery app. The company shared just a glimpse of the Gallery experience, but the app has now leaked before the public launch. We\u2019ve installed it on our device, and this is what it looks like:\n\nAs you can see, the Nothing Gallery app takes a more simplistic approach to a photo management app. You can choose which folders to show in the Photos view. The Photos view is a giant universal feed of all images on your device, so a filtering option is much appreciated here. You can pinch in and out to change the density of photos on display.\n\nWhen viewing a photo, the image preview bar at the bottom allows you to scroll through other images, which is a nice touch for quickly locating adjacent photos. A persistent toolbar is also present at the bottom, letting you mark an image as Favorite, share it, delete it, and access more menu options with the three-dot menu button. The menu button has further options, which helps avoid cluttering the toolbar with buttons used less often.\n\nWhen viewing videos, the persistent toolbar also gets a play/pause button and a volume control button. There is no visible seekbar, though, but the time played and total duration of the video are visible.\n\nThe Albums view further lets you filter down to a specific folder only. You can also create new folders/albums here. It also has a folder for recently deleted files, allowing you to make mistakes, just in case you accidentally delete something you shouldn\u2019t have. There\u2019s also a Search view that lets you search through all images.\n\nIf the entire UX looks too bright and white to you, then thankfully, there\u2019s a dark theme here, too. However, we could not locate an independent toggle for it, so the theme appears to be entirely dependent on your system theme. We also noticed that the Nothing Gallery app supports XDR/Ultra HDR photos.\n\nYou can get a better look at the app in our experience video below:\n\nCuriously, we could not locate any AI features within the Gallery app. Nothing had mentioned the following in its announcement: Gallery will include in the future: automatic AI image categorisation, \u201cmore natural language search,\u201d and more AI features like AI Upscaling and Super Resolution and AI Image Generation. Given that the Nothing Gallery app is currently in beta, it\u2019s possible that Nothing meant that these features will be present in the future. The company may also make further changes and adjustments to the UX and features since this is not the final release. You can sideload the APK on non-Nothing devices, but the app will not work unless you make further changes, and we do not recommend going down that route.\n\nHow do you like the Nothing Gallery app so far?

            "article_content": "I love a good show about teenagers fighting supernatural entities while also facing the mortifying ordeal of being a high school student. So Netflix\u2019s Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld, which not only sees a superpowered teenage girl battle demons but also draws from Chinese mythology, seems like it was created in a lab just for me. From the first trailer, I had high expectations. With bright, bold colors and character designs, compelling character relationships, and some very funky monsters and action sequences, it really checked all my boxes.\n\nBut there\u2019s one specific scene that I can\u2019t stop thinking about, because it so perfectly exemplifies the tone of this show and why it works so well.\n\n[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld.]\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld kicks off when 16-year-old Jentry (Ali Wong) learns that a demon is after her for the powers she\u2019s suppressed for most of her life. She must return to her hometown in Texas with her great-aunt Gugu (Lori Tan Chinn) in order to close a portal to the underworld and prevent more monsters from wreaking havoc in the world. All the while, she tries to fit in with her new (old?) classmates and slowly learns more about her own past and Gugu\u2019s refusal to reveal more about her parents.\n\nAbout halfway through the show, Jentry discovers that Kit (Woosung Kim), the new boy at school with big, dreamy eyes, is actually a Painted Skin demon from Chinese mythology. This means that he\u2019s actually a long-limbed shadowy demon who must construct elaborate disguises out of human skin to conceal his true form. Jentry is initially hurt by this revelation, but she eventually seeks his help to create a skin form in her image for a heist.\n\nCue a montage where the two of them carefully sew together a Jentry skin in Kit\u2019s dimly lit workshop while a soft romantic song plays. Kit cuts into a roll of flesh so that it best replicates Jentry\u2019s body, and gently tilts her face up so he can measure her chin. Jentry is mildly disgusted when Kit rifles through a bin of body parts and asks him to warn her when he picks the eyes, to which he replies he already knows the exact match for her eyes, because he\u2019s imagined them so often \u2014 and Jentry blushes.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt\u2019s a bit gross. It\u2019s incredibly intimate. It\u2019s uncanny, yet super romantic. It\u2019s adorably reminiscent of a budding high school romance, and also like something out of The Silence of the Lambs. But it\u2019s emblematic of how showrunner Echo Wu has marvelously leaned into the wonderfully weird, both with the paranormal elements and the more grounded stakes.\n\nThe show leans pretty hard on the more terrifying aspects of Chinese mythology, like a trip to Diyu, the Daoist version of hell, where souls are tortured for eons. The bright colors and cartoonish character designs keep the show firmly planted in PG territory, but it does get a bit freaky, in a good way. At one point, for instance, the house ghosts need to generate some more ectoplasm, so one of them volunteers to be brutally maimed \u2014 off screen, but with some screaming \u2014 in order to generate just a splash of magical ghost fluid. And even with those darker elements, the tone never gets too dire, and a lot of the fun comes from the weird situations and paranormal entities that Jentry and her friends encounter.\n\nAnd because Wu is tapping into a cultural mythos that American animation hasn\u2019t fully explored, none of the supernatural plotlines feel overdone (do we really need another broody vampire when we can have a Painted Skin demon?). American cartoons have long flirted with Chinese mythology, without actually delivering. American Dragon: Jake Long and The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, two animated shows that aired in the mid-2000s, also featured a young Chinese American protagonist guided by an elderly relative to battle monsters \u2014 but both shows primarily prioritized Western mythology, only incidentally pulling in Chinese legends. Jentry Chau does the reverse: By default, everything Jentry encounters is from Chinese mythology, mixing in other cultural perspectives without assuming that the default is Western. It\u2019s a unique lens, and one that really lets the show shine and avoid any trite cliches.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld. Ali Wong as Jentry in Jentry Chau vs the Underworld. Cr. COURTESY OF NETFLIX \u00a9 2024 Image: Netflix\n\nBut even with the fun paranormal side, Wu never loses sight of the show\u2019s more realistic threads. At the end of the day, Jentry is a teenage girl who just wants to be normal. Her relationships with her friends, her secretive great-aunt, and her own self might be colored by the paranormal, but they all feel very rooted in realism. The scene with Kit works so well because even though it\u2019s a demon making a skin costume, it\u2019s also about teenage crushes and complicated feelings (and the fact that those complicated feelings stem from your crush actually being a demonic creature). Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld certainly isn\u2019t the only high school supernatural romp out there, but Wu takes care to balance the fantastical elements with the real ones.\n\nStill, the show works so well because Wu isn\u2019t afraid to get weird. As both a coming-of-age story and a supernatural show, Jentry Chau could easily fall into some cliched genre pitfalls. But Wu doesn\u2019t let that happen, simply by embracing the funkier beats and really letting them sing. It\u2019s in the little details in the background, like Jentry\u2019s Lisa Frank leopard poster and Gugu\u2019s crocs. And it\u2019s also in the bigger scenes, like that romantic moment between Jentry and Kit, set against the sewing of a flesh suit. Now that\u2019s something special \u2014 and the whole show is a special, weird gem that sparkles with neon intensity.\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld is available to stream on Netflix now."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA 1 sites of MenB PS I. Credit: Science Advances (2024). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adp4937\n\nA team of researchers has revealed the structure of a modified and evolved version of Photosystem I (PS I), a key protein complex used by plants and cyanobacteria to convert sunlight into chemical energy. This discovery sheds light on the evolution and adaptation of photosynthetic organisms and could potentially lead to new, highly efficient systems for producing renewable solar fuels.\n\nThe research was led by K.V. Lakshmi at RPI's Baruch '60 Center for Biochemical Solar Energy Research. The center, established by Johanna and Tom Baruch, RPI Class of 1960 and Trustee Emeritus, is focused on understanding and enhancing the rates of photosynthetic processes, such as light harvesting, electron transport, and increasing the yield of products under changing environmental conditions.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process that powers life on Earth by allowing plants and certain bacteria to harness sunlight and produce chemical energy. One crucial part of this process is the photosynthetic protein PS I, which helps turn light into usable chemical energy.\n\nBy examining the structure and function of PS I in unprecedented detail, scientists can understand the adaptation of photosynthetic processes under changing environmental conditions and learn to harness them for human-made artificial solar energy systems that could produce renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, a clean energy source.\n\nIn a new breakthrough study published in the journal Science Advances, the researchers focused on a modified version of PS I isolated from a cyanobacterium (a.k.a., blue-green algae). Although natural PS I contains a molecule called phylloquinone to transfer electrons, evolution and adaptation led to a variant with an alternate molecule called DMPBQ.\n\nSwapping the phylloquinone molecule is a major discovery, as it can help scientists understand how organisms can adapt their photosynthetic machinery to varying environmental conditions. This discovery suggests that the electron carrier can be swapped with other molecules that could allow PS I to be connected to catalysts that generate hydrogen, effectively turning the protein into a tiny solar-powered fuel factory.\n\nThe electron transfer chain cofactors of PS I from WT Synechocystis 6803 and the MenB deletion variant. Credit: Science Advances (2024). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adp4937\n\nThe study used a cutting-edge technique known as cryogenic electron microscopy to capture a highly detailed picture of the modified PS I. With a resolution of 2.0 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms (less than a millionth of a millimeter), the research provided new insights into how PS I interacts with different quinones\u2014molecules involved in the transfer of electrons, which is essential for converting sunlight into energy.\n\nThese new insights will help scientists understand how and why these molecules are swapped as photosynthetic organisms evolve and adapt in nature, and in the future, may inform a design for improved versions of PS I for creating solar fuels.\n\nAccording to Lakshmi, the lead corresponding author of the study, \"Increasing global population and climate change uncertainties have compelled enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and yields over the coming decades. This presents a need for a thorough understanding of the adaptation of photosynthetic systems to changes in the environment and the key factors limiting photosynthesis.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

The discovery is part of a larger effort to create engineered photosynthetic systems that use natural processes to produce renewable fuels,\" said the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Chris Gisriel (formerly at Yale University), a primary author of the publication.\n\nCurrent methods for producing hydrogen often rely on fossil fuels or inefficient processes, but PS I-based systems have the potential to revolutionize the field by providing a more sustainable and effective solution. This work lays the foundation for further research into bioengineered energy systems and could eventually contribute to the development of large-scale, eco-friendly fuel production, helping to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and combat climate change.\n\nMore information: Christopher J.

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system."

            "article_content": "Recently, Amazon announced a multi-year partnership with Orbital Materials to use their \u2018proprietary AI platform\u2019 to develop new materials that help decarbonise their data centres. Orbital is synthesising and designing advanced materials for data centre-integrated carbon removal and cooling technology for Amazon.\n\n\u201cTogether, AWS and Orbital will evaluate the scalability and performance of these new technologies in removing carbon and increasing efficiency,\u201d said Amazon in the report.\n\nOrbital, like any other materials science lab using AI, said that the development of new materials has \u2018traditionally been a slow process of trial and error in the lab,\u2019 and generative AI has significantly improved the timeframe for discovering these materials.\n\n\u201cOrbital has achieved a 10x improvement in its material\u2019s performance through the use of its AI platform\u2014an order of magnitude faster than traditional development and breaking new ground in carbon removal efficacy,\u201d the startup announced. The company also plans to deploy and test these carbon removal technologies by the end of 2025.\n\nOrbital\u2019s claims of a \u2018radical\u2019 improvement in the speed of material discovery are also backed by research findings from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), suggesting we\u2019re living in a golden age of material discovery.\n\nThe Golden Age of Materials Science?\n\nRecent research from MIT outlines the potential of AI technologies and their assistance to scientists, specifically those working on materials science. The author revealed statistics after handing over \u2018new materials discovery technology\u2019 to 1018 scientists in an unnamed \u2018R&D lab of a large US firm\u2019.\n\nThe data showed a 44% increase in new material discovery, a 39% increase in patent filings, and a 17% increase in product prototypes that incorporated these newly discovered materials.\n\n\u201cTrained on the composition and characteristics of existing materials, the model generates recipes for novel compounds predicted to possess specified properties,\u201d said Aidan Toner-Rodgers.\n\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that 82% of scientists reported a reduced level of satisfaction with their work, as they found that leveraging AI decreased creativity and skill underutilisation.\n\nThe advent of AI revolutionising materials science began last year, when Google DeepMind released research titled \u2018Scaling deep learning for material discovery\u2019, where they discovered 2.2 million new crystals, equivalent to 800 years of work of knowledge. Out of which, 380,000 materials were stable materials.\n\n\u201cFor example, 52,000 new layered compounds similar to graphene have the potential to revolutionise electronics with the development of superconductors,\u201d said DeepMind in the announcement.\n\nGoogle DeepMind went beyond discovery and also published another research stating that 41 out of 58 selected materials were successfully synthesised in just 17 days.\n\nMeta marked its foray into material size by releasing a massive data set called Open Materials 2024, or OMat24. The dataset contains over 118 million examples of material simulations and structures, focusing on a wide range of inorganic bulk materials to improve AI-enabled material discovery.\n\nNew Materials, Really?\n\nDeep learning has amplified materials research and discovery for a few years now. However, if there\u2019s one way AI can save humanity, it lies in not just discovering new materials, but also finding ways to synthesise and manufacture them in commercial capabilities.\n\nWhen Google Deepmind made the announcement last year, the company did not take long for contradictory results to come into the picture, where a researcher said that many of the materials discovered weren\u2019t truly novel and were just minor variations of known compounds. It also said that Google Deepmind mostly focused on the stability of the materials, overlooking functionalities that are required for practical applications.\n\nMoreover, Google\u2019s claim of synthesising these newly discovered materials using an autonomous lab is also facing scrutiny, thanks to a study from Princeton University. The researchers here outright deny Google Deepmind\u2019s claim. They said that none of the materials produced by the autonomous lab were new and that the majority were misclassified.\n\nThe authors also say that a majority of the synthetic products were wrongly characterised. It failed to distinguish between materials with random and organised atomic arrangements. In short, the authors said that AI can generate predictions but will struggle to interpret experimental results accurately.\n\nWhen Do I Use It\n\nPresuming these challenges are overcome in discovering and synthesising new materials, but when can we hold these new materials?\n\nIt is indeed a very long journey. Benjamin Reinhardt, CEO at Speculative Technologies, puts it best in his work: Getting materials out of the Lab.\n\n\u201cYou can think of lab-scale materials as the most artisanal products in the world, painstakingly handcrafted by people with advanced degrees. Like any artisanal product, lab-scale materials are expensive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTrying to mass-produce these materials by simply increasing the number of fume hoods, test tubes, and pipette wielders would make them cost billions of dollars per kilogram.\u201d\n\nMass-producing or scaling these newly discovered materials remains a challenge. From analysing the materials\u2019 failure modes in controlled conditions to setting up an industrial-scale factory, following regulations, and justifying the choices to investors and customers, one is surely set to turn into Sisyphus.\n\nScientists, mostly working in universities, have strong incentives to focus on novelty and one-off demonstrations because these can lead to publications and positive media attention.\n\n\u201cStart-ups commercialising a new material face many headwinds, including often-unavoidable relationships with larger companies, trade-offs between speed and profit margins, and capital constraints,\u201d said Reinhardt.\n\nMoreover, newly discovered materials need to go through a lot of testing, and the world has seen quite a few tragedies when they\u2019re put out in the real world. For instance, carbon fibre, and composite materials are all the rage. We don\u2019t need to look far behind in the history books. In the recent OceanGate\u2019s tragic implosion, the Titan submersible was using an \u2018experimental carbon fibre composite hull\u2019. It was the first instance of the material being used in a submersible.\n\nAn investigation revealed that the hull may have been prone to micro buckling and delamination under deepsea pressures. Small manufacturing imperfections in carbon-fiber material could amplify such issues.\n\nIn 2017, the Grenfell Tower fire in London, claimed 72 lives owing to the building\u2019s exterior cladding. It was made of aluminium composite panel panels with a polyethylene core and flammable insulation materials. The combination led to a rapid spread of fire, and investigations revealed that manufacturers exploited loopholes in regulation.\n\nTherefore, there will be an increased sense of caution before these materials come to life. In the essay, Reinhardt also provided a dataset that visualises the timeline from when materials were discovered and fully commercialised.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. The next time it seems exciting when AI has discovered new materials, it\u2019s time to give ourselves a reality check. There\u2019s no doubt AI has the potential to speed up the manufacturing process as well, but we\u2019re yet to see how.\n\n[This story has been read by 258 unique individuals.]\n\n\n\n"

There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.\u201d\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren\u2019t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can\u2019t do that, says Bryk: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.\u201d\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn\u2019t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it\u2019s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user\u2019s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven\u2019t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today\u2019s AI search engines as a sandwich with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nMore than keywords\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here\u2019s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users\u2019 queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nA screenshot of Websets showing results for the search: \"companies; startups; US-based; healthcare focus; technical co-founder\"\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa\u2019s search engine predicts the next link. Type \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa\u2019s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That\u2019s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn\u2019t see this as a problem: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embed the whole web to be useful,\u201d he says. (Fun fact: \u201cexa\u201d means a 1 followed by 18 0s and \u201cgoogol\u201d means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)"

The study identifies the most widely used free and open-source software (FOSS) as application libraries. Among its key insights, the study underlines the ongoing importance of open source collaboration.\n\nCensus III is the third study investigating the widespread use of open source software and provides the most comprehensive aggregation of data to date. Derived from over 12 million observations of FOSS libraries in production applications at more than ten thousand companies, the report highlights critical trends shaping the open source ecosystem.\n\nThe Census III effort was conducted in partnership with Harvard University and leading software composition analysis (SCA) organizations, including Black Duck, FOSSA, Snyk, and Sonatype. This collaboration advances the state of open source research by combining insights and resources to better understand the value and security of the OSS ecosystem.\n\nKey Findings of Census III Report\n\nThe report highlights several key trends and insights, such as: The use of cloud service-specific packages is increasing. There is an ongoing transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Maven packages continue to be widely used, and there is an increased prevalence of NuGet and Python packages. Use of components from Rust package repositories has increased considerably since Census II. There continues to be a need for the use of standardized naming schema for software components. Much of the most widely used FOSS is developed by only a handful of contributors. Individual developer account security is increasingly important. Legacy software persists in the open-source space.\n\nCensus III is authored by Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School; Kate Powell, Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard; Richie Zitomer, Harvard Business School; and David A. Wheeler, Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), The Linux Foundation.\n\nTo read the report, download the Census III of Free and Open Source Software\u2014Application Libraries research study on the Linux Foundation website.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\nLinux Foundation\n\n\"Understanding the health and security posture of open source software is a critical step to ensure its sustainability. Census III underscores the importance of identifying and supporting widely used open-source components, complementing Linux Foundation projects, initiatives, and security-focused research, and it comes at a critical time as we navigate regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act. These insights are vital for prioritizing resources in our efforts to steward a secure and resilient open source ecosystem.\"\n\n-Hilary Carter, SVP Research, The Linux Foundation\n\nOpenSSF\n\n\u201cFOSS is now ubiquitous, serving as a foundational infrastructure of society. However, its success has also made it a target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. This study provides valuable insights that will help individuals and organizations worldwide prioritize their investments to significantly reduce both the recurrence and impact of vulnerabilities in FOSS\u2014both unintentional and malicious. This marks a critical step in safeguarding our software supply chains against attacks and ensuring they deliver reliable, high-quality results.\u201d\n\n- David A. Wheeler, Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security, Open Source Software Foundation (OpenSSF)\n\nHarvard Business School\n\n\u201cFree and open source software has become the backbone of the digital economy. However, understanding which projects are critical to sustaining the FOSS ecosystem is difficult since there is limited ability to centrally measure the most widely used packages. Census III provides deep and broad insights into this problem as it measures which FOSS packages companies are most heavily reliant on and offers guidance for organizations and individuals who want to invest to support and secure this essential public good.\u201d\n\n- Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School\n\nBlack Duck\n\n\u201cThe ubiquity of FOSS as both foundational software and as an innovation engine demands that companies understand that the health of the FOSS they consume is a business risk just as any other supply chain risk. If there are only a handful of contributors to a critical component or if the supplier is effectively one anonymous GitHub user account, the cybersecurity and software hygiene decisions of those individuals could introduce unexpected business risks.\u201d\n\n- Tim Mackey, Head of Software Supply Chain Risk Strategy, Black Duck\n\nFOSSA\n\n\u201cThis third multi-party open-source census from the Linux Foundation and Harvard is an important examination of the FOSS ecosystem, and I'm proud FOSSA was asked to contribute again. The report clearly reaffirms the ubiquity and continued growing influence of open source on the economy, but more than that, it plays a material part in the trend towards greater transparency. Government regulations, industry initiatives, and research like this are all instrumental in improving the software supply chain through open communication, which ultimately builds trust. On behalf of the thousands of organizations who use FOSSA and share our love of open source, thank you!\u201d\n\n- Kevin Wang, CEO, FOSSA\n\nSnyk\n\n\"Free and Open Source Software forms the backbone of modern technology, yet its decentralized nature presents challenges in understanding its true impact and vulnerabilities. Efforts like the Free and Open Software Census are pivotal, combining community-driven data with analytical rigor to help the industry identify critical dependencies and prioritize investments. By sharing data and fostering collaboration among developers, organizations, policymakers, and academia, we can secure and sustain the health of this invaluable ecosystem for the digital economy\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n- Danny Allan, Chief Technology Officer, Snyk\n\nSonatype\n\n\"Sonatype is proud to contribute to the Census III effort as part of our commitment to strengthening the open source ecosystem. By providing critical data and insights into FOSS usage, we aim to empower organizations to make informed decisions about securing their software supply chains.\"\n\n- Brian Fox, Co-Founder and CTO, Sonatype\n\nBackground on Census Projects I & II\n\nThe original Census Project (\u201cCensus I\u201d), conducted in 2015, centered on identifying critical software packages within the Debian Linux distribution that are essential to server operations and security. This initial effort provided a foundational understanding of the most vital components of the FOSS ecosystem, helping stakeholders prioritize their security and maintenance efforts.\n\nCensus II expanded the scope to include a broader analysis of language-level FOSS packages commonly used in applications developed by both private and public organizations. By broadening the lens beyond Debian, this phase captured a more comprehensive view of how FOSS is integrated into diverse applications and infrastructure, providing deeper insights into the dependencies that organizations rely on for their day-to-day operations.\n\nBuilding on these efforts, Census III takes the initiative even further by leveraging anonymized usage data from leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) partners. This collaboration allows for a more robust and data-driven understanding of FOSS adoption and security trends. With this enhanced dataset, Census III offers actionable insights to help stakeholders better prioritize resources and address critical security challenges within the FOSS ecosystem. This progression underscores the growing need for collaboration and coordination across the industry to sustain and secure the vital infrastructure that FOSS represents.\n\nAdditional Resources"
