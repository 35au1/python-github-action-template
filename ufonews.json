            "article_content": "We need less uproar over everyday drones and more critical attention about ones near airports and other restricted airspace\n\nDecember\u2019s spate of drone sightings seen in New Jersey and spreading nationwide, sure looks familiar. As does its associated media frenzy\u2014culminating in memes and conspiracy theories about so-called \u201cmystery drones.\u201d The episode bears an eerie resemblance to the UFO phenomenon, or the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) one, that spiked in recent years and has led to significant congressional attention and legislation.\n\nIn a way, this is progress. The reason this outbreak looks so familiar is that such drone sightings would previously have been identified as UAP ones. It\u2019s only after years of concerted efforts in education, and transparency by U.S. Department of Defense officials, that UAP sightings have rightfully evolved into common drone identification. That is not to say that the drone sightings are any less of a concern, but fortunately, we can address them without the contagion of the UFO community and the conspiracies associated with it.\n\nUnfortunately, our response has been no less irrational.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nA New Jersey state assemblyman has accused federal officials of \u201clying to us\u201d about drones on CNN. The president-elect suggested we \u201cshoot them down!!!\u201d which is almost (but only almost, sadly) needless to say, a bad idea. So is wasting resources to investigate nonsensical notions of advanced technology related to Iran or, again, aliens. Calls for shooting objects down not only have obvious safety issues but fail to recall that Congress and the White House limited such strikes over U.S. territory after the incidents involving the Chinese high-altitude balloon and other balloons, based on concerns about civilian safety.\n\nThere are a couple of things we need to make clear about the drone sightings. First, many of the sightings remain mistaken interpretations of manned aircraft or satellites such as Starlink ones. The real drone sightings fall into two classes: those that are in restricted airspace, and those that are in legal airspace. Restricted airspace surrounds airports as well as national security areas such as Air Force and Navy bases. Most sightings reported fall within the latter category and have been assessed as having no immediate national security or flight safety risk, although the public finds them annoying.\n\nOne fact that many people tend to overlook, or at least don\u2019t readily rationalize, is that these drones have lights on them. That lights are present on various flying objects including drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) is a fact I often referred to in my last job, heading a Pentagon office investigating UAP sightings. Lights on a drone are for collision avoidance. They are a safety feature. Flying drones with lights ensures they can be seen; if they were meant to be unnoticed, the operators would turn off or disable the lights. In September 2023, the FAA changed the rules to allow drones to fly at night this way, and this is likely a contributing factor to the increase in sightings. The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.\n\nCongressional officials and that unfortunate source of information, social media, continue to make unfounded claims of drone technologies far ahead of U.S. capabilities. The most recent example being the assertion that drones flew from an Iranian mother ship off the coast of the U.S. and demonstrated seven or eight hours of battery life. That fantastic assertion requires there to be evidence that the drones originated from an Iranian ship and were tracked continuously to the U.S. cities. There are no such tracks. The more rational explanation is that they originated near the place of the sighting, that is from domestic operators.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean some drone operations aren\u2019t ill-intentioned.\n\nSeveral hypotheses (apart from mistaken identity) might explain these drones in legal airspace. They might be academic, professional or hobbyist domestic operators exploring a new technology. YouTube overflows with drone footage from amateur photographers all over the world. Flying in urban settings, in legal airspace, for photography or maybe even some research such as high resolution thermal or pollution measurements is very plausible. Or they are commercial. Increased commercial activity is unavoidable as industry advances drone technology for delivery, remote sensing and communications.\n\nMore concerning, operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace. Whether foreign or domestic bad actors, they could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is. That information on reactions and response could readily feed back to some sort of attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.\n\nFinally, the operators could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic. It could be for personal gain (such as claiming they have the anti-UAV solution to sell), or perhaps advertising something resembling another History Channel series on aliens.\n\nMuch like the UAP problem, there is little evidence to support, or rule out, any of these hypotheses. Like UAP, the drones don\u2019t likely all have the same explanation. That makes it hard from a national security perspective to distinguish when a sighting is benign versus potentially nefarious. Lest we forget the lessons of the ongoing war on Ukraine, we don\u2019t want to be caught in an intelligence or technical surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, the sightings that are clearly in restricted airspace usually have more obvious intentions. These can range from benign to nefarious, but generally center around seeing things that are normally not allowed. Whether this is military aircraft, commercial airports or operations, these clearly identified drones and balloons with payloads pose not only a security risk but also a flight safety risk. It would only take one small quad copter to get sucked into a commercial jet engine to end in tragedy.\n\nThe proliferation of drone technology, in its commercial, recreational, scientific and military uses, is clearly disrupting the world around us. Our legislation and regulation have created an environment that allows for legal drone usage. It should come as no surprise then that drones are in the air and increasing. Yet here we are, once again with more extraordinary claims, public demands for transparency, baseless accusations of hiding the truth, and congressional calls for more legislation over a mystery in the sky, instead of a rational scientific approach to the investigation. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

He added: \"[The moon] was a dimly lit waning gibbous.\"\n\nThe military witness has spoken out following a spate of sightings of drones across the US, each lighting up the nights' skies.

The professional, who reported this episode to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), added: \"I observed it for at least a minute before fear took over and I sank back down into the bed of my truck and into my sleeping bag.\"\n\nSome of the latest incidents have included sightings of orbs the size of cars. Community leaders are \"livid,\" according to journalist and author Michael Shellenberger, who obtained audio from a video briefing delivered to more than 500 New Jersey mayors by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nHe told Fox News: \"One of them [i.e. a mayor] got up there and said, 'I had two automobile-sized drones hovering over my house.'\"\n\nPolice at US Army's Picatinny Arsenal have reported 11 confirmed and unauthorised drone sightings there since mid-November. Security officers described \"flashing red, green, and white lights\" with no obvious explaination."

            "article_content": "CHINA has unveiled the world's first sixth-generation fighter jet - an ultra-stealth spy craft without a tail.\n\nSocial media was flooded with footage showing the futuristic \"super weapon\", touted by experts as the \"most advanced\u201d ever, arcing through the sky.\n\n6 The clearest image of the new Chinese stealth jet Credit: X\n\n6 A still from the viral footage of the test flight Credit: Twitter / @TheInsiderPaper\n\n6\n\nThe sixth-generation jet test flight is the latest in a flurry of advancements in the Chinese military aircraft programme.\n\nMilitary experts have said the latest model marks a significant shift in aerial dominance towards China.\n\nThe video shows the huge grey jet, named unofficially as the J-36, gliding through the air in broad daylight.\n\nThe diamond-shaped \"modified delta wing\" design has a huge surface area, blotting out a large area of the sky.\n\nNo official information has been released about the jet, but it is believed to be the first sixth-generation fighter jet to be publicly exhibited in the world.\n\nIt has been claimed the Chinese government wanted footage of the new jet to circulate online because they made no effort to stop the spread of information.\n\nThe test flight also came on December 26, thought to have been deliberately chosen to coincide with the birthday of the dictator Mao Zedong, who founded the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nSeveral countries including the US have been racing to develop a sixth-generation jet so, if confirmed, this would mark a significant victory for the Chinese air force.\n\nThe new jet was flanked by a two-seater Chengdu J-20S chase plane, allowing for some comparison.\n\nThe unique design of the new aircraft is tailless, meaning it uses computers rather than vertical stabilisers to maintain control.\n\nTailless designs are much harder to detect with radar, indicating the jet is likely to be used for stealth missions.\n\nIt also makes the craft more aerodynamic by reducing drag, so it could be used for long-rang endurance flights.\n\nImages suggest the new plane is at least as long as the J-20, which is around 70ft.\n\nHypersonic \u2018jumbo jet ROCKET\u2019 hits 5,000mph in major step toward goal of flying passengers anywhere on Earth in 60mins\n\nThe body of the jet is very large compared to its length meaning it can carry large quantities of fuel, again suggesting it will be deployed on long-range missions.\n\nThe \u201cmost unusual\u201d feature of the jet is the position of the air intakes on top of the fuselage and on either side.\n\nThis has led to speculation of a \u201chighly unorthodox\u201d three-engine arrangement.\n\nEuan Graham, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the new designs \"show the willingness of China's aviation industry to experiment and innovate\".\n\n\"Whatever the merits or demerits, it appears to be a highly original design,\" he said.\n\n\"They deserve kudos for that, and should shake off any lingering complacency that the U.S. and its allies always set the pace.\"\n\nThe flight jet took to the skies over Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan province, and is thought to have been manufactured by the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC).\n\nA few hours after the jet took flight, footage began to emerge of a second new, slightly smaller aircraft launched from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation facility.\n\nRace to create 6th Generation fighter jets Sixth-generation fighter jets are the most advanced aircraft design - one up on the fifth generation jets already deployed by various airforces. Multiple countries have been known to be attempting to develop a sixth-generation fighter, including China, the US and Russia. Other countries have joined forces on sixth-gen projects, such as the UK, Japan and Italy in the Global Combat Air Programme, and France, Germany and Spain with FCAS. Sixth-generation fighter concepts share several distinct characteristics, such as the inclusion of AI and advanced stealth capabilities. If the jet spotted in the video footage is indeed a sixth-generation fighter jet, then China appears to have taken a significant step forward at the front of the race. The debut of the J-36 jet challenges US superiority in the skies and could have serious implications for India, which currently lacks a stealth fighter jet. It is anticipated the US will deploy its first sixth-generation fighter to the field around 2030.\n\n6 The new jet, on the left, accompanied by a Chinese Chengdu J-20S Credit: X\n\nThe demo of the new plane comes just a month after China unveiled the J-35 fighter jet, which bore a striking similarity to an American design, the F-35.\n\nIt was even claimed that the fifth generation fighter was built from designs for the American craft which were stolen by Xi Jinping's agents.\n\nAt the airshow the China released plans for a mysterious \"White Emperor\" jet design - capable of dropping devastating weapons from space.\n\nHowever, it is not thought this was the design captured in the recent footage.\n\nChina is also vying to take on the US \"Son of Concorde\" with an even faster supersonic jet that could blast from London to New York City in less than two hours.\n\nBeijing-based Space Transportation - also known as Lingkong Tianxing Technology - has been carrying out test flights and recently reached a speed of 3,106 mph which is four times the speed of sound, according to Chinese media.\n\n6 There has been no official information released about the new jet Credit: X"

            "article_content": "Most people, when they think about AI, focus on applications such as image generation or chatbots. But as we're starting to learn, there is so much more to artificial intelligence than these simple tools.\n\nAs well as the high-specification AI products, which help with science, deep research and other heavyweight needs, AI is also extremely useful in the softer sciences.\n\nOur existence is made up of relationships \u2014 work, family, friendships, they're all part of the important mix of life. So let's take a quick look and see how our computerized friend can help us navigate the tricky waters around our important social activities.\n\nIt's important to remember, however, that AI will never be a substitute for real-life engagement or professional guidance. This is just an example of how you can use AI, not professional advice.\n\n1. Communications\n\nSo much of the hard work relating to relationships comes from simply navigating communications. It's no surprise that large language models, which are the bedrock of today's AI, excel at language. We can use this ability to significantly improve our interactions.\n\nA growing number of people use their chatbot as a sounding board, to ask for advice on how to deal with tricky communications. Things said or unsaid.\n\nA simple tool is to give ChatGPT something you plan to send to a friend, loved one or even a colleague and ask: \"Can I phrase this better?\"\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n2. Conflict resolution\n\nInterview roleplay with GPT-4o voice and vision - YouTube Watch On\n\nOne of the sad but true facts about relationships is the fact that they involve a fair amount of conflict in one way or another. Chatbots can offer feedback on tricky episodes, as well as suggestions for how to overcome certain positions.\n\nEven asking simple questions about how to apologize, or requesting help with mediation is a valuable way to use the power of AI language.\n\nFor those who need something a little more structured, the Flamme app may be a worthwhile investment. It offers a wide range of options and is available on iPhone and Android. Essentially, it offers advice on interacting with your partner every day including tips and information.\n\n3. Mental Health\n\nAgain, this is not advice, merely a list of tips and apps you can use with AI.\n\nThere's a growing palette of AI tools being deployed for mental health applications. These cover the range from simple mood apps, which check your current state of mind and help to improve it, to deep therapy products which are designed to work alongside professional mental health services.\n\nOne such tool is Youper, which is a CBT chatbot designed to help people with emotional issues. Always check with medical professionals.\n\n4. Organizational tool\n\nA lot of the negative issues arising out of relationships come from simple bad planning. Forgetting appointments, losing track of obligations or simply not contributing our share to a workload. Again AI can come to the rescue through the use of a variety of tools to help manage these kinds of daily demands.\n\nThe free Trevor AI app is one such example amongst many. It combines an AI assistant with an organizer, to-do list manager and more.\n\n5. Social skills aid\n\nHave you ever wished you were more socially adept? You're not alone, millions of people across the world feel like they fail to cope with basic social skills. We can use artificial intelligence to help practice these skills, because they can be learned just like any other skill.\n\nRole-playing, active listening sessions and empathy exercises are all part of the things we can use to improve ourselves.\n\nThere are a number of commercial apps which can be used for this purpose, although many are just wrappers for the standard AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic and the rest. It's probably just as valid to use a standard chatbot in the first instance.\n\n6. Memory aid\n\nIt pays to remember the simple things in our relationships. Even banal issues like forgetting birthdays or anniversaries can be a cause of conflict and discord.\n\nBy using AI technology to manage our memory, calendar or even alarm clock, we can encourage smooth sailing in every way.\n\nSetting reminders for gift ideas is a very quick win. This type of feature is likely to become more common in standard AI models as the memory functions improve over time.\n\n7. General relationships\n\nIt may sound a little excessive, but by using an AI advisor to help us with relationship expectations at the beginning of an important life journey, we can proactively prevent issues down the line.\n\nWe can also use AI to help us with cultural and language gaps which may occur in our personal interactions.\n\nFinally, using AI to help with relationship goal setting in a collaborative way can be very useful. By working together on these kinds of tasks, we can probably strengthen the depth of our connection in subtle but important ways."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, scientists think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Yet most of the hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile</\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "The thing you need to know about OpenAI, according to OpenAI, is that its only goal is to solve \u201cthe most important challenge of our time\u201d in order to benefit all of humanity and the whole world.\n\nThat will continue to be the case, the organization said in an announcement on Friday, even as it restructures itself from a corporation controlled by a nonprofit to a stand-alone corporation that happens to throw a lot of money at an affiliated nonprofit.\n\nHow does this restructuring help OpenAI fulfill its mission of benefiting all humans and things non-human? Well, it\u2019s simple. OpenAI\u2019s \u201ccurrent structure does not allow the Board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission.\u201d Under the new structure, OpenAI\u2019s leadership will finally be able to raise more money and pay attention to the needs of the billionaires and trillion-dollar tech firms that invest in it. Voila, everyone benefits.\n\nNot mentioned in the press release is the fact that a year ago the non-profit board that oversaw OpenAI unsuccessfully tried to give CEO Sam Altman the boot for \u201coutright lying\u201d in ways that, according to former board member Helen Toner, made it difficult for the board to ensure that the company\u2019s \u201cpublic good mission was primary, was coming first\u2014over profits, investor interests, and other things,\u201d\n\nWith its new structure, OpenAI wants to maintain at least a facade of altruism. The for-profit company will be incorporated as a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation, which means that its board can consider how the company\u2019s actions impact stakeholders like employees and customers in addition to its fiduciary responsibility to shareholders (Corporate law experts have pointed out that normal corporations are also perfectly free to do this).\n\nOther publicly traded Delaware Public Benefit Corporations include Laureate Education, which operates a string of for-profit universities around the world, including one that was accused multiple times of misleading students about the cost of its degree programs (Laureate sold Walden University prior to the university settling a class action lawsuit earlier this year for $28.5 million). Another is Lemonade Inc., an insurance company that once advertised, and quickly apologized for, an AI feature it claimed could detect fraudulent customers by analyzing their faces.\n\nMixed in with all the effective accelerationist saviorism in OpenAI\u2019s announcement, is the clear message that the new company plans to raise a ton more money to further its drive toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). According to reporting from The Information, OpenAI and Microsoft have defined AGI as systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits. You know, the hallmark of intelligence.\n\nWhat will become of the nonprofit that currently oversees the company is less clear, although it certainly won\u2019t be pinching pennies. It wasn\u2019t a very traditional nonprofit to begin with, having quickly churned through $137 million in donated cash from Elon Musk and other tech moguls in addition to more than $100 million in free computing from Google, Microsoft, and others in order to create generative AI systems that now benefit for-profit corporations.\n\nAfter the corporate transition is complete, the nonprofit won\u2019t have any oversight duties at OpenAI but it will receive shares in the new for-profit company and be \u201cone of the best-resourced non-profits in history,\u201d according to OpenAI\u2019s press release. That will allow it to \u201cpursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, it won\u2019t be long before we all start benefitting from its charity."

            "article_content": "Cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, procedural utilization, and health care costs in the United States represent a high burden demonstrating upward trends across the past several years, according to study findings published in The American Journal of Cardiology.\n\nAnnual health care spending in the US in 2021 reached $4.3 trillion ($12,914/person), with hospital services as the largest category of related costs ($1.3 trillion). In the current study, investigators characterized trends in cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations, health care costs, and procedural utilization.\n\nThe investigators conducted a retrospective analysis using discharge data and ICD-10 codes from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016 to 2021 (costs adjusted and reported in 2023 dollars). The NIS is the largest all-payer, encounter-level database in the US for hospitalizations (about 7 million deidentified hospitalizations/year).\n\nThe investigators noted in 2021, the 4,687,370 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the US cost $108 billion. The highest costs, $18.5 billion, were accounted for by heart failure (HF), $11.2 billion by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), and $10.9 billion by stroke. Adults aged at least 65 years accounted for 64% of all cardiac-related hospitalizations, and those aged 45 to 64 years accounted for 30% (55% men; 70% White; 16% Black; 9% Hispanic).\n\n\u201c \u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021, significant upward trends were noted in the following:\n\nHF\n\nStroke\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nSTEMI\n\nChest pain\n\nHypertensive emergency\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nAortic dissection\n\nSudden cardiac death\n\nPericarditis\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia\n\nPulmonary heart disease\n\nTotal costs increased over $10 billion across the study period, although not linearly, with significant declines likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Total CV-related costs by 2030 may reach $131.3 billion.\n\nProcedures most performed in all years included coronary, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-bypass peripheral vascular surgery, pacemaker replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n\nStudy limitations include ICD codes may underreport primary diagnoses, NIS data are event-level related to discharge with unclear interpretation of how readmissions affect the data, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations and costs was undetermined.\n\n\u201cOverall, from the years 2016 to 2021, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures demonstrated upward trends,\u201d the investigators wrote. \u201c\u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Some [or one] study author(s) declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, scientists think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Yet most of the hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile</\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "NASA\u2019s mission to \u201ctouch\u201d the Sun has confirmed that it survived its record-breaking closest approach to the Sun\u2019s surface on Dec. 24.\n\nBreaking its previous record by flying just 3.8 million miles (around 6.1 million kilometers) above the surface of the Sun, NASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe hurtled through the solar atmosphere at a blazing 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kilometers per hour) \u2014 faster than any human-made object has ever moved. A beacon tone, received in the mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) late on Dec. 26, confirmed the spacecraft had made it through the encounter safely and is operating normally. APL designed, built and operates the spacecraft from its campus in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nAnimation Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Steve Gribben\n\nThis pass, the first of more to come at this distance, is allowing the spacecraft to conduct unrivaled scientific measurements with the potential to change our understanding of the Sun.\n\n\u201cGetting this close to the Sun is a historic moment in our quest to uncover the mysteries of our nearest star,\u201d said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate. \u201cBy studying the Sun up close, we can better understand its impacts throughout our solar system, including on the technology we use daily on Earth, as well as learn about the workings of stars across the universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis accomplishment is a testament to the dedication and innovative spirit of the entire Parker Solar Probe team,\u201d said APL Director Ralph Semmel. \u201cTheir incredible technological breakthroughs enabled this amazing mission, and they have delivered critical new insights that are revolutionizing our understanding of heliophysics and space weather.\u201d\n\nParker Solar Probe has spent the last six years setting up for this moment. Launched in 2018, the spacecraft used seven flybys of Venus to gravitationally direct it ever closer to the Sun. With the last Venus flyby on Nov. 6, the spacecraft reached its optimal orbit, an oval-shaped loop that brings it around the Sun every three months \u2014 close enough to study our Sun\u2019s mysterious processes but not too close to become overwhelmed by the Sun\u2019s heat and damaging radiation. The spacecraft will remain in this orbit for the remainder of its primary mission and potentially for many years after that.\n\n\u201cParker Solar Probe is braving one of the most extreme environments in space and exceeding all expectations,\u201d said Nour Rawafi, project scientist for Parker Solar Probe at APL. \u201cThis mission is ushering in a new golden era of space exploration, bringing us closer than ever to unlocking the Sun\u2019s deepest and most enduring mysteries.\u201d\n\nClose to the Sun, the spacecraft relies on a carbon foam shield to protect itself from the intense heat. The shield was designed to reach temperatures of 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit (around 1,430 degrees Celsius) \u2014 hot enough to melt steel \u2014 while keeping the instruments behind it shaded at a comfortable room temperature. Spacecraft operators expect the shield to have faced temperatures around 1,800 F (980 C) at closest approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s monumental to be able to get a spacecraft this close to the Sun,\u201d said John Wirzburger, Parker Solar Probe mission systems engineer at APL. \u201cThis is a challenge the space science community has wanted to tackle since 1958, and it spent decades advancing the technology to make it possible.\u201d\n\nBy flying through the solar corona, Parker Solar Probe can take measurements that help scientists better understand how the region gets so hot, trace the origin of the solar wind (a constant flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to half the speed of light.\n\n\u201cThe data is so important for the science community because it gives us another vantage point,\u201d said Kelly Korreck, a program scientist at NASA Headquarters and heliophysicist who worked on one of the mission\u2019s instruments. \u201cBy getting first-hand accounts of what\u2019s happening in the solar atmosphere, Parker Solar Probe has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun.\u201d"

Although Russia launched a powerful new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile at a Ukrainian weapons facility after the first two volleys of Western long-range missiles, it has since responded to them with its usual mix of drones, missiles and threats."

            "article_content": "The AI computing market may shift in 2025, opening opportunities for smaller companies.\n\nNvidia dominates AI computing. Evolving workloads could benefit competitors.\n\nCompanies like Groq, Positron, and SambaNova focus on inference to challenge Nvidia's market hold.\n\nIn 2025, the tides may turn for companies hoping to compete with the $3 trillion gorilla in AI computing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 90% of the market share for AI computing. Still, as the use of AI grows, workloads are expected to change, and this evolution may give companies with competitive hardware an opening.\n\nIn 2024, the majority of AI compute spend shifted to inference, Thomas Sohmers, CEO of chip startup Positron AI, told BI. This will \"continue to grow on what looks like an exponential curve,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn AI, inference is the computation needed to produce the response to a user's query or request. The computing required to teach the model the knowledge needed to answer is called \"training.\" Creating OpenAI's image generation platform Sora, for example, represents training. Each user who instructs it to create an image represents an inference workload.\n\nOpenAI's other models have Sohmers and others excited about the growth in computing needs in 2025.\n\nOpenAI's o1 and o3, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and a handful of other AI models use more compute-intensive strategies to improve results after training. These strategies are often called inference-time computing, chain-of-thought, chain-of-reasoning, or reasoning models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, if the models think more before they answer, the responses are better. That thinking comes at a cost of time and money.\n\nThe startups vying for some of Nvidia's market share are attempting to optimize one or both.\n\nNvidia already benefits from these innovations, CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's November earnings call. Huang's wannabe competitors are betting that in 2025, new post-training strategies for AI will benefit all purveyors of inference chips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to three challengers about their hopes and expectations for 2025. Here are their New Year's resolutions.\n\nWhat's one thing within your control that could make 2025 a big year for alternative chips?\n\nMark Heaps is the chief technology evangelist for Nvidia challenger Groq. Groq\n\nMark Heaps, chief technology evangelist, Groq:\n\n\"Execution, execution, execution. Right now, everybody at Groq has decided not to take a holiday break this year. Everyone is executing and building the systems. We are all making sure that we deliver to the opportunity that we've got because that is in our control.\n\nI tell everyone our funnel right now is carbonated and bubbling over. It's unbelievable, the amount of customer interest. We have to build more systems, and we have to stand up those systems so we can serve the demand that we've got. We want to serve all those customers. We want to increase rate limits for everybody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO, SambaNova Systems:\n\n\"For SambaNova, the most critical factor is executing on the shift from training to inference. The industry is moving rapidly toward real-time applications, and inference workloads are becoming the lion's share of AI demand. Our focus is on ensuring our technology enables enterprises to scale efficiently and sustainably.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThomas Sohmers, CEO, Positron:\n\n\"My belief is if we can actually deploy enough compute \u2014 which thankfully I think we can from a supply chain perspective \u2014 by deploying significantly more inference-specific compute, we're going to be able to grow the adoption rate of 'chain of thoughts' and other inference-additional compute.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's one thing you're hoping for that's not in your control for 2025?\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO and cofounder of SambaNova Systems. SambaNova Systems\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"It's about customers recognizing that there are novel advancements against incumbent technologies. There's a lot of folks that have told us, 'We like what you have, but to use the old adage and rephrase it: No one ever got fired for buying from \u2014 insert incumbent.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we know that it's starting to boil up. People are realizing it's hard for them to get chips from the incumbent, and it's also not as performant as Groq is. So my wish would be that people are willing to take that chance and actually look to some of these new technologies.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"If I had a magic wand, I'd address the power challenges around deploying AI. Today, most of the market is stuck using power-hungry hardware that wasn't designed for inference at scale. The result is an unsustainable approach \u2014 economically and environmentally.\n\nAt SambaNova, we've proven there's a better way. Our architecture consumes 10 times less power, making it possible for enterprises to deploy AI systems that meet their goals without blowing past their power budgets or carbon targets. I'd like to see the market move faster toward adopting technologies that prioritize efficiency and sustainability \u2014 because that's how we ensure AI can scale globally without overwhelming the infrastructure that supports it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\n\"I would like people to actually adopt these chain of thought capabilities at the fastest rate possible. I think that is a huge shift \u2014 from a capabilities perspective. You have 8 billion parameter models surpassing 70 billion parameter models. So I'm trying to do everything I can to make that happen.\"\n\nWhat's your New Year's resolution?\n\nPositron AI executives. From left to right: Edward Kmett, Thomas Sohmers, Adam Huson, and Greg Davis. Positron AI\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"In the last six months, I've gone to a number of hackathons, and I've met developers. It's deeply inspiring. So my New Year's resolution is to try to amplify the signal of the good that people are doing with AI.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"Making time for music. Playing guitar is something I've always loved, and I would love to get back into it.

Part of the reason I got into technology was because I wanted to see these tools lift up people to be able to do more with their time \u2014 to learn everything that they want beyond whatever job they're in. I think that bringing the cost down of these things will enable that proliferation.\n\nI also personally want to see and try to use more of these things outside of my just work context because I've been obsessively using the o1 Pro model for the past few weeks, and it's been amazing for my personal work. But when I gave access to my mom what she would do with it was pretty interesting \u2014 those sort of normal, everyday person tasks for these things where it truly is being an assistant.\""

            "article_content": "As India lost its soft-spoken former prime minister, here\u2019s a look at how Manmohan Singh transformed the face of the Indian economy in 1991 read more\n\nIndia\u2019s first Sikh Prime Minister and the architect of the Indian economy Dr Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday at age 92. A statement from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hospital said that Singh died due to an \u201cage-related medical condition\u201d. The soft-spoken former prime minister was born in undivided Punjab and was touted as the man who saved the Indian economy.\n\nWhen India was on the verge of bankruptcy, Singh, who was then the Finance Minister, introduced policy changes that changed the country\u2019s economic trajectory. As India now stands tall as the fifth-largest economy in the world, Singh\u2019s revolutionary policies acted as a foundation for its growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an impassioned speech, while presenting the Budget of 1991, Singh quoted Victor Hugo saying: \u201cI do not minimise the difficulties that lie ahead on the long and arduous journey on which we have embarked. But as Victor Hugo once said, \u2018No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.\u2019 I suggest to this august House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea\".\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Singh saved the Indian economy from collapsing.\n\nPrelude to the whole saga\n\nSingh was sworn in as the Finance Minister in former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao\u2019s cabinet in June 1991. During this time, the Indian economy was operating in accordance with the Nehruvian-socialist agenda. However, the economy was struggling with external debt pegged at 23 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and Internal public debt amounting to 55 per cent of the GDP.\n\nNot only this, the Indian employment rates went down to a negative and the fiscal deficit stood at eight per cent of the GDP. The effects of the poor state of the economy were felt everywhere with inflation rising by a good 13 per cent and retail inflation going even higher up the bend by a whopping 17 per cent.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of it all was the fact that India\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserves stood as low as Rs 2500 crores, which was 75 per cent lower than what it was in 1990. Overall, the Indian economy was facing a major crisis and the leaders were in desperate need to bring out new reforms.\n\nSingh: The best man for the endeavour\n\nWhen Singh took the helm, he was facing the major task of changing the face of the struggling Indian economy. Many believe that he was the best person for the job. Singh had a strong background in Business, Economics and Globalisation, having obtained a degree in economics from Oxford University.\n\nHe worked in the United Nations for three consecutive years and had another stint as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The former premier also held the post of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982-1985. He served as Chief Economic Advisor (1972-1976) and Planning Commission Head (1985-1987). Hence it was safe to say that Singh knew the ins and outs of the Indian economy more than anyone who was in charge at that time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6 ways Manmohan Singh saved the Indian economy\n\nSingh was tasked to present the first budget of the Rao government, in less than a month after he took charge of the finance ministry. After evaluating the situation at hand Singh realised that the Indian economy needed a shift towards economic liberalisation and a strategic end to the \u2018license raj\u2019. Here are 6 ways Singh changed the trajectory of the Indian economy:\n\n1. Devaluation Programme\n\nSingh started his endeavour with a two-step devaluation programme with the RBI devaluing the Indian currency against major currencies by nine per cent initially and then brought down to eleven per cent two days later. This gave the Indian economy a much-needed boost to trade and deal with the International markets.\n\n2. Welcoming Foreign Investments\n\nSingh brought India out of the Nehurivan socialist ideology and opened doors to welcome foreign investment into the Indian Capital. With the introduction of \u201cLiberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation (LPG)\u201d, Singh\u2019s policies gave a boost to industrialisation in the country. With these reforms, the Indian entrepreneurs were given direct access to the required capital, technology and target markets around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Mortaging India\u2019s gold holdings\n\nThe next thing the former prime minister did was to convince the RBI board to mortgage India\u2019s gold holdings with the Bank of England in four tranches. This way, India managed to get the necessary financial assistance it needed to sail. Singh got the idea from the State Bank of India which sold 20 tonnes of gold to the Union Bank of Switzerland, for which they had received about $200 million.\n\n4. Restructuring India\u2019s trade policy\n\nSingh had to restructure the Indian trade policy since it was on the verge of being banned from essential imports such as oil and gas. Under the LPG, Singh\u2019s reforms called for doing away with unnecessary controls, streamlining the licensing process and linking non-essential imports to exports to discourage such imports. Singh took the hard decision to abolish the popular \u2019export subsidies\u2019 along with the further expansion of the \u201cLicense Raj\u201d opening the country\u2019s economy to a great extent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Taking help from the IMF\n\nGiven the crisis at hand, Singh called for economic relief from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He applied for an emergency loan of $220 million, which was later seen as the main tool which prevented India from recording a debt default. While India had to follow some of the conditions presented by the international financial body, Singh\u2019s reforms acted as a cushion between India\u2019s socialist background and the IMF\u2019s capitalist and liberalising approach.\n\n6. Market Regulators\n\nSingh also called for the transfer of full statutory powers to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to enable it to regulate the workings of the Stock Exchanges in the country. Hence, SEBI soon became India\u2019s sole market regulator. Singh went on to propose a tax concession under section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act to export of software. As a result of this concession, the Indian Software companies became more cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Singh has garnered several criticisms from his opposition, over the years, one thing that cannot be denied is the fact that he managed to save the Indian economy from shamble in 1991."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "The expert said the prospect of an AI more intelligent than humans is a 'very scary thought'\n\nBritish-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said we need to be \"very careful\" and \"very thoughtful\" about the development of artificial intelligence (AI) which he says is a \"potentially very dangerous technology\". Professor Hinton, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics this year, said the pace of change in the area of AI is \"much faster\" than he expected and there has not been enough time to complete the research he believes is required. While his work has laid the foundations for machine learning, technology that allows computers to mimic human intelligence, his recent efforts have centred on advocating for safer AI. Last year he made headlines after resigning from his job at Google, citing concerns \"bad actors\" would use the technology to harm others. Google said at the time: \u201cAs one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence captures Sun's varying atmospheric conditions\n\nReflecting on where he thought the development of AI would have reached when he first started this work, Prof Hinton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I didn't think it would be where we would be now. I thought at some point in the future we would get here. \"Because the situation we're in now is that most of the experts in the field think that sometime, within probably the next 20 years, we're going to develop AIs that are smarter than people. \"And that's a very scary thought.\" He added: \"I like to think of it as, imagine yourself and a three-year-old - we'll be the three-year-olds, and they'll be the grown-ups.\" Prof Hinton said he thinks the impact AI could have on the world will be similar to the industrial revolution. \"In the industrial revolution, human strength ceased to be that relevant because machines were just stronger, and if you wanted to dig a ditch, you dug it with a machine. \"What we've got now is something that's replacing human intelligence, and just ordinary human intelligence will not be at the cutting edge anymore. It will be machines,\" he said.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
