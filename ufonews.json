You'll be able to watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

        "article_content": "On a crystalline blue afternoon 20 years ago \u2014 Nov. 14, 2004 \u2014 four Navy pilots spotted a mysterious flying object 100 miles off the coast of San Diego. It looked like a Tic Tac candy, with no wings, no flight surfaces, no windows and no smoke trail. It moved like a high-speed ping pong ball at a speed later estimated to be 46,000 miles per hour.\n\nThe so-called \u201cTic Tac\u201d incident eventually became one of the key episodes that led to an unexpected renaissance of serious interest in UFOs in 2017, and the pilots later appeared on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d CNN and elsewhere to discuss their experience. The event is often cited by believers in UFOs, short for unidentified flying objects, as the most credible sighting ever.\n\nThe overall tone of the UFO discussion shifted abruptly in March, however, when the U.S. government\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office released a highly skeptical report on the phenomenon. All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office Director Sean Kirkpatrick argued that renewed UFO mania had been driven by a \u201cwhirlwind of tall tales, fabrication and secondhand or thirdhand retellings of the same.\u201d\n\nThe report provided an important public service by authoritatively debunking some of the wilder claims in the UFO conversation, but it blinded many observers to the reality that the 45-page analysis did not attempt to solve the mystery of every single one of the claimed sightings, nor did it claim to do so. The most fascinating of these unsolved mysteries is the Tic Tac incident, which was accompanied by a well-known video. as well as unaccountable radar returns and visual sightings by members of the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group starting around Nov. 10, 2004.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that there has never been one piece of concrete evidence that the Tic Tac craft came from outer space, it\u2019s equally true that no hard evidence has emerged to support the idea that it was a weather balloon, an advanced Chinese drone, a sophisticated U.S. \u201cspoofing\u201d test of naval radar or an experimental U.S. test craft. Some of the alternative hypotheses, which have been explored in detail on both pro- and anti-UFO forums, are nearly as interesting as the alien spaceship hypothesis. A few raise important issues of national security and flight safety, even two decades later.\n\nWhile the March All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office report splashed cold water on UFO enthusiasts, it did confirm one of their pet theories: that many of history\u2019s well-known UFO sightings were, in fact, secret government programs. As the report noted, many \u201csightings since the 1940s have represented misidentification of never-before-seen experimental and operational space, rocket, and air systems, including stealth technologies and the proliferation of drone platforms. Many of these technologies fit the description of a stereotypical Unidentified Flying Object.\u201d\n\nThe All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office lists 28 secret programs that could have been misinterpreted through the years as UFOs, including something called the \u201cFlying Pancake.\u201d It would not take an enormous leap of the imagination to believe that the Tic Tac belongs in this line of historic events.\n\nBut the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office paper makes no mention of any programs that could have caused the Nimitz observations \u2014 even though it cites examples of drones that were tested later. So the report, while demystifying the broader UFO conversation, actually ends up adding more mystery to the Tic Tac episode. If the U.S. government has secret information about this celebrated incident, one wonders, how and why has it remained hidden all of these years?\n\nIt would be a disservice to veterans like David Fravor who have risked ridicule (and worse) to testify before Congress and in other public forums about the extraordinary things they saw simply to abandon the search for the answer to the Nimitz case because some unrelated outlandish claims were taken too seriously by Congress and the media. This puzzling episode remains relevant, and it deserves continued investigation.\n\nFrance is a former senior editor at BusinessWeek magazine who is the author of Nimitz Compendium, a comprehensive bibliography of the Tic Tac incident. He lives in Brooklyn."

        "source": "TechCrunch",
        "article_content": "The media industry today may not have a very favorable view of AI \u2014 a technology that\u2019s already been used to replace reporters with AI-written copy, while other AI companies have scooped up journalists\u2019 work to feed their chatbots\u2019 data demands, but without returning traffic to the publisher as search engines once did. However, one startup, an AI newsreader called Particle from former Twitter engineers, believes that AI could serve a valuable role in the media industry by helping consumers make sense of the news and dig deeper into stories, while still finding a way to support the publishers\u2019 businesses.\n\nBacked by $4.4 million in seed funding from Kindred Ventures, Adverb Ventures, and other angels, Particle was founded last year by former Senior Director of Product Management at Twitter, Sara Beykpour, who worked on products like Twitter Blue, Twitter Video, and conversations, and who spearheaded the experimental app, twttr. Her co-founder is a former senior engineer at Twitter and Tesla, Marcel Molina.\n\nFrom the consumers\u2019 perspective, the core idea behind Particle is to help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology. More than just summarizing stories into key bullet points for quick catch-ups, Particle offers a variety of clever features that let you approach the news in different ways.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nBut instead of simply sucking up publishers\u2019 work for its own use, Particle aims to compensate publishers or even drive traffic back to news sites by prominently showcasing and linking to sources directly underneath its AI summaries.\n\nTo start, Particle has partnered with specific publishers to host some of their content in the app via their APIs, including outlets like Reuters, AFP, and Fortune. These partners receive better positioning and their links are highlighted in gold above others.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nAlready, beta tests indicate that readers are clicking through to publishers\u2019 sites because of the app\u2019s design and user interface, though that could shift now that the app is launching beyond news junkies to the general public. In time, the company intends to introduce other ways to work with the media, too, in addition to sending them referral traffic. The team is also having discussions with publishers about providing its users access to paywalled content in way that makes sense for all parties.\n\n\u201cHaving deep partnerships and collaboration is one of the things that we\u2019re really interested in,\u201d notes Beykpour.\n\nTo help with its traffic referral efforts, the app\u2019s article section includes big tap targets, making it easy for readers to click through to the publisher\u2019s site. Plus, Particle includes the faces of the journalists on their bylines, and readers can follow through links to publisher profiles to read more of their content or follow them.\n\nUsing the app\u2019s built-in AI tools, news consumers can switch between different modes like \u201cExplain Like I\u2019m 5,\u201d to get a simplified version of a complicated story or those that summarize \u201cjust the facts,\u201d (or the 5W\u2019s \u2014 who, what, when, where and why). You can have the news summarized in another language besides English, or listen to an audio summary of a story or a personalized selection of stories while on the go. Particle can also pull out important quotes from a story and other links of reference.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nBut two of the more interesting features involve how Particle leverages AI to help present the news from different angles and allows you to further engage with the story at hand by asking questions.\n\nIn Particle, one tool called \u201cOpposite Sides\u201d aims to break users\u2019 filter bubbles by presenting different viewpoints from the same story. This model has been tried before by other news apps, including the startup Brief and SmartNews. Unlike earlier efforts, Particle includes a story spectrum that shows how news is being reported across both \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d-leaning sites, with bubbles placed to indicate how far to left or right the news\u2019 positioning is, and how outsized the coverage may be from one side or the other. The AI will also summarize both sides\u2019 positions, allowing news consumers to reach their own opinions about the matter.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nHowever, the app\u2019s killer feature is an AI chatbot that lets you ask questions and get instant answers about a story. The app will include suggested questions and those asked by others. For example, if you\u2019re reading about Trump\u2019s immigration policy plans, you could ask the chatbot things like \u201cWhat are the potential legal challenges to Trump\u2019s deportation plans?\u201d or \u201cWhat are the potential costs of mass deportation?\u201d among other things. Particle will then use its AI technology to find those answers and fact-check them for accuracy.\n\n\u201cThe chat function uses OpenAI as well as\u2026our own pre-processing and post-processing,\u201d explains Beykpour, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cIt uses the content, searches the web a little bit \u2014 if it wants to find extra information on the web \u2014 to generate those answers.\u201d She says that after the answer is generated, Particle includes an extra step where the AI has to go find the supporting material that matches those answers.\n\nOverall, the app encompasses tech like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, Anthropic, Cohere, and others, including more traditional AI technologies, which are not LLM-based, from Google.\n\n\u201cWe have a processing pipeline that takes related content and summarizes it into bullet points, into a headline, sub-headline, and does all the extractions,\u201d she continues. \u201cThen\u2026we pull out quotes and links and all sorts of relevant information about [the story]. And we have our own algorithms to rank, so that the most important or relevant link is the one that you see first \u2014 or what we think is the most important or relevant quote is the one that you see first.\u201d\n\nThe company claims that its technology reduces AI accuracy problems that would otherwise occur 1 out of 100 times, and reduces their likelihood to 1 out of 10,000 times.\n\nParticle will also use human editors as it grows to help better manage the AI content and curate its homepage, she notes.\n\nThe app is a free download on iOS for the time being and works across iPhone and iPad."

I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.\n\nAfter Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.\n\n\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"\n\nDuchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.\n\n\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.\n\n\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"\n\nDuchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.\n\n\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"\n\nAnother source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.\n\nDavid Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in the later years of \"The X-Files.\" Alamy\n\n\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.\n\n\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"\n\n\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.\n\n\"The world,\" Duchovny said.\n\n\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.\n\n\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.\n\n\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.\n\nDuring their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world."

        "article_content": "One of the most gorgeous, uniquely animated paranormal series from 2020 has finally returned after nearly five years with a second season. Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, based on the original manga by creative duo Aidaro has finally returned to continue Hanako and Nene\u2019s misadventures dealing with iconic school ghost\u2019s from Japanese urban legends after leaving audiences holding their collective breath when Season 1 ended. The new trailer shows what appears to be a significant improvement in animation quality, and hints at some of the major events that take place in the manga\u2019s Clock Keepers and Picture Perfect story arcs. The new season could also finally adapt the Young Exorcist story arc, which, in the timeline of the series, should have been in the anime\u2019s first season.\n\nStudio Lerche will be returning to animate Season 2, with Youhei Fukui (My Hero Academia Season 2, Bakugan: Evolutions) set to direct the series. The main cast will remain the same as it was in the first season, with Masayoshi Oishi (Overlord) providing vocals for the series\u2019 new opening song while ANCHOR composes the main theme.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nLerche\n\nToilet-Bound Hanako-kun Offers Anime Fans Everything They Could Want From the Supernatural\n\nMuch like the action-packed supernatural anime Dandadan, Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun puts a unique spin on classic Japanese folk stories by spinning them to fit the story\u2019s specific world-building and situation. The series primarily follows Nene Yashiro, a first-year high school student who wants nothing more than for her crush to return her feelings. To try and win his heart, Nene unwittingly participates in an occult ritual that causes her to become afflicted by the Mermaid Curse. Not wanting to be turned into a literal fish, Nene makes a deal with the ghostly spirit Hanako to prevent her from turning into a fish \u2013 given that she doesn\u2019t become submerged in water. To repay him, Nene is forced to become Hanako\u2019s assistant and help him spread rumors and stories about different supernatural beings residing within the school.\n\nToilet-Bound Hanako-Kun has something for everyone. In addition to an intriguing supernatural mystery that effortlessly builds itself up over time, the series has a visually unique and striking art style that makes it easy to get drawn into each paranormal entity Nene and Hanako investigate. Plus, just beneath the surface of the series core narrative, there\u2019s loads of character development and angst that gets explored in a staunch, brutally human way. The series truly has something for anime fans from every corner of the community, and with the new season dropping in January 2025, there\u2019s no better time to get caught up with Season 1 to prepare for the paranormal ride of a lifetime."

        "article_content": "Fifty years after its discovery on November 24, 1974, in the Afar region of northeastern Ethiopia, the fossil known as Lucy continues to shape our understanding of human origins. Lucy remains an icon among prehuman fossils, representing humanity's deep evolutionary history in Africa and playing an outsized role in the investigation of human origins due to her value as a symbol and her intrinsic worth as a source of evidence about human evolution.\n\nLucy, a 3.2-million-year-old Australopithecus afarensis specimen, consists of 47 bones, constituting approximately 40% of a single skeleton. Discovered by American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson and his graduate student Tom Gray, the fossil was unearthed during excavations in Hadar that began in 1973. The team celebrated the discovery around a campfire, with the Beatles' song \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\" playing repeatedly, leading to the suggestion to name the fossil Lucy. She is also known in Ethiopia as Dinkinesh, which means \"you are marvelous\" in Amharic.\n\nAt the time, Lucy was the most complete hominin skeleton found from such an ancient period, which was unprecedented for a fossil approximately 3.2 million years old. Her skeleton is similar enough to modern humans for researchers to think she could be a close relative or even an ancestor of modern humans. Lucy helped piece together an evolutionary puzzle that, until then, was disordered and full of loose ends.\n\nLucy provided extensive information about early human ancestors. Among the preserved regions of her skeleton are substantial parts of the bones that reveal the length of the limbs: the humerus and radius in the upper limb and the femur and tibia in the lower limb. This allowed scientists to determine that Australopithecus afarensis had limb proportions closer to those of chimpanzees and bonobos than to those of modern humans. Other fossils belonging to Australopithecus afarensis provide compelling evidence that the species walked upright on two legs, confirming that upright walking evolved before large brains in human evolution.\n\nSince Lucy's discovery, many more specimens have been found, providing an exceptionally detailed record of this ancient species. The dating of Australopithecus afarensis fossils covers a period from approximately 3.8 to 3 million years ago. Until additional fossils of recently identified hominins are found, Australopithecus afarensis remains the most likely ancestor and one of the most important species in human evolutionary history.\n\nDebates among scientists about Lucy's place in the human family tree continue. Some experts think Lucy belongs on the line leading to modern humans, adding to her significance. Potential descendants of Lucy have also multiplied, leading researchers to trace several possible lineages from her. The lack of information about Kenyanthropus platyops and other contemporaries leaves Australopithecus afarensis as the best candidate ancestor of Homo and Paranthropus, despite the increasing number of contemporaneous species, including Australopithecus bahrelghazali and Australopithecus deyiremeda.\n\nQuestions remain about whether Australopithecus afarensis or one of these other hominins is the ancestor of Homo and Paranthropus. The abundance of fossils led researchers Donald Johanson and Tim White, along with Yves Coppens, to propose the species name Australopithecus afarensis for Lucy and her relatives. Lucy's species possesses traits that foreshadow the genus Homo and others that belong to the paranthropines, placing it at the junction between two groups.\n\nTim White, an American paleoanthropologist, has been responsible for clarifying doubts regarding Lucy's significance. He explains, \"These fossils represent our evolution. Lucy's lineage led to the genus Homo, the genus of our species.\" White notes that while debates continue, Australopithecus afarensis remains the best-studied species, with paleoanthropologists now recognizing the significance of having 400 remains of a species to analyze.\n\nPascal Picq, a member of the group of young scientists gathered around Yves Coppens, has focused on the craniofacial biomechanics and diet of Lucy. He notes that Australopithecus afarensis needed to be able to chew \"bulbs, roots, tubers, and rhizomes,\" which are more perennial, due to changes in vegetation and the climate in East Africa. Picq offers another interpretation of the plethora of hominins uncovered in recent decades: \"It is a mosaic evolution, with a diversity of anatomical combinations.\"\n\nBrigitte Senut, a paleontologist, has studied Lucy's upper limbs and notes that Lucy's bipedality differs not only from that of chimpanzees but also from modern humans. She states, \"I have always placed Lucy on a separate path. And even more since our discovery of Orrorin tugenensis, with its more human femur, even though it is much older. That doesn't necessarily mean it is our ancestor. But if Lucy is in that lineage, it implies an evolutionary yo-yo.\" Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nDespite differing opinions, Lucy has remained a solid reference in the study of human evolution. She has definitively freed us from a desire to find our origin in Europe, remaining the great marker of our African roots. Lucy demonstrated that human evolution was much more convoluted, with a denser and more robust family tree that encompasses several species that inhabited Tanzania, Chad, Kenya, and Ethiopia four million years ago.\n\nThe discovery of Lucy had a significant impact on paleoanthropology, forcing scientists to reconsider key details of human evolutionary history, including when and where humanity began and how extinct members of the human family were related to each other and to modern humans. Lucy's skeleton helped articulate all the findings that had been accumulating in Africa since the 1920s.\n\nLucy continues to be an icon, not just of science but also in the public imagination. The fortunate choice of her name contributed to this recognition. Rebeca Garc\u00eda, a member of the Human Evolution Laboratory at the University of Burgos and specialist in postcranial skeletons, points out that all the recreations that have been made of Lucy \"are very endearing,\" making it easy for the general public to empathize and relate to her.\n\nEven today, articles and theses are still being written about her. As Tim White states, \"Lucy added an important piece to that puzzle. Still, we cannot put her on a pedestal because we would ignore the ultimate goal of paleoanthropology.\" Rebeca Garc\u00eda adds, \"Science advances so much that we cannot even imagine what answers Lucy will bring in the future, but she will continue to be fundamental in the study of human evolution, probably for another 50 years.\"\n\nShe is an icon among prehuman fossils and a symbol of evolution in progress. As Pascal Picq recalls, \"Lucy has definitively freed us from a desire to find our origin in Europe. She remains the great marker of our African roots.\"\n\nSources: Scientific American, Le Monde (Science), EL PA\u00cdS\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with generative AI company Alchemiq"

For geothermal power to be generated from them, water would need to pass through \"fractures\" to reach a supercritical state of more than 750 degrees Fahrenheit, as Interesting Engineering explained.\n\nShould we be digging into the ground to find new energy sources?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nHowever, as the release noted, superdeep rocks are already under immense pressure and heat, making them more ductile, or flexible, like Silly Putty. Because of this, researchers were skeptical that the rocks could form or maintain fractures for the water to move through.\n\nNow, the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) team's findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, have confirmed previous theoretical work detailed in Geothermal Energy: fractures in these superdeep, superhot rocks are possible.\n\nThis knowledge may pave a path toward low-cost energy that can be part of the transition away from polluting dirty fuels driving the overheating of the planet. Moreover, the power would be abundant \u2014 \"roughly five to 10 times the energy produced by today's commercial geothermal wells,\" per a 2021 Clean Air Task Force report cited in the release.\n\n\"We have shown that the brittle-to-ductile transition is not a cutoff for fluid circulation in the crust, which is promising for the exploitation of deep geothermal reservoirs,\" said research lead Marie Violay, head of EPFL's Laboratory of Experimental Rock Mechanics. \"These are among the first experimental results that shed light on such extreme conditions.\"\n\nAccording to the release, Quaise Energy helped fund the study, along with Alta Rock Energy, the European Research Council, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.\n\nQuaise, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is among the forward-thinking companies investing in geothermal solutions, with its developmental gyrotron drills possibly providing a way to access abundant, renewable power in more than 90% of the world.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

        "article_content": "Unemployment weakens governments. Inflation kills them. That\u2019s what a government official from Brazil once told me. But in rich countries including the United States, the politically destructive power of inflation had been forgotten. Standard policy tools left us unprepared and the Biden administration was slow to fight back. The re-election of Donald Trump should serve as a warning to democratic governments.\n\nIn this age of overlapping emergencies \u2014 hurricanes, an Avian flu outbreak, two regional wars \u2014 threats to supply chains are becoming commonplace. Each threat brings the risk of inflation and its power to destabilize governments, including our own. With such emergencies being the new normal, if we learned anything from last week\u2019s earthquake election result, it's that we need new means of protecting our society and democracy.\n\nAmong the biggest problems that need fixing: Many business sectors today are dominated by large corporations that can profit from these one-time events.\n\nUsing A.I. and natural language processing in an upcoming paper, several co-authors and I analyzed more than 130,000 earnings calls of publicly listed U.S. companies and found that businesses can coordinate price hikes around cost shocks. This enabled companies, by and large, to pass on or amplify the impact of the initial cost increase in response to shocks in the wake of Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine."
