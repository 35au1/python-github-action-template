        "article_content": "The horror of mutilated cattle, cheeks cut off on one side, tongues missing, sexual organs removed, bloodless carcasses and no visible signs of predation made big, bold headlines across Wyoming and the West in mid-1970s.\n\nWyoming had reports of cattle mutilated in Newcastle in the Bridger Valley in Uinta County and in Sublette County. There were mutilated horses in Meeteetse and Carbon County. Two years later there was a report of a heifer outside Casper found dead under similar circumstances.\n\nIn the years immediately after the Vietnam War and Watergate, suspects included the U.S. military, who some surmised were conducting experiments or collecting tissue, satanic cults or UFO visitations.\n\nEfforts by a Nebraska senator to get the FBI involved were met with hesitation and reluctance from the agency, which only fueled speculation. The mystery has lingered for decades, still spooking ranchers and former law enforcement officers as Halloween approaches, reminding them of a real horror they lived through.\n\n\u201cIt lasted in our area three years,\u201d former Uinta County Sheriff Leonard Hysell told Cowboy State Daily in an interview. \u201cThe first year we had it was an ungodly amount of them, a lot.\u201d\n\nWhile the headlines died off in the 1980s, reports of periodic cattle mutilations have continued. In Texas six cows were mutilated in similar fashion in 2023. Mutilations that occurred in eastern Oregon communities in recent years were profiled on Netflix\u2019s latest season of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nCurrent Wyoming Livestock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna and Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Hollie Hasel said they know of no reports of incidents of mutilation in the state since they assumed their respective roles.\n\nThe Mutilations Begin\n\nBut in the 1970s, the losses were real and the ranchers and law enforcement were at a loss to find a culprit or motive for the grotesque mutilations in the Cowboy State and rest of the country.\n\nThe Casper Star-Tribune reported on Oct. 26, 1975, that suspected cattle mutilations surpassed 45 cows with 10 in Sublette County and 16 in Uinta County. On Sept. 30, the paper reported on a calf north of Gillette with its sexual organs cut off and the stomach cut with a sharp instrument.\n\nThe Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s Office characterized the death as a \u201cconfirmed mutilation\u201d after a veterinarian could not determine the cause of death and there were no signs or tracks of predators or humans.\n\nFor Hysell, then Uinta County undersheriff, the incidents represented the most bizarre cases he investigated in his 47-year law enforcement career, including 20 years in Uinta County.\n\n\u201cWe only took the ones that were fresh kills, anything that was over 24 hours old we didn\u2019t try to speculate on that,\u201d he said. \u201cFresh kills we really tried to investigate. We racked up a large number of them. One rancher alone had 16 head, six in one night in one pasture. Now the predators are not doing that.\u201d\n\nEvidence Of Helicopters\n\nWhile many news stories speak of the lack of evidence and tracks around the kills, Hysell said he did find certain evidence at some of the sites that led to his suspicions about the cause \u2014 and it involved helicopters.\n\nDuring the period when cattle were being discovered mutilated, there were credible reports of military-style helicopters in the area and, on one occasion, three in different locations. Hysell said the aircraft had no numbers on the side, did not use lights and were only seen at dusk.\n\n\u201cWe found a lot of rotor wash around the carcasses, we found the marks of the landing skids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat led me to believe it was something a little more involved. And predators wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with those carcasses. Birds wouldn\u2019t peck on them. We never had any incidents like that before and we never had any after. If it was predators, why didn\u2019t it continue on? It just didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 3, 1975, the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph reported that El Paso County Undersheriff Gary Gibbs pointed to a satanic cult.\n\n\u201cThey are nomadic people. In the past two years we\u2019ve found evidence of similar happenings in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. This isn\u2019t a small group. There are several thousand members across the country,\u201d he was quoted. \u201cSome people laugh at the idea, but we have been working very hard on the problem and we have definite evidence. We want to catch these people because we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do when they tire of mutilating cows.\u201d\n\nHysell said the cult theory was not something he agreed with because of the money it took to operate the helicopters he knows were flying in and around his county at the time. But he does know that the federal government and state agencies were extremely reluctant to help sheriff departments across the West. And that included in Wyoming.\n\n\u201cThe state crime labs wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with anything either in Wyoming or in Utah,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard from other sheriff offices that that was the case they were running up against in all of their states.\u201d\n\nThe Casper Star-Tribune reported in April 1978 about a cow mutilated near Casper. (Courtesy Newspapers.com)\n\nThe Casper Star-Tribune reported in September 1975 about a calf mutilated near Gillette. (Courtesy Newspapers.com)\n\nLeft, the Casper Star-Tribune carried an article in October 1977 showing the extent of the cattle mutilation across the nation. Right, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported on cattle mutilations in September 1994. (Courtesy Newspapers.com) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nFBI File\n\nAn FBI file on the cattle mutilations reveals letters that were sent by Nebraska Sen. Carl Curtis to FBI Director Clarence M. Kelly in 1974 seeking the federal agency\u2019s help with solving the crimes.\n\n\u201cThis will refer to my previous letter of August 21 to you regarding the series of incidents stretching from Oklahoma to Nebraska in which cattle have been dismembered in some kind of strange witchcraft cult,\u201d Curtis wrote. \u201cI am wondering if your good offices have instigated an investigation of this situation either in Nebraska or any of the other states experiencing similar acts of mutilation to livestock.\u201d\n\nThe FBI director replied on Sept. 10, 1974, that he had an agent check into the matter and it appeared \u201cno federal law within the jurisdiction of the FBI has been violated.\u201d\n\nBy 1979, Sen. Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico succeeded in getting the Senate Appropriations Committee to include language in its report directing the FBI to \u201cmaintain its investigation of the cattle mutilations that have occurred in New Mexico and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRetired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel led an investigation into cattle mutilated on a native reservation in New Mexico and concluded that it was predators that were to blame.\n\n\u201cMost credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger activity. However certain segments of the population have attributed the damage to other causes ranging from UFOs to a giant government conspiracy,\u201d Rommel wrote in a letter to the FBI on March 5, 1980. \u201cNo factual data has been supplied supporting these theories.\u201d\n\nRommel did send in flakes of material that appeared on top of a Taos, N.M.. pickup truck in July 1978 after a UFO allegedly hovered over it. The FBI lab concluded it was white enamel paint, typical of exterior house paint and that the particles \u201cappear to have originated from a wood substrate.\u201d\n\nPredator Conclusion \u2018Not Valid\u2019\n\nHysell said he did not accept the FBI\u2019s conclusion about predators.\n\n\u201cI never met too many FBI agents that knew much about predators, at least the four-legged kind,\u201d he said. \u201cI totally thought that conclusion was not valid.\u201d\n\nHysell said he suspected that the government was involved in the mutilations possibly due to a chemical or biological mishap and it needed to test to see how extensive the material had spread.\n\n\u201cThere were mutilations of any place where air, water or food could enter or exit the bodies,\u201d he said.\n\nAn article in the Casper Star-Tribune on Oct. 23, 1977, quoted a spokesman for the national Cattlemen\u2019s Association who estimated 3,000 mutilations had been reported across 22 states beginning in late 1974 through a peak in the summers of 1975 and 1976.\n\nOne facility in Utah known to be involved in chemical and biological weapons is the Dugway Proving Ground located 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nA congressional report by the Committee on Veteran\u2019s Affairs and Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV on Dec. 8, 1994, stated that the proving ground had been the site of testing for various chemical and biological agents.\n\nIn 1968, the report stated that 6,400 sheep near the facility died following \u201cthe intentional release of a deadly nerve gas from a plane.\u201d\n\n\u201cInitially the Defense Department denied any responsibility for the accident \u2026 However, the nerve agent VX was identified when the poisoned sheep were autopsied, which made it clear the deaths were not caused by pesticides,\u201d the report stated. \u201cEventually, the Defense Department reimbursed the ranchers for their animals.\u201d\n\nWhile cattle mutilations were making headlines across the county in the mid-1970s, the mutilations have still occurred in recent years. (Courtesy Bovinevetonline.com)\n\n\u2018Simulant Testing\u2019\n\nAfter the 1968 deaths, the report stated the Department of Defense developed \u201csimulant\u201d testing. But during \u201c45-years\u201d of open-air testing, \u201cthe Army has stopped using a variety of simulants when they realized they were not as safe as believed,\u201d the report stated.\n\nWhile the mass mutilations of the mid-70s have stopped, reports of similar mutilations still occur. One of the most recent reports involved six cattle mutilations in Texas.\n\nA press release on May 23, 2023, by the Animal Legal Defense Fund reported that a 6-year-old longhorn-cross cow was discovered in April 2023 in Madison County with its tongue removed by a \u201cstraight, clean cut with apparent precision along the jawline. Scavenging animals did not touch the body.\n\nFive additional cows were discovered with their anus and sexual organs removed in addition to the tongues in neighboring Brazos and Robertson counties.\n\nThe investigator into the Madison County incident told Cowboy State Daily she could not speak to the media without the sheriff\u2019s approval. A message left with the sheriff was not responded to by deadline.\n\nAs Hysell looks back on the mid-70s and the collaboration with sheriff departments across the West, he recalls that a lot of people were \u201cridiculed\u201d as they tried to find the answers.\n\n\u201cI felt like we were being controlled with the news of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will tell you this at least in one case, I won\u2019t tell you which state it was in, a person who worked in the crime lab, they were told to back off of it, that they would not accept any more samples and they were to shut up about it.\u201d\n\nDale Killingbeck can be reached at dale@cowboystatedaily.com."

        "article_content": "By Aveekshith Bushan\n\nThe intersection of AI and consumer services is rapidly evolving, and multi-model AI applications are at the forefront of this transformation. Multi-model AI is a breakthrough in artificial intelligence due to its ability to integrate multiple data types, making human-computer interactions more natural and intuitive. According to industry reports, the global multi-model AI market, valued at approximately $893.5 million in 2023, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.2%, reaching $1050 billion by 2031. Businesses can leverage multi-model AI by breaking the text barrier and incorporating various forms of data by combining key-value, vector, and graph searches to offer more personalised and efficient consumer experiences.\n\nConsider common household examples like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. They rely on multi-model AI systems to evaluate user interactions in the form of speech and text for generating exact responses and learning behavioural patterns for subsequent interactions. These AI applications mark a new era of digital personal interactions.\n\nEnhancing Personalization with Key-Value Stores\n\nKey-value databases play a crucial role in enabling personalisation at scale, allowing businesses to cater to millions of users with real-time, tailored content and recommendations. With contextual intelligence, these stores help applications quickly retrieve user-specific information and contribute to improved decision-making by processing vast amounts of data efficiently. For example, e-commerce platforms use them to store user preferences and browsing history and to suggest related products for highly personalised interaction.\n\nOptimizing Search with Vector Databases\n\nVector search allows businesses to handle complex, unstructured data such as images, audio, or videos. Vector databases are also invaluable in areas like voice and image recognition, which are becoming prevalent in consumer applications.\n\nVector searches work by embedding data into numerical formats that allow AI to identify similarities between different pieces of content. This helps with improving the accuracy of recommendations and with handling diverse data types for a richer consumer experience. For instance, if a user watches a specific type of movie, a vector database can suggest other movies with similar themes or visual styles based on how closely the data matches, going beyond traditional keyword-based searches to identify deeper connections between data points.\n\nGraph Databases for Complex Relationships\n\nWhile key-value and vector databases handle personalisation and unstructured data, graph databases excel at mapping complex relationships between data points. Businesses can use graphs to understand how different entities are interconnected, such as users, products, or behaviours. This ensures better user engagement through relationship mapping and enhanced network-based recommendations\n\nSocial media platforms rely on graph searches to uncover connections between users, interests, and interactions, allowing for more relevant and meaningful recommendations. For example, graphs help with analysing user connections, identifying influencers, and recommending friends or content based on mutual interests.\n\nThe Power of Multi-Model AI\n\nThe true power of multi-model AI lies in its ability to integrate these different data models into a single, unified system. By combining key-value, vector, and graph, businesses can create more sophisticated and intuitive consumer interactions. An e-commerce platform, for example, may use key-value stores to retrieve customer data instantly, vector searches to recommend visually similar products, and graph databases to suggest items based on previous purchases.\n\nIn combination, these models provide highly personalised experiences tailored to each user\u2019s specific needs and behaviour, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. This approach paves the way for the next generation of consumer innovation, where AI seamlessly enhances personalisation, search accuracy, and relevance across platforms.\n\nThe author is vice president and GM, APJ, Aerospike.

        "article_content": "AI can assist everywhere from your email apps to fast food outlets. Now Amazon is keen to be involved in the AI revolution with an AI bot called Rufus, which can answer questions, research products, and help you make the right buying decisions across Amazon.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re stuck for a gift idea for someone special in your life, or you need to compare two products against each other. From asking about your active orders to checking up on the details of something you\u2019re thinking about buying, Rufus can help\u2014and here\u2019s how you can find it.\n\nHow Rufus works, and where to find it\n\nRufus might offer prompt suggestions based on your browsing history. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini, Rufus is very much along the same lines. It\u2019s trained on \u201cAmazon\u2019s extensive product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information from across the web\u201d, which it then sifts through, connects together, and summarizes to respond to your questions.\n\nThese bots, however, don\u2019t just copy and paste information\u2014they\u2019re designed to generate fresh and original responses, so (as always with these AI models) mistakes can be made. Amazon says Rufus \u201cmay not always get things right,\u201d so it\u2019s worth double-checking important details\u2014don\u2019t assume everything Rufus sells is 100 percent correct, and don\u2019t share private or personal information with it.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Amazon Shopping app for Android or iOS, you\u2019ll find Rufus on the right of the navigation bar at the bottom (the Rufus logo is two blobs with a star next to them): Tap the button to bring up a chat window and start asking questions. If you\u2019re shopping through the Amazon website, you\u2019ll see the Rufus button up on the left-hand side of the toolbar at the top.\n\nStraight away, Rufus will make suggestions about questions to ask\u2014some of these may be related to recent searches or recent purchases. Click or tap on any of the suggestions, or enter your own question or prompt, and Rufus springs into action.\n\nAfter each response, you get the opportunity to ask follow-up questions (Rufus will remember the conversation history), and rate the responses you\u2019ve been given (via the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons). You can clear your chat history in Rufus, but only in the app, and not on the web: Tap on the three dots (top right), then choose Manage chat and Clear chat history.\n\nQuestions and prompts to try with Rufus\n\nOne of the ways to use the bot is to ask questions about products. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nRufus knows what you\u2019re looking at on the Amazon platform, so you can ask it questions about a product you\u2019ve got up on screen. You can ask how much an item weighs, for example, or which materials it\u2019s made of, or what the battery life is like. In some cases, the bot will make direct reference to something in the listing.\n\nGoing beyond individual product pages, Rufus can answer shopping questions more generally. You might want to ask what the best tool is for a particular job, or how two specific items compare to each other, or what a certain item actually does (and how). You can ask about trends in product categories as well\u2014and see what\u2019s proving popular with other shoppers, for instance.\n\nYou can get quite creative with these questions. For example, you\u2019re able to ask about the tools and materials needed to make a garden shed, or about presents that would be suitable for a 5-year-old child\u2019s birthday, or about extras you might need for a dinner party. Any kind of advice you need, Rufus will attempt to give you some pointers.\n\nThis is where Rufus becomes more like other generative AI chatbots out there: If you\u2019re stuck for shopping inspiration, or you\u2019re not sure how two types of TV tech compare, then you can get answers. The questions you ask don\u2019t have to be specifically about what\u2019s being sold on Amazon, though you are quite likely to see links to see some related items on the site anyway.\n\nFinally, you can also chat with Rufus about the status of your current orders, or the last time you ordered (for example) packing tape. Sometimes you\u2019ll get a direct answer, and sometimes you\u2019ll be given a link for a relevant page on the Amazon site to follow. And if you\u2019re wondering how Amazon came up with the name, by the way, then it\u2019s to do with one of Amazon\u2019s earliest employees."

        "article_content": "Have you ever noticed how uploading images from a smartphone to Instagram can be a struggle? We\u2019re talking about making sure the picture fits into the desired aspects and outline of the app.Since you\u2019re mostly clicking using your smartphone\u2019s camera, the dimensions are different from the platform's classic 4:5 aspect ratio. Instagram needs you to fulfill this requirement before publishing. Hence, it\u2019s not always easy to make sure the picture looks good and no visible borders are seen.In case you don\u2019t do it yourself, the app crops or includes white borders to ensure everything is good to go in the FIT option. To be honest, many users were complaining and it looks like Meta has listened to feedback.Now, users will soon be able to benefit from AI-based photo expansion, thanks to this new feature. The popular platform is testing Expand Your Image which uses generative AI for expanding photo edges to fill up Stories. Pictures get analyzed before uploading and undergo expansion using the right content.But the question on many people\u2019s minds is whether it will work seamlessly in all scenarios or not? As per experts, the answer is sadly no. Who knows, it just might thanks to rapid developments in the world of AI.The feature is definitely worth a watch but in other news, the app is already using AI for editing pictures. For instance, there is a Restyle feature where users get to reimagine pictures by adding visual styles described. You can transform clicks through prompts such as watercolor. Similarly, you can use effects like collage styles from magazines or a newspaper with added torn-edge effects.There will be another Backdrop feature that alters how a scene or background is witnessed through a prompt like \u2018put me in front of a rainbow\u2019 or \u2018surround me with rose petals\u2019. It\u2019s amazing how much creativity is included thanks to AI. However, if and when you do plan on using assistance from AI, the image will feature watermarks towards the bottom left-hand side. This makes users differentiate AI from content designed by humans.For now, this expand your image feature is in testing but we\u2019ll let you know once it goes live so stay tuned.Image: Sam Sheffer / X Read next:"

        "article_content": "Marie Curie discovered radioactivity, Alexander Fleming found penicillin: in the 20th century, their merit was clear when they received the Nobel Prizes. In 2024, the Physics and Chemistry Nobels are unusual, and show that the nature of discovery is changing with the advent of AI. How?\n\nOn the stage of Stockholm this year we could observe a new act of the power held by the tech giants of AI: it\u2019s a new performance that should keep us alert. It may be just a matter of doing new research with AI, but, together with their intention to fund a push for nuclear power to satisfy its needs of energy, we cannot sit down and applaud. We\u2019ve done that with social media and are seeing the consequence in our new generations.\n\nThe justification of the 2024 Physics Nobel Prize to J J Hopfield and G E Hinton was \u201cfor foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks\u201d, the forerunners of AI. The prize was perhaps not for physics, as some physicists have said. It was perhaps mimicry, since they copied the human brain\u2019s neural networks that neuroscientists took ages to discover and describe. They picked all that, transferred to the codes of computer science, then scaled up the number of educated artificial neural networks, inserting new layers to form complex networks: a quick job for AI. Evolution took much longer, but of course it came up with more interesting functions for human neurons.\n\nThe reason for the 2024 Nobel prize for Chemistry was \u201cFor computational protein design\u201d (D. Baker) and \u201cFor protein structure prediction\u201d (D Hassabis and J Jumper). Proteins are essential compounds for life, and their structure determines their functions. Part of their structural diversity is \u201cfolding\u201d, the way skeins of amino acid components fold over each other. Baker developed software to predict these structure, but eventually enlisted Hassabis and Jumper, two AI researchers at Deep Mind (Google) to boost this task. In the end, all 200 million proteins listed in prior genetic databases had their structure revealed.\n\nIn both those prizes, there are issues with originality and allocation of merit. In discovery, the winner usually comes up with original research. On the other hand, copying the structure of a living thing is called synthetic or artificial, hardly original. In the Physics prize case, the winners modified the known physical process a living neural network uses to consolidate memory. They used computer science and AI to come up with a machine process to do that.\n\nAs for the Chemistry prize, one could ask: whose merit is it if privileged access to software \u2014 backed by the extremely powerful, massive data of Deep Mind AI \u2014 allows all possible statistical experiments in little time? Displaced merit has a negative effect on innovation and effectiveness of research: this should be of concern to many, including governments\u2019 research funding agencies.\n\nOf further concern is the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants, whose alliances with our research establishments could skew, redirect research, benefit or leave behind some, according to the value algorithms that remain inaccessible.\n\nBut there are more fundamental problems with the use and intrusion of AI in research. One is the nature of AI: it is based on data of existing studies, experiments, trials and publications. There is nothing further, not even the so called \u2018generative\u2019 AI, which is based on new combinations of the same material in the form of large language models. Of course AI can generate anything, including \u2018hallucinations\u2019, but it cannot go further because it doesn\u2019t have logical processes, inferences and arguments, implications or assumptions, lateral thinking etc. So it\u2019s stuck with existing experiences, its creativity limited to novel combinations of the status quo.\n\nThe problem is the current status of AI: it\u2019s considered the most advanced tool one can use. So a creative human mind, instead of using imagination, original perception and new solutions, has to concentrate on the competing speed and cover of AI. Distracted in this way, human creativity will be stunted, preoccupied and loosing ground. When \u2018futurists\u2019 historians predict the takeover of machines over humans, they will have to refer to the slowing of the human mind, not to the advance of \u2018thinking\u2019 machines.\n\nThen, not least, there is the environment and the undoing of terrestrial climate. The AI industry is benefiting from the hype and the naivety of market investors: tech giants are growing at unprecedented speed and are using ever more quantities of energy. Now they are turning back to nuclear power with massive investments, including the idea of recommissioning Three Mile Island, the famous reactor involved in the 1979 nuclear accident. The renewed interest in nuclear power, especially the funds flowing to test the viability of small reactors, will no doubt work against the current speed of renewable energy development. The lively price of uranium is the latest proof."

        "article_content": "The first dinosaur fossils discovered in Hong Kong may provide valuable insights into the Cretaceous period\u2019s terrestrial ecosystems in South China and bring new blood to the academic field, experts have said.\n\nBut a veteran geologist expressed concerns that the fascinating find could result in lasting damage to nature, adding that the city\u2019s curriculum design had misled students interested in geology into selecting a social science subject.\n\nThe experts\u2019 remarks were made before a group of fossil rocks found on Port Island in the Hong Kong Unesco Global Geopark was due to be shown to the public for the first time on Friday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nYoung Ng Chun-yeong, former chairman of the Association for Geoconservation and a key proponent of the geopark designation, said he expected the discovery to reignite public interest in geoscience and deliver long-term benefits to academia.\n\n\u201cBefore having the geopark, most people thought that Hong Kong was mainly a city and a concrete forest, without paying special attention to the natural rock foundations that we have,\u201d said Ng, who now chairs an ecotourism strategy reference group of the Australian Geoscience Council.\n\n\u201cNow that dinosaur fossils have been discovered, people will again notice that the natural foundation of Hong Kong is quite spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe star attraction of the geopark has long been the hexagonal rock columns in Sai Kung, which were formed when a supervolcano erupted 140 million years ago.\n\nNg said that with the finding, \u201ca new story will emerge\u201d that will also put the sedimentary rock formations in other parts of the geopark under the spotlight.\n\n\u201cNew stories will create new excitement, especially for teenagers as they are particularly interested in dinosaurs. So we can use the fossils as an attraction to stimulate teenagers\u2019 interest in this aspect, which will drive interest in future learning,\u201d he said.\n\nNg added that the greater interest from students might also make geoscience research topics popular at universities, which could eventually lead to an increase in researchers and resources in the city\u2019s Earth science academia.\n\nThe fossils belonged to an undetermined kind of dinosaur that dated to the Cretaceous period about 145 million to 66 million years ago.\n\nPalaeontologist Fion Ma Wai-sum said that no animal could survive alone in the wild. She explained that the discovery suggested there was an ecosystem in the vicinity of the island during prehistoric times.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helps to provide a full picture of the dinosaurs living in South China in the past,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that it was plausible that experts would find even more fossils on the island, not only dinosaurs but other animals and plants.\n\nShe also expressed hopes that more resources would be allocated to relevant research, education and outreach activities due to the new discovery and the scientific significance of it.\n\nMichael Pittman, assistant professor at the school of life sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said experts will compare the fossils found in the city with those from mainland China after conducting scientific research to determine the exact type of dinosaur.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that we can find out with further study,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the new finds lead to additional resources for the further expansion of paleontological studies in the city, that would be fantastic.\u201d\n\nChan Lung-sang, a visiting professor of the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley, said he doubted sufficient resources would ever be properly allocated to support geological studies in Hong Kong because geology was often considered as a marginal subject at schools.\n\n\u201cAlthough many students are passionate about topics like rocks, fossils and weather, they are frequently directed toward studying geography, which is primarily social studies ... The current school curriculum design, unfortunately, is not conducive to a proper earth science education in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe veteran geologist, who curated the new palaeontology gallery that opened last year at the Science Museum, also cautioned against attempts to commercially exploit scientific discovery.\n\n\u201cMy greatest concern is that fascinating discoveries, such as the dinosaur bone fossils, could end up being leveraged for economic initiatives, like promoting \u2018dinosaur bone tourism\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lead to infrastructure development in our country parks, eventually resulting in irreversible changes to our natural heritage.\u201d\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2024."

        "article_content": "Google's new Quick Share app for Windows just got the bug fixes it needed from the start\n\nGoogle is rolling out a Quick Share update for Windows devices.\n\nThe Update focuses on optimizing the app's performance on the platform, and squashes several bugs. It doesn't bring any new features.\n\nGoogle is also testing out a percentage indicator for transfer progress on mobile. The change is yet to roll out widely.\n\nSamsung and Google's merged Quick Share is a convenient file-sharing app. Available on Android, ChromeOS, and Windows, the app lets users transmit photos, videos, documents, audio files, and even entire folders through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct.\n\nFor mobile users, the application is set to gain support for file transmission over mobile data. Windows users, on the other hand, are receiving an update too, and although it isn't as exciting as mobile data support, it is necessary for the application's overall stability.\n\nThe update focuses solely on optimizing the application for Windows devices and squashing bugs that have long-plagued the app, bringing Quick Share to v1.0.2002.2 on Windows, as spotted by 9to5Google. A rundown of all the changes can be found below:\n\nFixed to delete files received from an unknown sender with the same payload ID.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when a file name has non-ASCII characters.\n\nFixed an issue where non-ASCII characters prevented received files from opening successfully.\n\nFixed an issue when reading preferences.\n\nFixed an issue where preferences failed to save on certain system configurations.\n\nFixed an issue that kept the Quick Share shortcut icon from showing up in the Start menu after installation.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when reading an input file.\n\nFixed an issue that caused multiple GATT reads during discovery.\n\nFixed a bug to stop Wi-Fi LAN advertising.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when connecting to Bluetooth.\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the Wi-Fi hotspot profile from being deleted correctly.\n\nFixed an issue where the Wi-Fi hotspot couldnt be recovered when the app was closed during file transfer.\n\nGet ready for an improved mobile app UI as well\n\nThe update follows version 1.0.1939.4, which improved the app's animations, added car and foldable devices to the list of device types, alongside support for credential expiration. It's worth noting that the Quick Share app on the Microsoft Store is Samsung's iteration, and currently only works with Samsung devices. Google's unified version of the app for Windows devices is only available through its own website.\n\nIn other Quick Share-related news, Google seems to be testing out a UI tweak for the app on mobile that brings it closer to the desktop counterpart. For reference, Quick Share on Windows shows an estimate of the time remaining alongside the transfer speed during an active transfer. As part of a recent test, users on mobile have now started spotting a percentage-based progress bar, resulting in more precise transfer progress tracking. The change seems to be part of an A/B test, and hasn't rolled out widely yet."

        "article_content": "Micro SaaS, or Software as a Service, is a rising trend in the business world, especially for entrepreneurs and small businesses. With a focused approach on solving niche problems, Micro SaaS products offer smaller-scale, targeted solutions that don\u2019t require huge teams or budgets. In this guide, we\u2019ll explore how to identify the best Micro SaaS products and how you can leverage them for your business growth.\n\nWhat is Micro SaaS?\n\nMicro SaaS refers to smaller software tools or platforms that cater to a specific market or solve a highly niche problem. Unlike traditional SaaS, which often targets larger markets with broad functionality, Micro SaaS is designed for a smaller, more focused customer base. These tools are usually developed by solo entrepreneurs or small teams, making them highly specialized and lightweight.\n\nBenefits of Micro SaaS\n\nLow Start-up Costs : Micro SaaS products usually require minimal resources to develop and maintain, making them ideal for bootstrapping.\n\nScalability : As these products cater to niche markets, scaling can be more straightforward with less competition.\n\nRecurring Revenue : Most Micro SaaS products follow a subscription model, ensuring consistent income streams.\n\nHow to Identify Top Micro SaaS Products\n\nFinding the right Micro SaaS product to use or invest in requires research and understanding of market needs. Here\u2019s how to go about it:\n\n1. Analyze Your Business Needs\n\nBefore diving into Micro SaaS options, take a step back and evaluate your business requirements. Are there repetitive tasks that could be automated? Is there a specific problem you\u2019re struggling to solve? Identifying pain points will help you find SaaS products tailored to your specific needs.\n\n2. Research Niche Markets\n\nMicro SaaS thrives on niche markets, so understanding the market is key. Explore forums, social media groups, and industry-specific blogs to see what tools businesses in your sector are using. For example, if you run a small e-commerce store, you may discover a Micro SaaS product that helps with cart recovery or inventory management.\n\n3. Look for User Reviews\n\nOne of the easiest ways to find top-performing Micro SaaS products is through user reviews and testimonials. Sites like G2, Capterra, or Trustpilot provide insights into user experiences. By reading reviews, you can get a sense of how the product performs, its customer support, and any drawbacks to be aware of.\n\n4. Evaluate Scalability and Flexibility\n\nA good Micro SaaS product should be scalable and flexible enough to grow with your business. Before choosing a tool, evaluate its potential for growth. Will it still serve your business as you scale? Can the product be customized or integrated with other tools?\n\nTop Micro SaaS Categories to Explore\n\nThere are several categories where Micro SaaS products excel. Below are some of the most popular sectors for these tools:\n\n1. Marketing Automation\n\nMicro SaaS products in the marketing space are becoming increasingly popular. These tools focus on automating tasks like social media scheduling, email marketing, or even SEO analysis. Platforms like Buffer for social media management or MailerLite for email automation are prime examples.\n\n2. Project Management\n\nSmaller teams often need lightweight, easy-to-use project management tools. Trello and Notion are Micro SaaS platforms that offer simple solutions for task tracking and team collaboration without overwhelming users with complex features.\n\n3. Customer Support\n\nHandling customer inquiries efficiently is crucial for businesses. Micro SaaS products like HelpScout and Crisp provide simple and effective tools for managing customer support tickets, live chat, and FAQs. These tools focus on delivering value for small businesses that don\u2019t need enterprise-level solutions.\n\n4. E-commerce Optimization\n\nFor e-commerce businesses, Micro SaaS products like Gleam and OptinMonster offer features to help improve conversion rates, such as pop-ups, giveaways, and lead generation forms. These tools are perfect for small e-commerce stores looking to boost sales without massive marketing budgets.\n\nHow to Utilize Micro SaaS Products Effectively\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the right Micro SaaS product for your business, the next step is maximizing its potential. Here are some strategies for making the most out of these tools:\n\n1. Start with a Free Trial\n\nMost Micro SaaS products offer a free trial or a freemium version. Use this time to test the tool in your workflow and assess its value. Pay attention to ease of use, integration capabilities, and the support provided during the trial phase.\n\n2. Integrate with Existing Tools\n\nOne of the best ways to utilize Micro SaaS products is by integrating them with your existing software stack. Many Micro SaaS tools offer API access or direct integrations with popular platforms like Slack, Zapier, or Shopify. By connecting these tools, you can create a more seamless workflow, saving time and effort.\n\n3. Use Data to Track Performance\n\nMicro SaaS tools often come with built-in analytics. Use these data-driven insights to measure how the product impacts your business. For example, if you\u2019re using a SaaS tool for lead generation, track how many leads convert into customers. Analyzing the ROI of the tool will help you decide whether to continue or explore other options.\n\n4. Focus on Customer Support\n\nMicro SaaS products usually offer limited customer support compared to large-scale SaaS platforms. Make sure to leverage whatever support channels are available, whether it\u2019s through a knowledge base, live chat, or email. Effective use of support resources can help you resolve issues quickly and get the most out of the product.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMicro SaaS products offer incredible opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to streamline operations, increase productivity, and solve niche problems. By carefully identifying your needs, researching the best products in your sector, and utilizing them effectively, you can stay ahead of the competition without overwhelming your budget.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for marketing automation tools, customer support platforms, or e-commerce optimizers, Micro SaaS solutions provide a practical and affordable way to grow your business efficiently. Take the time to explore this growing space and harness the power of niche, focused software that perfectly aligns with your business needs."

        "article_content": "Toast (NYSE: TOST) is a restaurant technology company with products for processing payments, taking orders, and more. And one year from now, Toast stock is likely to be trading higher than it is today.\n\nRevenue is growing at more than 20% annually, and management is demonstrating that it knows how to run a profitable business. Those two things are encouraging enough, but there's one more thing that makes me even more optimistic about the long-term prospects of this company.\n\nDon't overlook this adoption trend with Toast\n\nIn the second quarter, around 8,000 new restaurant locations started using Toast's technology. Admittedly, the second quarter is usually a strong one for the company, but this was a record amount of net new locations. And it answers a major question that shareholders had.\n\nIn 2023, Toast launched a new fee that outraged customers, leading management to quickly reverse the decision. But there are other restaurant technology companies out there, and shareholders were left wondering whether Toast had misstepped and alienated users from its platform.\n\nGiven the record number of net new locations in Q2, it appears Toast didn't suffer too much reputational damage. That being the case, there's good reason to believe its growth rate could accelerate.\n\nWhen Toast reaches 20% market share in a specific market, management calls this a flywheel market. It seems its existing customers become brand evangelists in those flywheel areas. Simply put, the company has noted stronger adoption rates, lower expenses, and consequently, higher profits, in flywheel markets.\n\nIn 2021, Toast had 20% or greater market share in only 5% of U.S. markets. In 2023, that jumped to 31% of U.S. markets. And it continues to climb in 2024, according to management.\n\nThe company only has 13% market share in the U.S. as a whole, but more and more markets are reaching a tipping point where taking more share gets easier.\n\nThinking about this from a big-picture perspective, Toast appears to be on a path to claiming a huge percentage of the overall restaurant space in the U.S., meaning the business could have many years of growth ahead of it.\n\nMore than just growth\n\nFor some time, I've been a believer in Toast's growth potential. I was a doubter when it came to its bottom line, but this company is proving me wrong in real time.\n\nToast provides hardware devices to customers at a gross loss, and payment processing is low margin. By contrast, its software subscription products are high margin. That's great, but it takes time for the software profits to get big enough to offset the losses elsewhere in the business. However, as this chart shows, Toast's gross profit margin is jumping higher recently as revenue soars.\n\nStory Continues"
