        "article_content": "For the believers and nonbelievers, the Pentagon answered whether UFOs or aliens have ever visited Earth, saying there is no evidence.\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder fielded several questions from reporters on Thursday on topics such as the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the use of B-2 bombers to conduct precision strikes on five military sites controlled by Houthi forces in Yemen, and North Korean soldiers fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine. On top of those subjects, the daily news cycle is filled with nonstop election coverage.\n\nJeff Schogol of Task & Purpose, which provides military news, culture and analysis by members of that community, took the opportunity to go off-topic with Ryder, and asked about one of Earth\u2019s biggest mysteries.\n\n\"Given the news cycle, you could announce anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life, and no one would care,\" Schogol said. \"So\u2026I\u2019m just going to take the shot. What do you got on UFOs, aliens, etc.?\"\n\nPENTAGON UFO REPORT FINDS NO ALIEN EVIDENCE: \u2018IF US WON\u2019T FESS UP, OTHER NATIONS WILL,' EXPERT WARNS\n\n\"The truth is out there, Jeff, and the truth is, we have no evidence to indicate extraterrestrial life has visited the planet,\" Ryder said.\n\nThe spokesperson\u2019s message was the same that was given months ago on the topic after the coordination of efforts to get to the bottom of whether UFOs, unidentified anomalous phenomena, UAPs, and aliens had been to Earth.\n\nOn July 20, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced the establishment of an All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\n\u2018UFO REVOLUTION\u2019 DOCUSERIES SHOWS UAP FLYING OVER MILITARY BASE, \u2018BLOWS UP DECADES OF CONSPIRACIES\u2019: EXPERT\n\nAARO\u2019s mission is to synchronize efforts across the DoD and other U.S. federal departments and agencies to \"detect, identify and attribute objects of interest\" in or around military facilities or airspace, which could pose a threat to safety of operations or national security \u2014 this includes anomalous, unidentified space, airborne, submerged and trans medium objects.\n\nThen in November, the DoD set up a website to report government activity related to unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), also known as UFOs.\n\nBut after setting up the AARO and conducting multiple investigations, the DoD claims there is no evidence any UAPs came from out of this world.\n\n\"The aggregate findings of all USG investigations to date have not found even one case of UAP representing off-world technology,\" according to the report, which was released on March 1, and \"authentic sensitive national security programs\" were \"mistaken\" with UFO programs.\n\n\"AARO has no evidence for the USG reverse-engineering narrative provided by interviewees and has been able to disprove the majority of the interviewees\u2019 claims,\" the report says, although \"some claims are still under evaluation.\"\n\nRUSSIAN UFO ENGAGEMENTS, SECRET \u2018TIC TAC\u2019 REPORT AND 3 KEY FIGURES SLIP UNDER RADAR AT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING\n\nOther conclusions put forth in the report include the public's general mistrust of the government and \"perceived bureaucratic barriers,\" intense secrecy related to military programs and growing interest in UFOs.\n\nTo put the rapidly growing interest in UFOs into perspective \u2014 a once-considered taboo subject that destroyed careers, like Bob Lazar's after he was essentially forced to hide in exile, had its own Super Bowl commercial.\n\nRyder, at around the same time the report was released, said there was no evidence that any information was \"illegally or inappropriately\" withheld from Congress.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"What we found was that claims of hidden programs are largely the result of circular reporting by a small group repeating what they heard from others and that many people have sincerely misinterpreted real events for mistaking sensitive U.S. programs as UAP or being extra-terrestrial exploitation,\" he said.\n\nFox News Digital's Chris Eberhart and Louis Casiano contributed to this report."

        "article_content": "f5ve have released their otherworldly new single \u2018UFO\u2019 today (October 17). Ahead of the song\u2019s release, the Japanese girl group spoke to NME about the story behind the new single, their remarkable social media presence and how they\u2019re bringing Japan\u2019s unique subcultures to the world.\n\n\u2018UFO\u2019 comes shortly after f5ve \u2013 originally known as SG5 \u2013 hit the big time with their May 2024 single \u2018Lettuce\u2019, a quirky but scathing diss track to a former lover that\u2019s since become a viral sensation on TikTok. Over a video call from Tokyo, the girl group told NME that \u2018UFO\u2019 tells the story of a girl who is exceptionally skilled at claw machines, which were popularised in Japan during the \u201970s and have since become mainstays at arcades around the world. \u201cThe people watching her start thinking, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s so good, she must be an alien\u2019,\u201d Kaede said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really fun and unique story.\u201d\n\nThe futuristic music video for \u2018UFO\u2019 was filmed in Akihabara \u2013 which member Miyuu describes as the \u201cstarting ground\u201d of Japan\u2019s idol scene \u2013 and finds the girl group performing inside a gacha ball, each of them caked in pale makeup and eerie all-white contact lenses. They soon arrive on earth disguised as humans, but their unnaturally large pupils, awkward movements and fascination with claw machines soon give them away as extraterrestrial beings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the US, the word \u2018UFO\u2019 makes people think of aliens, but in Japan, it brings to mind things like claw machines and gacha games,\u201d Miyuu said of their alien-like appearance in the music video, explaining that \u201cit\u2019s a playful word association that blends both Japanese and English\u201d which takes inspiration from UFO-related connotations in each language.\n\nDespite being a global-facing act, f5ve unanimously agree on the importance of showcasing Japanese culture in its truest form in their music and visuals. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to spark a revolution,\u201d said Rui, the youngest of the group. \u201cWe really love and have a lot of confidence in our music and our activities, and we are proud of who we are. We want to bring Japan to the world.\u201d\n\nTake their July single \u2018Underground\u2019, an energetic dance anthem about escaping from societal expectations. Its music video begins with scenes from Tokyo\u2019s busy subway network, with salarymen filing in and out of high-speed trains on their daily commutes. Tired of the monotony on the surface, they escape into the vibrant underground rave scene where they find their place in a sea of colourful outfits and neon lightsticks.\n\nRecommended\n\n\u201cI believe that we stand out because we\u2019re able to really incorporate Japanese culture [in our music] and represent it in an authentic way,\u201d said Sayaka, referencing the \u2018Underground\u2019 and \u2018UFO\u2019 visuals. \u201cI think something unique about us is that we are globally transmitting Japanese culture, which we don\u2019t think any other group is doing right now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kaede shared that the girl group \u201ctake pride\u201d in their Japanese roots. \u201cWe want to spread the best aspects of J-pop and Japanese culture to the world, and no girl group has really done that before. As representatives of Japan, we want to share our culture and show the real side of who we are to other countries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades, the Japanese music industry has been viewed as unusually insular. While a number of acts, especially in recent years, have managed to break through and find global success \u2013 such as YOASOBI, XG and ATARASHII GAKKO!, among others \u2013 few approach their careers with international audiences in mind, at least not the way their K-pop counterparts do. While those that do, Kaede added, seldom place Japanese culture at the forefront of their craft.\n\n\u201cThis might be something culturally embedded in Japanese people, but I think we aren\u2019t as confident in representing our culture and aren\u2019t aware of how much people overseas are interested in it,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so [some artists] might think that whenever they do something for overseas fans, the content has to be catered to them; the songs have to be in English, they have to do things that are already popular overseas.\u201d\n\nWhile chasing global trends might be a safer shot at success, f5ve are reluctant to do so at the expense of their identity. \u201cI think [following trends] ends up diluting the Japanese cultural aspect,\u201d said Kaede. Instead, they trust that their music will find the right audience while the rest of the world catches up. \u201c[We are] transmitting Japanese culture as it is [and] I think it has hit audiences that have always been interested in Japanese culture and music.\u201d\n\nA huge part of being an international facing group, f5ve shared, is the way they interact with fans on social media. While not every member of the act is fluent in English just yet, they have made it a point to bond with their audience, quickly picking up on popular internet slang and memes. This, in turn, has helped them gain a reputation for being one of the most authentic (and chronically online) J-pop acts around \u2013 and it\u2019s one they\u2019ve embraced whole-heartedly.\n\n\u201cThe reactions from overseas fans are really unique, and they always bring a lot of energy with their support,\u201d Kaede shared with an excited laugh. \u201cWhat stands out to me is how they comment things like \u2018Slay mother\u2019, \u2018Queen\u2019, \u2018Face economy, face card\u2019 to compliment us. Like, I have a bob now, so they said things like \u2018Your bob is fire! Your bob is bobbing!\u2019 to compliment my hairstyle. I find it so inspiring how they express it in such a creative way.\u201d\n\nRuri even joked about how the unfettered way they use social media \u2013 \u201cOur account has less official information than other groups, and we comment on a lot of fans\u2019 posts,\u201d she points out \u2013 has fans confused on whether the accounts really belong to the girl group. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t think it\u2019s an official account,\u201d she said.\n\nSocial media savvy aside, Ruri believes that much of f5ve\u2019s bond with their fans (called hi-5) is being \u201ctrue to ourselves\u201d. She explained: \u201cEven while we are doing these unique things, we love music and performing. So being honest, having confidence and expressing how much fun we are having. I think that translates directly to fans and creates a strong bond, which I hope will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nAlthough f5ve remained tight-lipped about what\u2019s to come for them, Rui shared her desire to release a catchy anime-inspired track down the line. \u201cAnd we want to sing about Japanese drinking culture,\u201d she added, to which the rest of the group exclaimed: \u201cWe love to drink!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say much yet, but if I could give a little hint, maybe 2025, there will be a big release from f5ve. We have many songs recorded, so please look forward to it,\u201d said Ruri. Wearing a bright smile, Kaede boldly declared: \u201c2025 might be the year of f5ve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot that we want to accomplish with the songs that we currently have. And so we hope that the fans and everyone can look forward to our activities next year and everything that we want to show to the world!\u201d"

        "article_content": "Recently, AI researcher Simon Willison wanted to add up his charges from using a cloud service, but the payment values and dates he needed were scattered among a dozen separate emails. Inputting them manually would have been tedious, so he turned to a technique he calls \"video scraping,\" which involves feeding a screen recording video into an AI model, similar to ChatGPT, for data extraction purposes.\n\nWhat he discovered seems simple on its surface, but the quality of the result has deeper implications for the future of AI assistants, which may soon be able to see and interact with what we're doing on our computer screens.\n\n\"The other day I found myself needing to add up some numeric values that were scattered across twelve different emails,\" Willison wrote in a detailed post on his blog. He recorded a 35-second video scrolling through the relevant emails, then fed that video into Google's AI Studio tool, which allows people to experiment with several versions of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash AI models.\n\nWillison then asked Gemini to pull the price data from the video and arrange it into a special data format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) that included dates and dollar amounts. The AI model successfully extracted the data, which Willison then formatted as CSV (comma-separated values) table for spreadsheet use. After double-checking for errors as part of his experiment, the accuracy of the results\u2014and what the video analysis cost to run\u2014surprised him.\n\nCredit: Simon Willison A screenshot of Simon Willison using Google Gemini to extract data from a screen capture video. Credit: Simon Willison A screenshot of Simon Willison using Google Gemini to extract data from a screen capture video.\n\n\"The cost [of running the video model] is so low that I had to re-run my calculations three times to make sure I hadn\u2019t made a mistake,\" he wrote. Willison says the entire video analysis process ostensibly cost less than one-tenth of a cent, using just 11,018 tokens on the Gemini 1.5 Flash 002 model. In the end, he actually paid nothing because Google AI Studio is currently free for some types of use."

(WBOY) \u2014 The West Virginia Department of Tourism has expanded the Paranormal Trail, which lets users earn prizes for checking in at different designated spooky spots across the state.\n\nWhen the trail was introduced at the beginning of the month, it had 14 locations. But after seeing \u201cgreat interest\u201d with more than 4,300 people signing up in the first week, according to Gov. Jim Justice, four more check-in spots have been added.\n\nIn north central West Virginia, the Silver Run Tunnel along the North Bend Rail Trail in Ritchie County, which is believed to be haunted by a woman in a white dress, and Cryptid Mountain Miniature Golf in Morgantown have both been added.\n\nSutton in Braxton County picked up a third location, the West Virginia Bigfoot Museum, meaning that you can earn the 3-stop prize just by exploring the town.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s Flatwoods Monster featured in new anime television series\n\nThe fourth new stop is the Hempfield Tunnel in Wheeling, which is believed to be haunted by the souls of those buried beneath its tracks.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see the love the Paranormal Trail is receiving from both in-state residents and travelers near and far,\u201d said West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby in a press release. \u201cThese four new stops give folks even more mysterious locations to explore, just in time for Halloween. I can\u2019t wait to hear more stories of the one-of-a-kind adventures guests experience as they make their way through some of West Virginia\u2019s most haunted attractions.\u201d\n\nAlthough the added locations will make it easier to earn the official Paranormal Trail sticker (3 check-ins) and the official Paranormal Trail beanie (10 check-ins), it will make it more difficult to earn the limited edition Paranormal Trail print, which is the prize for checking in at all the spooky spots.\n\nTo learn how to participate, visit the West Virginia Department of Tourism\u2019s website here.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

An image captured by the Perseverance rover in the course of its duties is one of the grisliest yet: it looks, for all the world, like a desiccated, decaying human head, severed from any body, just withering away under the harsh light of the Sun.\n\nIt is not a human head, you may be relieved (or dismayed) to know. It is \u2013 like most things on Mars that isn't a bit of ice, cloud, dust, or a nifty hole \u2013 a rock, one that so happens to look like another thing.\n\nThis particular rock was photographed on 27 September 2024, and monstrous head aside, it looks like a chunk of sedimentary sandstone not unlike other rocks around it. Which isn't unusual for Mars, especially where water is once thought to have flowed.\n\nThe thing that makes it unusual is its shape: the way it is weathered, and its orientation to the camera, make it look like a head, laying on its side, showing similarities to a brow ridge, nose, mouth, and chin.\n\nPareidolia, or the identification of meaningful shapes and images in random objects and arrangements, is surprisingly common among pictures of Mars. So far, we've found rocks that look like a bear's face, fungus, a carved image of a warrior, a teeny tiny Bigfoot, a spoon, a femur, and even bugs.\n\nIt's thought to happen when your eyes see an arrangement of shadows or objects or shapes, and some parts of your brain that process visual information jump to conclusions before the rest of your gray matter catches up, and it absolutely happens here on Earth too. There's even a special nub of tissue devoted to the rapid identification of faces, contained within the fusiform gyrus deep within the brain.\n\nTake a look through Onformative's Google Faces project, to identify face-like shapes in Google Earth images. The Badlands Guardian is a particularly famous example. Other examples include what look like human faces spotted on single grains of sand.\n\nIt's a pretty cool coincidence that a rock on Mars can be eroded in the shapes and proportions of a humanoid head, but that's all it is. To date, there remains no evidence that complex life ever emerged on, or visited, the red planet.\n\nHumanity is hoping to change that, with future crewed missions to Mars being planned. We might just be the aliens that leave mysterious objects behind, to baffle other alien explorers, far into the future."

        "article_content": "Archeologists in Denmark have made one of the most notable discoveries in recent history: a group of 50 skeletons found in a burial ground, believed to be from the Viking Era. The skeletal remains could help scientists unearth some of the mysteries around Viking DNA, and provide new answers about this centuries-old civilization.\n\nThe skeletons were reportedly preserved due to favorable conditions near the burial site; they were discovered in mid-October near the village of \u00c5sum, a remote settlement located three miles from Denmark's third-largest city, Odense, on the island of Funen. And scientists are just now getting started on unlocking the puzzles behind these ancient remains.\n\nWhat did the archeologists discover?\n\nA team from Denmark's Museum Odense located the burial site, which covers around 21,500 square feet and \"was used in the 8th and 9th centuries,\" the museum said in a press release. A \"total of 50 inhumation graves and five cremation graves have been found, placing the burial ground among the largest Viking burial sites discovered on the island of Funen.\" The discovery proves that the area was a \"key geographical point for the earliest urban developments\" in what would become modern Denmark. The graves contained men, women and children.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Sign up\n\nSeveral of the skeletons \"belonged to high-status individuals in society, as seen from the grave goods they were buried with,\" said the Museum Odense press release. This includes a woman who was \"buried in a wagon, the upper part of a Viking cart used as a coffin,\" as well as another grave containing a \"fine bronze three-lobed brooch, a single red glass bead that hung on a cord around the deceased's neck, an iron knife, and a small piece of rock crystal.\"\n\nWhat can these skeletons tell us about the Vikings?\n\nThe finding of the graves \"opens a whole new toolbox for scientific discovery,\" Museum Odense curator Michael Borre Lund\u00f8 said to Newsweek. The museum is hoping to perform DNA analysis on the recovered skeletons to see what information can be obtained from their bones.\n\nThis discovery in particular is rare because of the well-preserved nature of the remains. Often \"when we excavate bodies from the Viking age, we are lucky if there are just a few teeth,\" Lund\u00f8 said to CNN. But in this case, the dampness of the region meant that for \"long periods of time the bodies of the Vikings were covered in water, which slows down the decomposition of the bones.\u201d\n\nAs noted in the museum's press release, DNA testing on the skeletons could provide information on the \"general health, diet, and origins of those buried\" in \u00c5sum. DNA imaging \"might even reveal whether the buried Vikings were related, which would be particularly significant, as this has never been examined in similar graves.\" This could \"give us a much better idea of people's ages, sex, what diseases they might have had,\" and more, Lund\u00f8 said to CNN.\n\nScientists are \"really hoping to gain the larger picture,\" conservator Jannie Amsgaard Ebsen said to The Associated Press. \"Who were the people that were living out there? Who did they interact with? It's a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle: all the various puzzle parts will be placed together.\" Archeologists are continuing to dig up some of the area around \u00c5sum, CNN reported. Most of the skeletons themselves have already been removed from the burial site, and are currently awaiting further testing and DNA extraction."

According to Precedence Research, the global software market size reached $659.17 billion in 2023\u200b. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% during 2024 \u2013 2034 to reach $2.24 trillion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. In 2023, the North American region led the software market, holding a substantial share of 44%. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.\n\nA key factor influencing the market is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being integrated into software solutions to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. A study from Salesforce reveals that 85% of IT leaders expect AI to boost developer productivity over the next three years. This expectation underscores the growing recognition of AI\u2019s role in streamlining workflows and optimizing software performance.\n\nAnother significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based software. Companies are migrating from traditional on-premises solutions to cloud services due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This transition allows businesses to access applications remotely and across various devices, which has become crucial in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nThe 2024 AlgoSec State of Network Security report highlights a notable shift towards multi-cloud environments. The research, based on surveys conducted in H2 of 2022 and 2023, evaluated major players like AWS and Microsoft Azure. It indicates that security, continuity, and compliance are key factors driving organizations to adopt cloud platforms. While cloud adoption is growing, Azure remains the most popular platform, with AWS rapidly gaining ground.\n\nThe report also reveals that the move to remote work has significantly boosted Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) deployment, dropping the percentage of organizations without SD-WAN from 55.2% in 2022 to 34% in 2023. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022. This trend reflects a growing focus on securing cloud networks against external threats.\n\nWith an overview of the global software market in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.
