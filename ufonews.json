        "article_content": "UFOs came to Washington again today.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. at 11:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) is a relatively new catch-all term that includes sightings of unexplained objects or events that take place in the air, underwater, in space, or that travel between those domains.\n\nLike previous congressional UFO hearings, today's event featured testimony from current U.S. military personnel who claim the American government has for decades hidden evidence of advanced technologies and otherworldly visitors from the public. A multitude of anecdotes were presented about flying orbs coming out of the ocean, disc-shaped objects, and craft \"exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal.\" While such claims are nothing new, what is noteworthy about today's hearing are the pedigrees of some of the whistleblowers who testified, including a former U.S. counterintelligence officer, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former NASA associate administrator. All of them stressed the need for more government transparency, less stigma about the UFO topic and new policies to bring UAP data out of the \"black\" classified world and into the public domain.\n\nA still from a video titled \"Go Fast\" recorded by a U.S. Navy aircraft reportedly showing a UAP that was discussed in the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" on Wednesday (Nov. 13). (Image credit: U.S. Department of Defense)\n\nThis isn't the U.S. government's first attempt to investigate the recent wave of UFO claims that began in 2017. A similar hearing was held last year, in which a whistleblower told Congress the U.S. government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence.'\n\nThe Pentagon also created the All-Doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAP reports and government data about UFOs, but critics, including some government officials, are skeptical of the office's aims and methods.\n\nRelated: UFO whistleblower tells Congress the US government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence'\n\n\"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks today. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOther representatives stressed the need for transparency and data analysis today, a common theme of other recent UAP studies. \"We have evidence that what we are detecting things, and we know that we don't understand them, and this is worth investigating,\" Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said. \"I believe we can always be more transparent. To me, this hearing and others are simply about the truth and getting to the facts of what these UAPs actually are.\"\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former U.S. counterintelligence officer who has been vocal about such claims in recent years, told the assembled representatives at the hearing that \"excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public \u2014 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" Elizondo stated during his testimony.\n\nElizondo, who claims to have previously investigated UFOs as part of a secret Pentagon program, suggested that the U.S. government create a \"whole-of-government\" approach to studying UAP, create a national UAP strategy and offer protections so that whistleblowers who are \"desperate to do the right thing can come forward without fear.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Elizondo was asked if some of the \"advanced technologies\" that have been seen monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe could be operated by aliens or private companies. \"Maybe both,\" Elizondo replied.\n\nElizondo also stated point-blank to Rep. Mace's questioning that the U.S. government has programs to retrieve crashed UAP and reverse-engineer them, but avoided giving any specifics in an unclassified public setting such as the hearing.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) then questioned Elizondo, asking the former counterintelligence agent about a document he signed that limits him from speaking publicly about crash retrieval programs. \"The document said you can't talk about crash retrieval. Well, you know, you can't talk about Fight Club if there's no Fight Club, correct?\"\n\nLike other witnesses, Elizondo stated that the alleged excessive government secrecy around UFOs harms national security. In response to questioning from Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Elizondo stated that, if UAP sightings turned out to be technologies operated by adversarial nations, it would be \"an intelligence failure eclipsing 9/11 in order of magnitude.\"\n\nA still from footage shot by an MQ-9 reaper drone showing an unidentified spherical object soaring through the air shown to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services during an April 2023 hearing. (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nRetired U.S. Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet offered similar testimony as Elizondo. \"We know from last year's UAP hearing and recent statements and publications by credible whistleblowers that UAP, NHI [non-human intelligence], and their technology of unknown origin (TUO) represent a new realization that we are not the only advanced intelligence in the universe,\" Gallaudet said on Wednesday, according to his published remarks.\n\n\"Unelected officials in the U.S. government do not have an exclusive right to this knowledge about the nature of reality. The American people have a right to that knowledge,\" Gallaudet said. The retired rear admiral also stressed the national security and airspace safety concerns related with UAP sightings, calling them \"extensive.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Garcia asked Gallaudet and other witnesses what UAP might represent, the retired rear admiral said he believes they are evidence of a \"non-human higher intelligence.\"\n\nFormer NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold also testified at today's hearing, and previously served on NASA's UAP study team. Gold's testimony was more grounded; for example, he stressed the need for NASA to contribute its authority and expertise toward analyzing what UAP data it might already possess and helping dispel the stigma associated with the UFO topic.\n\n\"Our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science, but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA search team elicits such a vitriolic response,\" Gold said during today's hearing. \"Therefore, one of the most important actions that can be taken, relative to exposing the truth of UAP, is to combat the stigma, and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful.\"\n\nGold added that NASA has a massive archive of data that could possibly contain evidence of UAP, and suggested that artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms could help sort through the agency's trove of data to help shine light on the UFO phenomenon. In addition, the former NASA associate administrator said the agency should develop specialized instruments that might be able to gather useful data about UAP.\n\nRelated: NASA UFO report finds no evidence of 'extraterrestrial origin' for UAP sightings\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger also testified today, telling the representatives that there's a \"growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly called UFOs, and that elements within the military and IC [intelligence community] are in violation of their Constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.\"\n\nShellenberger stated that there is a secret program within the U.S. government known as \"Immaculate Constellation\" whose sole purpose is to collect UFO and UAP reports from military personnel and sensor data and quarantine them away from the rest of the government and military. While he noted that a Pentagon spokesperson has stated no such program exists, Shellenberger recounted prior examples in which the Department of Defense has initially denied knowledge of UAP-related information only to later change its stance and either admit the information exists or release it to the public.\n\n\"The U.S. government appears to know significantly more about UAPs than it is revealing,\" Shellenberger said at the hearing. \"But even those who believe the U.S. government has revealed all that it knows should have no objection to Congressional demands for greater transparency.\"\n\nTo conclude the meeting, Rep. Mace asked each of the witnesses to define what non-human biologics or non-human intelligence mean to each of them.\n\n\"I don't think it's a stretch, when you look at the diversity of life on this planet and the size of this universe, to think that there will be more diverse, higher-order, non-human intelligence throughout the universe, and that's probably what's visiting us,\" Gallaudet said.\n\nElizondo stated he would take a scientific approach: \"The definition would be the ability to react to a stimulus in a manner that requires an intellectual thought process.\"\n\nGold, meanwhile, questioned whether non-human intelligence necessarily implies life, suggesting sophisticated artificial intelligence might be responsible for some UAP encounters. Shellenberger simply stated he did not know what they might be.\n\nRelated: The search for alien life\n\nIn today's hearing, as in other UFO hearings, there was a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. One of the core tenets of these whistleblower testimonies is that much of the credible UFO data is classified and can't be revealed to the public based on the military capabilities that some of that data could reveal.\n\nWhistleblowers have attested for years that, because advanced or classified sensors and satellites sometimes capture footage or photos of unexplained phenomena or advanced craft, those photos or videos are likewise classified by the U.S. government in order to not reveal America's full surveillance or sensing capabilities.\n\nSuch was the case in 2023 when U.S. military aircraft shot down a mysterious object off the coast of Alaska. The American government has yet to release any imagery from the event, but a Canadian freedom of information request unveiled a photograph earlier this year of a balloon-like object.\n\nThose incidents and others like it, such as a weeks-long drone incursion above Langley Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., were discussed in today's hearing. \"The origin of these drones and their operators remains a mystery,\" Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said. \"This incident and other sightings near sensitive military installations highlights the complexity of the UAP challenge facing our intelligence, defense and homeland security committees.\""

Read our coverage for more details and videos from the hearing.\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs today, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You can watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

Besides reading everything published by TechRadar, navigating and connecting news stories you want to follow up on can feel like a full-time job on its own. A new mobile app called Particle is employing AI to solve that problem. Particle's iOS app relies on AI to sift through the news, looking beyond headlines and across multiple platforms to create more comprehensive reports on current events and real-time answers to questions about the news.\n\nParticle offers customizable summaries of the news called Stories, claiming they are a more holistic way to explain what's happening in the world. You can ask the app to simplify the news by telling it to \"Explain Like I\u2019m 5\" or get the most concise, basic facts with the \"5Ws\" format of who, what, when, where, and why. If you want to see a range of opinions and views on a story, you can open the \"Opposite Sides\" summary for contrasting perspectives.\n\nYou can also ask for the summaries in audio form and in different languages. If just seeing summaries is too passive, Particle also has an AI chatbot to answer questions about stories and see what others have asked. The AI also adapts to your interests so you're more likely to see stories on the topics you care about.\n\n\"We\u2019re often scouring the news, looking for answers we might not even find. With Particle, you can get an instant answer to any question about the story. And because you can see other people\u2019s questions, sometimes the answer you\u2019re looking for is already there,\" Particle wrote in a blog post. \"We enable powerful and transparent control over which stories you see, and which you don\u2019t. On Particle, you can tune your interests to the topics that matter the most to you. Your news feed will adapt to your interests, bringing you the most relevant stories without the noise.\"\n\nAI journalistic aid\n\nAI's foibles being what they are, Particle tries to avoid issues of incorrect facts and hallucinations with reviews by AI models and human oversight. The stories all include links to original sources as well; useful if you see something that comes off as unlikely. If the AI gets something wrong, you can flag it to have Particle fix the error.\n\nEfficient news gathering is obviously appealing to busy people. Particle's app can be as in-depth or straightforward as you want, which is another benefit to those who want to be more engaged in current events but who sometimes just want the basic facts and other times want more background than any single article might include. I'd rather rely on Particle than on the sometimes garbled or misunderstood takes seen on social media. If you want to keep up with the news without spending all day sorting through different sources, I'd give it a try after you finish your daily read-through of every word published here.\n\nYou might also like"

I believe there are more things in this world that we don\u2019t understand, and I don\u2019t discount the possibility at all,\u201d said Fran Walters, who has lived next door for the last 28 years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first moved out here, I\u2019d walk by there and I could not believe there was a little girl playing in the front, and I remember thinking, \u2018How could a family with little kids buy this house?'\u201d she said.\n\n5 On Nov. 13, 1947, Ronald DeFeo, 23, walked through his Amityville home and executed his sleeping family Newsday via Getty Images\n\nThe house has long attracted curiosity seekers over its claims that it is haunted, but the legends began with a real-life crime on Nov. 13, 1974.\n\nAt around 3 a.m., 23-year-old Ronald \u201cButch\u201d DeFeo rose from bed with a .35 caliber rifle in his hands and executed his parents and four siblings as they slept.\n\nHe then got dressed, and went to work. It wasn\u2019t until hours later that DeFeo burst into a neighborhood bar and claimed somebody had attacked his family.\n\nThe next year DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, but he spent his life blaming a long list of others \u2014 at one point reportedly claiming \u201cvoices\u201d coming from the house urged him to do it.\n\nThough DeFeo was believed to be a heavy drug user, famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren \u2014 who have since been fictionalized in \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d series of movies \u2014 came to believe he was performing satanic rituals, and those voices may have been demonic forces he unleashed on the house.\n\n5 DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, and died in 2021 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\u201cDeFeo was into Satanism,\u201d said Tony Spera, the Warrens\u2019 son-in-law, who now leads the couple\u2019s New England Society of Psychic Research. \u201cHe had a little room they called the red room because it was painted red, and there\u2019s a little cubby hole and he kept his satanic artifacts in there.\n\n\u201cThings were happening in the home,\u201d Spera told The Post. \u201cSomething was going on in that house that was nefarious, and we believe it was Ronald DeFeo Jr. doing these satanic rituals.\u201d\n\nAs DeFeo was being sentenced, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the Amityville house with their three kids at a bargain price of $80,000.\n\nOver the next 28 days, the family claimed they were harassed by a host of terrifying happenings \u2014 including levitations and visions of hags, the children sleeping face-down just as the DeFeos bodies were found, freezing temperatures while fireplaces raged, and slime oozing from walls and doors.\n\n5 Tony Spera, the son-in-law of Ed and Lorraine Warren, cautioned that the Amityville house could still be haunted Matthew McDermott\n\nThey fled the home before the month was out, and after a local news station camped out at the house for a segment the Warrens showed up to investigate \u2014 but the Lutzes reportedly refused to go back inside with them.\n\n\u201cThere was an arrangement for George to meet Ed and Lorraine at a pizza place about five blocks away from the Amityville house,\u201d Spera recounted. \u201cEd said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go to the house and check it out.\u2019\n\n\u201cGeorge stands up, pulls out the keys to the house. He goes, \u2018Here\u2019s the keys. I\u2019m not going in that house \u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere near that house. Do me a favor, Ed, in such-and-such a drawer there\u2019s a deed to the house. Just get me that, will you?\u2019\u201d\n\nMonths later the Lutzes inked a book deal to tell their story, with \u201cThe Amityville Horror: A Story,\u201d which came out in 1977 and was an immediate success, sparking an even more successful film and sequels.\n\nThough many wrote it off as a hoax \u2014 DeFeo\u2019s own attorney, William Weber, later claimed he and the family concocted the story over several bottles of wine \u2014 the Lutz parents stood by their story for life.\n\n5 George and Kathy Lutz stood by their haunting story their entire lives Getty Images\n\nAnd while the house has changed hands numerous times since the Lutzes left, none of the owners have ever reported any hauntings over those five decades \u2014 something Spera thinks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Lutzes were lying, or that whatever haunted them is really gone.\n\n\u201cEd used to not want to talk very much about it, because he said the more recognition you give to it, the more likely something would happen. It depends on the entity, too, that might be at that house. It may lay dormant for years,\u201d Spera said.\n\n\u201cThere could possibly \u2014 and I\u2019m emphasizing the word possibly \u2014 still be something dormant in that structure that could reignite with either recognition, or somebody doing rituals in the house, incantations, or a family that is susceptible to hauntings \u2014 in other words, a family that\u2019s weak-willed, or someone in the house that\u2019s weak-willed.\n\n5 The Amityville house has changed hands numerous times since 1974, but nobody has reported a haunting since Getty Images\n\n\u201cSo in other words, I can move into a house. I can make it haunted. I can make the house haunted by dabbling in occult practices, by doing witchcraft, incantations, satanic rituals, using a Ouija board in the house,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you do things like that, you\u2019re inviting things into your life. You\u2019re inviting the unknown in.\u201d\n\nThe current residents of the house \u2013 along with one of the Lutz children \u2013 declined to comment.\n\nAs for Walters \u2014 who \u201cmade it a point to never ever, ever watch the movie\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s ventured inside the \u201cbeautiful\u201d home once during an estate sale, but wouldn\u2019t consider living there.\n\n\u201cIn the back of my head, the Amityville Horror would always be there. You\u2019d hear a little creak in the night and it might set you off. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said."

        "article_content": "Some of the victims of the Mount Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D. in Pompeii were cast in plaster to preserve the scene.\n\nNew DNA studies of those victims tell a different tale than what experts had previously speculated.\n\nCommon interpretations of three well-known relationships were proven false by the scientific study.\n\nThe Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 A.D. blanketed Pompeii in destruction. To preserve the historical nature of the event and help tell the stories of the residents of the city, some of the victims who had been buried by the ash and debris from the volcano were eventually cast in plaster. It turns out that the stories of a few of those individuals weren\u2019t quite as truthful as we previously thought.\n\nA new study\u2014published in Current Biology by a team of researchers at Harvard University and the Archaeological Park of Pompeii in Naples, Italy\u2014asserts that ancient DNA taken from some of the victims challenges stories long told about those particular Pompeii citizens.\n\n\u201cThe findings demonstrate the importance of integrating genetic analysis with archaeological and historical information to enrich or correct narratives constructed based on limited evidence,\u201d Alissa Mittnik, a co-author of the study, said in a statement.\n\nRelated Story Roman Coins, Graves Found in Pompeii Shop Dig\n\nFor decades, many of the stories told about the relationships and connections between individuals discovered within the Archaeological Park of Pompeii were based simply on the physical appearances of the victims and their proximity to one another. In one situation, for example, the tableau of an adult with a golden bracelet holding a child on their lap was interpreted as a mother holding her offspring. This recent DNA analysis, however, shows that there was no maternal presence or any familial relationship involved in the scene. Instead, the adult in the scene wearing the jewelry was a male who was biologically unrelated to the child.\n\nA second scene features four victims huddled together, often believed to be a family. But when the research team analyzed DNA from three of the victims, they found no genetic ties between them.\n\nIn a third situation, two individuals are seen lying in what is believed to be an embrace. Some have hypothesized the two people could be sisters, a mother holding a daughter, or even lovers. The DNA shows that at least one of the two people was a male, eliminating two of the three common interpretations.\n\nThe ancient eruption buried several Roman towns, killing inhabitants and laying ash deposits across cities that preserved everything from buildings to sculptures and mosaics to human victims. Shortly following the eruption, rain helped functionally cement the bodies within the ash. When excavators descended upon the area centuries later, the outlines of roughly 1,000 victims remained and\u2014in over 100 cases\u2014the cavities were filled in with plaster to preserve their positioning.\n\nRelated Story Before Volcanoes, Pompeii Struggled with Potholes\n\nWhile this DNA analysis dispels some of the myths of Pompeii, the goal of the team behind this work was not necessarily to sleuth out any definitive histories. And DNA on its own wouldn\u2019t be enough to know the stories of these victims. For one, some of the remains may have been moved from their original positions, and the plaster casts could have been \u201ccreatively restored\u201d in the past, the study authors wrote. The team also warned that using so few clues, such as jewelry, to spin a full tale proves risky, especially in an area rich with differing cultures.\n\nThe intent of the team was never to get these stories right once and for all\u2014rather, they wanted to ensure that the tales were merely less wrong. \u201cInstead of establishing new narratives that might also misrepresent these people\u2019s experiences,\u201d David Reich, co-senior author of the study, said in a statement, \u201cthe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations.\u201d"

Unearthed was the remarkably preserved skull of a previously unknown bird species, Navaornis hestiae, from the Cretaceous Period. This discovery allowed researchers to digitally reconstruct the brain and inner ear anatomy of the ancient bird, providing significant clues to how modern avian brains, renowned for their cognitive abilities, evolved over millions of years.\n\nIn another significant development, researchers have documented catastrophic declines in African elephant populations across the continent. This comprehensive assessment, unveiled on Monday, revealed dramatic population drops of the savanna and forest elephant species. The study utilized data from population surveys at 475 sites spanning 37 countries from 1964 to 2016, painting a grim picture of these majestic mammals' plight.\n\nTogether, these findings emphasize the importance of understanding both past and present ecosystems. The fossil discovery not only enhances knowledge of avian evolution but underlines the necessity of tackling current biodiversity challenges, as evidenced by the declining numbers of African elephants, some of the planet's most intelligent and social creatures.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

        "article_content": "The excavations show the mysterious monument known as \"King Arthur's Hall\" on Cornwall's Bodmin Moor was built more than 5,000 years ago.\n\nA structure in southwest England that's associated with King Arthur isn't medieval as scientists had long thought. Instead, it dates back more than 5,000 years, to the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, archaeologists say \u2014 thousands of years before the mythical king and his knights are said to have lived.\n\nThe scientists who were involved in recent excavations at \"King Arthur's Hall,\" an unusual rectangular structure on the Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, used several dating techniques to establish that the hall was built between 5,000 and 5,500 years ago.\n\nThe results challenge the idea that the structure had anything to do with the mythical Arthur, who would have lived in the fifth or sixth centuries A.D. \u2014 although most historians think he didn't exist at all and, in reality, was a medieval fiction based on traditional tales.\n\n\"Given that the monument is now 4,000 years older than most people thought, we now need to consider the monument within the context of Bodmin Moor's prehistoric landscape,\" Tim Kinnaird , a geochronologist at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, told Live Science.\n\nRelated: Graves of dozens of kings from the time of King Arthur uncovered in Britain\n\nKinnaird is an expert in optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), which can estimate when certain minerals were last exposed to the sun. The OSL results were combined with other dating techniques, such as the radiocarbon dating of buried pollen and insect eggs, to determine the age of the mysterious structure.\n\nKing Arthur's Hall isn't the only Neolithic structure associated with Arthur. Arthur's Stone , a 5,700-year-old chambered tomb in Herefordshire, is also linked through legend to the medieval king, with one story claiming that a giant battling Arthur at the site fell and left an imprint of its elbow on the tomb.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

(Image credit: Cornwall National Landscape)\n\nKing Arthur's Hall\n\nKing Arthur's Hall is an unusual solitary structure on a remote part of Bodmin Moor; the name \"moor\" here means \"open uplands,\" possibly from an Old English word meaning \"swamp.\" It is rectangular, consists of a bank of earth and stone measuring about 69 by 160 feet (21 by 49 meters), and is studded with 56 standing stones on the inner face of the embankment.\n\nHistoric England, a government agency, had listed the structure as a medieval animal pound, although its standing stones and north-south alignment suggested it might be prehistoric. Now, the new dating has established that the structure was built in the late fourth millennium B.C., during the Neolithic \u2014 a discovery that indicates it is older than the oldest parts of Stonehenge .\n\nKinnaird said in an email that King Arthur's Hall had now been revealed as one of several prehistoric monuments on Bodmin Moor, which indicates an active Neolithic community had built a rich landscape of monuments there. Other nearby Neolithic structures include \"tor enclosures,\" such as Rough Tor ; standing stones; and \"long barrows\" (burial mounds).\n\nImage 1 of 2 The excavations were carried out this summer by a team of scientists from several British universities and local archaeologists. (Image credit: Cornwall National Landscape) The new analysis included the radiocarbon dating of organic materials and the dating of soil with Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), which can determine when certain minerals were last exposed to sunlight. (Image credit: Cornwall National Landscape)\n\nDeath of Arthur\n\nCornwall's Bodmin Moor has long been regarded in legends as the site of Arthur's final Battle of Camlann. According to medieval Welsh texts, Arthur and his knights fought in the sixth century against the rebel forces of Mordred at Camlann \u2014 a location identified by some as the Cornish town of Camelford on the edge of Bodmin Moor, although there are rivals for the claim .\n\nLegends say Mordred \u2014 either Arthur's nephew or illegitimate son, according to various authors \u2014 was killed in the battle, while Arthur was fatally wounded and taken by a magical boat to the mystical island of Avalon .\n\nSeveral ancient sites around Bodmin Moor are linked with Arthurian legends, and in the 16th century it was said Arthur himself had frequented King Arthur's Hall. But the new results show the structure must have already been thousands of years old if Arthur ever went there.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cornwall Archaeology Society, which was also involved in the excavations, said the association with Arthur reflected the structure's unknown origins."

Below are some Cavaliers versus 76ers markets to consider:\n\nCavaliers moneyline: -450 odds\n\nEvan Mobley to score 10+ points: -950 odds\n\nAlternate over 201.5: -590 odds\n\n*Note: Odds are based on the best value our experts find as of publication; check lines closer to game time to ensure you get the best odds."

        "article_content": "For the most part, Google has issued an update to the Pixel Watch roughly once a month. Most were simple security updates, while others included new features and OS upgrades. Fans expected an update in October, but Google delayed it until this month. This update will resume the rollout of Wear OS 5 to Pixel Watch 1 and Pixel Watch 2 users after a series of crashes caused Google to pause it back in September. After several months of work, the company has addressed the cause of the crashes and is confident that yesterday\u2019s update will be stable.\n\nIn addition to Wear OS 5, the update will also include better camera controls and changes to the Pixel Recorder app, which will be available through the Play Store. Your individual watch will notify you when the update is available for download, so you don\u2019t have to constantly check for it. The first update for the Pixel Watch 3 since its launch is also coming with bug fixes and security updates. All Pixel Watch models will eventually update to version AW2A.241105.012, although when the update happens will depend on both the carrier and the device.\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re going to have to wait a while for the next Pixel Watch software updates, which Google says won\u2019t come until March 2025. Before now, Pixel Watch users have never before seen a three-month gap in updates. The longest time between updates usually coincided with operating system upgrades, such as from Wear OS 3 to Wear OS 4. That said, slower updates aren\u2019t necessarily a downside. By reducing the time spent on deploying bug fixes, Google could potentially focus on releasing regular, larger updates \u2014 maybe quarterly versus monthly.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile the wait is unfortunate, it does have a gleaming silver lining. The schedule for the next update lines up with a March Feature Drop. You can expect some significant upgrades and improvements, along with a few updates we already know are coming like the Android 15 QPR2 beta. Expect to see changes not only in how the Pixel Watch works, but also in how it interacts with Android. It\u2019s also safe to say that there are likely several surprises we haven\u2019t come across yet."
