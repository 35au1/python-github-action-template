        "article_content": "Jimmy Kimmel. and Aaron Rodgers (Images Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAaron Rodgers has had his share of controversy. Despite being an absolute legend on the field, Rodgers has been quite vocal outside of the NFL realm as well. From admitting to spotting a UFO to making bold vaccination claims, Rodgers has always been in the news. One of his major feuds included the one he had with Jimmy Kimmel back in 2023.\n\nHere\u2019s everything that you need to know about the famous controversy.\n\nWhat Happened Between Jimmy Kimmel And Aaron Rodgers?\n\nIn a February 2023 episode of \u2018The Pat McAfee Show,\u2019 Rodgers discussed the incident of the US military taking down several unidentified aerial objects. However, otherwise known to be a UFO enthusiast, Rodgers did not seem interested. He insisted that the event was fabricated to take away focus from the Epstein client list.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Jeffrey Epstein has an alleged client list that reportedly visited his private island, Little Saint James. As a matter of fact, the island was notorious for allegedly abusing underage girls and several young women. Speaking about the same, Rodgers stated, \u201cThere\u2019s some files that have some names on it that might be getting released pretty soon.\u201d\n\nThis is the full timeline of the Jimmy Kimmel and Aaron Rodgers feud.\n\n\n\nI assumed Rodgers was trying to make a joke because he wasn\u2019t a fan of Kimmel\u2019s jokes about him.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Should Rodgers apologize or is Kimmel overreacting? pic.twitter.com/OmAclp8Eyb \u2014 Mike Ro \ud835\udd4f (@nuro_mike) January 3, 2024\n\nApparently, Jimmy Kimmel heavily criticized such a statement. Taunting the Green Bay Packers legend, Kimmel called him a \u2018tin foil hat.\u2019 This further escalated the situation, leading to further verbal back-and-forth between the two.\n\nWhat Did Aaron Rodgers Say To Jimmy Kimmel?\n\nFollowing Kimmel\u2019s taunt, Aaron Rodgers accused Kimmel of being on that dreaded list. Sparking a huge controversy, A-Rod said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, that are really hoping that doesn\u2019t come out.\u201d Such remarks further enraged Kimmel, who threatened to take legal action against the NFL star, while asking him to apologize.\n\nClick on \u2018Follow Us\u2019 and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google! Follow Us\n\nDisappointed by McAfee\u2019s approach!\n\n\n\nDisney/ESPN won.\n\n\n\nAaron Rodgers suspended from \"The Pat McAfee Show\" after his comments on Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n\n\nMcAfee said he was \"happy\" Rodgers wouldn't be back on the show because of the drama it caused.\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/xSZUSdHbfu \u2014 Patrick Bet-David (@patrickbetdavid) January 10, 2024\n\nAlthough Rodgers did not apologize, he did tone down his narrative against Jimmy Kimmel significantly. Rodgers said, \u201cI\u2019m glad that Jimmy is not on the list. I really am, and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s the P-word.\u201d Looking at Kimmel\u2019s reactions, another Packers star, David Bakhtiari, sided with A-Rod.\n\nTaking a dig at Kimmel, Bakhtiari wrote on X, \u201cTell me you\u2019re on the Jeffrey Epstein client list, without telling me you\u2019re on the Jeffrey Epstein client list\u2026.\u201d Thus, with the rumors doing the rounds for quite a while, things did return to normal. And as for now, the main controversy Rodgers is facing is his form. It will now be interesting to note whether he can get it back soon or not.\n\nAlso Read: NFC Team Shocks Everyone By Acquiring Jets QB Aaron Rodgers In Blockbuster Trade Proposal That Would Turn The NFL Upside Down"

        "article_content": "The LTSC edition of Windows adopts a lean, more stable approach. Windows 11 LTSC is now available with the third-version update, aka 24H2. However, it still maintains the simplistic design approach with the classic version of the system apps and outdated UI. AI, now the most precious thing for Microsoft, isn\u2019t included with Windows 11 LTSC.\n\nWindows Latest installed the latest version of the official Windows 11 LTSC ISO and then put it to test on a PC. The installation is smooth for the most part, except when it asks you to enter a work or school account. Note that Windows 11 LTSC is available for Enterprise users, so you cannot use a personal Microsoft account to set it up.\n\nBypassing the Work/School Account Requirement\n\nWe used a few techniques to bypass the work/school account requirement in Windows 11 LTSC. First, we tried the oobe\\bypassnro command, which used to work in previous versions of Windows 11. But its charm failed to deceive the setup, and we landed on the same page after the automatic restart.\n\nThen, we turned off the internet connection and tried again, but the account requirement page didn\u2019t let us pass. After that, we launched the command prompt using Shift + F10, opened Task Manager, and ended the Microsoft Account process. The screen flashed for a few seconds, and the much-awaited \u201cI don\u2019t have internet\u201d option appeared.\n\nWe proceeded with a local account setup. It didn\u2019t even ask us to set up security questions.\n\nOne thing that we liked about this was that there was no mention of adware, tracking, or promotional items on the OOBE page. It would be best if Microsoft adopted this approach for Windows 11 consumer editions (Pro and Home) as well, but we all know that it won\u2019t improve.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC is clean.\n\nAfter booting to the desktop, at first glance, it doesn\u2019t look like a simple, less-modern version. But when you open the Start menu, the difference becomes clear.\n\nThere are few system apps, unlike the clutter and promotions that you get with consumer editions. Windows 11 LTSC 2024 includes the new Outlook web app by default.\n\nWe checked a few system apps to verify if they have been updated. Most of them look like legacy apps from Windows 7, especially Snipping Tool and Paint. Microsoft is keeping the latest version of both these apps limited to Pro, Home and other editons.\n\n1 of 2\n\nThe new inbox apps multiple new features, like the background remover and layers in Paint and OCR in Snipping Tool.\n\nMicrosoft is making it challenging to customize Windows when the OS is not activated.\n\nIn Windows 11 24H2, most personalization options are locked, and it has patched the existing loopholes. For example, previously, you could apply a dark theme by clicking on the theme box, as shown in the image below. It doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nPreviously, some customization was available, but Microsoft really wants you to buy a license. This phenomenon is common in all editions of Windows 11.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC\u2019s File Explorer packs all the latest improvements. You can duplicate tabs; labels appear below commonly used actions, compressions formats support for TAR, and more. But the overall UI doesn\u2019t look as polished as the regular editions.\n\nHowever, LTSC promises a no-nonsense approach that doesn\u2019t overload the OS with newer features. So, users don\u2019t have to accustom themselves to unnecessary apps, design, or UI changes ship with each feature update. It doesn\u2019t include any AI component, so no Copilot app or any other bloatware.\n\nYou can still access Copilot via Edge, which is preinstalled in LTSC.\n\nMicrosoft Store isn\u2019t available, so you\u2019ll have to download the programs from the official sites and wait for updates to improve the system apps. We suggest trying it only if you don\u2019t need feature updates and the bugs that come with it and want a clean OS with a bare minimum of system apps.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of apps installed on our Windows 11 LTSC PC:"

He recalled, \u201cThere was a big mansion, it was dark, and the whole atmosphere felt eerie. Just before our shot, I was talking to someone when, out of nowhere, someone scratched me from behind!

Just one year before, Ronald DeFeo Jr shot and killed six members of his family in the same house. James Brolin and Margot Kidder lead this film, which became one of the biggest hits of 1979.\n\nAudition (1999)\n\nJapanese horror Audition follows a widower who meets a woman named Ayoma after staging auditions to meet a potential new partner. Soon, though, her dark past begins to surface, which equates to a pretty disturbing climax.\n\nopen image in gallery \u2018Audition\u2019 ( Omega Project )\n\nThe Blair Witch Project (1999)\n\nAlthough parodied to death, The Blair Witch Project popularised the found-footage format to terrifying degrees in 1999. People genuinely believed they were watching real clips of three student filmmakers being terrorised by a Maryland legend known as the Blair Witch.\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920)\n\nBlack-and-white silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionism, but also one of the scariest films in cinema history. It follows a hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist to commit murders, and Wiene\u2019s shadowed sets and striking visual style combine to unsettle the viewer in ways most filmmakers only dream of managing.\n\nFunny Games (1997)\n\nFunny Games places the horror in the familiar setting of home. It follows two young men who hold a family hostage and torture them with sadistic games. The result is far scarier than anything featuring ghosts, witches or demons.\n\nHereditary (2018)\n\nProving that horror is a force to be reckoned with, Hereditary became independent distributor A24\u2019s highest-grossing film around the world upon its release in 2018. It tells the story of a family who find themselves haunted after the death of their secretive grandmother and features a final act that left many of its viewers with sleepless nights.\n\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days New subscribers only. \u00a38.99/mo. after free trial.

It follows a shapeshifting demon who takes the form of a sadistic child-killing clown named Pennywise (Tim Curry).\n\nLake Mungo (2008)\n\nTaking the form of a mockumentary, the little-seen Australian drama Lake Mungo may have received a limited release in 2008, but its story of a family attempting to come to terms with the drowning of their daughter stays with viewers long after.\n\nopen image in gallery \u2018Lake Mungo\u2019 ( Screen Australia )\n\nThe Orphanage (2007)\n\nProduced by Guillermo del Toro, this acclaimed 2007 chiller follows the disappearance of a young boy in an orphanage, which brings many of the building\u2019s terrifying secrets to the fore.\n\nParanormal Activity (2009)\n\nCould Paranormal Activity be the scariest film of all time? It\u2019s certainly one of them. Just when you thought found-footage had had its day, Oren Peli\u2019s small-budgeted festival favourite became one of 2009\u2019s biggest hits. Audiences lapped up the story of a couple who capture supernatural presences on a camera in their own home.\n\nParanormal Activity 3 (2011)\n\nParanormal Activity 3 earns its place on this list for its final 10 minutes. Set 18 years prior to the events of the first two films, we see the cause of the curse that follows characters Katie and Kristi for the rest of their lives \u2013 and it\u2019s down to a coven of witches led by their grandmother.\n\n[REC] (2007)\n\nPlayed out in real-time, the claustrophobic Spanish horror film [REC] is one of the better examples of found-footage cinema. Released in 2007, it follows a reporter and her cameraman who follow firefighters to a Barcelona building and soon find themselves locked inside with its occupants who are displaying murderous behaviour.\n\nopen image in gallery [REC] ( Filmax )\n\nRing (1998)\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you know the story of Ring by now: viewers of a cursed videotape die seven days after watching it. While the inevitable Hollywood remake in 2002 was better than it had any right to be, Nakata\u2019s original is as terrifying as horror films come.\n\nSinister (2012)\n\nOf all the Blumhouse horror films, 2012 release Sinister \u2013 which features the demonic character Bughuul \u2013 is the spookiest of them all. It stars Ethan Hawke as a true-crime writer who discovers a box of home movies depicting grisly murders in the attic of his new house.\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)\n\nThe fictional Texas Chainsaw Massacre, marketed as a true story, follows a group of cannibals \u2013 including Leatherface \u2013 who relentlessly hunt down a group of friends. Not only is Tobe Hooper\u2019s film one of the most striking horror experiences, but one of the greatest of all time, too\n\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\n\nThe Wicker Man is deemed the best British horror film of all time for a reason. It tells the story of a Police Sergeant who travels to an isolated island in search of a missing girl, only to find its inhabitants practising a form of Celtic paganism.\n\nThe Witch (2015)\n\nFor the most part, it\u2019s not what you see in The Witch that terrifies, it\u2019s what you don\u2019t see. Eggers unsettlingly holds his camera a fraction too long in places as he retells the story of a Separatist family who encounter supernatural forces in the woods beyond their farm.\n\nOther galleries you might like:\n\n21 actors who took their roles so seriously it out of hand\n\n37 best film twists of all time\n\n37 actors who almost died on set\n\n49 best closing lines in movies"

MANY people will have heard about the legend of the Enfield Poltergeist as it has featured in various articles and appeared in films. The claims derive from supposed supernatural activity at 284 Green Street - a council house. Still standing, the property sits in Enfield, London, and the alleged poltergeist activity took place between 1977 and 1979. Single mother, Peggy Hodgson, called the Metropolitan Police after experiencing suspicious activity, including hearing strange noises and witnessing furniture move on its own. Her daughters Janet, 11, and Margaret, 13, have spoken out about the events since. There is even a picture of Janet seemingly lifted off the ground. While she claims to have been hurled from her bed by a supernatural force, others have suggested the image could also be explained by her jumping. Over the 18 month period, thirty different witnesses are thought to have experienced some level of the activity, including neighbours, paranormal investigators and journalists.\n\nJeffrey Smith, 43, a painter who lives a few doors down, has described how the frustrating situation \u201cis definitely a nuisance\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cYeah, people are knocking on our door all the time, wanting to take pictures and ask questions.\n\n\u201cPeople are always knocking on her [284 Green Street] door, every five minutes and it\u2019s nothing to do with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying they\u2019re taking photos and they\u2019re in the way all the time.\n\n\u201cBefore the family moved in, people used to trash the house as it was abandoned for a long time.\n\n\u201cYou should come back at Halloween, it\u2019s always busy then but it\u2019s all year round now.\n\nI turned my tiny front garden into a spooky haunted house for Halloween - all you need is a \u00a3xx B&Q buy, people are obsessed\n\n\u201cBack in the days after the documentary we used to have buses filled with tourists because it\u2019s very very popular, but it\u2019s just a nightmare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most famous house in the world but it\u2019s really painful to see as it attracts crazy people at all hours of the day, which means my dog is barking at all hours, at two or three in the morning because these people want to park outside my house and take pictures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constant but I just feel sorry for the people who live in the house, they\u2019re just living and don\u2019t have any peace.\u201d\n\nHas the Enfield house ever featured in a documentary? THE BBC released its first episode of Hauntings earlier this month with the series looking into various unexplained events. Presenting the story using recorded film and audio, the first installment was called The Enfield Poltergeist and looked to investigate the \"extraordinary events\" that occurred between 1977 and 1979. Following a police report in September 1977, officers attending the house could not find a reasonable explanation for furniture moving independently and tapping on the walls. Back in 2018, Sue MacGregor reunited a group of witnesses to \"paranormal events\" that occured at the council house in Enfield. The resulting conversation led to a 45 minute show being published on BBC's Radio 4 and even featured Janet and Margaret Hodgson, the two daughters at the centre of the case.\n\nAnother resident, Sharifa Wilson, 42, suggested the number of visitors has declined since the movie but that their behaviour has not changed.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 20 years and it\u2019s annoying but after a while you get used to it.\n\n\u201cAs the years progressed, people still drive past and slow down, I want to say something but you can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe lady that used to live there [284 Green Street], she lived there for years pretty much her whole childhood.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s left now, moved out with her kids and husband because they had people peering through windows.\n\n\u201cThe woman next door to me, she\u2019s lived here the longest and says it\u2019s rubbish but she can\u2019t move out, she\u2019s been here all her life.\n\n\u201cI did see a passerby stop and ask the current owner to give her a tour, they even offered her cash.\u201d\n\n13 Sharifa Wilson spoke of the frustrations she has living just a few doors down Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 The property is situated in the middle of the road, opposite a primary school Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Sun reporter Charlotte Bend went to investigate at the scene Credit: Louis Wood\n\nThe neighbour that Sharifa spoke of did not want to speak to the Sun for too long, tired from the activity and attention right outside her front door.\n\nShe explained: \u201cI don\u2019t want to highlight it anymore in the media than it already is.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say but I\u2019d rather just ignore it.\u201d\n\nOthers were happy to comment but wanted to remain anonymous out of the fear of complicating their relationship with neighbours in such close proximity.\n\nA mother and school worker who has lived on the street for nearly 20 years said she has met people visiting from \u201call over the world\u201d including China, Australia, America, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople drawing attention to the house, it\u2019s not good for the kids.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked the family that live there if they knew about the history before they moved.\n\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t know and now people knock on my door and people want to ask about the house.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, it\u2019s even at 1am in the morning, and it\u2019s anyone, not just kids.\n\n\u201cEven now, people slowing down when they\u2019re driving and they look.\n\n\u201cMy son once even let a woman in thinking I knew her. When I came downstairs thinking she was one of my Somali ladies, and I saw a white woman, I wondered why she was there.\n\n\u201cShe just sat there and I said I can\u2019t help you with information, people have children, they deserve their quiet private lives.\n\n\u201cBack when the film was released, it was really bad, you know like a tourist bus in central London.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how bad it was, and they were all photographing themselves outside.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just phone the police and ask them to move them on which is why the neighbours just won\u2019t open the door if they don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d\n\nWhat is The Conjuring 2? THE Conjuring 2 was a horror film released in 2016 and centred around the story of Peggy, and her four children. Much like the Enfield Poltergeist case, the single mum looks to investigators for help after her children report paranormal activity. Famed detectives, Ed and Lorraine Warren, that feature as characters in the film did visit the house in real life while the unexplained events took place. The film was directed by James Wan, an Australian filmmaker also known for Saw, Insidious, Aquaman and Malignant. The Conjuring 2 is known as The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case in the UK, and is the first sequel to The Conjuring, which was released in 2013.\n\nNear the semi-detached property that many have flocked to over the years, neighbours have made security their focus with one property boasting six CCTV cameras from the outside and black-out style curtains drawn across.\n\nMany others peered out of the corner of their front room window when having someone knock on their door - it was clear most were used to regular attention and shied away from it.\n\nSituated opposite a primary school, the busy main road does not particularly lend itself to a mass of fans hoping to park up and spend some time on the street.\n\nWhile the current inhabitants of the house were approached by the Sun, they very gently explained that they no longer talk to visitors or media.\n\nAnother man residing in a property nearby explained that he \"regularly\" saw \"people trying to peer through\" on \"a daily basis\".\n\nAnother told of how visitors \"don't just knock on our door\" but they \"ask us questions about the house\" and whether the story is true.\n\nHe added: \"We just have to tell them we don't know\".\n\nOthers refused to speak to us, with one woman living down the road exasperatedly noting: \"I am tired of this sh*t.\"\n\n13 Local residents were quick to explain how the situation worsened after the release of the film based on the property Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Tash Wilson lives further down the street and is still stopped by visitors, hoping to ask her questions Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Curtis Hart grew up being told about the property by his family Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Amir Hosaimi works in a pizza takeaway shop just round the corner Credit: Louis Wood\n\nTash Wilson, a 24-year-old working in admin for HMRC, explained how she thinks the attention will \"start again\" this week \"because it's Halloween\".\n\nShe said: \"I've had a few people ask me where it was but I've not actually known as I don't like scary films so I haven't watched it.\n\n\"But it's crazy that it's just there, someone's actually living there.\n\n\"Last time someone asked me where it was, I actually didn't know where to direct them as I live further down.\"\n\nCurtis Hart, a local builder who has lived in the area his whole life, told of how his mum used to explain the folklore surrounding the former council house years before any filming took place.\n\nLocal business owners were also keen to talk after regularly meeting lost or inquisitive tourists heading inside to ask questions.\n\nAmir Hosaimi, who works at a Pizza takeaway store just around the corner of the street, explained how he \"sees people every day\" and so it is \"not even worse on Halloween\".\n\nHe said: \"It's every afternoon, I see the cars parked up and they're stood there taking pictures.\n\n\"Always different people, every day from all around the world.\n\n\"It's mostly young people, many many students and sometimes they come to the shop to ask questions but I can only tell them to watch the movie.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about it in the area, even when you go for a coffee somewhere you'll always hear someone talking about it.\n\n\"I think lots of old neighbours know the story about the house and they like talking about it but others ignore it.\"\n\nHas the Enfield Poltergeist ever been proven false? ALTHOUGH there has never been anything proven or discounted officially, one expert revealed the case could be a hoax. Psychology professor, Chris French, explained five reasons to TimeOut in 2016. The girls \"admitted they faked\" some of the activity Janet's photo where she can be seen levitating above her bed could be explained by jumping Bill, the old man who possessed Janet, was obsessed with periods and Chris believes a young girl would be more likely to be interested on this Eyewitnesses can be incredibly unreliable According to Chris, there are other cases of schoolgirl pranks that have gotten out of hand\n\nAnother resident explained how it must be \"terrible for the people that live\" at the house itself.\n\nHe has seen people \"going round the back\" looking for \"other ways in\".\n\nMore recently, he told of spotting three people staring at the house trying to convince each other to go and knock on the door.\n\nHe continued: \"We've had people ask us about the house, most of them will just stand around and stare at it or take pictures in front of the thing.\n\n\"It's a regular thing, I mean a couple weeks ago there were two groups sitting out on blankets with candles around them and all sorts.\n\n\"I presume to protect themselves from whatever.\n\n\"We don't talk about it with the people who live there though, we have always known the people involved over there as neighbours and if they spoke to us about it they spoke to us about it but we never asked questions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a couple who parked their car in front of the house got out to take pictures and admire the exterior of the property.\n\nNicos Aoennou, 53, told the Sun how they regularly visit and even stay in places believed to be haunted.\n\nOther spooky places in the UK Pendle Hill - A hill in England that is believed to be the most haunted place in the UK. It is the burial site of the twelve Pendle Witches who were hanged in 1612. Tower of London - A popular historic attraction in London that is also considered one of the most haunted places in the UK. The tower has a dark history of torture, imprisonment, and execution. Chillingham Castle - A 13th-century fortress in Northumberland that is said to be home to many ghosts and ghouls. Berry Pomeroy Castle - A castle in Devon that is said to be haunted by the Blue Lady and the White Lady. Blickling Hall - A grand hall in Norwich that was once home to the Boleyn family and is said to be one of the most haunted houses in Britain. Hampton Court Palace - A palace in England that is known for being one of the most haunted attractions in the UK.\n\nThey have explored castles and hotels which claim to be inhabited by ghosts and spirits.\n\nTwo weeks out from undergoing a hip operation, Kate Fortune, 50, explained how attractions like this make for the perfect activity to fill some time while braving her new set of crutches under each arm.\n\nShe said: \"We like to find haunted places and go to stuff like this all the time.\n\n\"It's just to get out for a bit and I am quite open minded to stuff like ghosts - although apparently there's no haunting there anymore.\n\n\"I find it really interesting and I've always loved history, and so that comes with it.\"\n\nKate even spoke of an experience when she was younger where she believes to have seen a ghost.\n\nIt freaked her out so much at the time that she ran down a set of stairs and broke her ankle.\n\nDespite this, she \"loves haunted stuff\", including films, saying \"there's not enough of them\".\n\nShe added: \"Nothing bad has happened to me but I don't quite know how I'd be if there was a poltergeist flying around the house, that would freak me out.\"\n\nExplaining how the pair discovered the property, Nicos added: \"I used to drive past every day as I lived locally but I wasn't taking it in, to be honest.\n\n\"Then she mentioned she wanted to go and I said I'd take her down.\n\n\"I've watched the film and all that stuff so knew it was here.\"\n\nI photographed that terrifying snap of the Enfield Haunting - I thought it was nonsense until chilling moment GRAHAM Morris was a sceptical photographer when he was sent down to snap the apparent haunted family home in Enfield. He previously told the Sun that he \"initially thought it was going to be a load of rubbish\" when he was on his way to 284 Green Street in North London. At the height of the so-called supernatural activity, Graham was in his twenties and headed to the location with a reporter. He said: \"The children came in one after the other with adults but nothing happened until Janet walked in. \"It was unbelievable - things were just flying all over the room. Little things like toys, marbles, and Lego bricks. I tried to get a picture of something flying across the room, but everything was moving so fast. \"You couldn't pre-empt where the next object would come flying from. It was coming in from all angles. \"I was hit in the eyebrow, and although it didn't draw blood, I got one hell of a lump. Whatever this was, you had the feeling that it was out to get you. \"It didn't like the fact that I was taking pictures. I could see the fear on the family's face.\"\n\n13 The history of the property has attracted tourists from all over the world including China, Australia and America Credit: Louis Wood"

        "article_content": "Scientists have discovered that the icy shell of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, could possess an insulated, six-mile-thick (9.7-kilometer-thick) layer of methane ice beneath its surface. Ironically, this layer may make signs of life from the subsurface ocean of Titan easier to detect. And, down the line, the discovery could benefit the fight against human-driven climate change on Earth.\n\nTitan may be a moon, but it is also more similar to Earth than any other solar system planet. That's because it is the only planet or moon in the solar system other than Earth to possess an atmosphere as well as liquid rivers, lakes and seas. Because of the frigid temperatures of Titan, however, this liquid is composed of hydrocarbons like methane and ethane. Still, the surface ice of Titan is indeed composed of water.\n\nThe new results from a team of planetary scientists at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa revealed that methane gas may also be trapped within Titan's ice shell, forming a distinct crust up to six miles thick. This gas could warm the underlying ice shell and help molecules rise to the surface of Titan, some of which could indicate the presence of life. This warming may also help explain Titan\u2019s methane-rich atmosphere.\n\n\"If life exists in Titan's ocean under the thick ice shell, any signs of life, biomarkers, would need to be transported up Titan's ice shell to where we could more easily access or view them with future missions,\" research team leader and University of Hawaii scientist Lauren Schurmeier said in a statement. \"This is more likely to occur if Titan\u2019s ice shell is warm and connecting.\"\n\nThe team was first tipped off to the potential existence of this connecting layer of methane ice by the presence of shallow impact craters on Titan. Only 90 impact craters have been seen on the surface of the Saturnian moon, and these have been confusing to observe because they should be hundreds of feet deeper than they actually are.\n\n\"This was very surprising because, based on other moons, we expect to see many more impact craters on the surface and craters that are much deeper than what we observe on Titan,\" Schurmeier said. \"We realized something unique to Titan must be making them become shallower and disappear relatively quickly.\"\n\nInvestigating Titan's shallow craters\n\nTo further delve into the mystery of Titans' swallow impact craters, Schurmeier and colleagues turned to computer modeling. This allowed them to test how much the surface of Saturn's largest moon would relax and rebound after an asteroid impact if its icy shell were coated with an insulating layer of methane clathrate.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Arrows indicate potential forms of crater modification processes, including: dunes and sands (purple), channels (blue), and significant crater rim erosion (pink). (Image credit: NASA / Cassini)\n\nThe thickness of this methane icy shell matters because it could eventually explain why Titan's atmosphere is particularly rich with this hydrocarbon. It could also help scientists better understand Titan's carbon cycle, its liquid methane-based \"hydrological cycle,\" and the changing climate of the Saturnian moon.\n\n\"Titan is a natural laboratory to study how the greenhouse gas methane warms and cycles through the atmosphere,\" Schurmeier explained. \"Earth's methane clathrate hydrates, found in the permafrost of Siberia and below the arctic seafloor, are currently destabilizing and releasing methane.\n\n\"So, lessons from Titan can provide important insights into processes happening on Earth.\"\n\nProposed diagram of Titan's interior (not to scale), showing a methane clathrate crust over a convecting ice shell. (Image credit: Schurmeier, et al., 2024)\n\nThe thickness of the methane clathrate crust, when viewed in the light of the topography of Titan, means that the Saturnian moon's interior is likely warm and flexible rather than cold and rigid, as once believed.\n\n\"Methane clathrate is stronger and more insulating than regular water ice,\" Schurmeier added. \"A clathrate crust insulates Titan's interior, makes the water ice shell very warm and ductile, and implies that Titan's ice shell is or was slowly convecting.\"\n\n\n\nAnd that convection means that biomarkers indicating life could have been hoisted from Titan's subsurface ocean and carried to its outer icy shell, just awaiting discovery.\n\nThis research could act as a helpful guide to NASA scientists who intend to investigate Titan using the forthcoming Dragonfly spacecraft. Dragonfly is set to launch in 2028 and hopefully reach the Saturnian system in 2034 to conduct up-close observations of Titan's icy surface.\n\nThe team's research was published on Sept. 30 in The Planetary Science Journal.\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."

But today, with better manufacturing techniques and soaring demand for lithium, Alkhadra thinks the time is right. So do the investors who\u2019ve put $10 million into the project. These include Clean Energy Ventures and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.\n\nIn Medford, a startup called Lithios says it\u2019s creating a clean and relatively cheap way to access vast amounts of lithium that\u2019s presently sloshing around in briny water beneath the southern United States.\n\nIf we\u2019re all destined to drive electric vehicles, we\u2019re going to need a lot of lithium for the batteries. And where would you rather get that lithium \u2014 China or Arkansas?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of lithium in the United States, including a major find in Maine. But that lithium is trapped inside rock, and the process of extracting it is extremely messy and would consume vast amounts of energy.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nLithium can also be extracted from vast underground pools of salty water \u2014 the remnants of oceans that disappeared from the surface millions of years ago. Much of the world\u2019s lithium brine is found in Chile and Argentina. But the United States has a lot of this brine as well, mainly in a huge underground geological structure called the Smackover Formation which reaches across the southern United States from Texas to Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Smackover Formation is named for an Arkansas town located right over it. In the 1920s Smackover became a petroleum boom town, and since then the area has produced over 600 million barrels. Now its brine wells may produce a different kind of energy boom.\n\nLast week the United States Geological Survey and the Arkansas government said that the amount of lithium in the Smackover brine could range from five million to 19 million tons. According to the Geological Survey, that\u2019s up to nine times the amount of lithium that will be needed to power the world\u2019s electric cars in 2030.\n\nIn places like Chile, the lithium is extracted by pumping out the brine and pouring it into huge open-air ponds, where the water evaporates. What\u2019s left is lithium and lots of other minerals. It takes a lot of effort and money to get the lithium out. Besides, evaporation works fine in arid regions of the world, but not in Arkansas, which gets lots of rain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlkhadra, a US native who grew up in Saudi Arabia and earned his doctorate in chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he\u2019s got a better way. Lithios has developed a lithium-absorbing material that can be made into electrodes using the same technologies created to make electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nDozens of Lithios electrodes are layered together to form an electrode stack. When a current flows through the stack and brine is pumped in, the electrodes capture only the lithium and let all the other minerals pass. Flushing fresh water through the stack rinses out all the lithium, which can now be reduced to a powder for use in building batteries.\n\nAlkhadra said that the Lithios method uses 75 to 80 percent less water than other brine processing methods and doesn\u2019t sully the environment with other metals and chemicals found in the brine. And it\u2019s vastly cleaner and less energy-hungry than refining lithium from ore.\n\nLithios is currently developing its first full-scale stack at its Medford lab. The stack is expected to produce a ton of pure lithium per year from Arkansas brine. If it works, said Alkhadra, the company could install thousands of stacks in Smackover country and start pumping out thousands of tons of lithium.\n\nMichael McKibben, professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California at Riverside, is working on extracting lithium from brine found underneath California\u2019s Salton Sea. McKibben said it\u2019ll be a few years before it\u2019s known whether companies like Lithios can make their technology work in the real world. \u201cThey have to prove that it works at scale and they have to prove that it works under demanding conditions that are different than the lab,\u201d said McKibben.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the payoff would be immense. \u201cThe combination of Arkansas brines and Salton Sea brines would make the US totally self-sufficient in lithium,\u201d said McKibben. \u201cAnd then we wouldn\u2019t have to import lithium from China and Australia and South America anymore.\u201d\n\nHiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com.

The 25 fastest-growing public companies headquartered in Orange County based on revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 generated $33.6 billion in revenue combined for 2023 \u2013 that\u2019s an increase of 27% from the $26.5 billion reported for 2022.\n\nFive Point Leads\n\nThe fastest growing public company headquartered in Orange County is Five Point Holdings LLC, an owner and developer of residential mixed-use developments in Orange County, Los Angeles County and San Francisco. The Irvine-based company reported revenue of $212 million in 2023, up by 396% from 2022. Revenues were primarily generated from land sales at its Valencia site, where it closed the sale of land entitled for an aggregate of 729 homesites on approximately 72 acres for $162.4 million. In total, Five Point communities are designed to include approximately 40,000 residential homes and approximately 23 million square feet of commercial space.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor the market and interest rates; however, we believe that the ongoing housing supply shortage will help sustain strong demand for our land,\u201d said Dan Hedigan, Five Point chief executive, in a statement.\n\nNext-Level Automotive\n\nElectric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive Inc. was the second-fastest-growing company with $4.43 billion in revenue last year, up 167% from the prior year. The Irvine-based automaker produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, which more than doubled the totals from 2022. However, growth for 2024 was tempered due to higher interest rates and the company projects to match vehicle production from 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Rivian unveiled the newest version of its inventory. The midsize platform underpins R2, R3 and R3X vehicles. Pricing for R2 is expected to start around $45,000, and R3 will be priced below R2 with deliveries expected in 2026.\n\n\u201cOur design and engineering teams are extremely focused on driving innovation into not only the product features but also our approach to manufacturing to achieve dramatically lower costs,\u201d said Rivian founder and chief executive RJ Scaringe, in a statement.\n\nBiotech Growth\n\nBiotech, pharmaceutical and medical device companies account for six of the top 10 fastest-growing public companies headquartered in Orange County. RxSight Inc., an ophthalmic medical device company based in Aliso Viejo, had its initial public offering in 2021 and recently raised an additional $115 million through a secondary public offering that closed in May. The company is dedicated to providing customized vision to patients following cataract surgery.\n\nAxonics Inc., a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated devices to treat urinary and bowel dysfunction, announced plans to be acquired by Boston Scientific Corp. in January for $3.7 billion. This deal had not yet closed as of print time, because the Federal Trade Commission has asked for additional information during the acquisition review process.\n\n"
