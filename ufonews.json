It was one of three unidentified objects blasted out of the sky that month, according to CTV News.\n\nIt remains unclear what the object was and what it was doing flying over western Canada."

            "article_content": "Mysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - after weeks of being photographed in New Jersey.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the FAA and FBI requesting an investigation, Fossella called the situation 'bizarre', according to PIX11.\n\n'It is odd and quite bizarre that nobody can figure out who is flying these drones, where they are coming from, and their purpose.\n\n'It is not just a bizarre situation, but also a concerning one, as it seems these drones can potentially become a danger to personal safety.'\n\nHe also stated that he was worried about the drones' ability to impede life-saving care in medical emergencies - especially over the two hospital systems on Staten Island.\n\n'It was recently reported that, during a medical emergency resulting from a crash in Branchburg, New Jersey, the presence of these drones prevented a medevac helicopter from being able to transport a seriously injured patient to the hospital.\n\n'We hope that such an investigation may shed light on what these drones are doing, where they are coming from and how to mitigate the risks they may pose on public safety.'\n\nMysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - days after being photographed in New Jersey\n\nYesterday, new footage of at least five or possibly six of the unidentified drones was captured in a 50-second cell phone video in New Jersey, which one commenter declared was 'the clearest video yet.'\n\nOne drone, heard roaring in the skies as it moved through the darkness, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly and red lights blinking at the tips of its wings and tail.\n\nAnother drone came into frame that resembled a classic 'black triangle' UFO or the triangular TR-3B, which beamed bright white lights from its nose, wingtips and tail.\n\nSince mid-November, a wave of unexplained drone sightings above central Jersey has left both law enforcement and the general public watching the skies, hunting for clues on what these mysterious night flights might be.\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy has attempted to calm residents claiming these true UFOs pose 'no known threat to the public at this time,' but FBI and local police are actively investigating.\n\nConcerns have heightened over the proximity of these drone-like UFOs to President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course, US military research facility Picatinny Arsenal and critical local infrastructure.\n\n'Water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments, and military installations' have all had the UFOs roaming above them in recent weeks, according to the chief of police for the New Jersey borough of Florham Park.\n\n'Their presence appears nefarious in nature,' the police chief added.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' NJ native and TikTok creator @_bucky13 commented under his phone footage of the eerie drones (still image above), captioned 'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.' At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

This was the reality for Kyrstin \"Maggie\" Reeves from Pennsylvania until she stumbled upon the Simple app.\n\n\"I have loved food my entire life; I love to eat, I love to bake, I love sweets, and that has been my biggest struggle,\" the 30-year-old mother of three shared. She was already clued up on the potential health perks of intermittent fasting\u2014eating in cycles with periods of fasting during the day\u2014but lacked the motivation to start.\n\nThat's when Simple's AI coach proved invaluable to Kyrstin. The app, currently offering discounts of 60% with code REACH60 or 70% with BFCM70 until December 8, leverages AI to provide tailored workouts, nutritional analysis, and motivational coaching, all based on the principles of intermittent fasting, reports the Mirror.\n\nREAD MORE: Menopause supplement by Elle MacPherson gives 'so much energy' shoppers 'don't need coffee'\n\nREAD MORE: Next shoppers swoon over 'stunning' \u00a360 party dress with Christmas 'wow factor'\n\nAll you have to do is fill out your details, which include information like your health goals and past experiences with weight loss, and the app will build you personalised workout plans and nutritional information.\n\nThe AI coach, called Avo, is there to spur you on your journey and answer any questions you might have. \"Avo has taught me a lot about what I could be doing better and given me encouragement throughout the whole process,\" says Kyrstin.\n\nFor Kyrstin, the best thing about the app was giving her nutrition scores - essentially nutritional information on what she was eating. \"To be able to get information on what I was eating and being able to track the nutrition of everything I was consuming was amazing,\" she says.\n\nThe result? \"I have lost 26 pounds with Simple, I have another 25 to go until I hit my goal, and then it's just about toning and staying where I want to be,\" Kyrstin says happily. On her journey with Simple, she went from a size 18 to a size 10.\n\n(Image: Simple)\n\nAnd she's not the only person who has experienced the benefits of the Simple app. Brianna Alexander lost 60lbs within three years, saying: \"I'm really grateful that I'm tracking my nutrition and staying consistent, and the app makes it really easy - you can set up push notifications on your phone so you don't forget to track or start a fast, and I highly recommend it.\"\n\nThen there's Kelly Hartmann, who lost 15lbs in four months. She says she was \"blown away\" by the app, adding: \"It provided so much education as to why I had the habits that I had, and the best way to change those habits and it just fit right in with my day-to-day life, which is something that I had never found with any weight loss product.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that these are real Simple users who are featured and have been compensated for their honest testimonials. Results may vary.\n\n(Image: Simple)\n\nYou can check out our review of the app here. Over on Trustpilot, the app has an impressive 4.2-star rating, but some customers have shared a few more critical notes based on their personal experiences. \"It is useful for tracking ,but I don\u2019t think it is worth the cost for my needs. I will not be purchasing after the first 3 months,\" one user said. \"I was looking for an app for weight training for after menopause. This is not it.\" Another said: \"It\u2019s confusing to navigate, and there are too many screens to get stuck on.\"\n\nIf you want an app purely dedicated to food tracking, the basic version of MyFitnessPal is free. Alternatively, for an app focused on weight training, Caliber is a great shout for beginners - it's free, with in-app purchases.\n\nBut with plenty of positive testimonials behind it, be sure to check out the Simple app - and grab the 60% off of with the code REACH60, or 70% off with the code BFCM70 until December 8."

            "article_content": "The controversy surrounding the Conjuring House owner's claim of being contacted by a spirit from the 1800s and the allegations that followed.\n\nFor years, even before the age of cinema, ghost stories have been a staple form of entertainment for millions of people worldwide. The world of the supernatural has thus found a special place in the entertainment industry as well, where horror stories are consumed, loved, and adored by fans across the world. Among the many such stories, The Conjuring Universe is especially famous for its spine-chilling back story.\n\nA still from The Conjuring | Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nBased on the real-life story of the Perron family and the subsequent investigation carried out by famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren on their infamous haunted farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971, The Conjuring is a tale that sends shivers down our spines. Even more haunting is that the centuries-old haunted house located in Burrillville, Rhode Island continues to experience repeated supernatural activity and can even be booked by supernatural enthusiasts to experience these activities.\n\nHowever, the current owner of the \u2018Conjuring\u2018 house has been facing backlash and criticism after her recent claims of being contacted by one of the original owners of the house and her subsequent firing of an employee, even losing her business entertainment license in the process.\n\nOwner of the Conjuring House Contact by the OG Owner of the Infamous Estate\n\nThe Conjuring House aka the Arnold estate | Credit: The Conjuring House.com\n\nLocated in Burrillville, the colonial-era Old Arnold Estate spread across 8.5 acres in Rhode Island has always been a center of paranormal activity (via The Conjuring House.com). Made famous by the 2013 movie, The Conjuring, its relationship with otherworldly activities goes as far as the 1700s and is supposed to be haunted by several spirits and entities. Hence, when the farmhouse was up for purchase in 2022, the Boston attorney Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez purchased it without a second thought.\n\nHaving a long-standing relationship with the spiritual and supernatural world, Nu\u00f1ez has since transformed it into a business for horror enthusiasts to come and visit or stay at the house. The business was thriving until recently when she claimed to have been contacted by the spirit of John Arnold, one of the original owners of the estate from back in the 1800s. According to what she told WPRI, Arnold told her that one of her employees was stealing from her.\n\nI did get a message from John Arnold from the 1800s. I also have records of merchandise and stuff, and know that he stole.\n\nSince then, her story has gained attention from fans all over the world. While some fans believe her story, others remain skeptical and have criticized her decision to fire an employee. In the middle of all this controversy, she also lost her business entertainment license after the Burrillville town officials voted to not have it renewed citing concerns over her conduct and the disruption caused by the 24-hour business in a residential area.\n\nConjuring House Owner Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez Has Been Accused of Several Problematic Conducts\n\nThe owner of the Conjuring house, Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez | Credit: WPRI / FaceBook\n\nThe Conjuring House remains at the top of bucket lists for a lot of fans, and visiting the house at least once is a die-hard wish of several horror enthusiasts. However, soon that might change given how Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez has lost her license to continue her business of letting people visit the huge haunted estate. And a lot of it is to blame for her alleged problematic behavior, which allegedly has gotten worse since she purchased the house.\n\nAs reported by WPRI, she was arrested for drunk driving in October and also accused of threatening one of her past employees Jason Hawes as well as his family. Hawes, the star of the hit Ghostbuster series, revealed to the site that Nu\u00f1ez has sent her threatening messages even after the court lauded her with a no-contact order. Meanwhile, Nu\u00f1ez stated that she is now looking to file lawsuits against him, formal employees, and even Burrillville for how \u201cthey have just blatantly violated\u201d her constitutional protections.\n\nMeanwhile, the town manager of Burrillville, Micahel Wood revealed to the news site that the Conjuring House owner runs a 24-hour business in a residential area which is quite \u201cdisruptive to neighbors, and it draws curious people at all hours of the day and night.\u201d Furthermore, he stated that Nu\u00f1ez has been \u201cdifficult, uncooperative, and aggressive throughout the licensing process,\u201d which makes it hard for their cooperative relationship to resume. On the other hand, Nu\u00f1ez believes the town isn\u2019t letting her run her business since they have no care for the paranormal.\n\nThe Conjuring House Employee Believes in the Paranormal But Thinks Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s Claims Are Far-Fetched\n\nThe Conjuring | Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nWhile Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez wholeheartedly believes and claims that the spirit of John Arnold contacted her and informed her that one of her employees was stealing from her, her employee believes that Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s claims are a bit far-fetched. Brian Dansereau had been working at the Burrillville farmhouse for quite a while now, however, Nu\u00f1ez fired him last month claiming he had stolen about $3000 from her.\n\nDansereau has consistently denied the theft and even though he believes in the paranormal he thinks there is no way that the spirit of one of the former owners of the house from back in the 1800s would have contacted Nu\u00f1ez and told her something like this. While talking to WPRI, he stated,\n\nShe said, \u2018John Arnold told me you\u2019ve been stealing money out of the cash box for the past two months.\u2019 I literally stopped and I had to correct her like, \u2018John Arnold, one of the original owners?\u2019\n\nThe Conjuring House | Credit: The Conjuring House.com\n\nHe also shared his own paranormal experiences, such as hearing his voice in the basement or witnessing doors opening on their own. Yet, he cannot fathom a spirit snitching on an employee. On the other hand, Nu\u00f1ez claimed that she had been informed of other unexpected conduct from the past staff and guests and does not care if someone believes her or not.\n\nIt does not matter whether you believe in the paranormal or not. I and every person is entitled to experiences that bring understanding and meaning to our lives, including being informed or warned about wicked actors and actions. As far as Brian goes my experience with him devolved quickly, culminating in his at-will employment termination.\n\nNu\u00f1ez is thus planning to file a complaint with state officials, also because her former employee has been allegedly trying to damage her reputation by slandering her. What should have been a grand experience for fans of Conjuring and horror enthusiasts has taken a turn for the worst. There is a possibility that the tours and fan visits at the Conjuring house may not be possible in the future for Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez has no plans to sell the house even if she does not get her business license back.\n\nThe Conjuring is available to be streamed on Netflix."

            "article_content": "The story\u2019s the thing, says author T.S. Kincaid.\n\nThe Mount Hope resident, who launched her writing and illustrating career in 2007, will be featured at a special meet-and-greet next week in Oak Hill. The public can mingle with Kincaid from 6-8 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 10, at the administration building behind the Oak Hill Library branch.\n\n\u201cFor anyone interested in writing, I would say just do it,\u201d Kincaid says. \u201cDon\u2019t try to be super eloquent and sophisticated in your writing, just tell the story.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the point is to entertain, don\u2019t fill your story with words the reader constantly has to pull out a dictionary to understand what you are trying to say.\u201d\n\nKincaid said she\u2019s matured as a writer since her first endeavor, a children\u2019s book entitled \u201cThe Adventures of Casey the Lost Suitcase,\u201d which she penned as Tracy S. Kincaid. \u201cMy aunt had gone to Italy, but her suitcase didn\u2019t,\u201d she said in describing the concept of the children\u2019s book. \u201cWhen the suitcase was finally returned to her after 10 months, it had all of the security tags of where it had traveled. So, I got the idea to write the book from the suitcase\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nThe book lacked proper editing at the time, she said. \u201cThe problem with \u2018Casey,\u2019 although it was a great idea, was that it was never edited,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller, not an editor. Therefore, although well received, the writing had that flaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have written several other children\u2019s books since, but am still working on illustrations and they have not yet been published,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past eight years, she has moved into longer-form novels. \u201cThe Factory in the Crooked Hollow,\u201d published in 2016, was her first attempt at horror, she said. At the time, Kincaid wanted to distinguish her children\u2019s books from her adult books and changed her pen name to T.S. Kincaid. \u201cIn the meantime, I discovered there is another author by the name of Tracy Kincaid, so I decided to be T.S. Kincaid from now on. Although \u2018Factory\u2019 had been edited, I feel I did more telling than showing in this novella.\u201d\n\nFast forward a few years, and Kincaid dipped her toes into the novel pool again. \u201cAfter much research and soul searching, I decided to write \u2018I\u2019m Timmy,\u2019\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cThis book is the first in a series, with the next book being \u2018I\u2019m Klara,\u2019 which I am currently writing. I am very excited about this series because so far it has been well received and I feel I have finally mastered the craft of storytelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Timmy\u201d was self-published in September 2024 and is currently available at booksellers such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble. She will also have it on hand for $10 (normally $14.99) at the Oak Hill event. \u201cI decided to self-publish my \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 series due to the fact that I am older (I\u2019m 61), and wanted to get my stories out into the world instead of waiting to be picked up by a traditional publisher, which may or may not happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I work on my writing and illustrating full time.\u201d\n\nWhat prompted her to move into the horror genre? \u201cMost of the ideas that I get for writing my scary stories are from dreams that I have. I love horror stories and feel comfortable writing this genre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost of my books have an educational element to them,\u201d she continued. \u201cWith my children\u2019s books, I cover subjects like geography, math, a lot of imagination and a little bit of humor.\n\n\u201cWith my horror stories, I try to give the reader a new perspective and something to think about. Explaining the paranormal in ways that perhaps they had not thought about.\u201d\n\nTo complement her writing, Kincaid also has a \u201cwhisper room,\u201d or \u201cpod\u201d as she calls it, in her home in a sound-proof room built for her by her husband.\n\nThere, she \u201ccan do voiceovers and audio books,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cI have a background in theater and I love recording and bringing written books to life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI recorded the audio book for \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 with sound effects and music. That audio book was recorded in a professional studio in Sevierville, Tenn. by Lions Creative. It is due to be released soon.\n\n\u201cMy hopes and dreams for my writing, of course, is to be a best seller one day. However, I am perfectly happy writing stories that people enjoy reading and is something they will remember long after they have laid the book down. \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 is a dark and sad paranormal story and not for everyone, but it is an easy read and, once the reader is engaged, it is hard to put down.\u201d\n\nKincaid is available for lectures and to discuss the book with reading clubs, and is open to any questions from readers through her website, www.tskincaid.com."

            "article_content": "Is mathematics a discovery or an invention?\n\nThe answers to this question are an important part of the philosophy of mathematics. To answer it, philosophers would like to know whether mathematics is a natural part of this world that existed before humans discovered and comprehended it or if mathematics was invented by humans.\n\nIn this discussion, experts have developed many different possible answers as to the nature of mathematics\u2019s existence. A particularly popular one is mathematical realism: according to this view, mathematics is real irrespective of whether there is a human mind to comprehend it. In other words, it stipulates that human minds discovered mathematics rather than creating it.\n\nThere has been some support from evolution for this view. Insects called cicadas live underground but emerge every few years to eat foot, reproduce, and then die. This year, three broods of cicadas emerged at the same time: one with a 13-year cycle, one with a 17-year cycle, and one with a seven-year cycle. It\u2019s the first such event in 1,547 years.\n\nSeven, 137, and 17 are all prime numbers, and some scientists believe evolution opted for these numbers in order to avoid predators that emerge from underground to hunt cicadas at periodic intervals. By keeping their emergence cycle to a prime number of years, cicadas have a better chance of avoiding the predators\u2019 more predictale cycles.\n\nThere are many types of realism as well, including Platonic, mathematicism, and logicism. Other, alternative positions on the nature of mathematics include structuralism, fictionalism, and social constructivism."

            "article_content": "Kevin Weil showed no sign of the heat when he took to the stage at the Marriott Marquis in downtown San Francisco on an unseasonably sweaty early October morning.\n\nTrim and tan, outfitted in the de rigueur Silicon Valley uniform of a slim-fit gray tee, stonewashed blue jeans, and an Apple Watch Ultra, the chief product officer of OpenAI talked easily about the ambitious artificial intelligence-powered future his red-hot employer was building.\n\n\"You could imagine a world where you ask it a hard question about how you cure some particular form of cancer, and you let it think for five hours, five days, five months,\" Weil prophesied in response to a question about the \"reasoning capabilities\" of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither he nor his onstage interlocutor, Anyscale cofounder Robert Nishihara, ever acknowledged the elephant in the room: Weil wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nThe event, the AI infrastructure conference Ray Summit, had originally booked OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, to speak. Just days before, the high-profile executive had abruptly quit, prompting the last-minute swap. Murati's exit added to a long list of recent departures from OpenAI, one of the world's most valuable and hyped startups, even as it closed a historic $6.6 billion funding round on the day Weil spoke.\n\nIf Sam Altman is the starry-eyed visionary of OpenAI, Weil is its executor. He leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services it can sell, putting him at the center of a philosophical rift that has caused spectacular upheaval at the company, which was recently valued at $157 billion.\n\nIn two years, OpenAI went from a nonprofit lab nominally working to develop digital intelligence for the public good to a world-famous startup that puts out shiny new products and models every few months. The company is now attempting to become a for-profit operation to lure would-be backers to write bigger checks, which it needs to scale its business. Altman recently announced that the company's flagship product, ChatGPT, now has 300 million weekly users, triple the number it had a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with this astronomical growth, OpenAI has succumbed to a brain drain: Its chief research officer, head of AGI readiness, co-lead of its video-generation model Sora, and the list goes on. While this has sparked alarm bells in some corners of the tech industry, it has also elevated the profile of the senior leaders who have remained. That includes Weil, a relative OpenAI newcomer who joined in June and rapidly became one of its most notable ambassadors.\n\nAt a point when employee voices of dissent were growing louder, 41-year-old Weil arrived as a steady-handed product guru with a Midas touch. He was a longtime Twitter insider who created products that made the social media company money during a revolving door of chief executives.\n\nAt Instagram, he helped kneecap Snapchat's growth with competitive product releases such as Stories and live video. (Not everything he touched turned to gold, though. Weil also led Facebook's headlong charge into financial services as a cofounder of Libra, its ill-fated stablecoin.)\n\nWeil declined to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with five former senior colleagues, four of whom spoke on the record, and his past public interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter and Facebook were no strangers to chaos and scandal, but even their most challenging times are rivaled by OpenAI's workplace turmoil. There was a failed coup last year, bitter feuds among some workers, and an ongoing existential arms race to build \"digital gods.\"\n\nWeil's peers are certain he's the man to promote harmony. He's spent the better part of 15 years cranking out products that mostly delighted users and made money. He also has something his new employer desperately needs: The ability to pursue the company's best interests and balance human emotions at the same time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKevin Weil isn't a household name. But for those in the know in Silicon Valley, he's something better: \"He's the get-shit-done guy,\" said James Everingham, who worked with Weil at Instagram and Facebook.\n\nSarah Friar, OpenAI's new head of finance, has long admired Weil's product chops. Former Twitter boss Adam Bain called Weil \"Twitter's secret weapon\" for driving ad revenue. Everingham also described Weil as a workhorse who never shrank from a deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He brings that stamina, that dogged focus on the outcome,\" said April Underwood, a venture capitalist who worked closely with Weil on Twitter's ad products.\n\nWeil's relentless work ethic and people skills are recurring themes among former colleagues. At Facebook, two colleagues said he would often badge into the office first and fire off messages late into the night.\n\nOne colleague from Planet, a satellite imagery company where Weil worked as president until May of 2024, recalled how he started each week by posting in Slack the top three things on his mind. According to Everingham, Weil's a rare breed of product manager who codes almost as well as he writes memos. That endeared Weil to the engineers he needed to build products.\n\nWeil shrugs off the pressures of work with long runs and Diet Mountain Dew. Every birthday, he runs his age in miles and, in June, marked his 41st year with a 41-mile jaunt near his home in the posh California suburb of Portola Valley, according to a public Instagram post. Weil lives with his venture capitalist wife, Elizabeth, and three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a little bit superhuman in just the sheer amount that he works and works out,\" said Ashley Johnson, chief financial officer and now president of Planet.\n\nFormer colleagues say Kevin Weil was key to turning Twitter into a crucial arena for advertisers. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWeil set aside a Stanford doctorate in theoretical particle physics to cave out a path in tech, according to a 2017 speech he gave at his alma mater. In 2009, Weil landed at Twitter as a data scientist. At the time, Twitter had little revenue, never mind profit, to show for its many millions of users. That left investors wondering how Twitter would translate its popularity into money.\n\nWhen Twitter began developing ads a year later, Weil stepped up to lead it. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who overlapped with Weil at Twitter, said employees debated how to show ads in a way that didn't degrade the user experience, pitting engineers against marketers. Weil threaded the needle. Under his oversight, Twitter launched ads that looked like tweets inside the feed. AdAge reported in 2011 that hundreds of brands had embraced the format, helping to establish the cash flow that made Twitter's IPO possible in 2013.\n\nThen, in early 2016, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom asked Weil to dinner as Snapchat was nipping at the Facebook-owned photo app's heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram needed to get users, especially teens, to post more; Systrom wanted a pinch-hitter to get new features designed and added to the app and into the hands of Instagram users. Weil told CNBC in 2017 that he had already resigned from Twitter with plans to train for a 50-mile ultramarathon snaking the American River in California's Central Valley. He took the Instagram job and, a month later, finished fifth in the race.\n\nThe product leader wasted no time in the photo-sharing battle. In just a few months, Instagram rolled out a feature similar to Snapchat's disappearing photos and videos, then added popular face filters and also introduced a feed-ranking algorithm to highlight more relevant content. According to Instagram, its user base doubled within two years of Weil's arrival, reaching 1 billion monthly users by 2018; Snapchat's earnings statements during the same period indicated that its user growth had flatlined.\n\nEveringham, his former colleague, recounted how when Systrom identified Stories as Instagram's killer feature, Weil assembled a nimble team of engineers under the CEO's supervision to execute it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He had this clarity of thinking I haven't seen in anyone else,\" said Everingham, now an engineering leader of developer infrastructure at Meta.\n\nWeil's tenure at Instagram was defined by a controversial strategy: borrowing liberally from the competition. The features that became Instagram staples had their genesis in a rival's playbook, which neither Systrom nor Weil denied in interviews with Vox and TechCrunch over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy is particularly poignant as Weil steps into his new role at OpenAI, a company navigating a thicket of copyright lawsuits. New outlets, authors, and celebrities have sued OpenAI over using their work to train its large language models.\n\nThat's far from the only struggle the product chief faces. He's positioned as one of Altman's top lieutenants at a time when OpenAI's famed brain trust is leaving in droves, often to start competitor companies that may threaten OpenAI's early dominance in the space.\n\nFormer OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded Anthropic, one of OpenAI's most notable competitors, in 2021. Former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised $1 billion for his new venture, Safe Superintelligence. Ex-researcher Aravind Srinivas is working on an AI-powered search engine, Perplexity. In early December, Murati, the former CTO, told Wired she was \"figuring out\" what her new venture would look like, though it's unclear if her startup will directly compete with OpenAI.\n\nMira Murati's move follows a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI this years. Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images\n\nAnother threat comes from open-source AI models championed by the likes of Meta. If these free-to-use systems prove good enough for most users, it will make it far harder for OpenAI to effectively monetize its AI models and, ultimately, turn a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause with over $20 billion funding, according to PitchBook data, and only an estimated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024 plus losses of $5 billion, according to leaked documents obtained by The New York Times in September), OpenAI still faces a long road to prove that it can deliver a return on the unprecedented volumes of capital plowed into the company. And that's without even getting into the growing concern that improvements in AI models are slowing.\n\nOnstage at the Ray Summit in October, Weil shrugged off the threat of competition. When asked about whether the current gap in quality between open-source models and OpenAI's premium AI products will shrink, he quipped: \"I mean, we're certainly going to do our best to make it grow.\"\n\nIn theory, a proven leader like Weil could help guide the operation past the power struggles and talent losses toward a more steady state. By all accounts, he's a deft conciliator who can empathize with the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\"He's somewhat of a diplomat,\" said Jacobs Stanton, his former Twitter colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Facebook, where Weil helped develop a stablecoin backed by a basket of international currencies, he had to mediate between crypto natives, the product purists who wanted to take a more user-friendly, less decentralized approach, and policymakers, according to two former Facebook colleagues. The project ultimately couldn't overcome regulatory roadblocks and an exodus of corporate partners; Meta shuttered the project in 2022, selling $182 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.\n\nKevin Weil leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services OpenAI can sell. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nHow Weil's experience maps onto his current role remains to be seen. With its several thousand employees, regulators scrutinizing its every move, and 300 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI is more complex than any company Weil's stepped into before. In just six months since his arrival, OpenAI has rolled out a large language model that can solve more complex problems via a process the company calls \"reasoning,\" and a search engine within ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI launched a voice mode to talk to ChatGPT, which Weil personally tested as a \"universal translator\" during recent trips to Seoul and Tokyo. Reflecting on the release, Weil shared on LinkedIn, \"It feels normal to me now, but two years ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible.\"\n\nLast week OpenAI announced an ambitious \"12 days of shipmas,\" a festive product sprint likely to keep Weil working long hours. While he's managed to keep the proverbial plates spinning in his professional life, there's been one noticeable casualty: his workout routine. App data from Strava shows that he's been logging fewer hours of cycling and running each month since he joined OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Weil's exercise, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said Weil recorded 96 minutes of physical activity a day in November. \"I would say he's doing quite alright,\" Felix said.\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, covering startups and venture capital.

Learn More.\n\nOpenAI awarded a $1 million grant to a Duke University team of researchers seeking to explore AI algorithms capable of predicting people\u2019s moral judgment. The grant invests in academic research into \u201cAI morality\u201d as debates on the ethical use of artificial intelligence continue to gain steam in public discourse. Duke has been researching the use of AI to aid people in exercising ethical decisions, producing resources on ethics involving the latest AI technologies.\n\nThe study, \u201cMaking Moral AI,\u201d is being conducted by Duke\u2019s Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB) and led by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, professor of practical ethics and the project\u2019s principal investigator. Co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg of the Social Science Research Institute joins him on the project.\n\nMADLAB is an interdisciplinary laboratory designed to understand various factors that shape and influence people\u2019s \u201cmoral attitudes, decisions, and judgments.\u201d Researchers have been trying to understand the role of AI and how it can be used as a \u201cmoral GPS\u201d to help people make better judgments guided by ethical standards and traditions, drawing on \u201ccomputer science, data science, philosophy, economics, game theory, psychology, and neuroscience.\u201d\n\nAbout the OpenAI Grant\n\nOpenAI\u2019s grant will be used to \u201cdevelop algorithms that can predict human moral judgments in scenarios involving conflicts among morally relevant features in medicine, law, and business,\u201d according to a Duke press release. Information about the research grant has not been publicized, but it would be a good start for OpenAI to invest in such an effort. Ethics is highly nuanced. It\u2019s still a long shot for current technologies to grasp the nuances of moral judgments\u2014especially when human emotion also plays a crucial role.\n\nAI models are trained to calculate and compute data and statistics. Large language models mostly rely on patterns in language and reasoning to generate predictions. Various fields are involved in morality research, including philosophy, sociocultural studies, and psychology. Combining these disciplines with AI, computer science, and data science would be an enormous task. It also takes time to fully integrate social sciences and philosophy insights into AI algorithms.\n\nRead our guide to navigating AI\u2019s ethical challenges or our look at the ethics of generative AI models to learn more."

            "article_content": "4. Energy analysts agree the power grid needs upgrades to add more reliability and resiliency to the power supply. Data is helping the electric power sector generate more complete and accurate models to support better long-term planning to balance electricity supply and demand. Courtesy: Greenlots\n\nPlanning and operating a power system requires detailed grid studies to guide investment decisions and prepare for how the system may evolve over time. Long-term planning can identify the policy, regulatory, infrastructure, and operational updates that may be needed to achieve desired outcomes. Also, comprehensive planning can identify operating limits, determine performance improvements, assess mitigation measures, and characterize potential upgrades to the system. In the past two decades, installed capacity of renewable and distributed energy resources, most of them inverter-based wind and solar power, has increased significantly and is expected to continue accelerating. Traditional power system planning methods and tools are increasingly challenged as the impacts of decarbonization and electrification affect the power system. Models to represent synchronous machines\u2014until recently, most of the generation sources on the system\u2014are developed based on their physical characteristics. System operators increasingly seek methods and software to effectively plan and operate the bulk system with renewable energy resources, many of which may be at the distribution level.\n\nPower System Planning Studies Require New Tools and Methods\n\nIn addition to planning for future demand growth and evolving generation portfolios, system owners and operators must provide transmission services for renewable generation sources that are often remote from load centers and behave significantly different than traditional generation. Bulk power system planners and operators may require new tools and methods to provide a reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective supply of electricity to consumers while accommodating the expected increase in low-carbon resources. Studies used in system planning, typically referred to as transient studies or dynamic studies, focus on the timeframe immediately after an event on the system and simulate how the system will respond. To determine if a system event will lead to instability requires robust, accurate, and comprehensive mathematical models for every device on the network. These models represent both the physical characteristics of a device, as well as the action and behavior of any control system that may be present. This increase in computer-code-based control systems for generation resources creates a number of significant challenges for dynamic studies, including accurately representing these resources, ensuring models capture actual behavior of the assets, and understanding how changes in the computer code may impact device responses. Another key challenge in the studies is the ability to represent intellectual-property-protected computer code. The most accurate results can be obtained when using models provided by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), since they have visibility into their intellectual property (IP). However, in many cases, power system planning studies are conducted years before an OEM has been identified. Even when the OEM is known, the entity conducting the study may not have the necessary permissions to get access to IP-protected models, especially if a generation resource is located in a neighboring region or competing power system. In such scenarios, the use of generic models that do not represent any particular OEM, but can represent the trend of equipment dynamic responses, can be highly valuable. Generic models of synchronous machines\u2019 control systems are usually standardized models that have been well developed and validated over time. This is not the case for inverter-based resources, loads, high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission, flexible alternate current transmission, and other static devices.\n\nDeveloping Generic Models for Inverter-Based Resources and HVDC\n\nTo close this gap, the team at EPRI has been leading the work in the energy industry to continuously develop, parameterize, apply, and update generic models. Collaborating with OEMs, utilities, system operators, consultants, industry working groups, national labs, and other stakeholders demonstrates the team\u2019s value-driven approach. Several of the EPRI team\u2019s relevant generic models have been approved by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) Model Validation Subcommittee, an industry forum that determines which generic models can be used for specific WECC-wide interconnection studies. Largely, EPRI\u2019s generic modeling efforts have resulted in integration into commercial modeling software tools, such as:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development, parameterization, and benchmarking of generic WECC models for inverter-based resources (newer technology like grid forming and conventional technology), in both positive sequence and EMT domains.\n\nThe development of the WECC composite load model.\n\nThe development of HVDC generic models.\n\nWhile these models can be useful for understanding general trends in forward-looking studies, the use of generic models should be approached with appropriate cautions regarding applicability and limits. Appropriate parameterization of the models is extremely important, and recognizing the scenarios where these models can be applied and where they cannot is equally relevant. In its work with multiple system operators, transmission owners, and vertically integrated utilities, EPRI research has demonstrated:\n\nImproved numerical robustness of generic models in studies of systems with a high percentage of inverter-based resources, especially to understand general trends of potential instability under different operating conditions.\n\nThe capability of generic grid forming inverter-based resources models and technology in addressing stability issues.\n\nThe parameterization of load models based on survey and measurement data as well as parameterization of loads to replicate grid events.\n\nThe application of HVDC models for offshore wind integration.\n\n\u2014Deepak Ramasubramanian is EPRI Transmission Operations and Planning technical leader.

            "article_content": "As I read and listen more, as well as occasionally attend scientific conferences with both United States and world-known scientists, I realize we are on the brink of another theory that is like Humpty Dumpty. Falling off the wall is what has been purported to be truth for more than 100 years. Even the well-known evolutionist Richard Dawkins is taking another look at the latest scientific evidence.\n\nFor those hard-core evolutionists, let\u2019s consider some of the scientific evidence:\n\n-- Stephen Meyer \u2014 He\u2019s the author of \u201cDarwin\u2019s Doubt\u201d and \u201cSignature of the Cell.\u201d\n\n-- David Berlinski \u2014 He\u2019s featured in a YouTube video interview titled \u201cUncommon Knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with Peter Robinson, Berlinski quotes from his own essay, \u201cThe Deniable Darwin.\u201d Berlinski said that thousands of life forms appear at once. There is no progression; therefore, no evolution.\n\nHe went on to make a very interesting point. If life progressed by an accumulation of small changes, as Darwin suggests, the fossil record should reflect this. However, since Darwin published \u201cThe Origin of Species\u201d in 1859, nearly everyone in the scientific community has been mulling over and recognized what the problem is \u2014 or they are studying and trying to ascertain the incomprehensible evidence that has been revealing itself. I am in agreement with Berlinski.\n\nThere definitely is a problem. I believe this problem is that Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution has gained a cult following within academia without the theory being subject to scrutiny. It\u2019s like the giant elephant in the room that few want to talk about. In simple terms, with evolution, there is no link between species. Therefore, the theory is no longer palpable. Science is disproving evolution.\n\nHere are just a few examples:\n\n-- In the Big Bang, there was a beginning. Who did the Big Bang? Where did this come from? How did the Big Bang happen, whereby thousands of life forms appeared at once and are in the fossil record. How do you refute this? According to Astronomy.com, virtually all astronomers and cosmologists agree that the universe began with a Big Bang \u2014 a tremendously powerful genesis of space-time, that sent matter and energy reeling outward.\n\n-- Mathematics \u2014 All laws of physics are perfectly tuned. In the \u201cFine Tuning Argument,\u201d Robin Collins explains in her essay that the laws of physics have been specially tuned by an intelligent being to sustain life. This world is not something that has come from a random (evolution) process."

The colours are inviting, navigation and button placement feel instinctive, and executing what you have in mind isn\u2019t jarring or inconvenient\u2014almost as if the app knows you better than you know yourself.\n\nThen there\u2019s the flip side. Apps that feel like a maze designed by a mischievous gremlin, leaving you frustrated and reaching for the uninstall button faster than one can even say the word \u2018engagement\u2019.\n\nUser interface (UI) and user experience (UX) have transcended from mere tech jargon to the heartbeat of any successful app\u2014more so in the retail space. As we\u2019re seeing newer apps surface faster than social media trends going viral, the imperative for keeping your UI/UX feel fresh and intuitive has never been greater.\n\nHowever, why do these tiny tweaks matter? How can one achieve this amidst the uphill battle in the background without breaking a sweat (or the app)?\n\nWhy do little tweaks pack a big punch?\n\nReports highlight that a staggering 50% of users uninstall an app within just 30 days of downloading, with nearly 25% abandoning it after just one use. In that fleeting moment, the UI/UX does all the talking. An intuitive, visually appealing, and welcoming layout can make a difference between a user diving deeper or tapping out.\n\nSmall UI/UX enhancements\u2014like simplifying the checkout process, optimising load times, or making call-to-action buttons more prominent\u2014can lead to improvements in user engagement and conversion rates.\n\nThis is more so during the festive season when user activity sees a spike alongside competition. Retail and ecommerce apps roll out special offers, flash sales, and user interfaces donning the festive spirit.\n\nHowever, if an app\u2019s UI is clunky or counterintuitive, users will uninstall the app faster than Santa climbs down a chimney. According to a report, about 70% of online businesses fail due to poor usability of their apps and websites. Poor UX can be devastating\u2014customer churn, negative reviews, and a tarnished brand reputation.\n\nAlso Read How AI-based customer service is enhancing user experience\n\nThe struggle behind the scenes\n\nKeeping the UI/UX fresh and intuitive is paramount. However, ensuring this poses significant challenges for product managers and marketers alike.\n\nFrequent UI/UX changes demand a lot of creativity, time, and collaboration, and more so when dealing with global user bases with varying cultural preferences. Besides, the process can often be time-consuming. About 50% of marketers say it takes over four weeks to modify app and web experiences.\n\nDependency on developer teams and the arduous internal processes restrict the ability for quick implementation of updates, creating bottlenecks and further limiting responsiveness to user feedback. Nearly 24% of marketers find it impossible to experiment with variations due to technical or resource constraints.\n\nMoreover, 54% of product managers are unable to support marketers in experimenting with onboarding flows, content, and layout adjustments due to resource limitations. This reliance on developer teams adds to the complexities for marketers and product managers, resulting in potential delays in delivering timely, engaging experiences.\n\nImproving product experiences with no-code solutions\n\nMeeting the demand for instant UI/UX adjustments without a full-scale overhaul may seem impossible. However, advanced no-code and low-code solutions provide a seamless way for teams to enhance product experiences and easily manage frequent app updates.\n\nIn fact, 81% of marketers and 72% of product managers agree that no-code frameworks could empower their teams and facilitate faster and more frequent experimentation.\n\nMarketing automation platforms with no-code personalisation features and dynamic UI/UX adjustments can enable product managers to instantly tailor experiences for different user segments, minimising the strain on the developers.\n\nBy unlocking faster implementation and reducing the dependency on engineering, such tools can help marketers and product teams push out relevant updates without compromising on quality\u2014empowering them to remain agile and responsive to market needs and ensuring the app is always fresh for users throughout the year.\n\nToday, as technology and user expectations continue to soar higher, standing still is not very different from moving backwards. Agile UI/UX isn\u2019t just about keeping up with the trends but setting them.\n\nPrioritising UI/UX with low-code and no-code solutions shows users the brand listens, adapts, and values quality product experiences\u2014building loyalty and engagement more easily than ever.\n\nAnand Jain is the Co-founder and Chief Product Officer at CleverTap."

FanDuel doesn\u2019t restrict the odds of your wager, so I recommend finding the safest wager possible based on the odds. Forget about betting the spread or either team to win outright. The Longhorns are only a 2.5-point favorite, meaning both teams have a realistic shot at winning.\n\nInstead, I recommend betting on Texas RB Quintrevion Wisner to rush for 40+ yards. The odds are -1100 and the implied probability is 91.67%. Wisner leads the Longhorns in carries and has 344 rushing yards in the last two games. Earlier in the season when Georgia\u2019s defense dominated Texas, Wisner still tallied 52 yards.\n\n*Note: Odds are based on the best value our experts find as of publication; check lines closer to game time to ensure you get the best odds."

            "article_content": "To many, AI is just a horrible Steven Spielberg movie. To others, it's the next generation of learning computers. But what is artificial intelligence, exactly? The answer depends on who you ask. Broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) is the combination of computer science and robust datasets, deployed to solve some kind of problem.\n\nMany definitions of artificial intelligence include a comparison to the human mind or brain, whether in form or function. Alan Turing wrote in 1950 about \u201cthinking machines\u201d that could respond to a problem using human-like reasoning. His eponymous Turing test is still a benchmark for natural language processing. Later, Stuart Russell and John Norvig observed that humans are intelligent, but we're not always rational. Russell and Norvig saw two classes of artificial intelligence: systems that think and act like a human being, versus those that think and act rationally. Today, we've got all kinds of programs we call AI.\n\n'AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable'\n\nMany AIs employ \"neural nets,\" whose code is written to emulate some aspect of the architecture of neurons or the brain. However, not all intelligence is human-like. Nor is it necessarily the best idea to emulate neurobiological information processing. That's why engineers limit how far they carry the brain metaphor. It's more about how phenomenally parallel the brain is, and its distributed memory handling. As defined by John McCarthy in 2004, artificial intelligence is \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, the distinction between a neural net and an AI is often a matter of philosophy, more than capabilities or design. Many \"AI-powered\" systems are neural nets, under the hood. We also call some neural nets AIs. For example, OpenAI's powerful GPT-3 AI is a type of neural net called a transformer (more on these below). A robust neural net's performance can equal or outclass a narrow AI. There is much overlap between neural nets and artificial intelligence, but the capacity for machine learning can be the dividing line.\n\nWhat is an AI Made Of?\n\nConceptually: In the sense of its logical structure, to be an AI, you need three fundamental parts. First, there's the decision process -- usually an equation, a model, or just some code. AIs often perform classification or apply transformations. To do that, the AI must be able to decide on patterns in the data. Second, there's an error function -- some way for the AI to check its work. And third, if the AI is going to learn from experience, it needs some way to optimize its model. Many neural networks do this with a system of weighted nodes, where each node has both a value and a relationship to its network neighbors. Values change over time; stronger relationships have a higher weight in the error function.\n\nDeep learning\n\nDeep learning networks have more hidden layers than conventional neural networks. Circles are nodes, or \"neurons.\"Physically: Typically, an AI is \"just\" software. AI-powered software services like Grammarly and Rytr use neural nets, like GPT-3. Those neural nets consist of equations or commands, written in things like Python or Common Lisp. They run comparisons, perform transformations, and suss out patterns from the data. They run on server-side hardware, usually, but which hardware isn't important. Any conventional silicon will do, be it CPU or GPU. However, there are dedicated hardware neural nets, a special kind of ASIC called neuromorphic chips.\n\nTensors and Neuromorphic Silicon\n\nNot all ASICs are neuromorphic designs. However, neuromorphic chips are all ASICs. Neuromorphic design is fundamentally different from CPUs, and only nominally overlaps with a GPU's multi-core architecture. But it's not some exotic new transistor type, nor any strange and eldritch kind of data structure. It's all about tensors. Tensors describe the relationships between things; they're a kind of mathematical object that can have metadata, just like a digital photo has EXIF data.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModern Nvidia RTX GPUs have a huge number of tensor cores. That makes sense if you're drawing moving polygons, each with some number of properties or effects that apply to it. But tensors can handle more than just spatial data. The ability to parallelize tensor calculations is also why GPUs get scalped for crypto mining, and why they're used in cluster computing, especially for deep learning. GPUs excel at organizing many different threads at once.\n\nBut no matter how elegant your data organization might be, it still has to filter through multiple layers of software abstraction before it ever becomes binary. Intel's neuromorphic chip, Loihi 2, affords a very different approach.\n\nLoihi 2\n\nLoihi 2 is a neuromorphic chip that comes as a package deal with a software ecosystem named Lava. Loihi's physical architecture invites -- almost requires -- the use of weighting and an error function, both defining features of AI and neural nets. The chip's biomimetic design extends to its electrical signaling. Instead of ones and zeroes, on or off, Loihi \"fires\" in spikes with an integer value -- capable of carrying much more data. It begs to be used with tensors. What if you didn't have to translate your values into machine code and then binary? What if you could just encode them directly?\n\nMachine learning models that use Lava can take full advantage of Loihi 2's unique physical design. Together, they offer a hybrid hardware-software neural net that can process relationships between multiple entire multi-dimensional datasets, like an acrobat spinning plates.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI tools like Rytr, Grammarly and others do their work in a regular desktop browser. In contrast, neuromorphic chips like Loihi aren't designed for use in consumer systems. (At least, not yet.) They're intended for researchers. Instead, neuromorphic engineering has a different strength. It can allow silicon to perform another kind of biomimicry. Brains are extremely cheap, in terms of power use per unit throughput. The hope is that Loihi and other neuromorphic systems can mimic that power efficiency to break out of the Iron Triangle and deliver all three: good, fast, and cheap.\n\nAI vs. Neural Nets vs. Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning\n\nIf the three-part logical structure of an AI sounds familiar, that's because neural nets have the same three logical pillars. In fact, from IBM's perspective, the relationship between machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence is a hierarchy of evolution. It's just like the relationship between Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard. They're all separate entities in their own right, but each is based on the one before, and they grow in power as they evolve. We still have Charmanders even though we also have Charizards.\n\n\" achine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. In fact, it is the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence as it relates to machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. Image: IBM An AI isn't just several neural nets smashed together, any more than Charizard is three Charmanders in a trench coat. All these different types of artificial intelligence overlap along a spectrum of complexity. It can be difficult to precisely draw the line. But what often distinguishes an AI from a neural net is the ability to learn. IBM explains, \"[M]achine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. In fact, it is the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three [layers].\"\n\nHow Does an Artificial Intelligence Learn?\n\nWhen an AI learns, it's different than just saving a file after making edits. To an AI, learning involves changing its process.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany neural nets learn through a process called \"back-propagation.\" Typically, a neural net is a \"feed-forward\" process, because data only moves in one direction through the network. It's efficient, but it's also a kind of ballistic (unguided) process. In back-propagation, however, later nodes in the process get to pass information back to earlier nodes. Not all neural nets perform back-propagation, but for those that do, the effect is like changing the coefficients in front of the variables in an equation.\n\nSupervised and Unsupervised Learning\n\nWe also divide neural nets into two classes, depending on what type of problems they can solve. In supervised learning, a neural net checks its work against a labeled training set or an overwatch; in most cases, that overwatch is a human. For example, SwiftKey learns how you text, and adjusts its autocorrect to match. Pandora uses listeners' input to finely classify music, in order to build specifically tailored playlists. 3blue1brown even has an excellent explainer series on neural nets, where he discusses a neural net using supervised learning to perform handwriting recognition.\n\nSupervised learning is great for fine accuracy on an unchanging set of parameters, like alphabets. Unsupervised learning, however, can wrangle data with changing numbers of dimensions. (An equation with x, y and z terms is a three-dimensional equation.) Unsupervised learning tends to win with small datasets. It's also good at recognizing patterns we might not even know to look for.\n\nTensors and Transformers\n\nTransformers are a special, versatile kind of AI capable of unsupervised learning. They can integrate many different streams of data, each with its own changing parameters. Because of this, they're great at handling tensors. Tensors, in turn, are great for keeping all that data organized. With the combined powers of tensors and transformers, we can handle more complex datasets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nVideo upscaling and motion smoothing are great applications for AI transformers. Likewise, tensors are crucial to the detection of deepfakes and alterations. With deepfake tools reproducing in the wild, it's a digital arms race.\n\nThe person in this image does not exist. This is a deepfake image created by StyleGAN, Nvidia's generative adversarial neural network. Video signal has high dimensionality. It's made of a series of images, which are themselves composed of a series of coordinates and color values. Mathematically and in computer code, we represent those quantities as matrices or n-dimensional arrays. Helpfully, tensors are great for matrix and array wrangling. DaVinci Resolve, for example, uses tensor processing in its (NVidia RTX) hardware-accelerated Neural Engine facial recognition utility. Hand those tensors to a transformer, and its powers of unsupervised learning do a great job picking out the curves of motion on-screen -- and in real life.\n\nTensor, Transformer, Servo, Spy\n\nIn fact, that ability to track multiple curves against one another is why the tensor-transformer dream team has taken so well to things like natural language processing. And the approach can generalize. Convolutional transformers -- a hybrid of a CNN and a transformer -- excel at image recognition on the fly. This tech is in use today, for things like robot search and rescue or assistive image and text recognition, as well as the much more controversial practice of dragnet facial recognition, \u00e0 la Hong Kong.\n\nThe ability to handle a changing mass of data is great for consumer and assistive tech, but it's also clutch for things like mapping the genome, and improving drug design. The list goes on. Transformers can also handle different kinds of \"dimensions,\" not just the spatial, which is useful for managing an array of devices or embedded sensors -- like weather tracking, traffic routing, or industrial control systems. That's what makes AI so useful for data processing \"at the edge.\"\n\nAI On the Edge vs. For the Edge\n\nNot only does everyone have a cell phone, there are embedded systems in everything. This proliferation of devices gives rise to an ad hoc global network called the Internet of Things (IoT). In the parlance of embedded systems, the \"edge\" represents the outermost fringe of end nodes within the collective IoT network. Edge intelligence takes two main forms: AI on edge and AI for edge. The distinction is where the processing happens. \"AI on edge\" refers to network end nodes (everything from consumer devices to cars and industrial control systems) that employ AI to crunch data locally. \"AI for the edge\" enables edge intelligence by offloading some of the compute demand to the cloud.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn practice, the main differences between the two are latency and horsepower. Local processing is always going to be faster than a data pipeline beholden to ping times. The tradeoff is the computing power available server-side.\n\nEmbedded systems, consumer devices, industrial control systems, and other end nodes in the IoT all add up to a monumental volume of information that needs processing. Some phone home, some have to process data in near real-time, and some have to check and correct their own work on the fly. Operating in the wild, these physical systems act just like the nodes in a neural net. Their collective throughput is so complex that in a sense, the IoT has become the AIoT -- the artificial intelligence of things.\n\nNone of Us Is As Dumb As All of Us\n\nAs devices get cheaper, even the tiny slips of silicon that run low-end embedded systems have surprising computing power. But having a computer in a thing doesn't necessarily make it smarter. Everything's got Wi-Fi or Bluetooth now. Some of it is really cool. Some of it is made of bees. If I forget to leave the door open on my front-loading washing machine, I can tell it to run a cleaning cycle from my phone. But the IoT is already a well-known security nightmare. Parasitic global botnets exist that live in consumer routers. Hardware failures can cascade, like the Great Northeast Blackout of summer 2003, or when Texas froze solid in 2021. We also live in a timeline where a faulty firmware update can brick your shoes.\n\nThere's a common pipeline (hypeline?) in tech innovation. When some Silicon Valley startup invents a widget, it goes from idea to hype train to widgets-as-a-service to disappointment, before finally figuring out what the widget's actually good for.\n\nThe Gartner hype curve. Artificial intelligence shows up on this roller coaster several times. But we're already getting sick of the IoT. Who knew?\n\nOh, okay, there This is why we lampoon the IoT with loving names like the Internet of Shitty Things and the Internet of Stings. (Internet of Stings devices communicate over TCBee-IP.) But the AIoT isn't something anyone can sell. It's more than the sum of its parts. The AIoT is a set of emergent properties that we have to manage if we're going to avoid an explosion of splinternets, and keep the world operating in real time.\n\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence? TL;DR\n\nIn practice, artificial intelligence is often the same thing as a neural net capable of machine learning. They're both software that can run on whatever CPU or GPU is available and powerful enough. Neural nets often have the power to perform machine learning via back-propagation. There's also a kind of hybrid hardware-and-software neural net that brings a new meaning to \"machine learning.\" It's made using tensors, ASICs, and neuromorphic engineering by Intel. Furthermore, the emergent collective intelligence of the IoT has created a demand for AI on, and for, the edge. Hopefully we can do it justice.\n\nNow Read:"

But inside the U.S. government, some officials believe the group\u2019s turn toward pragmatism is genuine, and that its leaders know they cannot realize aspirations to join or lead the Syrian government if the group is seen as a jihadist organization.\n\nKurdish forces\n\nForces from Syria\u2019s Kurdish ethnic minority became the United States\u2019 main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces. After the extremist group was largely defeated, the Kurdish-led forces consolidated control over towns in the northeast, expanding an autonomous region they had built there.

            "article_content": "2024 has been a rough year for Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). The maker of healthier sugar-free energy drinks posted a revenue slump last quarter amid increasing competition and a changing strategy with its largest distribution partner. Shares have fallen a whopping 70% from all-time highs set just a half-year ago, causing immense pain for shareholders who have held on this year.\n\nThis short-term pain should be seen as an opportunity for patient investors focused on long-term gains. Here's why growth stock Celsius Holdings is a buy for investors as we head into the holiday season.\n\nMarket share stagnation, PepsiCo distribution headwind\n\nCelsius stock has gone in the tank for a few reasons. First, we should note that the stock was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of over 100 earlier in 2024. Any stock trading at a nosebleed P/E is going to be risky, no matter how fast the company is growing sales.\n\nSpeaking of which, that brings us to the second reason Celsius stock has faltered this year: slowing revenue growth. After posting huge double-digit revenue growth figures for many years, Celsius went into a big slowdown in 2024. Each quarter saw successive deceleration in revenue growth, with revenue actually falling 31% year over year last quarter.\n\nNow, this huge revenue drop is not as bad as it seems. Celsius has a major distribution deal with PepsiCo, which decided to trim its inventory levels for the energy drink brand this year. Ingesting less inventory meant a temporary hit to Celsius's revenue. The brand didn't lose 30% of its market share in one quarter.\n\nThe market share story is not pretty, though. After years of market share gains in the energy drink category, Celsius seems to have stalled out at around 12% market share in the United States in 2024. Time will tell whether this stagnation is a ceiling for Celsius, but investors are clearly worried. There is increasing competition from upstart brands like Alani Nu and Ghost that are eating into the sugar-free energy drink market once dominated by Celsius.\n\nLong-term international growth, category tailwind\n\nCelsius is facing headwinds in multiple areas right now. That doesn't mean they will be permanent. The inventory issues with Pepsi should resolve within the next few quarters. Then, the company's revenue will line up with actual sales from retailers to fans of the product.\n\nBrand competition is fierce, and investors shouldn't bank on Celsius gaining market share like it did before 2024. No consumer packaged good category is a monopoly -- there will always be other energy drink brands out there.\n\nThere are some long-term tailwinds that should help Celsius grow over the next five years. The brand is only just expanding to international markets, which now include English-speaking countries and France. International revenue grew 37% year over year last quarter, which investors should expect to continue in upcoming years.\n\nOverall energy drink sales keep growing, taking share from traditional drink sources such as coffee, fruit juices, and soda. If Celsius keeps its market share, this sector tailwind should help it grow revenue over the next few years.\n\nLast, we shouldn't forget the steady price increases consumer packaged food brands can implement year after year. A pack of 12 Celsius cans is currently going for around $20 on Amazon. Celsius will be able to raise prices to $21, $22, and eventually higher on its energy drink packs in the years to come and will likely get little customer pushback. These are simply not expensive items if people incorporate such products into their daily lives.\n\nCELH PE Ratio Chart\n\n\n\nCELH PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nWhy the stock is a buy right now\n\nAdd up these three growth drivers -- international expansion, category growth, and pricing power -- and I think Celsius can produce 10% annual revenue growth over the next five years. Extrapolating from its current trailing revenue of $1.37 billion, Celsius will be doing $2.2 billion in sales five years from now.\n\nAssuming the company can reach similar profit margins to Monster Beverage of 25%, Celsius will be generating $550 million in annual earnings in five years, which would bring its P/E down to 12.4 compared to the stock's current market cap of $6.8 billion. The average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is 31 today.\n\nIf you believe in the Celsius growth story, the stock is likely a buy for those looking to hold for at least five years or longer, after falling 70% from highs.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "article_content": "If you were around in the late 90s and early 2000s, you remember how technology seemed to be getting smaller and smaller. Eventually, we expected cassette and CD players to be as small as the media themselves\u2013but that didn't happen.\n\nHow Hardware Changed With The Times\n\nPicture this: it's 2002, and you just opened the latest Eminem album. You take out your shiny new portable CD player that's only a little bit larger than the CD itself and pop it in to listen to the entire album on repeat. Nearby is a portable cassette player that is around the same size as the cassettes it plays.\n\nTechnology tends to get smaller as time goes along. Just take a look at today's portable devices. The Steam Deck shows that handhelds may be the future of PC gaming, and that's just a regular gaming PC, shrunk down to work in the palm of your hand.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday, you can still find portable cassette and CD players because there's (still) an ever-shrinking market for them. Still, the nostalgia of holding onto that Bob Marley cassette your dad gave you in 1998 keeps you needing a portable player for it. Yet, the technology for these players seems to have come to a standstill.\n\nManufacturers Are Dwindling as Demand Drops\n\nLucas Gouveia / How-To Geek | ulrich22 Hulahop / Shutterstock\n\nIn the early 00s, you'd be spoilt for choice when it came to choosing a portable cassette or CD player. Every brand, from Panasonic to Coby, had an offering at different price ranges. Now, if you search for a portable player on Amazon, you'll come up with a much smaller assortment of new manufacturers.\n\nYou'll have a lot of brands to choose from, but none of them will be ones you recognize. As the demand for these electronic devices started to dwindle, the mainstream manufacturers moved into more current technology. As a result, smaller, less recognizable brands took over manufacturing and selling these portable players.\n\nIf you look at the portable players on offer, you'll realize something: all of them seem to be stuck in the 00s. With technology progressing as fast as it has, shouldn't there be sleeker, more streamlined designs? Why did players get stuck in that retro period without any update to their design?\n\nSmaller Technology Comes With a Price\n\nMoore's Law is well known in computing circles, and it says that the amount of transistors on a chip roughly doubles every two years with a minimal increase in price. What this means is that tech usually gets smaller with time. If you look at how far cell-phones have come in processing power, you'll have a good idea of how it works. But if that's the case, why doesn't it work for portable cassette and CD players?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile I was looking for the reasoning behind this, I found a simple reason behind why the cassette and CD-players were still so bulky. It has to do with the underlying technology. In a portable CD player, the most important component is the laser head. Unfortunately, the choice of components that manufacturers have is limited. The bulky designs we see in these modern CD players are due to having to accommodate those laser heads.\n\nFor cassette players, the problem is similar. While several companies are making portable cassette players in 2024, all of them rely on the same reading mechanism for the tape head. Since this mechanism only comes in one size, all the cassette players manufactured with it have to fit the same form factor.\n\nWhile technology manufacturers of the 90s and 00s could improve and iterate on their existing technology, there just isn't the market nor the profitability to do so with current components. If 8-tracks, an even older technology, had survived the ages, it too would run into the same problem of limited technology.\n\nOther Retro Technology Faces Similar Problems\n\nAnker, 1byOne, OBSBOT\n\nA few years ago, people started listening to vinyl records again, and the medium has a lot of new technology because of this upswing in users. When vinyl players became popular again, its biggest issue was the diamond needle that was needed to \"read\" the records. Even today, there hasn't been any effort to make a needle that stands up to use despite all the current technology we have available.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCDs seem to be going in the same direction as 8-track tapes, with more and more people having them as conversation pieces and not actual music technology. However, in a surprising trend, cassette tapes are making a comeback, meaning there may be a use for those portable cassette players after all.\n\nThat isn't to say that modern portable cassette players aren't pushing the envelope. Many of them have technology you'd expect them to have. From more efficient battery usage to Bluetooth connectivity in some cases, portable cassette players are proving that they aren't ready to give up the ghost just yet.\n\nDespite that, having retro portable technology is more of a flex than a necessity. With music so easily available through streaming and even downloaded music on our phones, retro portable music devices are just throwbacks to a simpler time. There's still no substitute for that analog hiss you get listening to the tape past the read head.\n\nThe Tradeoff Between Old and New\n\nI am not likely to be someone buying a new retro portable cassette or CD player. The one I already have still works (although it's way too draining on the batteries). I know how good it is to feel that sense of nostalgia. There's something that listening to digital music can't possibly copy, and that feeling comes from listening to music on the original hardware.\n\nWhile a portable cassette or CD player isn't technically the original hardware, it's close enough. With a good set of earbuds or headphones, you can experience the music as it was meant to be experienced. Listening to music the retro way walks the line between old and new, giving you the best parts of both. It's just a shame the hardware won't get any better."

            "article_content": "Explore Valve's evolving strategy for Steam Machines, from their initial launch to the impact of the Steam Deck, and what the future holds for living room PC gaming.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long and winding road for Valve\u2019s Steam Machines. First announced in 2013, these pre-built gaming PCs, designed to bring PC gaming to the living room, were met with a mix of excitement and skepticism. After a somewhat underwhelming launch and years of relative silence, many wondered if Valve had abandoned the project altogether. However, recent developments suggest that Valve\u2019s grand vision for Steam Machines might finally be coming into focus, albeit in a different form than initially imagined.\n\nThis article delves into the history of Steam Machines, exploring their initial goals, their struggles, and how Valve\u2019s evolving strategy, particularly with the success of the Steam Deck, might be the key to finally realizing their initial ambition: to make PC gaming more accessible and widespread.\n\nThe Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Steam Machines\n\nWhat were they? Steam Machines were pre-built gaming PCs designed to run Valve\u2019s SteamOS, a Linux-based operating system optimized for gaming. The idea was to offer a console-like experience with the openness and flexibility of PC gaming.\n\nWhy did Valve create them? Valve aimed to bridge the gap between PC and console gaming, offering a user-friendly experience with access to the vast Steam library. They wanted to challenge the dominance of consoles in the living room.\n\nWhat went wrong? Several factors contributed to the lukewarm reception of Steam Machines:\n\nLimited game compatibility: SteamOS, being Linux-based, initially struggled with compatibility issues, limiting the number of games available.\n\nHigh price point: Early Steam Machines were often more expensive than comparable gaming consoles.\n\nLack of marketing: Valve didn\u2019t heavily promote Steam Machines, leading to low consumer awareness.\n\nCompetition from consoles: The PS4 and Xbox One offered strong competition with established game libraries and exclusive titles.\n\nWhere are they now? While Steam Machines never truly took off, the underlying technology and vision behind them continued to evolve. The Steam Controller, initially designed for Steam Machines, found a niche audience. More importantly, the development of Proton, a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Linux, significantly expanded the SteamOS game library.\n\nThe Steam Deck: A Turning Point\n\nThe release of the Steam Deck in 2022 marked a significant shift in Valve\u2019s strategy. This handheld gaming PC, powered by SteamOS, proved to be a massive success, showcasing the potential of Valve\u2019s gaming ecosystem beyond traditional desktops.\n\nHow the Steam Deck changed the game:\n\nPortable PC gaming: The Steam Deck demonstrated the viability of portable PC gaming, attracting a new generation of gamers.\n\nProton\u2019s success: The widespread adoption of the Steam Deck highlighted the effectiveness of Proton, making Linux gaming a reality for many.\n\nSteamOS refinement: The Steam Deck pushed Valve to further refine SteamOS, improving its performance and user experience.\n\nThe Steam Deck\u2019s success has reignited interest in Steam Machines. With a mature SteamOS, a vast library of compatible games thanks to Proton, and a proven hardware design, the stage seems set for Valve to revisit the living room PC gaming concept.\n\nValve\u2019s Master Plan: An Evolving Ecosystem\n\nValve\u2019s approach to Steam Machines seems to have shifted from dedicated hardware to a more holistic ecosystem approach. They are no longer focused on selling specific devices but rather on expanding the reach of SteamOS and making it the go-to platform for PC gaming across various form factors.\n\nEvidence of this shift:\n\nSteamOS 3 open source release: Valve made SteamOS 3 available to the public, allowing manufacturers to create their own Steam Machines.\n\nFocus on software and services: Valve is investing heavily in Proton, SteamOS features, and cloud gaming services, strengthening the overall Steam ecosystem.\n\nCommunity involvement: Valve actively encourages community contributions to SteamOS development, fostering a collaborative environment.\n\nThis strategy allows Valve to leverage the success of the Steam Deck while enabling other manufacturers to contribute to the hardware side. This could lead to a diverse range of Steam Machines, catering to different needs and price points.\n\nThe Future of Steam Machines: What to Expect\n\nWhile Valve hasn\u2019t officially announced any new Steam Machines, the pieces are in place for a potential resurgence. Here are some possible scenarios:\n\nPartnerships with manufacturers: Valve could collaborate with hardware partners to release new Steam Machines, leveraging their expertise in design and manufacturing.\n\nFocus on niche markets: Steam Machines could target specific segments, such as living room gaming, portable gaming, or even competitive esports.\n\nIntegration with other Valve hardware: Valve\u2019s strategy could be tightly integrated with other Valve hardware, such as the Steam Deck and Index VR headset.\n\nCloud gaming integration: Steam Machines could leverage Valve\u2019s cloud gaming capabilities, allowing users to stream games from their existing PC libraries.\n\nThe success of this renewed approach will depend on several factors, including the continued development of Proton, the performance and affordability of new Steam Machines, and the overall growth of the PC gaming market.\n\nMy Personal Take\n\nAs a long-time PC gamer and someone who eagerly followed the initial Steam Machine announcement, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about their future. The Steam Deck has proven that Valve can deliver a compelling gaming experience on a Linux-based platform. With the advancements in Proton and the growing SteamOS ecosystem, I believe Steam Machines have the potential to finally carve out a space in the living room.\n\nI remember being excited about the prospect of a console-like PC gaming experience, but the initial Steam Machines fell short of expectations. Now, with the Steam Deck paving the way, I\u2019m hopeful that Valve can learn from the past and deliver a truly compelling Steam Machine experience that bridges the gap between PC and console gaming.\n\nValve\u2019s journey with Steam Machines has been a rollercoaster ride. While the initial launch didn\u2019t meet expectations, Valve\u2019s persistence and strategic shifts, particularly with the success of the Steam Deck, have breathed new life into the concept. With a more mature SteamOS, a vast library of compatible games, and a thriving ecosystem, the future of Steam Machines looks promising. Whether they will become mainstream remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Valve\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of PC gaming is unwavering."

The focus was on the EC2 UltraServers powered by Trainium2 chips and EC2 instances, which are now available. According to AWS, the new Trn2 instances offer 20.8 petaflops of computing power per instance and an up to 40 percent better price-performance ratio compared to the GPU-based EC2 P5 instances.\n\nAnzeige\n\nA Trn2 UltraServer consists of four Trn2 instances that are connected to each other via a NeuronLink connection. This architecture is designed to scale computing power up to 83.2 petaflops to reduce training and inference times for the world's largest AI models. Models with up to one trillion parameters could thus be processed with improved latency.\n\n\"Project Rainier\" for AI clusters\n\nAWS also announced \"Project Rainier\", which combines hundreds of Trainium2 UltraServers into an EC2 UltraCluster, enabling an increase in cluster size compared to existing solutions. These UltraClusters are used in organizations such as Anthropic to train AI models. Anthropic uses them, for example, to optimize Claude models for Amazon Bedrock on Trainium2. This infrastructure should enable customers to efficiently train models with trillions of parameters and use them in real time.\n\nRead also Amazon releases new AI model family \u2013 Nova\n\nAWS emphasized that it is not enough to increase the size of clusters to improve performance. Instead, the new architecture of Trainium2 UltraServers improves data distribution and resource allocation. This reduces the overall training time without encountering traditional network limits.\n\nNew instances with Nvidia Blackwell and outlook\n\nIn addition to the Trainium2 solutions, AWS presented the EC2 P6 instances. They are based on the next generation of Blackwell GPUs from Nvidia. Compared to the current generation, AWS promises up to 2.5 times higher performance and optimization specifically for compute-intensive generative AI applications. AWS sees the P6 instances primarily for applications that require fast response times and high scalability.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAWS has also already announced the upcoming Trainium3 chip as the successor to Trainium2. This will be manufactured using a 3-nanometer process. Compared to its predecessor, it is said to be more energy-efficient and four times more powerful. This will allow customers to iterate models faster and use them in real time. Trainium3 is expected to be available in later versions of the UltraServer.\n\n(nie)"

Payments from the $323 million settlement will likely start going out to survivors early next year.\n\nWhatever money, or sense of empowerment, eventually comes to Levins, it won't match the emotional price exacted since a trusted family friend, a Franciscan brother based in Port Jefferson, sexually molested him and his two brothers in the mid 1970s.\n\n\"This entire process in a way has also revictimized myself and probably others because we had to relive this so many times,\" Levins, 63, told Newsday.\n\nWHAT NEWSDAY FOUND A $323 million settlement between 600 clergy sex abuse survivors and the Diocese of Rockville Centre has left some survivors both relieved but anguished by reliving the abuse.\n\n600 clergy sex abuse survivors and the Diocese of Rockville Centre has left some survivors both relieved but anguished by reliving the abuse.

But the agreement \"also gives them some measure of closure and an acknowledgment that the abuse actually occurred \u2026 which can be very empowering to them.\"\n\nJo Ponticello, a therapist based in New Jersey who has counseled clergy sex abuse survivors, said one of their biggest hurdles going through the settlement process is overcoming a deep sense of shame.\n\nAnd \"of course you carry shame because there are secrets,\" said Ponticello, a licensed clinical social worker.\n\nComing forward with those secrets can be excruciating.\n\n\"If you\u2019ve been carrying something for 20 years and you haven\u2019t really talked to anybody about it and then you have this opportunity to go and disclose because there is legal action that you really support, that\u2019s a pretty daunting task,\" she said.\n\nLevins said he never told anyone, even therapists, many of the details of his abuse until he confided in his lawyers during the recent Rockville Centre proceedings.\n\nIn an interview with Newsday this week, he recalled being 16 when he first met Antonucci, who had identified himself as a Franciscan monk, or brother.\n\nFrom trust to turmoil\n\nIn the late 1970s, Antonucci was working at Infant Jesus Roman Catholic Church in Port Jefferson, according to a lawsuit the Levins brothers filed against the diocese and the parish in 2019 under the New York State Child Victims Act. That lawsuit and 600 others were transferred to U.S. bankruptcy court after the diocese declared bankruptcy in 2020, and were part of Wednesday's settlement.\n\nA few weeks before Christmas in 1977, the Levins brothers' parents separated. At Infant Jesus, a priest suggested Antonucci could help the boys get through the turmoil, caused in part by their beloved father moving out of the family home in Shoreham, Levins said.\n\nAntonucci quickly became a regular there.\n\n\"We would look forward to him because he was a very cool priest,\" Levins said. \"He was funny, charming.\"\n\nOne night there was a big snowstorm, and the family expected Antonucci to cancel a dinner invitation.\n\n\"When the doorbell rang and he was there,\" Levins said, \"we were just overwhelmed that this guy cared enough to come out in a snowstorm.\"\n\nOver dinner, Antonucci told the Levins he ran a home for boys and needed money to cover operating expenses. Levins' mother, who could barely support the family, quickly wrote out a check for $600 \u2014 a lot of money in 1977, he said.\n\nAntonucci \"put that check in his pocket, then proceeded to assault her three sons,\" Levins said.\n\nBy around 9 p.m., Antonucci was talking to Levins\u2019 15-year-old brother, Thomas, as he was lifting weights in the living room. Robert, then 16, went to bed.\n\nLevins remembers being awakened at 4 a.m. Antonucci had one hand on Levins\u2019 face and held a candle with the other. The trusted family friend from the Catholic parish then molested him, Levins said.\n\nThe next morning over breakfast, the two older brothers quietly talked about that night \u2014 and Thomas confirmed that he too was sexually abused.\n\n\"He was a pro\" at grooming the brothers for abuse, Thomas Levins told Newsday. Of abusers, he added: \"They are masters of manipulation.\"\n\nThe Levins and their mother reported the abuse to the parish staff in Port Jefferson. As far as the Levins know, nothing ever happened. The Diocese of Rockville Centre did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA third brother abused\n\nDecades later, Robert Levins learned the abuse was not limited to him and Thomas. In 2019, Levins told his brother Sean that he was filing the lawsuit. Sean Levins in turn said he too had been molested by Antonucci.\n\n\"I was floored that he would do this to a child,\" Robert Levins said. \"How evil can you be to hurt a 6-year-old?\"\n\nSean Levins died last year of a brain aneurysm at age 54.\n\nThe damage done to Robert and Thomas Levins as teenagers sent their lives into a tailspin. Robert started drinking heavily and also taking drugs. With plummeting grades, Levins said he barely graduated from high school. He didn't bother applying to college.\n\nLevins hit rock bottom when Sean, who he still refers to as his \"baby brother,\" and saw him as a role model, also saw him intoxicated.\n\n\"I could see the disappointment in his eyes,\" Levins said. \"When I sobered up I finally broke and for the first time in years cried out to God. I needed help and I knew it. I was throwing my life away.\"\n\nA concerned friend of his mother's connected Levins with a pastor at the Full Gospel Tabernacle in East Setauket who counseled him for a year and eventually told him he had a calling to ministry. The pastor suggested Levins attend a Bible college in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.\n\nLevins did, and by the age of 25, and disillusioned by the Catholic Church, he had become an ordained minister in the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination.\n\n\"I\u2019ve kind of turned this nightmare in my life into something positive for somebody else,\" said Robert Levins, now a Pentecostal minister who counsels other survivors of clergy sex abuse. Credit: Photo courtesy Robert Levins\n\nHe said praying and becoming an ordained minister and spiritual leader to others changed, and most likely saved his life.\n\n\"Without God I would have lost my mind or become an alcoholic,\" Levins said. \"I was just sliding downhill so quickly. I decided that this is the way that I can help people.\"\n\nHe also had a gnawing sense that the pain of his past remained unresolved. So, several years ago, with the help of a private detective, Levins said he tracked down Antonucci and got him on the telephone. He needed to confront Antonucci and also make sure the man that had molested him and his brothers was far away from children.\n\nAntonucci\u2019s response was chilling, Levins said. He didn\u2019t deny the abuse but defended it, telling him he had done good work in his ministry.\n\nThomas Levins said Antonucci's sexual abuse left him depressed and his life in turmoil. His grades dropped in high school. A standout pitcher growing up, he had visions of playing baseball in college. His senior year in high school, Thomas Levins said, he didn't try out for the team.\n\n\"Your whole world gets shattered,\" he said.\n\nNow 62, and a carpenter in Pennsylvania, the middle Levins brother is married for the third time. He has trouble trusting people as he and his older brother continue to heal.\n\nRobert Levins over the decades has also helped other survivors of clergy abuse heal through his ministry in Pennsylvania, Florida, New Jersey and North Carolina where he now is based near Raleigh. He has counseled hundreds of survivors.\n\n\"I tell them all, we are not going to wipe clean the memory. This is never going to go away,\" he said. But you must \"manage it so it doesn\u2019t hold you prisoner for the rest of your life.\""

According to his arrest warrant, Thornburg confessed to the killings and admitted to sexually assaulting Phillips\u2019 corpse.\n\nIt also emerged that the killer had stored the remains of his victims in containers, which he later cleaned and returned to the shop. Prosecutor Amy Allin told jurors \u201cHe is evil\u201d.\n\nImage: CBS Texas) CBS Texas)\n\nFirefighters made the horrifying discovery after putting out a blaze in Fort Worth. After he was charged in December 2021, Thornburg told officers he felt compelled to carry out \"ritualistic sacrifices\", and had eaten his victim's heart along with some other body parts before they were burnt, the KDFW - a local Fox affiliate - reported.\n\nHe also confessed to officers that he had killed his roommate and girlfriend, according to his arrest warrant. Thornburg's roommate, Mark Jewell, 61, was found dead in a house fire earlier that year, while his girlfriend, Tanya Begay, from New Mexico, vanished after holidaying with him in Arizona back in 2017.\n\nIn a bizarre series of claims made to cops, the serial killer said he had in-depth knowledge of the Bible and was being called to \u201ccommit sacrifices\u201d.\n\nImage: CBS Texas) CBS Texas)\n\nThe 44-year-old said the acts were a \"human sacrifice to God\" as the court heard he attended a conference led by one of his victims, where he wrote on a worksheet that he wanted to be a Christian missionary to fulfil \"a sense of destiny that must be achieved\". His lawyers argued he should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nAccording to the probable cause affidavit, Thornburg believed that one of his three victims, David, \"needed to be sacrificed. He sliced David\u2019s throat and then cut him into pieces in the bathtub. Thornburg initially hid the remains in his room in trash bags before obtaining Rubbermaid type tubs to store them in.\u201d\n\nHis second victim, Maricruz Mathis, was killed two days later, with the suspect accused of dismembering her body and storing her remains in containers."

At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

As the nighttime scene unfolded near a Lea County oilfield, the observer reported feeling like the air was astir with a leaden static.\n\nVideos of these episodes of stargazing turning bizarre in a state known for enigmatic nighttime occurrences are among those catalogued by a popular UFO reporting platform and cellphone app operated by Enigma Labs. The company, founded in 2020, has issued a new report naming New Mexico its top state for sightings per capita, with several strange videos submitted this year showing lights over Albuquerque.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"New Mexico is a focal point for UFOs,\" said Alejandro Rojas, a consultant for Enigma Labs. \"But it's really interesting that New Mexico has really popped up in our data lately as being heads above the leader when it comes to submissions per person.\"\n\nThe data set comes as an obsession with unidentified flying objects continues nationwide, even after a congressionally mandated Pentagon report released in February found no evidence the federal government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and no evidence UFO sightings are signs of aliens visiting Earth.\n\nA Pentagon office, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, was created in 2022 to track what the government calls UAPs \u2014 unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 with 757 reported to the office between May and June of this year, according to a November report.\n\nStill, people continue to see things.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the fast-paced digital age, Enigma Labs provides an online trove of oddities \u2014 an endless proliferation of sights and sounds.\n\nThe private company offers a website and cellphone app allowing UFO enthusiasts \u2014 and regular people who believe they have encountered the anomalous \u2014 to upload videos and photos with descriptions, aggregating and crowdsourcing the data.\n\n\"Like millions of ants crawling around us,\" the individual who spotted something in Jal said in the Enigma post.\n\n\"I hate to say it. Those are ships!\" gushed a man who claimed he was witnessing alien plasma ships in Gallup near the Arizona border.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll told, the Land of Enchantment's rate of 12.2 Enigma entries per 100,000 people is far higher than the next closest states of Nevada and Arizona, which boast submission rates of around 9 per 100,000 residents, according to the company.\n\nUFO researchers have theories about the large volume of entries here, citing how alien mythology and lore have been woven into the state's cultural fabric for decades. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, 1,708 sightings have been reported in New Mexico, most of them since 2000.\n\n\"We have a relatively small population, but the one thing we do have, and I think this factors into your question, is a preponderance of military operations areas and scientific development areas \u2014 Los Alamos [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] \u2014 a rich history of sightings,\" said David Marler, a longtime UFO researcher who lives in the Albuquerque area and serves as the executive director of a new UFO records center in Rio Rancho.\n\nWhile the Roswell incident has long been a dominant talker, Marler said there are many other intriguing reports of encounters over the last 75 years in New Mexico: April 1964, Socorro; April 1964, La Madera; March 1950, Farmington; November 1957, Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA prevalent state for sightings\n\nEnigma Labs runs a New Mexico page that archives and cataloging sightings, rating and categorizing videos.\n\nAs of late November, the company had received 278 New Mexico sightings directly, according to an email from Rojas. Combined with publicly available sources, it has 3,531 total sightings in New Mexico archived.\n\n\"When you go back and look at early magazine reports and military reports going back to the 1950s, there were magazine articles showing maps where a lot of UFO sightings. One of the most prevalent states was New Mexico,\" Marler said.\n\nA fascination with the unknown has long gripped New Mexico. It's a state renowned \u2014 thanks to its dry climate, low population density and sprawling deserts \u2014 for its night sky viewing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"One of the most spectacular reports is from last August. A witness said they were watching TV when they caught this weird object out of the corner of their eye. They were able to get a few seconds of video before it disappeared behind nearby trees,\" Rojas said of video footage taken in Chaparral, a Southern New Mexico community near El Paso.\n\nThe video shows a floating gray object with a television heard in the background.\n\nNew Mexico sightings logged into the Enigma Labs database break down like this: Albuquerque, 754; Las Cruces, 159; Roswell, 143; Alamogordo, 107; and Deming, 95. Rojas said eight sightings have been reported to Enigma from Santa Fe and one in Los Alamos.\n\nTwo friends were driving along San Mateo Boulevard in Albuquerque late one night in February when a moving craft in the sky lit up with lights flashing in a diagonal pattern.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn an episode that lasted about a minute, \"it went from a long craft to a triangle shaped craft with only 3 lights, and then to something that resembled a helicopter with one light, and quickly disappeared,\" states the caption on the for the video posted to Enigma Lab's site.\n\nNew records center in Rio Rancho\n\nTens of thousands of case files, among the earliest dated in 1947, are housed in Rio Rancho. They relay the stories of witnesses, couched in the diction of reports written by law enforcement officers or members of the military as far back as 70 years ago.\n\nThe files can be pored over at the new National UFO Historical Records Center, a facility that recently opened and can be visited by appointment.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It's the largest historical archive ever assembled on the history of the subject in the history of the United States,\" said Marler, the director.\n\nThe volunteer-operated research center, at 1301 Nicklaus Drive SE, opened in October.\n\nIt holds rolls of decades-old microfilm, hundreds of thousands of audio recordings, an exhaustive library of foreign and domestic magazines, newsletters and periodicals \u2014 all dealing with reports of mysterious craft spotted from Earth. Some 2,000 books line the shelves, along with an interminable supply of UFO investigations and intrigue, with tales and testimony for those who believe.\n\n\"It's really set up for academics and for the general public who have a serious interest in the subject. It's not for the casual enthusiast per se,\" Marler said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe center has files from the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, records kept by the largest citizen organization in the U.S. devoted to cataloguing UFO reports from 1956 until 1980, the year the group published its final newsletter. The center is currently digitizing the files for the first time ever.\n\nAlso in its possession are collections from the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, once based in Alamogordo, with tens of thousands of case files \u2014 as well as collections from the UFO Research Committee of Akron, especially active in the 1950s in Ohio.\n\n\"We're literally getting these holdings in from all different points of the globe,\" Marler said.\n\nWell-documented cases beyond Roswell\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAcademics of unexplained phenomena have descended on the Land of Enchantment for a beloved UFO festival in Roswell. But the mythic narratives don't go dry there.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. That always dominates the conversation and there are better, more well-documented cases on file,\" Marler said, referring to the 1947 crash of a craft near the Southern New Mexico city. While many believe it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft, the federal government has said it was a secret military balloon aimed at detecting Soviet atomic bomb tests.\n\nMarler said many New Mexicans aren't aware of other cases within their own state.\n\nIn November of 1957, a UFO was tracked on radar and \"violated\" the perimeter of the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, hovering around restricted sites, according to reports Marler has reviewed. He said the Rio Rancho records center has the original case file on it from \"Project Blue Book,\" the Air Force name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969.\n\n\"Two Air Force personnel were observing it with binoculars at night. They described it as looking like a car standing vertically on end with a white light emanating out of the bottom. The object had the ability to hover, to rapidly accelerate, to move slowly,\" Marler said.\n\nThe Socorro incident in April 1964 \u2014 unresolved in the Air Force investigations that transpired at the time and widely reported by New Mexico news publications \u2014 was observed by local police Officer Lonnie Zamora, who claimed he witnessed two humanoids beside a shiny, egg-shaped object that later rose into the air from an arroyo as flames belched from the rising craft.\n\nMarler said he had believed the Socorro case was an isolated one. In the last year, however, he received the APRO files and came across an account published in the Santa Fe New Mexican of a similar report four days after the Socorro incident from La Madera, a remote community north of Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County.\n\n\"Eyewitness Recounts Passage of 'Thing' Burning in Sky,\" reads a headline in the April 28, 1964, edition of The New Mexican.\n\n\"It talks about Socorro, but it talks about a landing in La Madera ... and it described an egg-shaped object,\" Marler said. \"... New Mexico State Police [investigated and] drew a detailed diagram of the landing site and took pictures and colored photographs.\""

            "article_content": "By Amal Noureldin\n\nDriving through downtown Dallas, you might see a striking banner hanging at the U-turn bridge, near the Walnut Hill exit on Central Expressway (US 75): \u201cStop Fluoridation!\u201d Below it, other banners demand action and warn of supposed dangers.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time fluoride has been at the center of public debate.\n\nSince 1951, fluoride has been added to community water supplies in many countries to prevent tooth decay. Fluoridation started as an observation, then an idea that ended as a scientific revolution 50 years later.\n\nFluoridation is the controlled careful addition of a precise amount of fluoride to community water systems to enhance dental health, ensuring it remains safe without causing systemic health side effects.\n\nThe practice has been hailed as one of the \u201c10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nBut with Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a vocal opponent of fluoridation of water supplies, being tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, this progress is under threat.\n\nI am a clinical professor specializing in caries management, with over 30 years of experience in preventing and treating early decay. In my view, it is crucial to rely on evidence-based practices and research that have consistently shown fluoride to be a cornerstone of dental health, benefiting millions without adverse effects.\n\nFluoride in the water supply\n\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in water, soil and even certain foods. Its role in oral health was first recognized in the early 20th century when researchers observed lower rates of tooth decay in communities with naturally high levels of fluoride in their water.\n\nIn 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first city in the world to intentionally fluoridate its water supply. This decision came after thorough discussions with Dr H Trendley Dean, head of the dental hygiene unit at the National Institutes of Health at the time, and other public health organizations. The Michigan Department of Health approved adding fluoride to the public water supply the following year.\n\nThe city was chosen due to its low natural fluoride levels, a large population of school-age children, and proximity to Muskegon, which served as a control city. After 11 years, the results were remarkable: Cavity rates among children in Grand Rapids born after fluoridation began dropped by over 60%. This scientific breakthrough transformed dental care, turning tooth decay into a preventable condition for the first time in history.\n\nBy 2008, over 72% of the U.S. population \u2013 over 200 million Americans \u2013 using public water systems had access to fluoridated water.\n\nThis scientific breakthrough transformed dental care, turning tooth decay into a preventable condition for the first time in history.\n\nFluoride is naturally present in most water sources, but typically at concentrations too low to prevent tooth decay. By adjusting the fluoride level to the recommended 0.7 milligrams per liter, equivalent to about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, it becomes sufficient to strengthen tooth enamel.\n\nBenefits of fluoride for tooth health\n\nThe science is simple: Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel, the protective outer layer of teeth, by promoting remineralization. It also makes teeth more resistant to the acids produced by bacteria in the mouth. This helps prevent cavities, a problem that remains widespread even in modern societies.\n\nFluoridated water has been extensively studied, and its benefits are well documented. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, water fluoridation reduces cavities by about 25% across all age groups. It\u2019s a public health measure that works passively \u2013 every sip of water helps protect your teeth, without requiring you to change your behavior.\n\nThis is especially important for vulnerable populations. Low-income communities often face barriers to accessing dental care or fluoride products like toothpaste. By fluoridating water, communities provide a safety net, ensuring that everyone benefits regardless of their circumstances.\n\nEconomically, it\u2019s a smart investment. Research shows that for every dollar spent on fluoridation, communities save about $20 in dental treatment costs. These savings come from fewer fillings, extractions and emergency visits \u2013 expenses that disproportionately affect low-income communities.\n\nOpposition to fluoridation\n\nDespite its benefits, water fluoridation is not without controversy. Opponents often argue that it infringes on personal choice \u2013 after all, most people don\u2019t get to opt out of drinking community water. Others raise concerns about potential health risks, such as fluorosis, bone issues or thyroid problems.\n\nFluorosis, a condition caused by excessive fluoride exposure during childhood, is often cited as a reason for alarm. However, in most cases, it manifests as mild white spots on teeth and is not harmful. Severe fluorosis is rare in areas with regulated fluoride levels.\n\nWhat about other health risks? Decades of research, including large-scale reviews by expert panels from around the world as well as the World Health Organization, have found no credible evidence linking fluoridation to serious health problems when fluoride levels are kept within recommended limits. In fact, the fluoride concentration in drinking water is carefully monitored to balance safety and effectiveness.\n\nThe CDC oversees the monitoring of fluoride levels in community water systems across the United States. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency establishes a safety standard of 2 milligrams per liter to prevent mild or moderate dental fluorosis.\n\nStill, the debate continues, fueled by misinformation and mistrust in public health initiatives.\n\nIt\u2019s important to separate legitimate concerns from unfounded claims and rely on the overwhelming body of evidence supporting fluoridation\u2019s safety.\n\nFluoride alternatives\n\nFor those who prefer to avoid fluoride, there are alternatives to consider. But they come with challenges.\n\nFluoride-free toothpaste is one option, but it is less effective at preventing cavities compared with fluoride-containing products. Calcium-based treatments, like hydroxyapatite toothpaste, are gaining popularity as a fluoride alternative, though research on their effectiveness is still limited.\n\nDiet plays a crucial role too. Cutting back on sugary snacks and drinks can significantly reduce the risk of cavities. Incorporating foods like crunchy vegetables, cheese and yogurt into your diet can help promote oral health by stimulating saliva production and providing essential nutrients that strengthen tooth enamel.\n\nHowever, these lifestyle changes require consistent effort and education \u2013 something not all people or communities have access to.\n\nCommunity programs like dental sealant initiatives can also help, especially for children. Sealants are thin coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of teeth, preventing decay in high-risk areas. While effective, these programs are more resource-intensive and can\u2019t replicate the broad, passive benefits of water fluoridation.\n\nUltimately, alternatives exist, but they place a greater burden on people and might not address the needs of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nShould fluoridation be a personal choice?\n\nThe argument that water fluoridation takes away personal choice is one of the most persuasive stances against its use. Why not leave fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash, giving people the freedom to use it or not, some argue.\n\nThis perspective is understandable, but it overlooks the broader goals of public health. Fluoridation is like adding iodine to salt or vitamin D to milk. These are measures that prevent widespread health issues in a simple, cost-effective way. Such interventions aren\u2019t about imposing choices; they\u2019re about providing a baseline of protection for everyone.\n\nWithout fluoridated water, low-income communities would bear the brunt of increased dental disease. Children, in particular, would suffer more cavities, leading to pain, missed school days and costly treatments. Public health policies aim to prevent these outcomes while balancing individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nFor those who wish to avoid fluoride, alternatives like bottled or filtered water are available. At the same time, policymakers should continue to ensure that fluoridation levels are safe and effective, addressing concerns transparently to build trust.\n\nAs debates about fluoride continue, the main question is how to best protect everyone\u2019s oral health. While removing fluoride might appeal to those valuing personal choice, it risks undoing decades of progress against tooth decay.\n\nWhether through fluoridation or other methods, oral health remains a public health priority. Addressing it requires thoughtful, evidence-based solutions that ensure equity, safety and community well-being.\n\nAmal Noureldin is Clinical Professor of Cariology, Prevention and Restorative Dentistry, Texas A&M University.\n\nThe Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/water-fluoridation-helps-prevent-tooth-decay-how-growing-opposition-threatens-a-70-year-old-health-practice-230504\n\n\u00a9 The Conversation"
