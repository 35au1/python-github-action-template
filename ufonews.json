        "article_content": "The Pentagon has received hundreds of reports of new UFO sightings, including \u201cseveral particularly interesting cases,\u201d according to the director of the office that investigates these reports, but reiterated it found no evidence of alien activity.\n\nThe Pentagon, working with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and other government agencies, has received a total of 1,652 reports to date, according to the newly released annual report, including 757 new reports between May 2023 and June 2024. The growing number of new sightings represent an expanding effort from the US government to catalog, track and investigate what are officially called unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, especially since a number of the sightings are near military bases and national security facilities.\n\n\u201cReports of unidentified anomalous phenomenon, particularly near national security sites, must be treated seriously and investigated with scientific rigor by the US government,\u201d said Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\nThe topic of UAPs has garnered tremendous public attention, fueled in part by its inextricable link to UFO sightings and conspiracy theories about the US government hiding evidence of aliens.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\u201d said Kosloski. \u201cNone of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies.\u201d\n\nOf the new reports AARO has received, nearly 50 have already been closed as everyday items, such as balloons, birds or drones, according to the annual report, while another 243 cases of apparently common items are pending final review. A total of 444 new reports were filed into an active archive of cases because of a lack of data or evidence that would allow investigators to determine their origin.\n\nNone of these closed cases were the result of foreign adversaries or a breakthrough in advanced technologies, AARO said in their report.\n\nBut the remaining 21 cases have not yet been plausibly explained, requiring additional data and analysis. Kosloski said some of these were \u201cinteresting cases that I - my physics and engineering background, and time in the (intelligence community) - I do not understand, and I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either.\u201d\n\nKosloski said the cases, which occurred mostly over the last 18 months, consisted of different shapes, including \u201corbs, cylinders, (and) triangles.\u201d One of these cases occurred \u201cover an extended period of time\u201d with the potential for \u201cmultiple things happening,\u201d such as drones being confused with UAP activity.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nNordstrom is attempting to streamline the holiday shopping experience with a refreshed mobile app that leverages generative artificial intelligence, per a press release\n\nNewly introduced trend reports rely on expertise from Nordstrom stylists and generative AI to deliver relevant trends. Other features include an improved search experience, personalized recommendations and a Style Swipes tool.\n\nAlso part of the retailer\u2019s strategy will be an immersive installation on Nov. 27 entitled \u201cThe Blizz on 57th Street\u201d that will transform its flagship New York City location into a festive visual spectacle. The move from Nordstrom comes as other brands similarly build out their app experiences.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs generative AI grows in popularity, Nordstrom joins a handful of marketers incorporating the buzzy tech into their apps, including by offering deeper customization. AI could present a new opportunity for app developers by assisting with the product development tasks behind personalized experiences and regular app updates.\n\nThe enhancements to Nordstrom\u2019s app are intended to bring the experience of in-person shopping to the online space. Included in the refresh is a new look and feel for the app\u2019s homepage. Along with the trend reports feature is Style Swipes, a tool which makes product recommendations to consumers based on their habits and preferences. As consumers interact with the app, their experience will become more personalized through enhanced learning features, per release details.\n\nFor those who would still prefer to interact with a person, customers can also request a personal look from a stylist or schedule an appointment to visit in-store directly from the app. A holiday gift hub includes curated lists meant to streamline the shopping experience.\n\nThe app release is the cornerstone of the retailer\u2019s holiday strategy, which will also include an immersive installation at Nordstrom\u2019s flagship New York City location. The Nov. 27 takeover will include a cast of larger-than-life inflatable characters voiced by filmmaker and actor John Waters and actress Fran Drescher. The inflatables are inspired by fictional New York City staples, according to release details.\n\nNordstrom\u2019s revamped app is the latest in a slew of recent app updates from a variety of brands. Last month, Revolve Group, parent of fashion brands Revolve and FWRD, launched a new mobile fashion game that puts players in the mode of a stylist searching collections for the perfect outfits. Meanwhile, QSR chains Burger King and Chick-fil-A recently launched new app experiences that include more functionality and content offerings."

That's certainly the case of Poinsett Bridge, the oldest bridge in the state which also happens to be visually stunning. You'll find it in the northern mountains of Greenville County, near Landrum. It's a bit off the beaten path but it's well worth the adventure to witness this stunning slice of history.\n\nThe Poinsett Bridge was built in the 1820s and is therefore not only the oldest bridge of its kind in South Carolina; it's also among the oldest in the entire southeast. The bridge's design is attributed to Robert Mills, a dedicated South Carolina resident credited with other iconic landmarks including the U.S. Treasury Building and even the Washington Monument. He also designed the Greenville Courthouse, whose Gothic windows mirror the stone bridge's iconic archway.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo why was the Poinsett Bridge built? It was a crucial part of the State Road, which connected South Carolina to the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee. There were three bridges constructed at the time. Poinsett Bridge was built over Little Gap Creek and the other two were built over North Saluda River and Hodge\u2019s Creek. Today, Poinsett Bridge is the only one that remains.\n\nThe bridge was named for Joel Poinsett, who was the president of South Carolina's Board of Public Works at the time. Poinsett is also significant for his role as the first U.S. ambassador to Mexico and was responsible for bringing a certain flowering plant to the U.S., now known as the Poinsettia.\n\nToday, the bridge is visited by history enthusiasts and even some paranormal investigators. Those who have visited the bridge after sunset report some eerie, unexplainable phenomena. Local legend tells the tale of a local worker who contracted malaria while working on the bridge. His body is believed to be buried under the bridge\u2014though this claim has never been proven. Another more lighthearted story is that the ghosts of two Irishmen frequently visit the bridge because they are so pleased with their handiwork.\n\nParanormal or not, there's no denying the allure of this landmark. Standing at the bridge, you can imagine what it must have been like to travel over two centuries ago. Today, the bridge is owned by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. It continues to be assessed to pinpoint the best structural engineering so that it can continue to be enjoyed by visitors and locals alike.\n\nHave you ever visited the Poinsett Bridge in South Carolina? Be sure to share this article with someone you'd like to go exploring with! We've outlined some other adventures for you, too; check out this list of the most incredible man-made wonders in South Carolina."

My partner and I receive printed publications on a monthly basis and also follow curated newsletters.\n\nVideos by TravelAwaits\n\nNew Scientist, which has been around since 1956, is a well-known publication in our household.\n\nI read New Scientist articles and studies to stay updated on a wide range of topics, from AI to rising temperatures to bathroom tiles that mathematicians love. The latter is a great example of the type of casual, science-centric content the publication focuses on.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not all dry and boring.\n\nIn fact, New Scientist wants to do a lot more than educate you on the latest innovations and discoveries. The company also wants to transport you and other like-minded travelers even closer to the frontiers of our world\u2019s most impactful scientific research.\n\nAnd how is it doing that? One of the latest ways that New Scientist engages with its readers is through its highly tailored Discovery Tours programs.\n\nLike the title suggests, these curated trips zero in on science and research projects happening around the globe.\n\nBest of all, science buffs like you (and me) can join them easily. Caught your interest? Here\u2019s what you need to know about New Scientist Discovery Tours.\n\nInside New Scientist Discovery Tours\n\nThe premise here is simple. Science nerds (I say that lovingly) with an overlapping interest in travel can shop around for highly specialized and expertly organized trips.\n\nYou can shop around for tours that run a massive gamut\u2014from solar eclipses to polar bear expeditions to monarch butterfly migrations.\n\nSeriously, you can get lost looking into the dozens and dozens of tours available.\n\nEach is headed by a group of experts who have ample experience in scientific fields and research.

        "article_content": "A quirk in scientific 3D modeling has led to the discovery that laser light can \u2014 under the right circumstances \u2014 cast its own shadow.\n\nThe finding challenges our current understanding of what a shadow is, researchers wrote in a new paper published Nov. 14 in the journal Optica .\n\n\"Laser light casting a shadow was previously thought impossible since light usually passes through other light without interacting,\" study co-author Raphael Abrahao , a physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, said in a statement . \"Our demonstration of a very counter-intuitive optical effect invites us to reconsider our notion of shadow.\"\n\nImagine shining two flashlight beams through each other \u2014 neither one blocks the other. However, some 3D computer models of laser systems depict the laser beam as a cylinder. Those models give the simulated laser beam its own shadow because they treat it as a solid object instead of a ray of light. During a lunchtime conversation about this quirk of the modeling system, some of the scientists wondered whether they could replicate the phenomenon with a real beam.\n\nRelated: World's most powerful X-ray laser set for massive upgrade that will help us better understand the atomic world\n\n\"\"What started as a funny discussion over lunch led to a conversation on the physics of lasers and the nonlinear optical response of materials,\"\" Abrahao said in the statement. \"From there, we decided to conduct an experiment to demonstrate the shadow of a laser beam.\"\n\n(Image credit: Abrahao et al.)\n\nThe researchers set up an experiment with a ruby crystal, a popular material for studying unusual properties of light. They directed a green laser and a blue laser into the ruby at right angles to each other. On a screen opposite the blue laser, they saw a dark line where the green laser blocked blue light leaving the crystal.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThis curious phenomenon arises from a property of the ruby itself. When the green laser encounters atoms along its path through the crystal, it gives the electrons in those atoms a bit of extra energy. In their high-energy state, those electrons can absorb blue light from the second laser. The green laser beam thus behaves like an object, blocking the blue light and casting a dark line across the screen.\n\nThat dark line meets all the criteria for a shadow: it was visible by eye, it took the shape of an object blocking illumination and it moved as the researchers moved the green laser.\n\nThe scientists also found that they could tune the intensity of the green laser to create a darker or lighter shadow. The maximum contrast between illuminated and shadowed areas on the screen was about 22%, similar to the contrast of a tree's shadow on a sunny day.\n\n\"\"This discovery expands our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens up new possibilities for utilizing light in ways we hadn't considered before,\"\" Abrahao said in the statement.\n\nThis finding could prove useful in various fields, Abrahao added. One example is optical switching in devices that rely on light to control the presence of another light, or in technologies that require precise control of light transmission, such as high-powered lasers."

The coral measured 112 feet wide, 105 feet long and 18 feet high with a circumference of more than 600 feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Just when you think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" Enric Sala, National Geographic Explorer in Residence and founder of Pristine Seas, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a significant scientific discovery, like finding the world's tallest tree. But there is cause for alarm. Despite its remote location, this coral is not safe from global warming and other human threats.\"\n\nCoral is a living organism made up of a complex network of coral polyps, tiny individual creatures. Coral reefs, however, are made up of many colonies of corals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists said the newly discovered coral is so large that it can be seen from space and looks more like a huge rock lurking just under the ocean. The discovery comes as concerns continue over dying coral reefs around the world because of climate change.\n\n\"The ocean provides for our livelihoods and has contributed so much to our national economy and communities,\" Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele, told National Geographic. \"Our survival depends on healthy coral reefs, so this exciting discovery underlines the importance of protecting and sustaining them for future generations.\""

        "article_content": "Every day, NASA\u2019s satellites orbit Earth, capturing a wealth of information that helps us understand our planet. From monitoring wildfires to tracking climate change, this vast trove of Earth Science data has the potential to drive scientific discoveries, inform policy decisions and support industries like agriculture, urban planning and disaster response.\n\nBut navigating the over 100 petabytes of collected data can be challenging, which is why NASA has collaborated with Microsoft to explore the use of a custom copilot using Azure OpenAI Service to develop NASA\u2019s Earth Copilot, which could transform how people interact with Earth\u2019s data.\n\nGeospatial data is complex, and often requires some level of technical expertise to navigate it. As a result, this data tends to be accessible only to a limited number of researchers and scientists. As NASA collects more data from new satellites, these complexities only grow and may further limit the potential pool of people able to draw insights and develop applications that could benefit society.\n\nRecognizing this challenge, NASA embarked on a mission to make its data more accessible and user-friendly. Through NASA\u2019s Office of the Chief Science Data Officer, the agency seeks to democratize data access, breaking down technical barriers to empower a diverse range of audiences, from scientists and educators to policymakers and the general public.\n\nYouTube Video Click here to load media\n\nThe challenge: Navigating the complexity of data\n\nNASA\u2019s Earth Science Data Systems Program is responsible for collecting an incredible variety of data from spaceborne sensors and instruments. This data spans everything from atmospheric conditions to land cover changes, ocean temperatures and more. However, the sheer scale and complexity of this information can be overwhelming. For many, finding and extracting insights requires navigating technical interfaces, understanding data formats and mastering the intricacies of geospatial analysis \u2014 specialized skills that very few non-technical users possess. AI could streamline this process, reducing time to gain insights from Earth\u2019s data to a matter of seconds.\n\nThis issue isn\u2019t just a matter of convenience; it has real-world implications. For example, scientists who need to analyze historical data on hurricanes to improve predictive models, or policymakers who want to study deforestation patterns to implement environmental regulations, may find themselves unable to easily access the data they need. This inaccessibility affects a broad array of sectors, including agriculture, urban planning and disaster response, where timely insights from spaceborne data could make a significant difference.\n\nMoreover, as new satellites with new instruments continue to launch and collect more data, NASA is constantly faced with the challenge of building new tools to manage and make sense of this growing repository. The agency explored emerging technologies that could not only streamline data discovery but also broaden accessibility, enabling more people to engage with the data and uncover new insights.\n\nThe solution: AI-powered data access through Microsoft Azure\n\nTo address these challenges, NASA IMPACT worked with Microsoft to develop an AI-driven customer copilot, called Earth Copilot, which could simplify data access and encourage a wider range of users to interact with its Earth Science data. Together, they built the proof of concept AI model that leverages Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform and advanced AI capabilities to transform how users can search, discover and analyze NASA\u2019s geospatial data.\n\nThe key to NASA\u2019s Earth Copilot lies in the integration of cloud-based technologies like Azure OpenAI Service, which provides access to powerful AI models and natural language processing capabilities that enable developers to integrate intelligent, conversational AI into their applications. This approach allows NASA to integrate AI into its existing data analysis platform \u2014 VEDA. These technologies together make it easier for users to search, discover and analyze Earth Science data\n\nBy combining these technologies, Earth Copilot enables users to interact with NASA\u2019s data repository through plain language queries. Instead, they can simply ask questions such as \u201cWhat was the impact of Hurricane Ian in Sanibel Island?\u201d or \u201cHow did the COVID-19 pandemic affect air quality in the US?\u201d AI will then retrieve relevant datasets, making the process seamless and intuitive.\n\n\u201cAzure\u2019s robust suite of services, including machine learning, data analytics and scalable cloud infrastructure, powers this AI prototype,\u201d said Juan Carlos L\u00f3pez, former NASA engineer and current Azure Specialist at Microsoft. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed the system to handle complex queries and large datasets efficiently, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need without getting bogged down by technical complexities. Our goal was to create a seamless, scalable solution that could evolve as NASA\u2019s data, tools and applications grow.\u201d\n\nDemocratizing data for open science\n\nThe collaboration between NASA IMPACT and Microsoft has resulted in a solution that democratizes access to spaceborne data, enabling a broader range of users to engage with NASA\u2019s science data. This has significant benefits for the scientific community, as researchers can now spend less time on data retrieval and more on analysis and discovery. For example, climate scientists can quickly access historical data to study trends, while agricultural experts can gain insights into soil moisture levels to improve crop management.\n\nEducators and teachers can use real-world examples to engage students in Earth Science, fostering curiosity and encouraging the next generation of scientists and engineers. Policymakers can leverage the data to make informed decisions on critical issues like climate change, urban development and disaster preparedness, ensuring they have the most accurate information at their fingertips.\n\n\u201cThe vision behind this collaboration was to leverage AI and cloud technologies to bring Earth\u2019s insights to communities that have been underserved, where access to data can lead to tangible improvements,\u201d said Minh Nguyen, Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. \u201cBy enabling users to interact with the data through simple, plain language queries, we\u2019re helping to democratize access to spaceborne information.\u201d\n\nThe development of this AI prototype aligns with NASA\u2019s Open Science initiative, which aims to make scientific research more transparent, inclusive and collaborative. By removing barriers to data discovery, NASA and Microsoft are setting the stage for a new era of discovery, where insights are not confined to a select few but can be explored and expanded by anyone curious about the world.\n\nLooking ahead: Bridging the gap between data and insights\n\nAt the moment, the NASA Earth Copilot is available to NASA scientists and researchers to explore and test its capabilities. Any responsible deployment of AI technologies requires rigorous assessments to ensure the data and outputs cannot be misused. After a period of internal evaluations and testing, the NASA IMPACT team will explore the integration of this capability into the VEDA platform.\n\nThis collaboration exemplifies how technology can empower people, drive innovation and create positive change. Solutions like this will be essential in ensuring the benefits of data are shared widely, enabling more people to engage with, analyze and act upon information that shapes our world.\n\nTags: AI, Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot, Microsoft Azure"

        "article_content": "Everyone is talking about e-readers again, and it\u2019s because Amazon recently released a whole new bunch of Kindles. Of the new releases, one stands apart as something new for Amazon: The Kindle Colorsoft is the company\u2019s first attempt at a color e-ink display, and it replaces the long-forgotten Kindle Oasis as Amazon\u2019s new flagship e-reader device. At $280, it\u2019s certainly an expensive piece of kit \u2014 especially if you consider the basic Kindle costs almost a third of that. But it\u2019s quite simply the most advanced Kindle that Amazon has ever made.\n\nSo, does that mean you should buy it immediately? Absolutely not; I want you to buy something else instead.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAmazon was late to the party. Other manufacturers have been doing this whole \u201ccolor e-ink\u201d thing for a lot longer, and frankly, they\u2019re doing it better. Don\u2019t buy the Kindle Colorsoft; buy the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 instead.\n\nWhat makes the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 so special\n\nWe\u2019re no strangers to the Boox Go Color 7. In fact, our own Nadeem Sarwar took the original black version out for a spin in July. He loved it, pronouncing it the best Kindle alternative he\u2019d ever used. I have to admit, after using the fetching new white variant, he\u2019s absolutely on the money.\n\nThe key to the e-reader\u2019s success in his eyes, and increasingly in mine too, is the operating system. Unlike a Kindle, which uses a \u201cforked\u201d version of Android that basically just runs Amazon\u2019s software and nothing else, the Boox Go Color 7 runs a full Android 12 install. That means it has more in common with an Android tablet than an Amazon e-reader, with access to not only Onyx\u2019s e-reading platform, but the Google Play Store too. Yes, that same Google Play Store you\u2019ll find on your Android smartphone or tablet is available here, and it means you can download the same apps you use on your other devices.\n\nYou might assume that means it doesn\u2019t run much other than the most basic of apps, but you\u2019d be wrong. While traditional benchmarking software seems to be beyond its modest capabilities, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 nestled inside the plastic shell is actually surprisingly powerful. It ran Balatro just fine, without the processor struggling or giving any indication it wasn\u2019t up to the task.\n\nDoes that mean it\u2019s basically a tablet, then? Well, no. It ran Balatro, sure \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t great. While the processor was up to the task, the screen\u2019s refresh rate really wasn\u2019t, and the game looked a little bit like it was trudging through mud. Even with the card\u2019s gentle swaying motion turned off, it wasn\u2019t always easy to see what was going on while the game was in motion, and while it was playable, it wasn\u2019t a game I revisited on the Go Color 7.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter, because the Go Color 7 isn\u2019t meant to play Balatro. No, it\u2019s meant to read pretty much anything.\n\nYou can read anything\n\nThe Boox Go Color 7 has its own reader app and its own store for buying e-books, and by most accounts, it functions pretty well. I can\u2019t tell you from firsthand experience because, well, I didn\u2019t use it very much. And that\u2019s because I had access to the Google Play Store.\n\nAccess to the Google Play Store is a big deal for any e-reader. Amazon\u2019s walled garden means the Kindle is sleek and fast \u2014 but walls are still walls. The Go Color 7 has no such barriers.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you have e-books spread all over the place. You\u2019ve bought e-books from Amazon, there\u2019s that Humble Bundle you bought, that free e-book on Google Play Books \u2014 not to mention your dalliance with Barnes & Noble, back from your very first Nook e-reader.\n\nSo unless you\u2019re way more loyal to a single brand than me, you\u2019ve probably got a treasure trove of e-books spread around. I\u2019m an old hand at this now, so I know you can send books to the Amazon Kindle \u2014 but doing so can be a bit of a pain. Not so on the Go Color 7. Install the app, sign in, and you\u2019re ready to go.\n\nI\u2019ve been merrily book-hopping between apps for the better part of the last few weeks, and it has been delightful. No longer tethered to Amazon, I\u2019m free to explore where I want.\n\nThis extends over to other apps as well. I\u2019m a longtime manga reader, and the Go Color 7 is perfect for reading in the Shonen Jump app. I\u2019m not much of a comic guy, but I loaded a few up through the Kindle app, and they look great. The limitations of the e-ink display mean it\u2019s not as clear or crisp as it might be on my phone, but there\u2019s a beauty to the slightly washed-out colors and delicate grain. It\u2019s more like reading an actual comic than any other digital method, and that means I actually prefer it.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but that\u2019s why I love it\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, there are two types of smart devices; polished and refined ones, and buggy but charismatic ones. In Star Wars terms \u2014 because I can\u2019t do anything without relating it back to Star Wars \u2014 it\u2019s the difference between an Imperial Star Destroyer and the Millennium Falcon.\n\nThe Amazon Kindle is an Imperial Star Destroyer. It\u2019s backed by a massive organization, it\u2019s sleek and no-nonsense, and it\u2019s incredibly good at what it does. That\u2019s a good thing, obviously, but one Star Destroyer is much like another, and that also applies to Kindles. My Kindle Paperwhite is fantastic, but it\u2019s very much a plastic slab with no personality. I\u2019ve had it for years, but I\u2019m not particularly attached to it because it lacks charisma.\n\nBut the Boox Go Color 7 has charisma. It has it in spades \u2014 and it\u2019s because it\u2019s flawed.\n\nThat sounds strange, but I promise you it makes sense. Consider my example from earlier. What is it you remember most about the Millennium Falcon? It\u2019s certainly not that it worked flawlessly. No, it\u2019s that it had problems. The hyperdrive was peerlessly fast, but it was wonky. Sometimes she needed a bonk on the control panel to start up, but when she got going, she could outfly any Imperial bucket.\n\nThe Falcon\u2019s character was strong \u2014 so strong that I slipped into calling it a \u201cshe\u201d without thinking. And that\u2019s because charisma can be created by lovable flaws. Because the Kindle is so good, it doesn\u2019t leave much of an impression. It just works, to borrow a phrase, and that\u2019s sometimes a detriment.\n\nThe Boox Go Color 7 is an incredibly capable machine. But it has more than its share of problems. It\u2019s prone to ghosting. A lot of ghosting; certainly more than you\u2019re used to if you\u2019ve used Kindles. You can fine-tune how the display works to lessen this, but it never really fully goes away. The screen rotation also isn\u2019t great, and the color is a little washed-out. While it has a built-in speaker, it\u2019s difficult to use apps like Audible, because the speaker won\u2019t continue playing with the screen off. You can keep the screen open, but eventually it\u2019ll time out and playback will stop.\n\nIt\u2019s flawed in a way that I\u2019ve never found a Kindle to be, but I find myself loving it all the same. So, while those flaws are definitely present, they aren\u2019t bad enough to ruin the device. Instead, they bring my attention back to the Boox Go Color 7 in a way that\u2019s slowly increased my affection for it. It\u2019s an odd thing to admit, but I actually like the e-reader because it isn\u2019t as flawless as a Kindle.\n\nI might not feel this way if it only offered as much as a Kindle did \u2014 but because it offers way more than Amazon\u2019s e-reader ever has, I love it despite its flaws. In the same way Han Solo felt a connection to the Millennium Falcon because of the struggles they\u2019d been through together, I feel a stronger connection to this e-reader.\n\nIs the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 a Kindle killer?\n\nIt\u2019s time for the big question: Should the Boox Go Color 7 replace your Kindle? Well, that\u2019s a complicated question. The basic Kindle has a big edge in pricing, and I\u2019m not about to argue that anyone looking to buy a $100 Kindle should instead spend almost three-times that amount for the Go Color 7. The same applies to the Kindle Paperwhite, which also includes waterproofing for a much lower price.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what I came here to argue; at the price of $250, the Go Color 7 is a full $30 cheaper than the Kindle Colorsoft. And sure, it doesn\u2019t have waterproofing, and it doesn\u2019t have the casual slickness of Amazon\u2019s software \u2014 but it has everything else, and it\u2019s a darn good e-reader in its own right. Access to the Google Play Store is a major game changer, as it means the Go Color 7 is a universal e-reader in a way the Kindle simply isn\u2019t. If you only own e-books through Amazon, and don\u2019t read comics or manga through their own apps, then the Kindle Colorsoft is definitely still a good option.\n\nBut at $30 less, with access to all the e-reading apps you could ever need, and its own store and reader besides, the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 is a hard prospect to pass up. Even if you do have to live with some bugs, it\u2019s simply one of the best value propositions around."
