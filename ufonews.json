            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 explores the reality behind the supposed existence of extraterrestrial beings through the alleged experiences of several former and retired US Army officials, including Jason Sands. The UFO whistleblower served in the Air Force as a master sergeant before concluding his career in 2007. As per reports, he is also one of the numerous individuals who have spoken to former intelligence official and whistleblower David Grusch about allegedly encountering UFOs. Jason\u2019s claims have shaken the online communities and platforms that study UAPs. Interestingly, his experience of allegedly meeting an alien, as he revealed in the documentary, forms one of the most detailed and vivid accounts delivered by a whistleblower in recent times! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nJason Sands Served 22 Years in the Air Force\n\nJason Sands joined the US Air Force in 1985. His discharge/release certificate states that his primary specialties were electronic system security assessment and aircraft structural maintenance. However, after emerging as a UFO whistleblower, he claimed that he was part of several top-secret programs within the Air Force. In an interview given in April 2024, he alleged that one of his duties concerned understanding technology captured from non-human intelligence (NHI). He further added that he was a member of the \u201cRed Team,\u201d which was committed to monitoring exchanges between scientists, which apparently concerned numerous alien races at times. Despite these claims, there isn\u2019t any evidence in the public domain to prove that he was part of any missions that targeted extraterrestrial activity.\n\nJason\u2019s life supposedly turned around in 1994 when he allegedly met an extraterrestrial being while driving through the Nellis Air Force Base Complex in Nevada. As detailed in \u2018The Program,\u2019 he witnessed the apparent entity disappearing from Earth in a peculiar-looking craft. He shared this unverified experience with the documentarian James Fox, paving the way for his inclusion in the project. After meeting the former Air Force officer, the filmmaker investigated the claims and details concerning his tenure, only to be convinced about his credibility. After collaborating with Jason on the documentary, Fox accidentally revealed the former\u2019s identity, only for him to emerge as a whistleblower.\n\nJason Sands\u2019 Allegations and Claims Are Highly Contested\n\nJason Sands has been a significant presence in the online UFO research community since April 2024. He garnered immense attention with his claim of meeting an alien in 1994 and being part of several secret government programs. In an interview, he reportedly said he joined a UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomenon) task force forum in 2021 to contribute his supposed knowledge concerning \u201cblack projects.\u201d Even though many have accepted him and his words, several others have approached the same with critical eyes. After Jason released his Air Force release/discharge certificate in April 2024, a former UFO enthusiast raised suspicions concerning his alleged involvement in extraterrestrial research, which are not indicated in the \u201cproof\u201d he shared.\n\nFurthermore, in an interview with Spaced Out Radio in April 2024, Jason claimed he was \u201cforced to serve\u201d in the \u201c20 and Back Program.\u201d As per reports, it was described as a program in which participants spent 20 years in a Secret Space Program (SSP) to interact with extraterrestrial beings and visit military bases across the solar system. In 2022, a whistleblower named Corey Goode admitted that he fabricated the entire program to take advantage of his fans financially. Jason\u2019s alleged involvement in a fictional program turned numerous UFO enthusiasts against him, forcing him to describe the whole ordeal as a misunderstanding. He stated in April 2024 that \u201c20 and Back\u201d was an \u201cexperience\u201d for him rather than one official program.\n\nSimilarly, Jason\u2019s claim that he heard scientists discussing multiple alien races has also been scrutinized. In March 2024, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense published a report about the US government\u2019s involvement with UAP. The same offers insights about test and evaluation units with a nickname with \u2018alien\u2019 connotations, which can be what Jason apparently heard as an alleged member of the \u201cRed Team.\u201d\n\nJason Sands is Involved in the UAP Discourse While Working as a Consultant Today\n\nAs discussions and debates concerning Jason Sands\u2019 claims and allegations grow, he has been working as an independent consultant for the Department of Defense since August 2024. The whistleblower is currently based in Gaithersburg, a city in Montgomery County, Maryland. While he remains a popular figure in the UFO research community, he has chosen to keep his family away from the spotlight, which is understandable considering the scrutiny he faces day after day. The backlash he deals with has only increased following his inclusion in James Fox\u2019s \u2018The Program.\u2019 The recent reactions against Jason can be traced back to an interview he gave to Post Disclosure World, a YouTube channel dedicated to UFO news, in December 2024.\n\nWhen asked about his experiences as an Air Force officer, Jason alleged that he was forced to do some \u201cdirty work,\u201d which mainly involved killing \u201cNHI,\u201d also known as non-human intelligence. He went on to explain that he had to do it because he was informed that \u201cbad things\u201d would happen to him or his family if he didn\u2019t comply. The online UFO research community immensely scrutinized the whistleblower\u2019s \u201calien assassin\u201d claim. The credibility he garnered since his emergence as a first-hand witness of alleged alien existence was severely affected within a day. Even James Fox, who initially backed Jason, expressed his disbelief.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely devastates his credibility. But I still believe that encounter may have happened based on the background digging I did, but yeah, that\u2019s not good for his credibility,\u201d Fox shared. Irrespective of the backlash Jason continues to receive, he remains a sensational figure when it comes to alien discourse. Since April 2024, he has given numerous interviews and appeared on several podcasts to explain his claims. He is also one of the advocates of a comprehensive Congressional investigation into UAP within the jurisdiction of the US government. As \u2018The Program\u2019 sheds light on the possible existence of extraterrestrial beings, we can look forward to more clarity concerning Jason\u2019s credibility and his claims\u2019 authenticity.\n\nRead More: Lee Speigel Tribute on The Program: Who Was He?

            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 ends with a dedication to Lee Speigel. Lee was one of the most reputed and influential journalists who specialized in the UFO and paranormal study for over half a century. He grew up in Concord, New Hampshire, inspired by the Apollo space missions, which ignited his interest in UFOs and several other unexplainable phenomena. In the early 1970s, he found a second home in New York City, where he fed his interest in extraterrestrial life with whatever he could find on the subject. Lee\u2019s contributions to UFO research are not only exceptional but also unparalleled.\n\nLee Speigel Was a Pioneer UFO Researcher\n\nAfter establishing himself in New York City by the early 1970s, it didn\u2019t take long for Lee Speigel to leave an impression on his peers. His obsession with alleged UFO sightings and witness stories prepared him to conceive CBS\u2019 documentary record album \u2018UFOs: The Credibility Factor.\u2019 In 1978, he made his presence known in the world of extraterrestrial research by organizing the United Nations\u2019 first-ever meeting on UFOs. The participants of the conference ranged from military personnel to scientific experts, in addition to the UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. In the late 1970s, Lee collaborated with Richard Belzer to give birth and run \u2018Edge of Reality\u2019 for NBC Radio.\n\n\u2018Edge of Reality\u2019 gradually became a highlight of Lee\u2019s radio career. He produced around 1,500 hours of the program, which featured eminent figures such as \u2018Star Trek\u2019 stars Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner. During this period, his collaborations grew. Lee even interacted with Stephen Spielberg while the latter was developing \u2018Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u2019 and \u2018E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\u2019 In addition to the filmmaker, the renowned journalist Robin Leach spent time with the UFO enthusiast, specifically to go for \u201cUFO hunting.\u201d In the late 1990s, a while after the conclusion of \u2018Edge of Reality,\u2019 Lee ended up in ABC Radio Networks.\n\nAfter a short stint at ABC News as a copy editor, Lee joined AOL News in 2010 to write about inexplicable phenomena. The freelance position was a precursor to his appointment as a full-time reporter of The Huffington Post, presently known as HuffPost, in 2011. It didn\u2019t take long for him to find his footing in his new workplace since he won the 2012 International UFO Congress Researcher of the Year Award. As the years passed, even though the workplaces changed, his focus remained the same. He delved deep into UFOs, this time with astronauts such as Edgar Mitchell, Alan Bean, and Leroy Chiao.\n\nLee Speigel Collaborated With James Fox and Several UFO Investigators\n\nIn his late years, Lee Speigel was as busy as ever with several commitments. He restarted hosting \u2018Edge of Reality\u2019 after reviving the radio show for UN-X Digital Broadcast Network. During his time at The Huffington Post, the topics he explored ranged from mythical creatures such as the yeti to the specifics of \u201calien sex.\u201d His remarkable articles were not the only things that left his colleagues in bewilderment. During an editorial meeting, he claimed to be committed to exposing a multinational conspiracy mounted to conceal a spacecraft\u2019s crash-landing. This example explains why Buck Wolf, the director of HuffPost Trends and one of Lee\u2019s longtime colleagues, saw him as a showman in the newsroom.\n\nFurthermore, James Fox didn\u2019t dedicate \u2018The Program\u2019 to Lee for no reason. The latter co-wrote and co-produced the filmmaker\u2019s 2020 documentary \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which explores unidentified aerial phenomena through the words of high-ranking government officials. One of Lee\u2019s final assignments was assisting Marc Hartzman in writing \u2018We Are Not Alone,\u2019 a comprehensive investigation into UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence. In addition to these works, he is featured in several media productions such as History Channel\u2019s \u2018Unsealed: Alien Files,\u2019 H2\u2019s \u2018Hangar 1: The UFO Files,\u2019 and the TV movie \u2018UFO Coverups: Secrets Revealed.\u2019\n\nLee Speigel Passed Away at the Age of 74\n\nLee Speigel passed away in August 2023 at the age of 74 after battling esophageal cancer. He is survived by his wife, Lorraine Simone. Following his passing, the friends and family of the journalist were adamant about bidding adieu to him in a way that honored his life and contributions. They raised over $10,000 to send his cremated ashes into space with the help of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \u201cAnyone who knew Lee knows he wanted to get into space somehow [\u2026]. I\u2019m sure Lee is somewhere enjoying all this immensely,\u201d Simone told HuffPost about the unexpected ceremony.\n\nThe SpaceX rocket with Lee\u2019s ashes was launched on March 4, 2024. Buck Wolf and Simone joined hands together to send their beloved one to the vastness and comfort of outer space with the money the former raised on behalf of the journalist\u2019s family and friends. In June 2024, Wolf confirmed that the deceased\u2019s cremated ashes were orbiting Earth. Lee\u2019s companions and loved ones also donated his enormous archive of interviews and case files to the National UFO Historical Records Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, so that the next generation of UFO enthusiasts could delve into the same.\n\nFollowing Lee\u2019s passing, many of his friends and collaborators remembered him fondly. Marc Hartzman identified him as the one who \u201copened doors no one else could\u201d to HuffPost, joining Race Hobbs, the journalist\u2019s UN-X producer who called him a \u201cgenius.\u201d Ultimately, Buck celebrated his life by describing him as a \u201cstargazer,\u201d \u201cdreamer,\u201d and a \u201ckind spirit\u201d who was loved by many. Lee joined the realm of stars after creating an unparalleled legacy in the field of UFO research and investigation, which makes his tribute on \u2018The Program\u2019 all the more fitting.\n\nRead More: Craig Lindsay: Where is the Retired RAF Officer Now?"

Beyond there just being no shortage of tasks where a professional\u2019s expertise is required, we are living in the days of the modern gig economy, and whether you need a ride across town or someone to pick up some groceries for you, apps place you just a few taps away from connecting with someone ready to help.\n\nThere\u2019s also another option that\u2019s becoming increasingly available to us, and instead of hiring another person to complete tasks, there are more and more things where AI is interested in helping out directly. But just how comfortable are you with handing over the reins to an algorithm?\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen plenty examples of embarrassing AI failures, like when a system is used to summarize information, whether that\u2019s web searches, news headlines, or our latest notifications, and gets those summaries wildly wrong. At least that\u2019s reasonably low stakes, and it\u2019s usually pretty easy for us to spot when the AI is \u201challucinating.\u201d Are experiences like that enough to turn you off from trusting AI to complete tasks that are a little more consequential in our lives?\n\nProducts like the Rabbit R1 have billed themselves as versatile AI assistants, able to do things like order food delivery on our behalf. This era of \u201cagentic\u201d AI is only just getting started, and you had better believe that over the course of 2025 we\u2019re going to be hearing a whole lot more about AI doing things like scheduling appointments for us, or even finding and booking the best flights for an upcoming trip.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen enough AI demonstrations to understand that this sort of thing is totally doable\u2026 if everything manages to go right. Both humans and AI models are capable of making mistakes, and forming false assumptions, but are they equally good at catching them, and course correcting in time? That\u2019s a very good question, and one where it doesn\u2019t feel like AI is quite on the winning side just yet. Sure, performance is getting better all the time \u2014 but how good is it going to have to be before you\u2019re willing to rely on it?\n\nWould you trust an AI to book your flights or buy your groceries? 60 votes Absolutely. AI is only growing more capable every day. 2 % Sure, but I'm definitely double-checking everything after the fact. 5 % Kind of. I'm happy to let AI do the research, but I'm making my own purchasing decisions. 20 % Not yet. AI's pretty impressive, but I don't think it's quite ready for these tasks. 18 % Hard no. That sounds like a recipe for a red-eye with six connections. 55 %\n\nLots of us rely on AI for recommendations about things like which new music artist should we listen to \u2014 but are you equally willing to take AI\u2019s advice when it comes to new foods to check out? New places to visit? It\u2019s a complicated balance of stakes, and with AI performance changing by the day, not one that\u2019s likely going to present obvious answers for all of us in every situation.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that plenty of us aren\u2019t also interested in being early adopters, and really pushing these system to see just where they can pick up a little bit of the slack in our lives. Are you a member of team \u201cAI, take the wheel,\u201d or are you happy to keep doing things the old way and have someone else worry about getting a surprise DoorDash delivery that\u2019s just four dozen shallots?

            "article_content": "(Editor\u2019s note: Looking back on 2024, there were so many good albums released that we decided to reach out to some of today\u2019s artists and get them to weigh in on their favorites. What follows is Entheos vocalist Chaney Crabb\u2019s \u2018Top Albums of 2024\u2019.)\n\nMy name is Chaney Crabb and I am the vocalist of the band ENTHEOS. We released an EP this year on Metal Blade Records called An End to Everything and are looking forward to sharing a full album in 2025.\n\nJB Dunckel \u2013 Paranormal Musicality\n\nJB Dunckel\u2019s \u2018Paranormal Musicality\u2019 was my first favorite album of 2024. JB is one half of one of my favorite musical groups of all-time \u2013 AIR. Air\u2019s hauntingly enchanting and melancholy melodies have kept me a fan of every release I\u2019ve heard from them since their music first graced my ears in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides\u201d score, and JB\u2019s solo efforts are no different.\n\n\u2018Paranormal Musicality\u2019 is a piano-only album \u2013 there are no vocals and no accompanying instruments, but as every melodic line passes there\u2019s a sense that they\u2019ve always existed within our world. There\u2019s heavy emotion behind every keystroke of the piano. This is this album that ushered in every winter day for me at the start of 2024 \u2013 and I predict that it\u2019ll be the one I listen to the most to close out the year.\n\nKim Petras \u2013 Slut Pop Miami\n\nOne night over the summer as I was alone in my house, smoking a joint, and surfing through videos on YouTube I came across Kim Petras\u2019s lyric video for \u201cRim Job\u201d. I\u2019d heard a few Kim Petras tracks in the past but had never really taken a full dive into her work, but by the time the lyric video for \u201cRim Job\u201d was finished, I knew that I was a fully committed fan.\n\nFrom that point forward, \u2018Slut Pop Miami\u2019 became my summer go-to album. Its perfect blend of dancy, club hits with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and synthy, catchy lines is everything I want in a fun album to put on in a group setting. I can proudly say that I turned many of my friends and my band onto this album \u2013 we listened to it almost every day before we went on stage over the summer.\n\nMarilyn Manson \u2013 One Assassination Under God \u2013 Chapter One\n\nFrom the moment the first single from this album was released I had a feeling it would end up on my favorite albums of the year list. At this point I would say that this is the album I\u2019ve listened to more than anything else this year \u2013 songs like \u201cOne Assassination Under God\u201d and \u201cAs Sick As the Secrets Within\u201d are up there with my favorite Manson classics. The production is clear and perfect \u2013 Manson\u2019s voice is as good as its ever been and seeing the band live over the summer cemented that.\n\nChelsea Wolfe \u2013 She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She\n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Chelsea Wolfe\u2019s for a while, and one thing that I love about her as an artist is that she\u2019s never afraid to explore different aspects of her own artistry and sound. \u2018She Reaches Out to She Reaches out to She\u2019 embraces the landscape of dark electronica to its fullest \u2013 one of my favorite parts of this album is the atmosphere of it \u2013 at moments its almost suffocating, but always with the outward breath of beauty and relief masterfully entwined in the darkness.\n\nThe Cure \u2013 Songs of A Lost World\n\nIt comes as a little bit of a surprise, even to myself, that I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of The Cure. It\u2019s not that I have never liked their music \u2013 it\u2019s that I\u2019ve never taken the time to familiarize myself with their entire discography. I can proudly say that this changed this year with the release of \u201cSongs of A Lost World\u201d. From the first lyrical line on the album \u201cThis is the end of every song that we sing\u201d I was completely entranced by the dark beauty of this album. The album feels to me like a deep, introspective look at death. I feel such a kinship to that lyrical matter and sense of darkness in this beautiful world."

            "article_content": "This story was originally published in the 2024 edition of Discovery magazine, the College of Science's publication. This edition of Discovery celebrated the 20th anniversary of the College of Science.\n\nThe Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG) is Nevada\u2019s state geological survey. The bureau\u2019s primary mission is to provide Nevadans with geologic information about natural resources and geologic hazards to protect the public and facilitate, diversify and enhance Nevada\u2019s economic future. All but two states in the U.S. have a state geological survey, and about half are associated with their state university systems. The NBMG is a public service unit at the University of Nevada, Reno and supports the University\u2019s land grant, educational and research missions.\n\nThe NBMG was originally established as the Nevada Bureau of Mines in 1929 by the Nevada State Legislature, with the charge of serving as a bureau of information and exchange on Nevada's mineral industry, mineral resources and geology.\n\n\n\nOther responsibilities outlined in state statute include field investigations and laboratory studies, application of geologic engineering principles to geologic problems around the state and assisting state and local governmental agencies on topics related to the geology of Nevada.\n\nIn 1971, the bureau\u2019s name was changed to \"Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology.\" James Faulds, state geologist and director of the NBMG, said that with this change came a shift in the bureau\u2019s responsibilities to take on more of a research and teaching mission. The bureau\u2019s research output grew substantially and, in the late 1980s, NBMG research geologists were reclassified as University faculty. Later, in 2012, responsibilities for the NBMG\u2019s academic faculty were further expanded to include regular teaching and advising of graduate students. Today, over a dozen graduate students are training to become geologists under the supervision of NBMG mentors.\n\n\"It is interesting to reflect on changes in the state\u2019s geological needs over the bureau\u2019s almost 100-year history, as well as our evolution within the University,\" Faulds, who has worked at the NBMG for over a quarter century, said. \"Our mission was initially focused on the state\u2019s natural resources, particularly its mineral resources, as they related to Nevada\u2019s extensive mining activities. However, as the state grew in population and diversified its economy amid periodic earthquakes, floods and landslides, the NBMG\u2019s mission expanded to include assessments of geological hazards to facilitate more careful infrastructure planning and thus enhance public safety. Meanwhile, the University was also evolving into a premier research institution, and the NBMG\u2019s mission expanded accordingly into both research and education over a period of several decades.\"\n\nOverall, the NBMG employs nearly 30 individuals to cover its wide spectrum of responsibilities. These include specialists in geological mapping, economic geology (mineral resources), geothermal energy, geologic hazards, GIS/cartography and data organization/dissemination. Producing geological maps is a core function of state geological surveys like NBMG, as they provide foundational information needed for assessment of natural resources and geologic hazards. Major research organizations within the bureau include the Great Basin Center for Geothermal Energy, which hosted its first geothermal open house event last fall to inform the local community about geothermal resources in the state; the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory, which operates a network of more than 400 GPS stations tracking crustal motions across Nevada, helping to define earthquake hazards; and the Center for Research in Economic Geology, which conducts cutting-edge studies on gold deposits, critical minerals (such as lithium), and mine waste as a potential source of minerals (see page 14). NBMG also operates the Great Basin Science Sample and Records Library, a public facility and regional repository housing over 350,000 geologic specimens and reports. Additionally, the bureau provides outreach to K-12 students and teachers. The NBMG\u2019s many activities are summarized in biennial reports.\n\nOver its 95-year history, the bureau has carried out its role by sharing information with citizens and industry about hazards and resources to advance both public safety and economic development in the state, using the most up-to-date technology available. Major recent accomplishments include publishing a record number of geological maps in the past year, completing a new geological map of the Las Vegas Valley, conducting detailed analyses of some of Nevada\u2019s largest lithium deposits, election of one its faculty (Geoffrey Blewitt) to the National Academies of Sciences, and awarding of the prestigious Donath Medal (Young Scientist Award) by the Geological Society of America to another faculty member (Andrew Zuza).\n\nFaulds, who has served as director of the bureau since 2012 and is planning to step down upon the hire of a new director, reflects on its long history and promising future:\n\n\"As the search for a new director progresses, I can only reflect in awe at all of the accomplishments over the past several decades of our dedicated faculty and staff, who have endured tight budgets and expanding duties, but have continued to excel in producing high quality maps, reports and publications to meet the growing needs of this amazing state, endowed with all of its geological complexity and enormous potential,\" Faulds said. \"It has truly been an honor both to serve Nevada for the past 12 years as state geologist and to work with my talented colleagues to achieve important objectives for the state. I know that the bureau will continue to expand its horizons in concert with both the state\u2019s increasing needs and continued growth at the University.\""

            "article_content": "Tech mogul Elon Musk intensified his legal battle with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in the days after Christmas. Court filings show two prominent tech investors lending support to the billionaire\u2019s allegations that the company unfairly blocked potential backers from investing in its rivals. The dispute between the world\u2019s richest person and one of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups sets up a potential court battle over OpenAI\u2019s future. The artificial intelligence developer is trying to restructure itself to remove the oversight of its nonprofit board, freeing it to pursue profits more like a conventional tech company.\n\nMusk is asking a federal court in Northern California to block OpenAI from changing its structure, arguing that a nonprofit can\u2019t walk away from its original mandate backed by donors like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015 and was a major funder of the project before splitting with his co-founders in 2018 after attempting to take control of the project.\n\nThe billionaire also wants OpenAI to be prohibited from forcing its investors to decline to support competing AI companies, such as his own AI start-up, xAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s company, which offers the chatbot Grok, announced $6 billion of new funding last week from investors including Morgan Stanley and an investment fund associated with the Saudi royal family.\n\nAlso last week, progressive tech advocacy organization Encode filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing support for Musk\u2019s claims against OpenAI. Encode\u2019s filing was backed by several AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google researcher who shared a Nobel Prize this year for his work on AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode. \u201cAllowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed a brief in the case saying she was talking with the company about its plans and would step in if she believed it was breaking the law.\n\nMusk added new support from prominent tech investors to his legal assault on OpenAI in sworn declarations filed late last week by the entrepreneur and three allies.\n\nThey alleged that OpenAI told potential investors this year that they could back the company only if they committed not to invest in rival AI developers, including Musk\u2019s AI start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, which has invested in xAI, said in a filing that it was widely known among investors that OpenAI had made withholding from investments in competitors a provision of its latest funding round.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of hedge fund Atreides Management, which has invested in Musk ventures including electric automaker Tesla, said in his own declaration that the competitor investment ban was common knowledge among top tech investors.\n\nGracias and Baker did not claim in the filings to have heard directly from OpenAI\u2019s leaders about the alleged condition placed on prospective investors in the company.\n\nJared Birchall, chief financial officer of Musk\u2019s xAI and a longtime lieutenant to the billionaire, said in his own declaration filed with the court that an unspecified \u201creputable venture capital investor\u201d told him of the restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Deutrom, a spokesperson for OpenAI, declined to comment on whether the company had asked investors not to invest in competitors. The company has disputed Musk\u2019s claims in court filings.\n\nAt the New York Times DealBook conference last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said OpenAI investors who also invested in competitors would be cut off from receiving special information on OpenAI\u2019s business. He said in an interview with the Free Press this past month that Musk was \u201cclearly a bully.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Musk and Altman, two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men, erupted into public view last February.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman that month in state court in San Francisco. He alleged the company\u2019s leaders tricked him and others into supporting a company pledged to bettering humanity, but pivoted it into a for-profit enterprise. He later dropped the suit but filed a similar one in August in federal court in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced in October that it had raised $6.6 billion in new investment funding, valuing the company at $157 billion. The following month, Musk widened his suit to also allege that OpenAI worked with its main backer, Microsoft, to unfairly squash competition in AI. Microsoft has denied the allegations in court filings."

            "article_content": "\"Private autopsy doesn\u2019t confirm cause of death stated by police.\"\n\nProbe the Probe\n\nThe family of Suchir Balaji, the 26-year-old OpenAI whistleblower who was found dead just a month after his New York Times expos\u00e9 was published, is claiming that the young man was murdered.\n\nAn account that appears to belong to Balaji's mother Poornima Ramarao \u2014 shortened to \"Rao\" online \u2014 said in a post on X-formerly-Twitter that a private investigator's probe has led the family to believe that the young whistleblower did not commit suicide as officials allege.\n\n\"We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death,\" Ramarao tweeted. \"Private autopsy doesn\u2019t confirm cause of death stated by police.\"\n\n\"Suchir\u2019s apartment was ransacked,\" she continued, adding that there was some \"sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.\"\n\nThe account, which has shared photos of Balaji that hadn't previously been seen in the press and a GoFundMe for the private investigation efforts, went on to suggest that the city of San Francisco is covering up a \"cold blooded\" murder.\n\nAfter calling for an FBI investigation, the Rao account then tagged Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 and actually got a response from Musk himself.\n\n\"This doesn't seem like a suicide,\" the X owner and OpenAI cofounder wrote.\n\nPressing Matter\n\nIn the wake of Balaji's death, Ramarao has spoken out online and in the press about her son and her suspicions \u2014 though for the most part, her missives have not made waves stateside.\n\nEarlier in December, Business Insider published an interview with the grieving mother, who described her son's precocious interest in math and artificial intelligence, his disillusionment and ultimate exit from OpenAI, and the debacle she endured when trying to get answers about his death.\n\nAccording to Ramarao, Balaji had been on vacation with friends to celebrate his 26th birthday just before being found dead in his apartment. She claims she was the one to call the police when she hadn't heard from him upon his return from his trip, and that she waited outside the apartment for hours only to learn of Balaji's death when a medical examiner's van arrived on the scene with a stretcher.\n\n\"They didn't give the news to me,\" Ramarao told BI. \"I'm still sitting there thinking, 'My son is traveling. He's gone somewhere.' It's such a pathetic moment.\"\n\nOn X, Ramarao also claims that she was interviewed by ABC News on December 27, but that it \"has not been aired.\"\n\n\"We wonder why American TV media is not picking up,\" she tweeted, \"despite... it being international sensation?\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Ramarao is not pointing fingers at OpenAI or any other organization or individual. Instead, she seems simply to want justice for her son \u2014 a just cause, if there ever was one.\n\nMore on Balaji: Dead OpenAI Whistleblower Had Been Named as Potential Witness in Lawsuit Against Employer"

            "article_content": "It looks like Elon Musk is not alone in a legal battle thrown to thwart OpenAI from switching to a for-profit company.Geoffrey Hinton who earned recognition as being the top mind in the AI industry, not to mention a prominent data expert, is actually showing support for Musk and his legal case that wants to bar OpenAI from making the switch.Hinton shared more on this front including how OpenAI was founded with a sole purpose and that was to be non-profit. To make a sudden switch is questionable and unacceptable in his eyes. Remember, the company was first known as a safe non-profit entity so it\u2019s alarming why it thinks making the switch would be acceptable now.Hinton who is also a Noble Peace Prize winner of 2024 for his groundbreaking work in the world of physics shared several safety-based promises inside the charter. This includes marketing AI to better human abilities instead of seeking a replacement. It also has so many tax and different benefits, thanks to its non-profit status.The fact that it could tear that up into shreds and move on as if nothing happened in the past is not only irresponsible but also setting the wrong standards for today\u2019s industry, he continued. Remember, OpenAI was first founded in 2015 as a research lab working on a non-profit basis by leading members Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and several others.In 2019, it started to behave similar to the workings of a startup firm. Then it came up with capped-profit models featuring non-profits staying in control of the entire firm. For now, it\u2019s on a mission to get a more classic for-profit stance that enables the firm to raise the capital it needs using conventional terms that\u2019s similar to others working in this space. This was mentioned by the company itself in a blog published last week.But Musk is keen to block this switch and has been rivaling many of its actions since he left the board in 2018. Encode already rolled out a legal document that provided more information of a court case from a group that may not be involved directly but full supports the lawsuit blocking OpenAI.Such restructuring would undermine the company\u2019s committment to make public safety a priority, Encode shared in its recent statement. It further added that the company is currently operating in a non-profit where essential guardrails are in place and if the switch happens, these get forfeited.This is not the first time that we\u2019re seeing Hinton go against OpenAI with public criticism. A press conference from October shed light on how opposed Hinton was with Sam Altman. He felt the CEO was more worried about making money and less concerned about public safety. If that was not enough, he called this entire scenario a very unfortunate situation.In the past year, Hinton shared more on this front including how he needed to sound the alarms before AI could cause a major catastrophe for humanity. He also shared with the NYT how much he regretted his position in developing AI tech.On the other hand, Musk\u2019s concerns are a little more on the personal side. They have to do with him feeling like he was betrayed by top executives in terms of co-founding the firm and acting like they were just as worried as him about the concerns related to AI. However, OpenAI refutes those claims. It says that the tech billionaire had another vision which included transforming the organization into one that makes profits from the start and that was as early as 2017.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Fake Stars Are Being Used To Boost Malicious GitHub Repositories, New Study Claims"

            "article_content": "As committed chroniclers of the proverbial \u201cart world\u201d \u2014 an imperfect term denoting the ecosystem of artists, institutions, and other entities that make the visual art planet go \u2019round \u2014 we at Hyperallergic have noticed a few patterns emerge over the years. For example, why are museums getting so expensive? How come exhibition lighting is so offputting? And for God\u2019s sake, what\u2019s with all the soil art?!\n\nIn the spirit of ringing in the new year \u2014 and bidding adieu to 2024 \u2014 we\u2019ve compiled our Dos and Don\u2019ts for 2025, listing the trends and habits we\u2019d like to leave behind and those we\u2019d like to bring forward. Here\u2019s to another year navigating our strange, lovable, and deeply idiosyncratic art community (hopefully with fewer fair panels this time around \u2026 )\n\nIn 2025, Let\u2019s Leave Behind \u2026\n\n1. Soil Art \u2014 Since Walter De Maria\u2019s classic \u201cEarth Room\u201d (1977), soil has held a certain fascination and allure for art audiences, but now we\u2019re drowning in artworks that love to dig things up and prove to us how environmental they\u2019re being. All this has soiled our spirits on earthy works and we\u2019d prefer something else to make us feel grounded.\n\n2. Scrappy Ceramics by Artists Who Are Not Ceramicists \u2014 We\u2019ve all seen them, in hastily organized group shows and certain art fairs \u2014 shoddy ceramic \u201csculptures\u201d reminiscent of a last-minute middle school project you only remembered to tell your parents about the night before it was due. They\u2019re typically the work of artists with good intentions who want to experiment with the medium, but it\u2019s time to accept that this art form requires skill, and not everyone can (or should) take on the challenge.\n\n3. Abstruse Art Terms \u2014 \u201cThe artist\u2019s oeuvre of speculative futurisms is a catalyst for a praxis of rupture\u201d \u2014 did you feel your entire body cringe at that sentence? Let\u2019s treat contrived, obscure art terms like any other vice this new year: Everything in moderation. Don\u2019t get us started on crafty little parentheses within words, usually in service of saying two things at once that both mean nothing \u2014 \u201c(mis)understand,\u201d \u201c(re)imagine.\u201d It\u2019s not clever, it\u2019s just annoying.\n\n4. Little Gallery Books \u2014 Let us take a moment to consider the ecological disaster that is little gallery books. They\u2019re often small picture flipbooks with a short essay that someone hopefully got paid well to contribute to, but as anyone who has a bookshelf knows, those slim volumes are impossible to find. Not that anyone will ever read them.\n\n5. Gold Flakes \u2014 They\u2019re not good on cakes, so why would they be good in art? Believe us: The shinier the gold flakes, the cheaper the artwork looks. Wealthy collectors with abhorrent taste in art might cheer this unnecessary addition, but we prefer art that is rich at heart.\n\n6. Neon Text Art \u2014 It was cool back in the early aughts when everyone was into the academic critique of consumerism and mass advertising, but over the years we all caved in, gave up, and moved on. What good is your clever, post-modernish neon text if you\u2019re addicted to your phone, binge every piece of crap on Netflix, and ask ChatGPT to write your press releases? And does anyone even care?\n\n7. The Vessel \u2014 We were hoping for a permanent closure of the Hudson Yards Vessel when it shuttered for three years after four people jumped to their deaths from the structure, but no such luck. In October, the Manhattan eyesore reopened with prevention nets, despite public outcry. As Charley Burlock wrote for Hyperallergic, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the site has become a memorial rather than a public artwork.\n\n8. Unclear Opening Hours \u2014 Galleries and museums, for the love of all that is good: Clearly list your opening hours on your website and respect them. That seems obvious, yet art venues that boast values like access and inclusivity often ignore this most basic of principles. (On a related note: please make your websites user-friendly. If we have to click on an unlabeled floating object just to get to a list of current exhibitions, or your home page looks anything like Documenta 15\u2019s website, you\u2019re doing it wrong.)\n\n9. Pseudo-Academic Art Fair Panels \u2014 Hosting \u201cpanel discussions\u201d and similarly meaningless programming during an art fair is like putting a dress on a pig. No one wants to hear a group of \u201cthought leaders\u201d debate the politics of public art in the age of AI, or the relevance of biennials, or whatever. These talks are typically attended only by the speakers and their three friends who agree with them, perpetuating the art-world echo chamber effect we know all too well.\n\n10. Miserly Food Offerings at Openings \u2014 Nary a miniature croissant could be found at the press opening of the Whitney Biennial this year, to the chagrin of many of us who perused the bland artwork offerings on view with a grumbling stomach. No, we don\u2019t expect a three-course meal, but a small snack for a multiple-hour-long event is a nice gesture. And don\u2019t get us started on the increasingly microscopic wine pours at gallery openings.\n\n11. \u201cGallery-Spreading\u201d \u2014 Ever silently wrestle with some guy on the subway over leg space before resigning yourself to bumping up against him the whole ride? \u201cGallery-spreading\u201d \u2014 opening up multiple spaces with essentially the same function within just a few miles of each other \u2014 is the art world equivalent.\n\nNotice any odd titles in Philip Johnson\u2019s bookcase? (photo Valentina Di Liscia/Hyperallergic)\n\n12. Philip Johnson \u2014 Four years ago, when a group of architects and scholars exposed the architect\u2019s creepy racist and white supremacist views \u2014 and Harvard University removed his name from a building, and even the Museum of Modern Art, where he was the first director of the Architecture Department, agreed to cover up his name in an exhibition \u2014 we really thought Philip Johnson was dunzo. This year, however, The Glass House in Connecticut announced the complete restoration of his little \u201cBrick House\u201d on the property, complete with a reconstruction of Johnson\u2019s private library exhibiting a book simply titled \u201cHitler.\u201d Jfc.\n\n13. Expensive Museum Tickets \u2014 In the last two years, we\u2019ve seen ticket costs rise at several major museums across the United States, from MoMA to The Met to the Guggenheim to SFMOMA. Tempered by some positive initiatives like the Whitney\u2019s commitment to free admission for attendees 25 and under for the next three years, senior and student discounts, and other options, these price hikes are nevertheless an obstacle for low-income visitors.\n\n14. Art World Social Media \u201cInfluencers\u201d \u2014 With all due respect to your \u201cpersonal brand,\u201d we don\u2019t need your vapid hot takes on art, and don\u2019t have any time or energy to waste on your narcissism.\n\n15. Wishy-Washy Billboard Art \u2014 Let me guess: Your billboard project opens up a portal for discourse, community-building, and alternative futures. Does it really, though? Unless it offers a thoughtful message, isn\u2019t navel-gazing, and is situated in an area where people will actually see it and reflect on it, these billboards are less public art, more publicity.\n\nIn 2025, Let\u2019s Bring Forward \u2026\n\n1. Artists Putting Their Politics Into Action \u2014 This fall, author Jhumpa Lahiri turned down an award in protest of the Noguchi Museum\u2019s staff dress code banning the Arab and Palestinian headscarves known as keffiyehs, and earlier in the year, a group of anti-Zionists artists withdrew from a show at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco in a call for divestment from Israel. These were just a few of countless examples of cultural workers putting their money where their mouth is and holding institutions accountable. It takes integrity to pass up a career opportunity to stand up for what\u2019s right, and we commend those in our community who are speaking truth to power.\n\n2. Accessibility in Art Institutions \u2014 Canvases hung just a couple of inches lower to accommodate those in wheelchairs, better experiences for color-blind visitors, and fairs centered around artists with disabilities \u2014 we\u2019re starting to see some hints of the art world becoming more geared toward accessibility. Let it not be another fad, please.\n\n3. Better Food at Museums \u2014 There was a time when all we would expect at a museum restaurant or cafeteria was a dry ham and cheese sandwich or bad coffee, but nowadays we\u2019re finding that the options are better than ever. Whether it\u2019s Untitled at the Whitney Museum of American Art or the new caf\u00e9 at the Brooklyn Museum, it is feeling like we don\u2019t have to leave our culinary tastes at the door anymore, as there\u2019s sure to be something to enjoy if we need to take a break with a drink and food.\n\n4. Tribeca, a More Human-Scaled Art Neighborhood \u2014 We\u2019ve been dealing with the alienating galleries of Chelsea for too long, and now that Tribeca is slowly snatching the crown as the city\u2019s new gallery district, we\u2019re very relieved that there\u2019s a more human-scaled art neighborhood that allows you to wander dozens of art venues, while not feeling like you\u2019re trekking through an industrial wasteland. And if you thought the High Line park would help humanize Chelsea, I think you\u2019re wrong, as we have just added that one thing New Yorkers hate the most: feckless tourists who can\u2019t wait to tell you that their kid can paint that. Tribeca galleries give us hope that the art community is realizing that audiences want a different kind of art-viewing experience.\n\n5. A More Ethical Arts Journalism Ecosystem \u2014 So your show got a great review in Hyperallergic and you want to share it on social media \u2026 great! Just don\u2019t screenshot the whole article and upload it as an image on Instagram. Many people don\u2019t realize that online publications depend on readers and traffic, and posting our content in this way only benefits social media platforms. Instead, post a small snippet or image, if you\u2019d like, and direct your followers to a link they can click on to actually read the article on our site. Please share our stories as thoughtfully as we strive to write them.\n\n6. Thoughtful Exhibition Lighting \u2014 For a field that prioritizes visual experience, we sure spend a lot of time dodging light reflecting off an artwork\u2019s protective glass in order to, you know, actually look at the work. We see you, museums with anti-glare glass, and we appreciate you.\n\n7. Museums Unearthing Fascinating Collection Items \u2014 After languishing in storage for decades, if not longer, there\u2019s a new trend among collecting art institutions to showcase art that has not been allowed to shine in their galleries for ages, if ever. From the exhibition of Bhupen Khakhar\u2019s \u201cKali\u201d (1965) for the first time ever since it was purchased in 1967 by the Museum of Modern Art, or Thelma Johnson Street\u2019s \u201cRabbit Man\u201d (1941), which was purchased in 1942 but never shown \u2014 both of which are currently on display in MoMA\u2019s Vital Signs show \u2014 it\u2019s great to see museums figure out what they aren\u2019t doing right. As Shiva Balaghi outlined in her piece about MoMA\u2019s \u201cMuslim Ban\u201d show back in 2017, the reality is institutions are doing a poor job exhibiting their own collections, and when they do it is often much later, which robs audiences of important access to art that doesn\u2019t always fit into the institutional narratives.\n\n8. More Native Curators and Artists at Museums \u2014 There are more Indigenous curators and artists at museums than ever. In the last few years, artists as varied as Shelley Niro, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Jeremey Frey, Robert Houle, Nicholas Galanin, and many others have had retrospectives at major American museums, while artists like Kay WalkingStick have been exhibited at the New York Historical alongside their renown Hudson River School collection to explore the political realities that each body of work evokes. This is a trend we adore. More, please.\n\n9. More Local, Community-Based Art Shows \u2014 The year 2024 brought us an open-call exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum featuring more than 200 artists from the borough and a \u201csalon des refus\u00e9s\u201d at the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, presenting the work of hundreds of artists who submitted to the former and didn\u2019t get in. Meanwhile, at the Flushing Town Hall, over 70 Queens artists were included in the notably diverse World\u2019s Borough Exhibition. We love to see more opportunities for emerging artists to show locally, and for us residents to discover them.\n\n10. More Awareness of Age and Ageism \u2014 The art world has made some progress in recognizing the contribution of long-overlooked women and queer artists. On our end, we published a series of 23 interviews with queer elders throughout this year\u2019s Pride month. We must continue honoring those who pave the way for future generations.\n\n11. Being Open About Faith \u2014 There was a time when talking about religion in the art community was frowned upon. It was a strange taboo, considering so much classroom time in art history programs spent looking at Roman Catholic altarpieces, Early Christian manuscripts, Islamic architecture, or Buddhist or Hindu sculpture. But that unofficial ban seems to be lifting, and while some people like to think of contemporary art as a type of secular spiritualism, the art community is finally relaxing and allowing faith to be a bigger part of the conversation in arts institutions. Faith, like anything, is something we welcome as part of conversations. Back in 2003, our editor-in-chief remembers interviewing a Jewish-American artist who explained that he wasn\u2019t able to find a traditional gallery to exhibit Judaica. Has that changed today? Not fully, but it most certainly is changing.\n\n12. Museums Appointing Provenance Researchers \u2014 The Met Museum hired its first-ever head of Provenance Research this year, after a string of high-profile restitution scandals that led to government seizures of artworks believed to have been looted or otherwise improperly acquired. It\u2019s about time for institutions to have dedicated teams pursuing this work rather than relegating it to overwhelmed and underpaid curators.\n\n13. Playlists for Exhibitions \u2014 As interdisciplinary as the art world claims to be, how did it take so long for us to start incorporating music into the gallery-going experience? We think playlists add another dimension to viewing art, a personal touch, as evinced by the soundtrack Manny Vega curated for his exhibition Byzantine Bemb\u00e9 at the Museum of the City of New York this year.\n\n14. QR Codes \u2014 Let\u2019s face it, those printed press releases and checklists that galleries hand out always end up in the trash, wasting resources and polluting our precious planet. Art institutions that still don\u2019t use QR codes should join the trend. Your grandchildren will thank you.\n\n15. Audiobook Catalogs \u2014 While audiobooks are booming in the publishing industry, the field of art has yet to catch up on this trend \u2014 granted, this might be partly because so many artbooks are simply sales catalogues and not really supposed to be read, but that\u2019s another story. Earlier this month, I heard Duke University will be creating an audiobook version of Eunsong Kim\u2019s The Politics of Collecting book (check out our podcast with the author), and I hope it is part of a trend to allow us another way to engage with important volumes that we can listen to while we drive, cook, clean, go for a walk, or toil away in our studios. Audiobooks are great, and as someone who listens to them all the time, it would be great to have more art content to explore."

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "Tech mogul Elon Musk intensified his legal battle with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in the days after Christmas. Court filings show two prominent tech investors lending support to the billionaire\u2019s allegations that the company unfairly blocked potential backers from investing in its rivals. The dispute between the world\u2019s richest person and one of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups sets up a potential court battle over OpenAI\u2019s future. The artificial intelligence developer is trying to restructure itself to remove the oversight of its nonprofit board, freeing it to pursue profits more like a conventional tech company.\n\nMusk is asking a federal court in Northern California to block OpenAI from changing its structure, arguing that a nonprofit can\u2019t walk away from its original mandate backed by donors like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015 and was a major funder of the project before splitting with his co-founders in 2018 after attempting to take control of the project.\n\nThe billionaire also wants OpenAI to be prohibited from forcing its investors to decline to support competing AI companies, such as his own AI start-up, xAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s company, which offers the chatbot Grok, announced $6 billion of new funding last week from investors including Morgan Stanley and an investment fund associated with the Saudi royal family.\n\nAlso last week, progressive tech advocacy organization Encode filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing support for Musk\u2019s claims against OpenAI. Encode\u2019s filing was backed by several AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google researcher who shared a Nobel Prize this year for his work on AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode. \u201cAllowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed a brief in the case saying she was talking with the company about its plans and would step in if she believed it was breaking the law.\n\nMusk added new support from prominent tech investors to his legal assault on OpenAI in sworn declarations filed late last week by the entrepreneur and three allies.\n\nThey alleged that OpenAI told potential investors this year that they could back the company only if they committed not to invest in rival AI developers, including Musk\u2019s AI start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, which has invested in xAI, said in a filing that it was widely known among investors that OpenAI had made withholding from investments in competitors a provision of its latest funding round.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of hedge fund Atreides Management, which has invested in Musk ventures including electric automaker Tesla, said in his own declaration that the competitor investment ban was common knowledge among top tech investors.\n\nGracias and Baker did not claim in the filings to have heard directly from OpenAI\u2019s leaders about the alleged condition placed on prospective investors in the company.\n\nJared Birchall, chief financial officer of Musk\u2019s xAI and a longtime lieutenant to the billionaire, said in his own declaration filed with the court that an unspecified \u201creputable venture capital investor\u201d told him of the restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Deutrom, a spokesperson for OpenAI, declined to comment on whether the company had asked investors not to invest in competitors. The company has disputed Musk\u2019s claims in court filings.\n\nAt the New York Times DealBook conference last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said OpenAI investors who also invested in competitors would be cut off from receiving special information on OpenAI\u2019s business. He said in an interview with the Free Press this past month that Musk was \u201cclearly a bully.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Musk and Altman, two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men, erupted into public view last February.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman that month in state court in San Francisco. He alleged the company\u2019s leaders tricked him and others into supporting a company pledged to bettering humanity, but pivoted it into a for-profit enterprise. He later dropped the suit but filed a similar one in August in federal court in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced in October that it had raised $6.6 billion in new investment funding, valuing the company at $157 billion. The following month, Musk widened his suit to also allege that OpenAI worked with its main backer, Microsoft, to unfairly squash competition in AI. Microsoft has denied the allegations in court filings."

            "article_content": "In the new year, blockbuster legal cases will play out in US courts.\n\nMajor criminal cases include Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Luigi Mangione.\n\nIn the civil arena, the DOJ's list of antitrust lawsuits will make their way to court.\n\nAs we enter the new year, dockets are filling up with blockbuster court cases in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCriminal courts in Manhattan are preparing for the trial of rap mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and early hearings in the prosecution of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\nIn the civil arena, lawyers are gearing up for a year of antitrust lawsuits brought by the DOJ against Big Tech, Visa, and other companies it accuses of monopolizing their industries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2024 was the year of Donald Trump in court, there's still much to be done in the coming year as his fight to clear his rap sheet and zero out his civil judgments continues.\n\nHere are some of the cases Business Insider will be watching this year:\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs faces criminal and civil cases. Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs cases\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 founder of Bad Boy Records and the Sean John brand \u2014 is due to stand trial in federal court in Manhattan on May 5 on a sex-trafficking indictment that could send him to prison for life. Prosecutors have also warned that a second indictment is imminent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven what's already in the record, trial testimony and evidence will be graphic, and the courtroom jousting will be heated. Combs' defense is that he never forced anyone to have sex, and that his accusers have financial motive to implicate him. The trial will likely focus on consent and credibility.\n\nCombs' mother and his six oldest children \u2014 who range from teenagers to early 30s \u2014 have attended pretrial hearings, waving and smiling at him from the audience. The trial may prove less family-friendly. The evidence includes hundreds of hours of videotape from the rap mogul's sex parties \u2014 especially from his so-called freak-off performances, along with testimony by male sex workers who attended the parties. The trial will not be televised.\n\nSeparately, Combs faces more than 30 civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse. \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted, or sex trafficked anyone,\" his attorneys recently said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuigi Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is awaiting trials on murder charges. Pamela Smith/AP\n\nLuigi Mangione court case\n\nLuigi Mangione, a 26-year-old software developer from a Maryland real estate family, will face state and federal murder charges in Manhattan this year in the December ambush shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He risks a maximum sentence of life in prison and, in the federal case, the death penalty \u2014 though it has been more than 60 years since a Manhattan jury has sent anyone to death row.\n\nBoth the state and federal prosecutions are in their early days. While Mangione has pleaded not guilty in his state case, he is not set to enter a plea to his federal indictment until later this month.\n\nIt's possible Mangione will go to trial in 2025, though it's unlikely. His attorney suggested prior to taking the case that he could pursue some kind of psychiatric defense, which could delay the trial into 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continues to fight for a clean rap sheet and to zero out his civil judgments. AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nDonald Trump's court cases\n\nThe president-elect's criminal indictments have sputtered to a halt, thanks in large part to the US Supreme Court's July presidential immunity decision. Loose ends remain in the Manhattan hush-money case, as Trump works to clear his rap sheet of its sole conviction before his January 20 inauguration.\n\nThere is still no sentencing date, and New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan has yet to rule on Trump's demand that the case be tossed in the interest of justice, given the election. Also pending is Trump's Second Circuit appellate efforts to move the hush-money case to federal court.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump begins 2025 with a half-billion-dollars in civil court judgments hanging over his head, all of which he's in the midst of aggressively appealing, including his two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases. A midlevel New York appellate court could keep, trim, or overturn the biggest of Trump's judgments at any time \u2014 his massive civil fraud penalty, a debt to New York state that remains frozen on appeal, which has now ballooned to $490 million with interest. He remains a defendant in eight civil cases brought by injured Capitol Police officers and members of Congress involving his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court could strike down the law banning TikTok from app stores. Gearstd/iStock, Tyler Le/BI\n\nTikTok ban\n\nIn the spring, Congress passed a law that would ban TikTok from app stores in the United States unless Bytedance, the platform's Chinese owner, divested itself from the app.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe deadline is January 19. Bytedance still owns TikTok. A Washington, DC-based appeals court was unpersuaded by TikTok's arguments that its users' First Amendment rights outweigh the national security-based reasoning of Congress's law.\n\nAll eyes are on the US Supreme Court to see whether it will strike down the law before the deadline. The court agreed to hear oral arguments in the case on January 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia faces a DOJ probe. Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nNvidia\n\nThe Justice Department has reportedly been ramping up an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker throughout 2024. Competitors have said Nvidia uses unfair marketing tactics to gain a stranglehold on the market for chips used in AI development, while the company says it simply offers a best-in-class product. If the DOJ brings a lawsuit or comes to a settlement with Nvidia, it'll likely come in 2025.\n\nMeta faces an antitrust lawsuit. Fabrice COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeta antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued Meta during the first Trump administration, alleging it had an illegal monopoly on the social media market through its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The Biden administration has kept up the lawsuit, which scored a major victory in November when a federal judge allowed most of the case to go to trial.\n\nMeta says the company's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram have been good for consumers. If it loses the trial \u2014 scheduled for April \u2014 the FTC will seek to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has two ongoing antitrust battles. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nGoogle antitrust lawsuit\n\nGoogle search case\n\nAlphabet was dealt a major blow in 2024 when a federal judge concluded Google formed an illegal monopoly in the search market. Now the company is tussling with the Justice Department over how it should be punished. Google suggested it could pull back some of its partnerships with other companies. The DOJ has asked the judge to force Google to divest from its Chrome browser, a more dramatic move. The decision \u2014 and the many appeals to come \u2014 will continue to play out in 2025.\n\nGoogle advertising case\n\nAnother major Google antitrust case is over its role in online advertising. In September, a federal court held a bench trial to determine whether the company formed another illegal monopoly, in the adtech market.\n\nGoogle claims the Justice Department has overstated its role in the market, where it competes fiercely with the likes of Meta and Amazon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decision is expected to come sometime in 2025, with appeals to follow.\n\nAmazon's antitrust trial is expected in 2026. Amazon\n\nAmazon antitrust lawsuit\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of states sued Amazon, alleging it abused its dominance in the online retail space to inflate prices, squeeze third-party sellers with onerous fees, and push its in-house products at the expense of others. Amazon has said it does everything for the benefit of consumers, to whom it provides better products and better prices.\n\nIn September, a federal judge knocked down some of the states' claims but allowed the bulk of the lawsuit to proceed to trial. The trial date is scheduled for 2026, with more litigation and appeals expected to take place before then.\n\nOpenAI faces a lawsuit by The New York Times. NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nNew York Times vs OpenAI\n\nAll sorts of content creators \u2014 journalists, novelists, filmmakers, photographers \u2014 have filed a slew of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, accusing them of illegally siphoning their creations to train their AI models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI companies have generally argued that the use of the material is sufficiently \"transformative\" to be considered \"fair use\" under copyright law.\n\nOne of the major cases to watch is The New York Times's lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, which has progressed further than many of the other cases. In January, a federal judge is scheduled to oversee a marathon day of oral arguments over whether the case is on firm enough legal ground to proceed to trial.\n\nElon Musk vs Sam Altman and OpenAI\n\nIn the past few years, OpenAI has become a tech behemoth, setting the pace for generative artificial intelligence technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is technically structured as a nonprofit that seeks to build artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. However, under its leader Sam Altman, OpenAI has signed a lucrative deal with Microsoft, which hopes to harness the tech to drive its own growth.\n\nNow OpenAI is trying to formally convert itself into a for-profit company, shedding the nonprofit label. Musk \u2014 who was involved in OpenAI's early stages and who runs a competitor, xAI \u2014 is trying to stop that from happening.\n\nThe case has been moving at a fast clip, with lawyers for Musk and OpenAI dropping legal filings that reveal internal emails and other records about the other. It's set to continue heating up in 2025 as OpenAI tries to become a corporation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams' administration was in turmoil before he was indicted. New York Daily News/Getty Images\n\nEric Adams indictment\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan accused New York City Mayor Eric Adams of taking bribes from Turkey to fuel his political career \u2014 charges that he has strenuously denied. Adams hired Alex Spiro, a hard-charging lawyer best known for representing Musk, to fight the cases. The case is on the fast track and is expected to go to trial in April, before the city's Democratic primary.\n\nAn initial pretrial conference in the antitrust lawsuit against Apple is scheduled in February. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nDOJ's Apple antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Justice Department sued Apple in March, accusing it of violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a smartphone monopoly. More than a dozen states have since joined the lawsuit against the tech giant, and the initial conference in the case will be held on February 27 in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThe DOJ accuses Apple of making its rivals' products worse by selectively imposing contractual restrictions on developers and by withholding critical access points from them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple does this, according to the Justice Department, by suppressing the development of cloud-streaming apps and services, worsening the quality of cross-platform messaging with rivals like Android, limiting the functionality of third-party smartwatches unless the owners keep buying iPhones, blocking the development of \"super apps,\" and limiting functions on non-Apple wallet tap-to-pay.\n\nApple previously told Business Insider that if the lawsuit was successful, it could set a dangerous precedent by \"empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology.\"\n\n\"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,\" Apple said in a March 2024 statement to BI. \"If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe DOJ accuses Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, of unlawfully dominating the live music market. Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nLive Nation Ticketmaster lawsuit\n\nA little over a year after the historic Ticketmaster crash, which prevented Taylor Swift fans from purchasing Eras tour tickets, the Justice Department in May sued Live Nation, the website's parent company.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe DOJ accuses Live Nation of unlawfully dominating the live music market, stifling innovation, and exerting control over how fans can purchase tickets and where artists can perform. It seeks to break up the company.\n\nA final pretrial conference is scheduled for February 12 in federal court in Manhattan, but the case isn't expected to go to trial until early 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLive Nation previously told BI in a statement that the lawsuit would fail in court.\n\n\"The DOJ's lawsuit won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows,\" the company said in May.\n\nAn antitrust lawsuit brought by the DOJ says Visa handled more than 60% of US debit transactions, earning the company more than $7 billion in fees a year. Visa\n\nVisa antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa in September, accusing the company of engaging in anticompetitive behavior with its US debit transactions. Initial hearings in the case are expected in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the payment-processing giant of entering into contracts with potential competitors that prevent them from becoming actual competitors. By doing so, Visa is able to collect fees that it wouldn't be able to in a competitive market, the Justice Department alleges.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, said Visa handled more than 60% of US debit transactions, earning the company more than $7 billion in fees a year.\n\nIn September, a lawyer for Visa told BI the lawsuit was \"meritless.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Today's lawsuit ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving,\" Julie Rottenberg said in a statement at the time.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is scheduled for a January 3 contempt hearing. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nRudy Giuliani defamation case\n\nThis will be the fourth year for the court battle between Rudy Giuliani and Georgia election workers Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss and Ruby Freeman.\n\nThe former Trump attorney and New York City mayor has owed Moss and Freeman $148 million since December 2023, after a DC judge found his repeated false accusations of election fraud subjected the mother-daughter pair to a barrage of racist death threats. The pair's lawyer complained in court recently that Giuliani has yet to turn over any assets beyond a handful of luxury watches, a Mercedes without a title, and a New York apartment without a current lease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiuliani now faces contempt of court for allegedly continuing to defame the pair on his nightly podcast and for what defense lawyers complain has been his heel-dragging in turning over assets and complying with subpoenas.\n\nHe is scheduled for a January 3 contempt hearing and a January 16 bench trial, both in federal court in Manhattan. The trial will determine if Giuliani must surrender his Palm Beach condo and three World Series rings."

Currently, blood test readings are based on one-size-fits-all reference intervals that don\u2019t account for individual differences.\n\nI am a mathematician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and my team studies ways to use computational tools to improve clinical blood testing. To develop better ways to capture individual patient definitions of \u201cnormal\u201d lab values, my colleagues and I in the Higgins Lab at Harvard Medical School examined 20 years of blood count tests from tens of thousands of patients from both the East and West coasts.\n\nIn our newly published research, we used machine learning to identify healthy blood count ranges for individual patients and predict their risk of future disease.\n\nClinical tests and complete blood counts\n\nMany people commonly think of clinical tests as purely diagnostic. For example, a COVID-19 or a pregnancy test comes back as either positive or negative, telling you whether you have a particular condition. However, most tests don\u2019t work this way. Instead, they measure a biological trait that your body continuously regulates up and down to stay within certain bounds.\n\nYour complete blood count is also a continuum. The CBC test creates a detailed profile of your blood cells \u2013 such as how many red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells are in your blood. These markers are used every day in nearly all areas of medicine.\n\nFor example, hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that allows your red blood cells to carry oxygen. If your hemoglobin levels are low, it might mean you are iron deficient.\n\nPlatelets are cells that help form blood clots and stop bleeding. If your platelet count is low, it may mean you have some internal bleeding and your body is using platelets to help form blood clots to plug the wound.\n\nWhite blood cells are part of your immune system. If your white cell count is high, it might mean you have an infection and your body is producing more of these cells to fight it off.\n\nNormal ranges and reference intervals\n\nBut this all raises the question: What actually counts as too high or too low on a blood test?\n\nTraditionally, clinicians determine what are called reference intervals by measuring a blood test in a range of healthy people. They usually take the middle 95% of these healthy values and call that \u201cnormal,\u201d with anything above or below being too low or high. These normal ranges are used nearly everywhere in medicine.\n\nBut reference intervals face a big challenge: What\u2019s normal for you may not be normal for someone else.\n\nNearly all blood count markers are heritable, meaning your genetics and environment determine much of what the healthy value for each marker would be for you.\n\nAt the population level, for example, a normal platelet count is approximately between 150 and 400 billion cells per liter of blood. But your body may want to maintain a platelet count of 200 \u2013 a value called your set point. This means your normal range might only be 150 to 250.\n\nDifferences between a patient\u2019s true normal range and the population-based reference interval can create problems for doctors. They may be less likely to diagnose a disease if your set point is far from a cutoff. Conversely, they may run unnecessary tests if your set point is too close to a cutoff.\n\nDefining what\u2019s normal for you\n\nLuckily, many patients get blood counts each year as part of routine checkups. Using machine learning models, my team and I were able to estimate blood count set points for over 50,000 patients based on their history of visits to the clinic. This allowed us to study how the body regulates these set points and to test whether we can build better ways of personalizing lab test readings.\n\nOver multiple decades, we found that individual normal ranges were about three times smaller than at the population level. For example, while the \u201cnormal\u201d range for the white blood cell count is around 4.0 to 11.0 billion cells per liter of blood, we found that most people\u2019s individual ranges were much narrower, more like 4.5 to 7, or 7.5 to 10. When we used these set points to interpret new test results, they helped improve diagnosis of diseases such as iron deficiency, chronic kidney disease and hypothyroidism. We could note when someone\u2019s result was outside their smaller personal range, potentially indicating an issue, even if the result was within the normal range for the population overall.\n\nThe set points themselves were strong indicators for future risk of developing a disease. For example, patients with high white blood cell set points were more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes in the future. They were also nearly twice as likely to die of any cause compared with similar patients with low white cell counts. Other blood count markers were also strong predictors of future disease and mortality risk.\n\nIn the future, doctors could potentially use set points to improve disease screening and how they interpret new test results. This is an exciting avenue for personalized medicine: to use your own medical history to define what exactly healthy means for you.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "Thiruvananthapuram\n\nWorld Tsunami Awareness Day (November 5) presented a moment of reflection 20 years on from catastrophic Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004 that resulted in 2.25 lakh fatalities across 14 countries and emphasised the urgent need for effective tsunami preparedness.\n\nIt led to the establishment of Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System that serves 27 Indian Ocean Basin countries. Initiatives such as \u2018UN Secretary-General\u2019s call for Early Warnings for All\u2019 aim to make these systems inclusive and accessible to all, further strengthening collective resilience.\n\nLead time available\n\nHawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre that operates in the Pacific Ocean was aware of the mega event unravelling in the Indian Ocean. A lead time of two hours was available before the tsunami could potentially strike - as it eventually did - coasts of India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The disaster would have been mitigated if there had been an effective warning system in place.\n\nJapan experience\n\nBut a recent experience from quake-prone Japan, known for its culture of preparedness to mitigate effects of these disasters, is instructive. A magnitude 7.1-Mw quake off the coast of Kyushu on August 8, 2024, prompted an advisory indicating an increased likelihood of a mega quake. The advisory expired on August 15, 2024. Fortunately, the shaking that intervened was not severe, causing some damage and a modest 0.5-metre tsunami, but no casualties.\n\nEarly warning system\n\nIn any case, a multi-hazard early warning system is crucial for mitigating risk from various natural hazards, including tsunamis, notes Sanjay Srivastava, Chief, Disaster Risk Reduction, UN-ESCAP. It provides timely alerts to protect lives and reduce economic damage from extreme geophysical and climate events occurring individually, simultaneously, or sequentially.\n\nMakran zone scan\n\nIt is noteworthy that India, Iran, Pakistan, the UAE and Oman have collectively developed a unified Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment with respect to a perceived threat in the Makran subduction zone. This is now being used to help enable evacuation planning and activation of national tsunami warning chains within a matter of 20 minutes, Srivastava explained to businessline.\n\nFrom global to local, tsunami warning systems should represent a seamless value chain. For instance, the Indian and Pacific Ocean capacity assessment covers all aspects of existing tsunami warning and mitigation systems as well as identifies targeted areas for improvement from upstream to downstream.\n\nAssessment summaries\n\nAssessments and companion summaries for policy and decision makers are being published in line with the 20th commemoration of the Indian Ocean tsunami events (2024) and the 60th anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (2025). This effort is being piloted by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission-UNESCO with support from the ESCAP Trust Fund for Tsunami, Disaster, and Climate Preparedness; the Asian Development Bank; the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Italy.\n\nTsunami threat resilience\n\nCurrent level of adaptation finance falls short of what is needed for transformative adaptation, Srivastava noted. Investments made in preparedness are far more cost-effective than spending after a disaster especially since climate change continues to exacerbate effects of disasters including those geophysical in origin (tsunamis).\n\nDisaster risk financing needs to be dramatically increased and financing mechanisms scaled up. Progress has been made in regionally active tsunami warning and mitigation systems, but continued investments in the region\u2019s multi-donor coordinated Trust Fund is essential to ensure that Asia and the Pacific remains resilient to future tsunami and climate related threats."

The thickness of the fog, its appearance under a flashlight, and the respiratory symptoms some have reported after exposure led many to theorize about chemical attacks, bioweapons testing, and, of course, aliens.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSo far, there has been no confirmation that there is anything nefarious about any fog in any part of the world, but with mistrust in the government at high levels, this hasn\u2019t slowed the spread of frightened posting.\n\nNow everyone in TikTok is afraid of the fog pic.twitter.com/Trt4bOXEJN \u2014 UAE Exotic Falconry & Finance\ud80c\udd43 (@FalconryFinance) December 31, 2024\n\nWhat are the fog conspiracy theories?\n\nStarting on Dec. 29, social media users on conspiracy-heavy platforms like TikTok and X began publishing videos about a nefarious fog that seemed unusually thick or made of large particles. Some reported an odd smell described as chemical, electrical, or burning, and then claimed to experience fever, coughing, sore throat, headache, and fatigue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese symptoms drew COVID-19 comparisons and soon led to the term \u201cFogvid-24.\u201d As an echo of the conspiracy theories around the virus, some claim that government forces are surely deploying the fog as a means to spread a new pathogen, either as an experiment or an attack.\n\nReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u201cchemical fogs.\u201d\n\n\n\nDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\n\n\n\nDubbed\u2026 pic.twitter.com/DQqnrsYKzd \u2014 Shadow of Ezra (@ShadowofEzra) December 30, 2024\n\n\u201cReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u2018chemical fogs,\u2019\u201d writes X account @ShadowofEzra. \u201cDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAround the globe\u201d may be an exaggeration, however. Most if not all of these reports appear to come from the U.K. (which is famous for its fog) or areas of the U.S., including Florida.\n\n\u201cFlorida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, California, Texas and basically all over the country people are reporting this same thick \u2018particle fog,\u2019\u201d tweeted @WallStreetApes. \u201cThey say it\u2019s making them feel sick, smells like chemicals, and is not normal.\u201d\n\nSkeptics react\n\nConsidering how prolific they have become thanks to the internet, many users are quick to dismiss anything that smacks of a conspiracy theory. Theories on the fog are no exception, especially as believers and skeptics appear to fall along political lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose reporting on the fog as though it\u2019s a government plot (or aliens) tend to lean conservative, with histories of anti-government posts or handles like \u201c@BGatesIsAPsycho.\u201d Skeptics, on the other hand, tend to lean left and are wasting no time insulting those who want to believe.\n\n\u201cThe delusional throbbers that believe this stupidity need to give their heads a massive wobble,\u201d writes @BSmithBenS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have suggested that conspiracy theories like this demonstrate a need for traditional news media, heavy on fact-checking.\n\nWhat could explain the mysterious fog?\n\nAs the term \u201cthe fog\u201d trends on X, many posts come with videos of people shining flashlights into the mist, allowing viewers to see individual particles swirling around. This led to widespread alarm among those unaware that fog is actually made of small water or ice particles that reflect light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA video from 2015 by a YouTube user testing out his LED flashlights shows the same effect. This is, in fact, how fog normally looks under concentrated light.\n\nAs for cold or flu-like symptoms, it\u2019s possible that people are simply catching COVID-19 or another common respiratory virus over the holidays. Some of those sounding the alarm say that the fog appeared on Christmas Day when they likely would have spent time indoors with a group of loved ones.\n\nEvery year since 2020, the late fall and early winter holidays have brought a spike in COVID cases, as has always been the same with contagious and seasonal respiratory illnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial fog machine patent fuels conspiracy theories\n\nNot everything about these conspiracy theories can be easily explained away, including the reported chemical smells. Meanwhile, people keep digging up additional oddities that they connect to the fog.\n\nEarlier today, X user @girlymisogynist posted about a patent for a \u201cprocess and apparatus for the production of intense artificial clouds, fogs, or mists.\u201d However, inventors Paul Weiss and Jules Verdier submitted the patent application on Feb. 27, 1916, and it expired in 1937. So, it\u2019s probably not related to the current fog issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. military bacteria fog experiments\n\nIn what sounds like a conspiracy theory but is reported as real by the Bay Area CBS News, the U.S. military conducted experiments over cities like San Francisco using artificial fog to spread bacteria from 1949 to 1969. They were meant to be simulations of \u201cgerm warfare\u201d attacks and allegedly sickened and even killed U.S. residents.\n\nThis is according to Director of the Terror Medicine and Security Program at Rutgers Medical School Leonard Cole in his 1989 book Clouds of Secrecy.\n\n\u201cNearly all of San Francisco received 500 particle minutes per liter,\u201d Cole wrote. \u201cIn other words, nearly every one of the 800,000 people in San Francisco exposed to the cloud at normal breathing rate (10 liters per minute) inhaled 5,000 or more particles per minute during the several hours that they remained airborne.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis report is based on \u201cgovernment records, courtroom testimony and interviews,\u201d according to Publishers Weekly.\n\nNone of this means that the government is pouring pathogens on its populace now, but we can\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible to do so.\n\nThe internet is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 delves into the mysteries behind some of the most puzzling reported UFO sightings, including the popular Calvine sighting. In August 1990, two chefs working at a Scottish hotel went hiking in Calvine, Scotland, only to allegedly come across a diamond-shaped aircraft. The duo then reportedly clicked six photographs of the unbelievable sight, which were passed on to the tabloid newspaper, Daily Record. When the authorities learned about the incident, the photographs were sent to the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defence. Since then, the Calvine sighting remained a myth, but only until Craig Lindsay startled the world with a photograph he had safeguarded for decades!\n\nCraig Lindsay Secretly Possessed the Alleged Calvine UFO Sighting Photograph For Over 30 Years\n\nCraig Lindsay was born in the Scottish town of Kilbirnie. His career began with short stints as a journalist at the Dalkeith Advertiser and the Fife Herald. In the 1960s, he left the world of journalism to work in the PR departments of the Scottish Tourist Board and Vauxhall Motors. He eventually became a civil servant by joining the Scottish Office. During this period, he covered several tragedies, including the Chernobyl disaster. Lindsay joined the Royal Air Force\u2019s Scotland and Northern Ireland division as a PR officer in 1989. The very next year, he became the first official to talk to one of the two chefs who allegedly encountered a UFO in Calvine.\n\nAfter the two chefs had submitted the photographs they had taken to the Daily Record, Lindsay was responsible for collecting and sending them to the Ministry of Defense in London, England. However, before completing this task, he broke the rules and kept a copy of one of the six photographs with him. The illegal print remained inside his desk for the next three decades, safely inside a copy of the book, \u2018Great Aircraft of the World.\u2019 The print Lindsay possessed was revealed to the world through the investigative journalist and lecturer David Clarke. The latter met the retired RAF officer in 2022 after reaching out to him in August 2021 without any awareness concerning the existence of the invaluable photograph\u2019s copy.\n\nCraig Lindsay Donated the Alleged Calvine UFO Sighting Photograph in 2022\n\nIn a way, Craig Lindsay eagerly waited for someone like David Clarke to lift a burden from him. \u201cI have been for waiting for someone to contact about this for more than 30 years,\u201d the retired RAF officer told the Journalist, as per Daily Mail. In June 2022, he decided to donate the photograph to Sheffield Hallam University. The donation was followed by an evaluation by the photographic specialist Andrew Robinson, who confirmed that the diamond-shaped object featured in the photograph was not integrated into it after it was clicked. Lindsay\u2019s actions attracted curious minds from across the globe to one of the most well-preserved photographs of an alleged UFO. As a former civil servant, it was not at all easy for him to unveil this prized possession to the world.\n\nLindsay was even scared of breaching the Official Secrets Act, especially since the Ministry of Defense and The National Archives wanted to keep the photograph hidden until 2076 due to privacy reasons. \u201cAs a press officer for Scotland, I dealt with many UFO reports but most were just of lights in the sky. It was obvious this one was different,\u201d Lindsay told Clarke, as per the same Daily Mail feature. \u201cWhen I asked what sort of noise it had made, the man said, \u2018It didn\u2019t make any noise at all.\u2019 Up to that point, I wasn\u2019t treating it very seriously, but when he said it was silent, I suddenly realized there is no aircraft that I know of that is silent,\u201d he added.\n\nCraig Lindsay Serves His Local Community With His Wife Today\n\nThe publication of the photograph placed Craig Lindsay in the limelight. However, his focus remains on leading a peaceful retired life with his beloved family in Waulkmill Steading, a small region near the Scottish city of Dunfermline. He continues to share his life with his constant companion and better half, Jennifer Lindsay, with whom he welcomed four children and six grandchildren. Lindsay concluded his time as an RAF officer in July 1999 with a short voyage aboard a Jaguar fighter. Following the remarkable send-off from service, he was invited by the Registrar General for Scotland to be part of the publicity campaign for the 2001 Scottish Census.\n\nThe campaign was a notable success, and Lindsay even earned a national award for his efforts. Over the years, he has been an unignorable presence in his local community. He occupied several positions after his retirement, such as the chairman of Limekilns and Charlestown Community Council and the Dunfermline Heritage Trust. In 2022, the former RAF officer retired from Scouting after leading the Dunfermline District Scout Committee for a considerable while. Lindsay has also served as a member of the Charlestown-based Queen\u2019s Hall committee. Nowadays, he is committed to fighting for the restoration of the Limekilns Pier as a trustee of the Limekilns Heritage Trust.\n\nIn December 2023, Lindsay and Jennifer marked a milestone in their relationship by celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. The joyous occasion was graced by a Coronation portrait of King Charles and Queen Camilla, who congratulated one of the British Empire\u2019s commendable retired servants. Even though \u2018The Program\u2019 turns the attention of the UFO enthusiasts to Lindsay, it appears to us that he won\u2019t be bidding adieu to his comfortable, quaint life in Waulkmill Steadings for a prolonged time in the limelight.\n\nRead More: Jason Sands: Where is the UFO Whistleblower Now?"

            "article_content": "Within our comfortable world of causality we expect that reactions always follow an action and not vice versa. This why the recent chatter in the media about researchers having discovered \u2018negative time\u2019 with photons being emitted before the sample being hit by source photons created such a stir. Did these researchers truly just crack our fundamental concepts of (quantum) physics wide open? As it turns out, not really.\n\nMuch of the confusion stems from the fact that photons aren\u2019t little marbles that bounce around the place, but are an expression of (electromagnetic) energy. This means that their resulting interaction with matter (i.e. groupings of atoms) is significantly more complicated, often resulting in the photonic energy getting absorbed by an atom, boosting the energy state of its electron(s) before possibly being re-emitted as the excited electrons decay into a lower orbit.\n\nThis dwell time before re-emission is what is confusing to many, as in our classical understanding we\u2019d expect this to be a very deterministic process, while in a quantum world it most decidedly is not.\n\nThis is highlighted in the Scientific American article on the subject as well, specifically quantum probability. Within this system, it\u2019s possible that there can be re-emissions before the atomic excitation has fully ceased. It was this original 2022 finding that was recently retested, with the findings confirmed.\n\nAs confusing as this all may sound, the authors of the recent paper stress that the core of the issue here is the so-called \u2018group delay\u2019 of the original pulse as it excites the cloud of rubidium atoms. If one were to think of this pulse as discrete quanta of photon particles, it\u2019d seem to break causality, but as a wave function within quantum physics this is perfectly acceptable. Observations such as the rubidium atoms becoming excited despite photons passing through the cloud, and emitting a photon before the electrons returned to their ground state do not seem to make sense, but here we also have to consider how and what we are measuring.\n\nThe short version is that causality remains unbroken, and the world of quantum physics is intuitive in its own, strange ways. Research like this also gives us a much better fundamental understanding of photonics and related fields, none of which involve time travel.\n\nExperimental setup and measured optical depth.
