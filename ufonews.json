Fourth St.\n\nThese vehicles, which include things such as a replica of the 1960s Batmobile, a Delorean with a flux capacitor and even an \"invisible\" Boatmobile from the animated series \"Spongebob Squarepants,\" showcase a look at the most odd, weird and quirky things someone might see driving down the street.\n\n'Oddities' in Salina: A fun exhibition to curate\n\nMatthew Miller-Wells, the director of education for The Garage who worked on getting vehicles this exhibition, said it has been one of the more fun things to curate.\n\n\"There's just some weird, obscure stuff here,\" Miller-Wells said.\n\nIt's not only the 1995 \"ChewBaru,\" a Subaru Boxer covered with dental tools, dentures, toothbrushes and more, that excites Miller-Wells, but the rare vehicles that have gone out of style.\n\n\"The (K-Car) '83 LeBaron that's over there excites me just as much as like the (floating) Amphicar, because you just don't see those anymore,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the words that have already been used to describe this show, like odd and weird, he said one word is going to stick with him as people visit.\n\n\"I think 'polarizing' could absolutely be one,\" he said. \"There are cars here that people will love to see and ones that people will be really confused and don't like.\n\n\"That's the fun of it, is that what is strange is subjective. Someone may think it makes no sense that a K-Car is in here, because they remember a time when they were everywhere.\"\n\nThe Garage, an automotive museum in downtown Salina, opened its latest exhibition this week: \"Oddities.\" The exhibition, which features such vehicles as the Batmobile, a UFO and an amphibious car, will be on display through the end of the year.\n\nWhen is 'Oddities' on display in Salina? How much is admission?\n\n\"Oddities\" is now open at The Garage for people to come and see.\n\nDaily general admission for the museum is $15, with discounts for seniors, students and military being $12.\n\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nMemberships are also available beginning at $45 a year, with unlimited admission to the museum and other benefits included.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Salina Journal: Salina automobile museum's newest exhibit includes the weird and odd"

        "article_content": "Disco Volante is a watch style. In Italian, it also means \u201cflying disc\u201d but neither Frisbee nor mid-argument dinner plates. It\u2019s simply a term for a UFO and harks back to the mid-20th century. With such a rich history of Italian people collecting watches, many terms and nicknames have an Italian origin, but is this design ethos a new and rising trend?\n\nJudging from the response to the seemingly lugless Furlan Marri Disco Volante in its three versions, we will see more, and I, for one, will rejoice. Like the odd Cartier Pebble with its massive resurgence, round or roundish watches with short or no lugs are comfortable daily wearers. They also offer a much-needed alternative to the plethora of diver\u2019s watches that abound and are sleek options if small rectangles do not convince you. Let\u2019s look at the Furlan Marri, a smooth alternative to it, as well as some strong pre-owned options.\n\nA different take on vintage, now with a bracelet\n\nI already covered the Furlan Marri inspiration for this story, now known as the Disco. Read my article on it here, and it will serve as an intro to a style that has gone fairly viral in #watchfam circles. Even if my forearm has a tattoo that reads \u201ccontrarian,\u201d I do get the hype because we need new retro styles to covet.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen \u201960s diver\u2019s watches and know the time-traveling style they bring. I get it, but I enjoy dressing smart and have never quite caught the rectangular-Cartier bug, so I hope this is a new trend. In its three versions (Verde, Havana, and Celeste), the Furlan Marri Disco has been improved with the addition of a chic mesh bracelet that only heightened my desire. Better still, the price has remained the same at CHF 2,500\n\nVintage UFO grails from AP\n\nThe Furlan Marri Disco has a soft, circular case that takes inspiration from the most well-known flying saucers. Audemars Piguet might be known mostly for the Royal Oak and its Offshore brethren today, but when it comes to vintage dress watches, the brand excels. Most Disco Volante-style watches come with spare, minimalist dials like the Tiffany-signed one above sold by Amsterdam Vintage Watch Co. It has a Genta-revised design from the \u201970s that AP made for many years. In fact, the one above is from the early 2000s. The elaborate oversized bezel with its concentric rings gives it a big presence, only underlined by the big added value of a Tiffany signature.\n\nThe AP Disco Volantes come in many references with wildly varying price points. But I should underline one important fact here. Though I mentioned that G\u00e9rald Genta revised the design, in fact, a German designer should get the credit for its creation. Gebhard Duve originally sketched the \u201cDiscovolante\u201d 5093 models in the 1950s, as Audemars Piguet writes on its excellent AP Chronicles. The lovely 5093 above is my favorite, recently sold by Tempus Orologi in Italy for an unknown sum. It boasts a patinated cream dial and an architectural hobnail bezel in 18K white gold. Do a quick search on Chrono24, and you\u2019ll find an exceedingly wide spread of prices, starting with this lovely manual-wind 1960s model at just less than \u20ac4,000 up to more than \u20ac30K.\n\nSports watches, JLCs, Omegas, and more\n\nYou will find a lot more if you do a general Disco Volante search. And you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on vintage UFO gems for less than \u20ac1,000. The trend took off (get it?) around 50 years ago, and the choices are vast. With this search on Chrono24, you\u2019ll find quirky alternatives, such as this Longines Admiral powered by the caliber 431. It rocks a big (for a Disco Volante) 42mm case with a broad, radially brushed bezel. It\u2019s very unusual and shows that some brands appropriated the style into a sportier context, which only adds spice.\n\nOmega also had a UFO affair with the De Ville dress line. And within my search, they routinely appear for less than \u20ac1,000, offering big value. Of other brands, you will even find some Jaeger-LeCoultre variants and a delightful brace of Vacheron Constantin references. They are usually of the mid-\u201950s variety with a strong hobnail bezel design and a 35mm yellow gold case. However, the important question that needs to be asked is whether the Furlan Marri is the first of many new Disco Volantes to come. I say yes, and another lugless watch offers proof.\n\nA triangular Disco Volante?\n\nLike the rest of the team, I have only just decompressed from three days of horological wonder at Geneva Watch Days. And between running way too fast for 28\u00b0 Celsius to catch a meeting, I met with Matteo Violet-Vianello. He\u2019s the charming designer behind the brand Anoma. Brad Homes covered the Anoma A1 for us back in May, and after getting it on my wrist, I was smitten. The first model may have sold out and gone viral for good reason, but is it a Disco?\n\nI would say \u201cyes\u201d as I\u2019m sure there are triangular-shaped UFOs in the underground bunkers of Area 51. The Anoma has all the qualities except a circular case. It has a minimal design with a dressy touch sans lugs and is remarkably smooth with pebble-soft charm. The first run is sold out, but stay tuned to Anoma for more. I believe \u00a31,300 is a fair price to enter the realm of flying objects.\n\nDo wrist-worn flying objects tempt you, Fratelli? I\u2019m certainly feeling them, and I will also add an image of the epitome of the term. No, it\u2019s is not a watch but, rather, the amazing Bertona Alfa Romeo Disco Volante from 1952. Feel free to comment on the watches and the trend (and even the car) in the comments."

        "article_content": "Kudos to Plaud for one thing: in a year otherwise marred by high-profile failures and oh so much AI vaporware, it made an AI gadget that does exactly what it claims to do and does it pretty well. The gadget is called the NotePin, and it\u2019s a $169, pill-shaped voice recorder that can transcribe, summarize, and pull important information out of your audio. This is something current AI systems can actually do well! There\u2019s good and mature tech at every step along the pipeline here, from tiny microphones to speech-to-text transcription to natural-language processing and AI summarization. The NotePin does it well.\n\nBut the reason the NotePin works is also the reason I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying one. AI voice recording is great and handy and being commoditized at an absolutely blistering pace. With iOS 18 or macOS Sequoia, you get transcriptions and summarization built into the Voice Memos app. Google\u2019s Pixel Recorder app is terrific and is built into both the Pixel phones and the Pixel Watch. You can also get similar features from lots of apps. Do you need a dedicated voice recorder?\n\nThis is, of course, the eternal question about AI assistants as a whole. Are they a feature of your existing devices or a gadget category unto themselves? Plaud\u2019s argument for dedicated hardware is about the same as all the other AI startups: that ease of use is everything. The NotePin\u2019s accessories are core to its appeal: there\u2019s a braided lanyard so you can wear it around your neck, a wristband so you can wear it Fitbit-style on your arm, and a clip so you can put it almost anywhere else.\n\nPlaud\u2019s argument for dedicated hardware is about the same as all the other AI startups: that ease of use is everything\n\nIn my time testing the NotePin, I\u2019ve mostly had it around my neck, and I\u2019ve used it to note reminders while driving, ramble long ideas to myself while walking the dog, and summarize calls and conversations. It\u2019s certainly handy being able to just reach down, press the NotePin until it vibrates to indicate it\u2019s recording, and then yammer away at nothing while my necklace dutifully listens. Once, when I was particularly enjoying a podcast, I just played the whole thing on speaker so the NotePin would transcribe and summarize it. The NotePin is easier to access than my phone in my pocket, and it\u2019s definitely simpler than holding my wrist in front of my mouth for minutes at a time while shouting into my watch. The form factor definitely matters.\n\nThe NotePin\u2019s mic is perfectly fine: the audio it records never sounds amazing, but in every realistic scenario I tried, it was good enough for solid transcription. Plaud estimates the device\u2019s battery lasts for about 18 hours of recording or 30 days of standby time, and in my testing, I\u2019ve done about four hours of recording over about 10 days, and the battery just hit \u201cLow.\u201d The NotePin charges on a tiny pad, which I\u2019m confident I\u2019m going to lose very soon, and I wish it was just a simple USB-C plug. But look: the thing works. It does what it says on the tin.\n\nPlaud\u2019s transcriptions and summaries are mostly pretty good! But that\u2019s just not enough. Screenshots: David Pierce / The Verge\n\nThe major problem with the NotePin, and frankly every other AI gadget, is that it\u2019s not useful enough on the other side. Once you\u2019ve made some recordings with the NotePin, you import them into the Plaud app, which is relatively quick and simple. But then you have to go into each recording and manually tell the app to transcribe it, pick a \u201ctemplate\u201d you want to use for how it\u2019s summarized, and then come back a few minutes later to see what it came up with. (You get 300 monthly minutes of transcriptions and basic templates for free, or for $80 a year, you get 1,200 and more templates and features.) That\u2019s too much busy work. Plus, how much effort am I really saving if I have to pull out my phone \u2014 twice! \u2014 anyway?\n\nThe transcriptions are good, and the summaries are helpful, and so far, I haven\u2019t had any huge mistakes or hallucinations. But once they\u2019re done, they just live in reverse-chronological order in the Plaud app. The app correctly noted that one of my recordings was a reminder to buy retinol; it didn\u2019t remind me of anything. It just made the title \u201cReminder to buy retinol.\u201d When I wandered my kitchen speaking a grocery list into the NotePin, the app accurately transcribed that list for me but just titled the note \u201cGrocery List with Various Food Items and Household Essentials.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not really the NotePin\u2019s fault that it can\u2019t do more than turn my nonsensical ramblings into text files. It\u2019s not Plaud\u2019s fault, either. It\u2019s just that what I really want \u2014 and what should really happen \u2014 is for it to take that grocery list and add it to the grocery list I already have on my phone. It should add that reminder to my to-do list. At the very least, the app should be able to combine my grocery list note with my other grocery list note, but it can\u2019t do that, either. Ultimately, no matter what you\u2019re recording, odds are you want to do something with it afterward, and Plaud simply can\u2019t do most of those things. Eventually, the Plaud app just began to feel like another inbox I needed to check.\n\nAll that is why your phone or smartwatch might be insurmountable foes in the AI assistant wars. They might be marginally less convenient \u2014 you have to pull it out of your pocket instead of just reaching down to your chest \u2014 but they\u2019re far more connected with the rest of your digital life. Building your whole world around a transcription app just doesn\u2019t make any sense."

Meta says that \"from next week\" all adults in the UK who use Facebook and Instagram \"will start receiving in-app notifications to explain what we\u2019re doing\". These notifications will apparently include information on how you can \"access an objection form\" so you can opt out of your data \"being used to train our generative AI models\".\n\nExactly what those notifications and objection forms will look like isn't clear, but hopefully, they'll be simpler and clearer than previous ones, which were buried in layers of menus and that you might understandably have missed.\n\nIf you did see those earlier objection forms, Meta says you won't be contacted this time. It also claims that it's \"incorporated regulatory feedback to ensure our approach is even more transparent\". But if you don't want your data to be fed into Meta's ravenous AI machine, what else can you do?\n\nHow to opt out\n\nTwo iPhones next to each other on a blue background showing the privacy settings menus for Facebook and Instagram\n\nMeta says it will \"use public information \u2013 such as public posts and comments, or public photos and captions \u2013 from accounts of adult users on Instagram and Facebook to improve generative AI models for our AI at Meta features and experiences\".\n\nThis means that if your Facebook or Instagram posts aren't 'public', you theoretically don't have anything to worry about. To check this in the Facebook app, go to Menu (in the bottom right) > Settings & privacy > Settings, and scroll down to the 'Audience and Visibility' section. In here, you'll see sections for Posts, Stories, and Reels \u2013 tap each one and make sure the audience is set to one of the four options that aren't 'Public'.\n\nIn the Instagram app, tap your profile in the bottom right, then tap the hamburger menu in the top-right \u2013 scroll down to 'who can see your content' and tap on 'Account privacy'. By default, this will be set to 'Public', but to make it private toggle 'Private account'. This will mean that only followers will be able to see your posts \u2013 and Meta won't be able to train its generative AI on your images.\n\nAside from checking these settings, you can also look out for those in-app notifications in Facebook and Instagram that should start popping up next week. Unfortunately, these are unlikely to be simple 'yes or no' affairs, with a previous form requiring you to \"tell us how this processing impacts you\". So making sure your posts on Facebook and Instagram are private is likely the best first step.\n\nMeta has also added that \"we do not use people\u2019s private messages with friends and family to train for AI at Meta, and we do not use information from accounts of people in the UK under the age of 18\". However, that doesn't mean that photos of children uploaded on other public accounts \u2013 for example, by family or parents \u2013can't be used for AI training, so it's best to get those privacy settings locked down.\n\nWhile this all may seem invasive, at least those of us in the UK and EU have the option of opting out of Meta's AI training \u2013 we recently saw that Facebook and Instagram users in Australia have no opt-out option, despite Meta admitting to scraping posts and photos in the country from as far back as 2007.\n\nYou might also like..."

Learn More\n\nMicrosoft has unveiled a groundbreaking benchmark called Windows Agent Arena (WAA) to test artificial intelligence agents in realistic Windows operating system environments. This new platform aims to accelerate the development of AI assistants capable of performing complex computer tasks across diverse applications.\n\nPublished on arXiv.org, the research addresses critical challenges in evaluating AI agent performance. \u201cLarge language models show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cHowever, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena in action: AI agents tackle diverse computer tasks, evaluated rapidly through Azure cloud technology. The system aims to advance human-computer interaction. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nWindows Agent Arena: A virtual playground for AI assistants\n\nWindows Agent Arena provides a reproducible testing ground where AI agents interact with common Windows applications, web browsers, and system tools, mirroring human user experiences. The platform includes over 150 diverse tasks spanning document editing, web browsing, coding, and system configuration.\n\nA key innovation of WAA is its ability to parallelize testing across multiple virtual machines in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud. \u201cOur benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes,\u201d the paper states. This dramatically accelerates the development cycle compared to traditional sequential testing that could take days.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena, a new benchmark for AI agents, simulates real-world Windows tasks across various applications. The platform allows for rapid testing and evaluation of AI assistants, potentially accelerating the development of more sophisticated human-computer interactions. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nNavi: Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent takes on human-level tasks\n\nTo showcase the platform\u2019s capabilities, Microsoft introduced a new multi-modal AI agent called Navi. In tests, Navi achieved a 19.5% success rate on WAA tasks, compared to a 74.5% success rate for unassisted humans. These results highlight both the progress made and the challenges that remain in developing AI that can match human capabilities in operating computers.\n\nRogerio Bonatti, lead author of the study, said, \u201cWindows Agent Arena provides a realistic and comprehensive environment for pushing the boundaries of AI agents. By making our benchmark open source, we hope to accelerate research in this critical area across the AI community.\u201d\n\nThe release of WAA comes amid intensifying competition among tech giants to develop more capable AI assistants that can automate complex computer tasks. Microsoft\u2019s focus on the Windows environment could give it an edge in enterprise scenarios, where Windows remains the dominant operating system.\n\nNavi, Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent, as it confronts a typical Windows task in the Windows Agent Arena: installing the Pylance extension in Visual Studio Code. This demonstrates how AI agents are being trained to navigate common software environments. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nBalancing innovation and ethics in AI agent development\n\nWhile the potential benefits of AI agents like Navi are significant, the development of such technologies raises important ethical considerations. As these agents become more sophisticated, they will have unprecedented access to users\u2019 digital lives, potentially interacting with sensitive personal and professional information across various applications.\n\nThe ability of AI agents to operate freely within a Windows environment \u2013 accessing files, sending emails, or modifying system settings \u2013 underscores the need for robust security measures and clear user consent protocols. There\u2019s a delicate balance to strike between empowering AI to assist users effectively and maintaining user privacy and control over their digital domains.\n\nMoreover, as AI agents become more capable of mimicking human-like interactions with computer systems, questions arise about transparency and accountability. Users may need to be clearly informed when they are interacting with an AI versus a human, especially in professional or high-stakes scenarios. The potential for AI agents to make consequential decisions or actions on behalf of users also raises liability concerns that will need to be addressed as the technology matures.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to open-source the Windows Agent Arena is a positive step towards collaborative development and scrutiny of these technologies. However, it also means that potentially less scrupulous actors could use the platform to develop AI agents with malicious intent, highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance and perhaps regulation in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nAs WAA accelerates the development of more capable AI agents, it will be crucial for researchers, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to engage in ongoing dialogue about the implications of these technologies. The benchmark not only measures technological progress but also serves as a reminder of the complex ethical landscape we must navigate as AI becomes an increasingly integral part of our digital lives."

Here are the key moments of what's happened so far\n\n16th May: Giovanni Pernice sensationally quits Strictly Come Dancing after nine years on the show.\n\n17th May: Giovanni becomes the centre of an official investigation after three former partners \u2013 believed to be Amanda Abbington, Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh \u2013 make complaints to the BBC.\n\n16th June: Giovanni releases an official statement vowing to clear his name and denies any wrongdoing.\n\n8th July: Strictly confirms Aljaz Skorjanec will return to the series, replacing Giovanni, after initially quitting the show two years ago.\n\n10th July: Amanda Abbington launches fresh legal proceedings to get the rehearsal footage from her time with Giovanni, after allegedly he refused to release the videos.\n\n13th July: Graziano Di Prima is axed from Strictly for \"gross misconduct\" after footage of his treatment of Zara McDermott is brought to the attention of the BBC.\n\nGraziano quickly broke his silence, apologising for his behaviour in a statement and saying he \"deeply regrets it\", adding his \"intense passion and determination to win might have affected his training regime.\"\n\n15th July: Strictly bosses implement new duty of care protocols, including having a chaperone present throughout all rehearsals.\n\n16th July: Zara McDermott speaks out publicly for first time. She states while the production team were \"amazing to work with\", she found the rehearsal room \"completely different\", confirming there's footage of \"certain situations\".\n\n19th July: Anton Du Beke is put under the spotlight for his \"1970s attitude\" and treatment of female celeb stars, particularly after allegedly referring to 2009 partner Laila Rouass as a \"p***\" after getting a spray tan.\n\n21st July: Paralympian Will Bayley, who has limb condition arthrogryposis, revealed he was encouraged to leap from a table during a dance routine, despite fears. The stunt caused an injury that forced him to withdraw from the show.\n\n22nd July: MasterChef's Gregg Wallace admits he broke down in tears and got a nasty stress rash on his face during his time on Strictly in 2014.\n\n22nd July: Despite ongoing issues, the Strictly professional cast begin rehearsals for this year's series.\n\n23rd July: Celebrity agent Melanie Blake claims she was sexually assaulted by an unnamed pro dancer while backstage on the show, and claims she witnessed ageism, rudeness and a rough treatment to the point of injury.\n\n23rd July: Strictly is forced to beef up security after 'an intruder scales the wall of the rehearsal studio'.\n\n23rd July: BBC boss Tim Davie breaks his silence on the ongoing allegations against Strictly, saying he is 'deeply sorry', adding: \"Hundreds of people, be they pros, contestants or crew have been part of it and had a brilliant experience.\n\n\"At the same time if someone thinks there was something wrong or they want to talk about their experience then of course we want them to raise that with us. Be in no doubt we will take it seriously, listen and deal with it as appropriate.\"\n\n24th July: Strictly 2023 star Krishnan Guru-Murthy holds a bombshell interview with Amanda Abbington on Channel 4 news, where she claims she was bullied, with some of the 'humilation being of a sexual nature'.\n\n27th July: Laura Whitmore releases a statement regarding her Strictly experience, saying \"I thought my experience was specific to me but I\u2019ve since learned I was wrong\".\n\nShe adds she is not part of the official complaint, but has come forward to support Amanda with the BBC, alongside others.\n\n28th July: Laila Rouass speaks out against the accusations regarding Anton Du Beke, saying she \"never felt pressured\" by him and \"personally insisted on six to seven hours training a day\".\n\n10th August: Graziano breaks his silence on his Strictly axe, saying \"these vile, false allegations have ruined my life.\"\n\nHe also told of the \"shocking\" end to his friendship with Zara McDermott.\n\nWe also revealed that Amanda Abbington was also quizzed for a second time as Strictly execs recruited 15 new staff to monitor rehearsals.\n\n11th August: Just as the investigation was expected to conclude, Amanda made a dramatic intervention. Giovanni was on the brink of being cleared until Amanda handed in more text messages.\n\n24th August: Graziano Di Prima called in top lawyers to sue the BBC and to try to clear his name. He recruited big hitters Whitestone Chambers to fight his corner.\n\nA source said: \"They\u2019ve also looked at his BBC contract and believe there are grounds to sue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC also delayed releasing the findings of the probe into Giovanni Pernice. The Sun revealed that the results of the three-month investigation were unlikely to be announced in August."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nSome chapters of human history are more poignant to revisit than others.\n\nThe Battle of Waterloo ended a 23-year war, but thousands were killed on June 18, 1815, when allied armies led by the Duke of Wellington and Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher defeated Napoleon Bonaparte and his forces south of Brussels.\n\nPaintings, books and eyewitness accounts have preserved details of the conflict more than two centuries later. Until recently, only two complete skeletons from the battle had been found, leaving gaps in the somber tale of what horrors unfolded during and after the clash.\n\nNow, archaeologists and military veterans have found the remains of amputated limbs and horses at the site that help tell the story of what happened in the battle\u2019s aftermath.\n\nBut other chapters, like those describing the loss of our ancient ancestors, are harder to recover as time passes. A chance finding of bones in a cave is revealing clues of a much older tragic mystery.\n\nWe are family\n\nArchaeologists discovered the remains of a Neanderthal, nicknamed Thorin, in Grotte Mandrin in 2015. Courtesy Ludovic Slimak\n\nFive teeth uncovered in a rock shelter in France\u2019s Rh\u00f4ne Valley in 2015 could explain why Neanderthals disappeared from the face of Earth 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe once-in-a-lifetime find, nicknamed Thorin after a character in \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d has puzzled researchers for nearly a decade. While genetics suggested the Neanderthal was 105,000 years old, archaeological context indicated he lived 40,000 to 50,000 years ago.\n\nNew research found that Thorin belonged to a Neanderthal lineage isolated from other groups that unexpectedly lived nearby for 50,000 years, which made his DNA seem older than it was.\n\nThat isolation put Neanderthals at an evolutionary disadvantage and could have led to their demise.\n\nFantastic creatures\n\nWhen scientists observed dark sleeper fish gulping down young Japanese eels, some of the eels were able to hatch an escape through the predator\u2019s gills in a matter of minutes.\n\nTo get an inside look, researchers used an X-ray video system and observed the eels breaking free from within the fish\u2019s stomach.\n\n\u201cBefore capturing the first X-ray footage, we never imagined that eels could escape from the stomach of a predatory fish,\u201d said Yuha Hasegawa, an assistant professor at Japan\u2019s Nagasaki University.\n\n\u201cWitnessing the eels\u2019 desperate escape from the predator\u2019s stomach to the gills was truly astonishing for us.\u201d\n\nAcross the universe\n\nThe Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition named US photographer Ryan Imperio overall winner for his photo depicting distorted shadows of the moon\u2019s surface created by an eclipse. Ryan Imperio\n\nColorful auroras over the mountains of New Zealand, the glittering Dolphin Head nebula and a sunlit silhouette of the International Space Station are just some of the winners of the Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition.\n\nThe overall winner of the competition was photographer Ryan Imperio for his photo taken during the October 2023 annular solar eclipse.\n\nThe image captured the progression of Baily\u2019s beads. The phenomenon is visible for brief moments during an eclipse when sunlight shines through the moon\u2019s valleys and craters, creating glowing drops of light.\n\nSeparately, SpaceX\u2019s Polaris Dawn crew made history this week after acing the first commercial spacewalk and setting other space exploration records ahead of its expected return in the coming days.\n\nForce of nature\n\nThe world\u2019s most devastating mass extinction wiped out more than 90% of all life on the planet about 252 million years ago \u2014 and now, scientists think they have discovered a climate phenomenon that played a pivotal role.\n\nPreviously, scientists thought carbon dioxide belched out by volcanic activity triggered a sudden warming of the planet, acid rain and ocean acidification.\n\nBut an intense, prolonged El Ni\u00f1o event that lasted years and originated from an ancient body of water much larger than today\u2019s Pacific Ocean would have enhanced the effects of the volcanism.\n\nTogether, the two phenomena could have caused the Great Dying, and the catastrophic extinctions began on land before occurring in the ocean.\n\nA long time ago\n\nRapa Nui, located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, is known for its hundreds of carved moai, or giant stone head sculptures. Zhu Yubo/Xinhua/Sipa USA\n\nSome scientists have long believed that the population of Rapa Nui faced a ruinous decline hundreds of years ago. Also called Easter Island, it\u2019s known for its hundreds of carved stone statues.\n\nBut a new analysis of ancient DNA from 15 of the island\u2019s former residents who lived there within the past 400 years tells a different story.\n\nThe genetic analysis suggests that the island\u2019s small population actually increased in size until the 1860s and that the island\u2019s inhabitants reached the Americas in the 1300s, long before Christopher Columbus in 1492.\n\nMeanwhile, the search for the origin of Stonehenge\u2019s mysterious central Altar Stone is intensifying, and researchers have ruled out a seemingly likely ancient site as the source of the monolith.\n\nExplorations\n\nTake a closer look at these new findings:\n\n\u2014 A physics breakthrough means that scientists are closer than ever to creating a nuclear clock, which ticks so steadily that it won\u2019t lose a second even if it functions for 1 billion years.\n\n\u2014 Lab-grown cocoa and fermented fava beans could be used to create the guilt-free chocolate of the future to avoid rising cocoa prices and the detrimental effects of cocoa farms.\n\n\u2014 Rare, newly discovered fossils revealed that some species of massive ancient flying reptiles called pterosaurs soared like vultures, while others had a different flight style.\n\n\u2014 NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore believes he and fellow astronaut Suni Williams could have returned to Earth aboard Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule, which returned empty last week, \u201cbut we just simply ran out of time,\u201d he said.\n\nLike what you\u2019ve read?

It is complete with multiple expansive lava flows and surrounding volcanic deposits, spanning an area of approximately 112 by 112 miles \u2013 an impressive addition to Io\u2019s volatile surface.\n\nThis discovery not only marks the first close-up examination of Io\u2019s surface in over 25 years, but also adds to the ever-evolving story of this dynamic moon.\n\nThe findings were presented this week at the Europlanet Science Congress (EPSC) in Berlin, offering exciting new insights into Io\u2019s relentless volcanic activity.\n\nMany changes discovered on Io\n\nThe newly spotted volcano is situated just south of Io\u2019s equator in a region previously thought to be inactive.\n\nWhile Io is well known for its intense volcanic activity, with hundreds of active volcanoes dotting its surface, images captured during NASA\u2019s Galileo mission in 1997 revealed no evidence of volcanic structures in this particular area.\n\nInstead, the region appeared as a smooth, featureless landscape, devoid of any signs of the violent geological processes that now define it.\n\nMichael Ravine is the advanced projects manager at Malin Space Science Systems, Inc., the team responsible for designing and operating JunoCam for the NASA Juno Project.\n\n\u201cOur recent JunoCam images show many changes on Io, including this large, complicated volcanic feature that appears to have formed from nothing since 1997,\u201d said Ravine.\n\nDistinct characteristics of Io\u2019s new volcano\n\nThe eastern side of the volcano is marked by a diffuse red stain, the result of sulfur vented by the volcano and later settling back onto the surface.\n\nOn the western side, two dark lava flows stretch across the moon\u2019s landscape, each extending about 62 miles.\n\nAt the edges of the lava flows, intense heat has vaporized frozen surface material, creating two distinct grey circles where the lava has pooled.\n\nJunoCam\u2019s unparalleled view of Io\n\nJunoCam captured the best images of this feature on February 3, 2024, from a distance of 2,530 kilometers.\n\nThe image, taken in low light conditions with illumination provided solely by reflections from Jupiter, offers an unparalleled view of Io\u2019s nightside. The new volcanic feature lies just east of a previously known volcano, Kanehekili.\n\nThe observations are part of three recent flybys of Io in 2023 and 2024, during which JunoCam gathered close-up images of nine volcanic plumes.\n\nThe camera also documented new lava flows and surface changes, highlighting the ongoing geological transformations on Jupiter\u2019s moon.\n\nJunoCam\u2019s data is publicly accessible\n\nInterestingly, JunoCam\u2019s data is made available to the public almost immediately after being received on Earth. This means that anyone with an interest in space exploration can dive into the mission\u2019s findings.\n\nThe public is encouraged to access this data through the mission\u2019s website and create their own images of Jupiter and its moons, promoting a collaborative spirit that allows space enthusiasts to participate in the discovery process.\n\n\u201cJunoCam images are created by people from all walks of life, providing a way for anyone to join our science team and share in the excitement of space exploration,\u201d said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of NASA\u2019s Juno mission at Southwest Research Institute.\n\nScientific significance of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io\n\nOngoing observations of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io, particularly its volcanic activity, provide valuable insights into the internal processes of one of the most geologically active celestial bodies in the solar system.\n\nIo\u2019s extreme volcanic behavior, driven by tidal forces from Jupiter\u2019s gravity, helps scientists better understand how such forces shape the geology of moons and planets.\n\nThe new volcano on Io also offers clues about the moon\u2019s evolution and its unique volcanic landscape. Continued monitoring of Io will further reveal how its surface is constantly being reshaped by its fiery interior.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

A code does not guarantee tickets. Tickets will be sold on a first come first served basis.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the news ticketless fans had hoped to hear, with many taking to social media to vent their frustration.\n\n\u201c'I am so so sad - in the ballot but no code and 9 hours in ticket master queues,\u201d wrote one person on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely devastated\u201d agreed a second.\n\n\u201cNever been to a concert in my life and yours is the only one I ever wanted to go to,\u201d lamented a third.\n\nIt comes after many fans were shocked by standard tickets for the reunion tour more than doubling from \u00a3148 to \u00a3355 on Ticketmaster, prompting the Government and the UK\u2019s competition watchdog to pledge they will look into the use of dynamic pricing.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday the band said they hoped the new private ballot ticket sale strategy would make \u201cthe process far smoother for fans by reducing the stress and time it takes\u201d to obtain tickets.\n\nSaturday\u2019s sale for the extra two Wembley days will be broken into three slots across the day, running from 8.30am to 10am, 12pm to 1.30pm and 3.30pm to 5pm.\n\nSadly, that doesn\u2019t appear to have been the experience for many.\n\nOthers who were successful, including 17-year-old Nathan Palmer, expressed their excitement at securing a ballot code but worried at how tough the competition will be on Saturday to secure a ticket.\n\nHe previously queued for four Oasis tickets but \u201cby the time we got through the queue, Ticketmaster had already raised the prices from \u00a3140 to \u00a3360 each and we all thought that was way too much to be paying so we didn\u2019t get any\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe all signed up to this new presale ballot and only one of us got the code but on the email it says that the ticket prices will be definitely set between \u00a375-\u00a3200 which is more reasonable so we have a bit more hope that we will get tickets this time.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s sale for the extra two Wembley days will be broken into three slots across the day, running from 8.30am to 10am, 12pm to 1.30pm and 3.30pm to 5pm."

For this roundup, we didn't evaluate business lines of credit, invoice factoring/financing, merchant cash advances since they either have a long application process (like SBA loans) or act differently than a traditional term loan, which gives you a lump sum that you pay back over a fixed time period. We compared each small business loan on a range of features, including: Minimum and maximum loan amounts\n\nLength of term\n\nCredit score needed\n\nApplication requirements\n\nStreamlined application process\n\nFund disbursement\n\nCustomer support\n\nBetter Business Bureau rating\n\nCustomer reviews, when available The rates and fee structures for small business loans are subject to change without notice, and they often fluctuate in accordance with the prime rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee that the interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a small business loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require both personal and business proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more. You'll likely also need to put up collateral, which can include business equipment, real estate or personal assets.

        "article_content": "Last week, I was in Berlin with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold at the very start of my review period, and I wanted to write something about the camera ahead of it. I decided to do so by indulging in a photographic hobby of mine.\n\nWhen I travel, I like to take photos of cars, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was going to be my companion. It had better be up to the task, as other phones were waiting in the wings if it let me down.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCar-spotting in Berlin\n\nDespite the Pixel 9 Pro Fold having Pro in its name, it does not have the same camera as the Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 9. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5MP wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera for a 5x optical zoom. It\u2019s essentially the same as the Google Pixel Fold\u2019s camera setup, and on a technical level, it\u2019s not as impressive as the far less expensive (but much less foldy) Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nBut would it do what I wanted while in Berlin? I was in the city for the IFA 2024 technology trade show, and I stayed in close proximity to Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (or Ku\u2019damm for short), which is central, elegant, and packed with lovely places for coffee and food. It\u2019s also full of expensive designer stores, luxury watch brand boutiques, and all the cars accompanying those who shop there. Over the many years I\u2019ve stayed in this area, I\u2019ve always enjoyed some casual car-spotting, often to the chagrin of my colleagues.\n\nI\u2019m a car geek, so when I\u2019m in new places, I find it really enjoyable to spot cars I don\u2019t usually see at home. What makes Kurf\u00fcrstendamm enjoyable for me is the variety of cars you see cruising and parked up, ranging from supercars to modern classics in fantastic condition.\n\nA good car-spotting camera needs to take colorful, high-contrast, dynamic photos in all lighting conditions to highlight the metal. It really needs a telephoto camera, so you don\u2019t have to get right up close to the vehicle when taking a photo, keeping things more incognito. It also needs a robust editing suite and a big screen to make adjustments. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold should be a great choice, so how did it do?\n\nUsing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera\n\nOver the few days I was in Berlin, I took around 50 photos of different cars with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold \u2014 and I loved the results, regardless of whether I used the main, wide, 5x telephoto camera, or even the 2x non-optical zoom. I was consistently impressed with the speed of the camera, too, and although I didn\u2019t take many photos of cars on the move (more on that in a moment), I never missed a shot due to the camera or app being too slow.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I take photos of cars on the move? I had intended to try out Google\u2019s Action Pan mode, which adds a cool motion blur effect to moving objects, as I\u2019d enjoyed it on the Pixel 9 and Pixel 8. However, oddly, Action Pan is missing from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera app. Action Pan\u2019s sister mode, Long Exposure, is present though. There\u2019s no obvious technical reason why it\u2019s not included, and in this case, it was rather frustrating. Perhaps it\u2019ll turn up in a future software update.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes Maybach S680. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-AMG GT. Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz AMG G63. Wide-angle Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nWhat about the cars? It\u2019ll come as no surprise that two leading car brands dominate the Ku\u2019damm landscape: Mercedes Benz and Porsche. Porsches of all types are so prevalent that I stopped taking photos of 911s, as I\u2019d have spent most of my time capturing them if I hadn\u2019t done so.\n\nI didn\u2019t do the same with Mercedes as, despite seeing so many, the models were often highly unusual spots for me, as Ku\u2019dammers seem to love their high-performance Mercs. That said, on one day, the first five cars I considered photographing were all AMG GT models of various types, giving you an idea of how prevalent this particular car was in the area.\n\nThe cars and photos\n\nI didn\u2019t want to fixate on just supercars either, and I wanted to illustrate the variety of cars I saw, which I think speaks to the interesting car culture that I assume exists in Berlin and its surroundings. The convertible Mustang was a surprise, and although I didn\u2019t get photos as most were on the move when I saw them, the amount of Aston Martin and Jaguars, both new and old, illustrated that it wasn\u2019t solely about German cars either. Ferrari was notable in its absence, and the few I did see were easily outnumbered by Lamborghini and Bentley models. It was fantastic to see all these cars out and in use, particularly during the week.\n\nThe beautiful weather during my stay no doubt helped people bring out cars that may have otherwise been safely garaged, and it also helped out with my photos, as did the urban backdrop. I tried to incorporate Ku\u2019damm and its side streets into the photos, but there were times when a bit too much of it got in the way, and this is where the Pixel 9 Pro Fold became the ultimate companion for my car-spotting adventures on the move. For a start, opening the phone to view and then edit images on the large screen is amazing, and it simply can\u2019t be matched on a non-folding phone. Only editing on a laptop or tablet can compare, and I can carry neither in my pocket.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 6 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible. Wide-angle Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz SL (R129). Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz S Class. 2x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nOn the open screen I was able to make full use of Google Photos\u2019 Magic Editor mode, and wow, did it do some impressive things. My favorite is the wide-angle photo of the Mustang, which was interrupted by a street sign and some of the rental scooters that litter Berlin\u2019s streets when I took it.\n\nAmazingly, after a few careful swipes, Magic Editor took them all away without a trace. If I didn\u2019t point it out and show you the before image, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever realize. It also turned a photo I\u2019d have probably discarded into one I really like. I did the same with the background in the photo of the beautiful R129 SL, then removed the parked cars on either side of the white S Class, and was astonished by the clean, seamless result.\n\nNot a car-spotter?\n\nThis isn\u2019t our review of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or its camera, so all the photos you see here have been edited on the device using the tools found in Google Photos. Magic Editor has become incredibly adept at removing small distractions and re-creating backgrounds perfectly, and cleaning up the photos took just a few moments.\n\nBut I only wanted to edit the photos because they looked excellent to begin with, meaning I could tweak them to my taste rather than use the tools to try to reach an acceptable baseline. I\u2019ve managed to create a collection of photos I am really happy with that captures Berlin\u2019s obvious love of very powerful cars.\n\nWhen I came up with the idea of using car-spotting as the basis for my story on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold while in Berlin, it was with some trepidation. I take these photos for myself and fun, so I didn\u2019t want that to change. If the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a pain or didn\u2019t take the pictures I wanted, it would become an effort and effectively become work, with all the fun of car photography removed.\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen because the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a joy to hold and use. It\u2019s not annoyingly heavy, the software has been faultless, and I never wanted to reach for the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max I also had with me to take a photo. I enjoyed my occasional hobby of photographing cool cars I spot just as much, if not more than usual, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as my camera and Magic Editor at the ready.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a photo of a car and are wondering if all this is relevant to you, all the same principles and performance of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera and Google Photos apply to whatever you\u2019re photographing. I love the open screen when I want to see my photos after taking them, and the telephoto camera allows me to shoot my chosen subject in more visually exciting ways from a distance. The editing toolkit helped me easily create photos I wish had been possible in real life.\n\nRegardless of what you want to take photos of, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a great companion. My first few days with the phone and its camera have left me smitten, and it\u2019s looking like the start of a very positive review."

        "article_content": "NEW DELHI: India's transition towards cleaner energy solutions in the automobile sector will involve a mix of electric vehicles , hybrids, and plug-in hybrids, rather than exclusively relying on EVs, according to a report by Elara Securities.The Indian EV market has witnessed significant growth, with global EV sales reaching 14 million in 2023 and India witnessing a 90 per cent growth rate.The government has set a target of 30 per cent EV penetration by 2030, supported by the expansion of charging infrastructure , advanced battery management systems, and the introduction of new EV models.\"In the next 5-6 years, around 200,000 chargers will be needed, with 1 charger for every 50 vehicles. By CY30, connected car adoption is expected to reach 75-80 per cent, and ADAS adoption should hit 45 per cent, making BEV acquisition more attractive,\" said Gaurav Gupta, chief growth officer at JSW MG Motor India.The report further stated the emergence of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) as a key trend shaping the future of the Indian automotive sector. These vehicles integrate electronics, software, and electrical architecture into a unified system, enabling advanced features and services that can be monetized. This shift is pushing OEMs to adapt their business models from hardware-focused to software and smart solution-driven operations.Bevin Jacob, Partner & Co-Founder of Automobility, said, \"On-demand mobility services, powered by internet connectivity, electrification, autonomous driving, and mobility-as-a-service, represent a transformative development for the industry's future.\"The report said that India's automotive sector is on the cusp of a significant transformation, driven by technological advancements, collaborative efforts, and a strong focus on sustainable mobility. The transition to clean energy will involve a combination of EVs, hybrids, and plug-in hybrids, supported by a robust ecosystem of localized production and smart solutions."
