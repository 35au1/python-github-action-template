        "article_content": "It's never aliens.\n\nAt least, it hasn't been yet. The United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities heard testimony on Tuesday (Nov. 19) from Jon T. Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). The U.S. Department of Defense created the office in July 2022 in order to have a single place for military and government personnel to report UFO sightings, or UAP, as they're now known. The new term, short for unidentified anomalous phenomena, encompasses not only unidentified objects or events in the sky, but also those in water, in space or those that appear to travel between these domains.\n\nDuring today's hearing, Kosloski came in strong, stating that \"it is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.\" Still, despite having resolved hundreds of cases with prosaic explanations, Kosloski noted that his office does not believe that every UAP is a bird, balloon or drone. \"We do have some very anomalous objects,\" he said.\n\nA still from a video captured by a U.S.-operated drone in 2018 while flying above Mt. Etna appears to show an anomalous object, but the Pentagon's UFO chief says his office was able to solve the case. (Image credit: AARO/DOD)\n\nKosloski also reported on the office's latest analysis of UFO/UAP cases, stressing that his office will \"continue to follow the science and data wherever they lead\" and keep both Congress and the public as informed as possible \u2014 at the unclassified level, he clarified.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to testimony presented to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee last week, in which a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer told lawmakers that the American government is part of a decades-long coverup to conceal the fact that \"we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Kosloski gave an overview of his office's activities since it issued a report to Congress and testified in a similar setting last year. \"Many reports resolve to commonplace objects like birds, balloons and unmanned systems, while others lack sufficient data for comprehensive analysis,\" Kosloski said, adding that \"only a small percentage of reports received by AARO are potentially anomalous.\"\n\nKosloski referred to a UAP incident that occurred in 2013 near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The infrared video, shot in 2013 by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol helicopter, appears to show an object flying just above the ocean before disappearing into it, or perhaps splitting in two.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"We assessed that it was actually flying over the airport the entire time,\" Kosloski said. When the object appears to disappear in the infrared video that accompanies the case, it is actually the camera sensing that the object is the same temperature as the water behind it. Instead of splitting in two, it was simply two objects \u2014 balloons or sky lanterns \u2014 in close proximity that came in and out of view.\n\nKosloski also offered how his office was able to close the case on the infamous GOFAST video, shot by a U.S. Navy fighter jet in 2016 off the coast of Florida. In that case, the object's apparent speed in the video was actually due to the parallax effect, or the camera's perspective, Kosloski explained.\n\nFurthermore, the AARO director showed a 2018 video captured by a drone flying over Mt. Etna that he stated is not widely known among the public. \"This was a rather difficult case to solve,\" Kosloski said. \"The object was actually 170 meters away from the plume \u2014 not flying through it.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) asked Kosloski about whether or not some individuals who have encountered UAP might be reluctant to engage with his office, referring to accusations some UAP disclosure advocates frequently level against AARO. These critics attest that the office is part of an alleged decades-long U.S. government-led campaign of \"excessive secrecy\" that aims to keep the public in the dark about UFOs.\n\nIn response to Gillibrand's questioning, Kosloski defended his office. \"Congress has gone out of its way to create the organization AARO specifically to conduct these sorts of investigations, and has uniquely empowered them to have access to all UAP related information, whether that's historic or current, and we take that responsibility and those authorities very seriously,\" he said.\n\nGillibrand also asked about a report released by AARO in March 2024, noting that she has been told \"it doesn't show any any evidence of secret programs that have aliens.\"\n\nBut Gillibrand pushed back on that assertion. \"That's not how I read the report,\" the senator said. \"What I read in the report is the US government took sightings extremely seriously over the last 75 years, and put some of the greatest minds together to analyze these cases, because they assessed them as some deeply unknown phenomena that may or may not cause threats \u2014 that may or may not be related to adversaries.\"\n\nA still from a video reportedly showing a \"transmedium\" UAP that appears to travel between air and water and split in half. During testimony on Nov. 19, the head of the Pentagon's UFO office says it actually shows an infrared camera's inability to tell two objects' temperature apart from the ocean behind them. (Image credit: AARO/DOD)\n\nAARO released a report to accompany today's hearing earlier this week. The report, titled, \"All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office\u2019s Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena,\" examines UAP cases dated between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as historical incidents that were not included in previous reports.\n\nBut, like in its other reports, AARO found no smoking gun for alien visitation this year. \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report notes. Out of the 485 cases that are well within the report's timeframe, 118 were solved and another 174 were slated to be closed, pending a final review.\n\nStill, AARO's 2024 report says that many cases remain unsolved, and that the office continues to study them. However, AARO\u2019s ability to resolve cases \"remains constrained by a lack of timely and actionable sensor data,\" according to the report, meaning there just isn't enough data to conclusively solve cases that lack detailed or multi-sensor observations. In some cases, all there might be to analyze is a single photograph, a few seconds of grainy video or an aviator's written report. Many UAP sightings happen in the blink of an eye as an unknown object zooms past a moving aircraft, for example, so there often isn't enough time to gather photographic or video evidence.\n\nIn other cases, the capabilities of the sensors or platforms involved in the UAP sightings are themselves classified (sometimes, even their existence isn't publicly known), so AARO is unable to discuss them in unclassified reports.\n\nThough overall, according to the 2024 report, there is enough data for AARO to state that it has has \"no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nToday's hearing echoed a previous hearing held last year on April 19, 2023. During that hearing, AARO's previous director Sean Kirkpatrick told the Senate Armed Services Committee that his office has seen \"no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics.\"\n\nSimilarly, the report released by AARO in March 2024 that examined historical UFO cases found \"no evidence that any USG [U.S. government] investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.\"\n\nAARO's previous report, released in 2022, examined 510 contemporary UAP reports gathered from government agencies and branches of the United States military. The report found that, while most cases were able to be resolved, 171 remained a mystery.\n\n\"Some of these uncharacterized UAP appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis,\" AARO's 2022 report states.\n\nToday's hearing concluded with a discussion of recent incidents in which unidentified drones, or uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), were seen over U.S. military bases and other sensitive installations. Those incidents, Kosloski notes, underscore the need for the United States to have \"more persistent monitoring and understand that, whether it is a UAP or a counter-UAS issue, that we need to have that complete domain awareness around our national security facilities.\""

Why isn't UFO hearing tearing up Google trends? | Opinion\n\nYou would think if anything could break through the noise of our news cycle, UFOs could.\n\nThis needs to be a bigger deal folks because the American people, nay people of the world, need this right now.\n\nLast week, for the second time in two years, there was a Congressional subcommittee hearing on UFOs, or as they have been foolishly rebranded \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d shortened to UAPs.\n\nOne of the visionaries helping uncover the truth is none other than Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman, R-Fond du Lac, who chairs the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nEditorial: Hovde's election claims are false. He's blaming Milwaukee \u2013 without evidence.\n\nLast week\u2019s hearing, \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" including a new slate of witnesses who provided testimony about UFO sightings and what the government may or may not know about them. One witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence officer, went so far to say, \"Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nAlien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials now in Congressional Record\n\nLast year\u2019s testimony included former Pentagon official David Grusch telling a Congressional committee that he\u2019d learned of a decades-long Pentagon program focused on \u201ccrash retrieval and reverse engineering\u201d of UFOs from other planets. Grusch also said that remains found at the spacecraft crash sites were \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d\n\nYes, crashed alien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials made it to the Congressional Record.\n\nHowever, neither in the aftermath of last year's and last week's hearing did the terms \"UFO\" \"Alien\" \"UAP\" or even \"government coverup\" break the 25 most searched terms in Google Trends.\n\nWhat were people searching for last week? Would it surprise you if I said: \"mike tyson jake paul fight.\"\n\nTo be fair, neither of these hearings has provided real evidence to prove UFOs or UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. But the collection of testimony indicates that UAPs are very real in the sense there are a number of as-yet-unexplained phenomena.\n\nAnd yet, apparently, most of us do not care enough to let that information even make a blip on our news cycle.\n\nAll the more reason that right now is the right time for these tight-lipped folks in defense and intelligence departments, whose jobs could very well be on the chopping block anyways in Trump's administration, to just let it rip.\n\nDeclassify everything. Tell us the truth is out there. Then send Biden and Trump out to do a tag team Bill Pullman-Independence Day-esque speech, where they encourage us to not be consumed by our petty differences and instead be united in our common interests. Give us a new enemy!\n\nOr at the very least, declassify everything just to remind humans of our standing in the universe. I don't know who said it first but right now feels like a good time for everyone to remember that we\u2019re, \"just ghosts driving meat coated skeletons made from stardust riding a rock floating through space.\"\n\nKristin Brey is the \"My Take\" columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: House committee answers questions we've long had about ET | Opinion"

In corroborating much of the testimony Pentagon intelligence official David Grusch offered in July 2023, Elizondo also accused the Department of Defense of hiding its UFO programs from Congress while misappropriating funds to operate them.\n\nElizondo said in the House hearing that laws regarding classified information constrained him and Grusch from publicly presenting hard evidence to support claims of a crash-retrieval program, which the Pentagon has repeatedly denied exists.\n\nKosloski testified Tuesday that the AARO does not unilaterally declassify materials and that some photos and other evidence remain classified due to how it was obtained instead of what the information reveals.\n\nWhat is AARO?\n\nThe Pentagon has overseen AARO since its creation in 2022 and created a website for the office in 2023 to allow the public to access declassified UFO information.\n\nAARO has released a series of reports with findings on various UFO sightings, all of which end with the same conclusion: That no evidence has been found to suggest that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial in nature.\n\nIn its most recent report released Thursday, a day after the congressional UFO hearing, AARO studied 757 reports of UAP between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024.\n\n\"There are definitely anomalies,\" Kosloski admitted at a briefing last week, adding: \"We have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrial.\"\n\nAstrophysicists have long cautioned that the absence of obvious natural explanations for UFOs doesn't make otherworldly ones likely."

Its profile, called @Nvidia_AI_PC, is dedicated to RTX AI PCs and seems to be promoting AI for the average user. Its bio says, \u201cNvidia Powers the World\u2019s AI. And Yours with RTX AI PCs,\u201d and the first pinned post says, \u201cWhether you are deep into AI or just a little curious, we\u2019re here to explore the power of AI on your local PC.\u201d\n\nThe social media profile will deliver the latest news, tech, and AI inspiration from Team Green, with the aim of promoting AI tech on consumer devices. This is particularly important as it seems that most users still haven\u2019t figured out AI, with the majority buying an AI PC not because of its AI capabilities but because it\u2019s the only available option in 2024. And although Nvidia is the leading manufacturer of AI tech in the data center and enterprise world, it probably faces its fiercest competition in the consumer space, with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and even Apple all producing processors with built-in NPUs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe company has previously criticized AI PCs, saying that their performance is only good for basic AI workloads and that its GPUs offer better performance, achieving 100 to more than 1,300 TOPS, depending on the model. Furthermore, we\u2019ve been hearing news and rumors that Nvidia will soon launch an Arm-based processor in 2025, which was further fueled when the heads of Nvidia, TSMC, MediaTek, and Quanta were spotted having dinner before Computex 2024. Although it\u2019s easy to brush off this event as just industry leaders enjoying some time off, it could also be a cap to an informal agreement where Nvidia produces consumer AI CPUs, especially as these four companies are what you need to produce a laptop from scratch.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s no secret that Nvidia wants to enter the CPU market. It even attempted to buy Arm, the company behind the architecture of Snapdragon X and Apple M chips. Unfortunately, the deal was shot down by several government regulators, including the U.S.\u2019s FTC and the U.K.\u2019s CMA. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, the investment group that owns 90% of Arm, regret that they both did not take the opportunity to merge the two companies about a decade ago.\n\nThe company\u2019s move to launch the Nvidia AI PC account Twitter/X is one more sign that the company is trying to emulate its success in data center AI in the consumer space. If and when Nvidia launches its own AI CPU, it would add one more competitor in the processor market \u2014 a space that\u2019s increasingly becoming crowded with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all jostling for a bigger slice of the pie."

        "article_content": "Meta hired Salesforce\u2019s CEO of AI, Clara Shih, to lead a new organization building AI tools for businesses that use Meta\u2019s apps to reach consumers, according to a LinkedIn post from Shih on Tuesday. Meta confirmed the appointment and the new Business AI group in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to share today that I\u2019ve joined Meta to lead a new Business AI group,\u201d said Shih. \u201cOur vision for this new product group is to make cutting-edge AI accessible to every business, empowering all to find success and own their future in the AI era.\u201d\n\nAnother Salesforce AI executive, Adam Evans, will take over Shih\u2019s role overseeing the company\u2019s AI efforts, TechCrunch has learned. Evans is now the executive vice president and general manager of AI at Salesforce, according to his LinkedIn.\n\nMeta has an unusual business model around AI, claiming to use an open source approach, though not by everyone\u2019s definition of it. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company doesn\u2019t sell a subscription to its AI chatbots, like OpenAI or Google, in order to generate revenue. Instead, Meta is betting that its Llama large language models will make its current family of apps that much better. These AI tools for businesses seem to be part of that effort.\n\nSpecifically, Meta\u2019s new group will offer AI products made with Llama to the millions of businesses advertising and creating content on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. It\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of tools Meta could offer these folks, but offering tools to create AI-generated ads seems likely. Meta has recently pushed more AI-generated content into its social media feeds, including a carousel on Facebook of AI-generated photos, and AI chatbots imitating content creators on Instagram.\n\nThat\u2019s a notable shift for Meta\u2019s platforms, which previously only featured human-generated content. Giving businesses tools to cheaply generate more ads could be quite lucrative for Meta. It\u2019s unclear if Meta will sell these AI tools, or if they\u2019ll be offered for free as a way to drive up ad spending \u2014 the company\u2019s main source of revenue.\n\n\u201cWe believe these latest advancements in AI represent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers,\u201d said Meta\u2019s VP and Head of Monetization, John Hegeman, in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. \u201cThis new product group under Clara\u2019s leadership will help us bring that vision to life.\u201d\n\nShih previously led Salesforce\u2019s AI efforts, which have not exactly been a huge success. In May, Salesforce\u2019s shares dropped the most since 2008, largely because investors feared the enterprise giant had missed out on the AI boom. The enterprise giant told investors at the time it expected to have the slowest growth ever in the coming quarter. Since then, Salesforce has leaned hard into AI, releasing an AI agent developer platform called Agentforce. Its CEO, Marc Benioff, has even gone on the offensive, publicly taking shots at Microsoft\u2019s enterprise AI efforts.\n\nSalesforce did not immediately respond on the record to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\n\nNow it seems Shih will have a chance to start something new at Meta, a company she wrote a book about in 2009 called \u201cThe Facebook Era.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Barrie business owner says at least five deaths have occurred at former slaughterhouse, built in 1929, including suicides, goring and an explosion\n\nParanormal investigators Raif Boric and Krista Maryk of Walking Among Us recently filmed an episode of their popular YouTube series Walking Among us at Sanford and Son Emporium in Barrie.\n\n1 / 1 Paranormal investigators Raif Boric and Krista Maryk of Walking Among Us recently filmed an episode of their popular YouTube series Walking Among us at Sanford and Son Emporium in Barrie. Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, told BarrieToday the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford told BarrieToday, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, telling BarrieToday he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going. This thing would not stop with the motion-sensored cat balls and there were noises going on all in the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was standing there asking questions and we heard a little girl call out. We looked at each other like \u2018what the (heck) was that!?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoric said they went to explore where the sound came from, which is when he heard Maryk yelling from where she was in the building.\n\n\u201cWe started running back and she was where the doll was \u2026 and asked what all the banging was about,\u201d he said, adding neither he nor the employee\u2019s wife knew what his partner was talking about. \"We\u2019d just heard the kid\u2019s voice, which is where Shirley had heard disembodied voices in the area previously.\u201d\n\nBoric told BarrieToday it felt like a game of cat and mouse trying to track down the spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve encountered that a lot, and it sometimes gets a little annoying because you go thinking you\u2019re going to experience something and it just leads you around the building,\" he said. \u201cIt was a good experience and there was a plethora of (paranormal) activity.\"\n\nBoric ended up bringing the \u201chaunted doll\u201d home to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cI have her in the room with the other ones,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure her arm moved the other night, so I am setting up a security camera in the haunted room.\u201d\n\nSanford says she found the entire experience \u201cfascinating,\u201d adding she \"absolutely\" believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get scared over any of this stuff that happens. I am all for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen these guys came in, I saw it for myself. The white orbs and the one gentleman at the very end had forgotten something upstairs \u2026 When we got up there, one of the revolving showcases was on and (it) hadn\u2019t been on 15 minutes early when we\u2019d been up there.\u201d\n\nThe episode is expected to air on the Walking Among Us YouTube channel in January 2025."

        "article_content": "After some encouraging developments last season, Chad Ollinger was excited to get back to exploring for Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch. The popular Discovery Channel series meshes the paranormal with the historical, following Chad and his father Duane as they excavate the family\u2019s 160-acre property in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin. For more than a decade the Ollingers and their crew have worked through the grounds long rumored to sit atop an ancient hidden Aztec fortune. The search continues for Season 4.\n\nThey\u2019ve been led to believe the 500-year-old lost treasure is hidden in a vast system of underground caves buried deep within the property. Attention has turned to the mysterious keyhole-shaped cavern. A potential breakthrough and link to the fortune, which has motivated them to do all they can to find a viable way in. The plan is to work multiple sites simultaneously. The father-son duo has once again assembled its team including Eric Drummond, a renowned geologist. A $3 billion find could be around the corner. Not to mention the possibility that they may be stepping on what could have been the birthplace of the original Aztec civilization.\n\nBefore the adventure continues, Chad teases the dangers, discoveries, and revelations viewers can expect to see this season.\n\nHow were you feeling going into this season knowing some of the breakthroughs you\u2019ve had?\n\nChad Ollinger: I think the thing is we\u2019re finding so much stuff that keeps us on track. There are so many clues that lead us in a different direction. We really think the Aztecs were here. There is more and more proof with the artifacts we find. It all dates back to that era. It\u2019s really cool. We\u2019re also finding these cave entrances that further lead us to believe the Aztecs were there. It all keeps us going.\n\nHow would you describe the dynamic you have with your dad? There is such a bond there.\n\nI\u2019ve always worked for my dad ever since I was a kid. We\u2019ve worked on different projects together. This is just another one. I\u2019m super fortunate to work with my dad, especially on a project like this. It blows my mind we get to do some of the coolest stuff together. The memories we keep making are really cool. I feel fortunate to have this opportunity.\n\nHave you gotten pushback from other family members questioning why you keep doing this?\n\nGreat question. We do get some pushback from different family members for sure. They don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re still pushing for this, but it doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re just going to keep going.\n\nThe focus is on the key-shaped cavern. How would you say this space sets the stage for what unfolds this season?\n\nWe found clues that helped us get to this key-shaped cavern. Some of them are under water and some of them are above water. Any time we get close to a new discovery, it\u2019s like the land fights back. We\u2019re talking seismic activity and animals around. It\u2019s pretty frustrating. Also, it\u2019s common knowledge what happens out there.\n\nYou\u2019re also putting your life on the line with your exploration. I know there were a few close calls. Does it ever deter you to keep going?\n\nDefinitely in the back of my mind, I don\u2019t want to push it too far where I die. Though without risk there is no reward. I\u2019m definitely going to keep pushing and putting myself in hairy situations, which you will see this season. We found out the seismic activity is out there, but we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from. It has been happening for years we\u2019ve come to find out. We were in a cave one time and it got really scary really fast and we had to get out of there. That was a close call.\n\nWhat can you say in terms of some of your discoveries this season? I know in the teaser you uncover a human skull.\n\nWe found different stuff from the Aztecs. We found dinosaur bones as well. We did find a skull. We kind of think there was a sacrificial spot on the ranch too, but we don\u2019t know exactly what for. We know the Aztecs used to do a ritual as well. We\u2019re still trying to find out the purpose of it all.\n\nWho are the new faces we\u2019ll meet to help move the investigation forward?\n\nWe brought in Josh Feldman. Josh is a treasure hunter from Arizona. He has traveled the world finding a lot of amazing stuff. A great guy and big into mining. Any mining questions or ancient caves we find, he could automatically know who it was and what time era people were digging into there.\n\nHow is it for you to see the show resonate with audiences like it has? They are invested.\n\nIt\u2019s wild. I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d make it past Season 1 and we\u2019re on Season 4 now. It just blows my mind. I would never have guessed, but it\u2019s a hell of a ride.\n\nHow is it juggling your personal life? This demanding job certainly comes with sacrifice.\n\nIt has hindered different relationships for sure. We spend a lot of time up there. We travel quite a bit to research this project. It has been tough on relationships, but here we are.\n\nWhat are some of the big challenges you can say in terms of the paranormal forces?\n\nOne of the hindrances has been the paranormal for sure. We\u2019re right by Skinwalker Ranch, so we\u2019re starting to see different clues from that. The things we see and hear and smell is wild. I didn\u2019t believe in any of this stuff until I got up here. There is definitely something going on for sure. You can even ask the people around here. They all believe in this kind of thing because they\u2019ve experienced certain things that are weird. We experience it, too. It can hinder our path. We\u2019d find a big clue and it\u2019s almost like something weird happens all the time after. It\u2019s almost like something is being protected or guarded.\n\nHas there been any thought of having any crossovers with one of those ghost-hunting and haunting shows?\n\nWe have a couple of things going on, but not particularly. We\u2019re looking at doing spinoffs ourselves. We\u2019re looking at traveling to different places. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\nWhen do you feel you\u2019ll be satisfied with the work you\u2019re doing?\n\nGreat question. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a good question. As long as we\u2019re finding stuff that keeps us moving forward to the motherload, we\u2019re going to keep going. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll stop until we find this treasure.\n\nWhat do you want to tease to viewers before they watch this season?\n\nThis season is a hell of a ride. We\u2019re finding so many clues leading us to different caves. We have close calls the whole time. We\u2019re finding these ancient artifacts that keep us heading in the right direction. It will be a good season for sure.\n\nMystery at Blind Frog Ranch Season 4 premiere, November 20, 10/9c, Discovery Channel"

        "article_content": "Alan Wake 2 was the game that fully connected the entire Remedy universe, but it all started with Control. Set in The Oldest House, home of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), Jesse Faden became the new director as she used her transforming gun and powers to defeat the Hiss. A DLC chapter connected her with Alan Wake, and now another piece of DLC for Alan Wake 2 has shifted the focus back on the FBC. Control 2 is the next chapter of this dark and paranormal story unlike anything else on our list of upcoming video games. It will still be a while before we return to the world of altered items of objects of power, so thankfully we have games like Civilization VII and Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows to hold us over, but there\u2019s nothing that can scratch that specific itch Control did. This is our declassified document on everything we know about Control 2.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on the lookout for the best upcoming PS5 games, we\u2019ve got you covered there too.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRelease speculation\n\nThere\u2019s no word on when Control 2 will launch as of now. The game was first officially announced at the end of 2022 when it was first entering production, but in October of 2023 revealed that the game was still only in its \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d stage. Based on that, we might not see Control 2 until 2026 or later.\n\nPlatforms\n\nRemedy games since Quantum Break have never been platform-exclusive and we don\u2019t anticipate that changing for Control 2. You should expect to see it on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at least, but possibly Switch 2 as well.\n\nTrailers\n\nNo footage for Control 2 has been shared yet, but it sounds like Remedy may be ready to show us the game soon based on how much it is talking about it. Who we play as, where, and what we\u2019ll be doing is all up in the air.\n\nGameplay\n\nNews from our Capital Markets day: \ud83d\udd26 Alan Wake 2 has sold over 1.8M units\n\n\ud83d\udd3b Control Ultimate Edition will release on Mac February 12th, 2025\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Control 2 will be an action RPG\n\n\ud83c\udf81 Control will receive a free update in early 2025, unlocking some previously released content \ud83d\udd0e\u2026 pic.twitter.com/AX1jqpNTkt \u2014 Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) November 19, 2024\n\nThe only concrete detail we know about Control 2\u2018s gameplay is that it will be an action RPG. This was revealed by Remedy Entertainment itself, which lines up with how the first game played. It will also have a budget of approximately $52.9 million. This is low for most modern games, but quite a bit more than the first game\u2019s $30 million budget.\n\nControl 2 will almost certainly still be a third-person shooter with various weapon modes, psychic powers, and skill trees. How Remedy expands on those elements or what it decides to add is yet to be seen.\n\nPreorder\n\nThere will be no preorder details until Control 2 has a solid release date. As soon as they are available, we will update this article."

        "article_content": "Data engineers face numerous challenges in managing large datasets, maintaining quality control, and handling complex workflows, which can impede productivity. \u201cAlmost 70-80% of the work involves data preparation, engineering, and standardisation. It\u2019s all manual work, and frankly, the most painful activity,\u201d said DataSwitch chief Karthikeyan Viswanathan in an exclusive interview with AIM.\n\nHandling data from diverse sources presents a major obstacle for engineers managing multiple-source extractions. Beyond collection, ensuring quality and consistency across these varied inputs remains critical, as poor data can lead to flawed insights and decisions.\n\nHowever, the task is easier said than done. Merging data from different sources in varied formats and schemas is a labour-intensive job often involving custom coding and manual scripting.\n\nA frequent gripe is that data engineers spend much of their time buried in code and debugging, leaving little room for true innovation. Therefore, as data volumes continue to surge, scalable and efficient data pipelines become essential.\n\n\u201cData engineering is more than just writing pipelines with SQL and Python. It\u2019s about solving business problems and delighting end-users,\u201d said Zach Morris Wilson, the founder of Dataexpert.io. He added that data engineers who understand the business they\u2019re working in have a significant advantage because they know when to say no to low-value requests.\n\nA data engineering professional on X pointed out, \u201cWe have a data engineering problem. AI keeps getting better, but the inputs needed are trash or hard to get. The big money is going to be in securing the best quality data possible.\u201d\n\nToday, every enterprise wants to use AI, but most data isn\u2019t ready for it. This disconnect between AI aspirations and data readiness can result in failed projects, wasted resources, and missed opportunities.\n\nSeveral challenges hinder enterprise AI readiness, including data silos, quality issues, lack of governance, integration difficulties, and the overwhelming volume and velocity of data generated daily.\n\nTo bridge the gap between current data states and AI readiness, enterprises should focus on establishing an AI vision and data strategy, implementing robust data governance, improving data quality, developing scalable infrastructure, prioritising data integration, adopting DataOps practices, and investing in data engineering talent.\n\nInterestingly, a Gartner report highlights that synthetic data generated with generative AI could reduce the volume of real data needed for machine learning by half by 2024. The report recommends building AI into all capabilities, including data ingestion, data quality, cost monitoring, insight generation, and sharing, to address bottlenecks and accelerate data and analytics pipelines.\n\nDS Integrate to the Rescue\n\nThis is where DS Integrate comes into play. It offers a user-friendly interface with pre-built connectors and functionalities, enabling businesses to ingest data from various sources and transform it into a usable format without extensive coding expertise.\n\nIts toolkit supports various data formats, including structured and unstructured data, from sources such as PDFs, images, and text files. By automatically generating code for data catalogue creation, DS Integrate greatly minimises the manual effort needed for data preparation.\n\n\u201cWith no code, DS Integrate will reduce the dependency on core technology personnel, allowing business professionals themselves to perform data analysis. That is one of the objectives; it\u2019s not that DataSwitch is killing jobs,\u201d said Viswanathan.\n\nHe stressed that to get the most out of AI, the data must be well-prepared. According to him, this means prioritising both \u201cAI for data\u201d and \u201cdata for AI\u201d and making the processes more self-serviceable. \u201cWe want to make our customers\u2019 data ready, standardised, and prepared for AI use, as this is a common challenge every enterprise faces,\u201d he said.\n\nDS Integrate automatically generates code to create a knowledge base in a format compatible with cloud databases such as Spark, Talend, Matillion, DataBricks, and more.\n\nAlso, after standardising data, DS Integrate enables users to convert raw data into valuable insights without requiring advanced coding skills. This approach, termed Citizen Data Engineering, dramatically improves accessibility to data engineering and encourages innovation and agility, facilitating quick adaptation to changing market dynamics.\n\nEven though data engineering is a tough job, it is highly sought after. According to AIM Research, 10,593 job openings for data engineers across industries were listed on online job portals.\n\n(Total 107 views)"

        "article_content": "Networks have long been the backbone of IT infrastructure, crucial for enterprise environments, much like electricity is to modern life. Traditionally seen as commodities, they were evaluated mainly on bandwidth, speed, reliability, complexity, and cost. However, the landscape is changing, with modern enterprises redefining their networks. Instead of just conduits for data, networks are becoming dynamic hubs of insight and automation. This shift is driven by advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, software-defined networking (SDN), cloud-controller-based networks, AIOps, observability, and generative AI.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe Evolution of Networks\n\nDissolved Enterprise Boundaries\n\nTraditionally, enterprise IT boundaries were clearly defined by firewalls. Today, these boundaries have blurred with the advent of \"Anytime, Anywhere, AnyDevice\" access models facilitated by cloud computing. The shift from an 80:20 private-to-public traffic ratio has inverted, propelling us into an era where \"Everything is on the Internet.\" This necessitates intelligent traffic path selection and integrated security, evolving Wide Area Networks (WANs) into Software-Defined WANs (SD-WANs).\n\nAdvertisment\n\nDistributed Data\n\nGone are the days when enterprise data was centralized within fortified private data centers. Modern enterprises leverage multi-cloud environments and edge computing, distributing data to remote locations while complying with country-specific regulatory requirements. This shift enhances digital adoption and drives the need for networks to manage dispersed data efficiently.\n\nAccelerated Digital Transformation\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe rapid pace of digital transformation, fueled by Industry 4.0, IoT, RPA, AI, and big data solutions, demands that networks keep up. Whether it's omnichannel marketing in retail, telemedicine in healthcare, or digital twins in manufacturing, networks must support the performance requirements of these advanced applications.\n\nTransforming Network Operations\n\nBeyond Connectivity\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe expectation from modern networks extends beyond basic connectivity. They must now address critical business concerns\u2014user experience, reliability, security, and uptime\u2014while grappling with transformations in software-defined solutions, cloud integration, AI, digital adoption, and cybersecurity.\n\nTo meet these demands, networks need to evolve continuously. They must become more than just data transporters; they need to sense, analyze, and transform. Here's how:\n\nBe a Sensor\n\nAdvertisment\n\nModern networks must be aware not only of the source and destination of data but also of various critical parameters:\n\nApplication Awareness: Understanding what data packets contain and ensuring efficient delivery to meet performance expectations.\n\nEndpoint Awareness: Identifying the types of devices generating traffic is crucial for security and performance management.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nUser, Location, and Time Awareness: Knowing who is accessing the network, from where, and when, to ensure authorized use and enhance security.\n\nBe an Analyzer\n\nNetworks should go beyond basic monitoring to observe, collect data, measure performance, and deliver actionable insights. Techniques like flow collection, traffic mirroring, and synthetic monitoring enable predictive user experiences. Modern networks must offer hop-by-hop performance measurement and deep analytics.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nBe a Transformer\n\nIntelligence in networks is driven by AI and machine learning, which analyze telemetry data to predict performance, capacity needs, and potential issues. Automation, aided by AI, plays a crucial role in building self-healing networks. Low-code/no-code automation tools and open-source scripting options accelerate network automation. Enterprises should move from point-based automation to comprehensive, catalog-based solutions, ultimately adopting frameworks like NetDevOps and Network as Code.\n\nThe Elixir for Self-Healing Networks\n\nWhile no single tool can address all network challenges, transforming networks into insightful, intelligent, and self-healing entities requires a strategic combination of technologies and approaches:\n\nAdopt Software-Defined Solutions: SDN and SD-WAN technologies provide flexibility and control over network traffic.\n\nImplement Observability Tools: Advanced analytics and telemetry tools offer deep insights into network performance and user experiences.\n\nLeverage AIOps and GenAI: These technologies provide predictive analytics and automation capabilities, enabling networks to self-heal and optimize.\n\nBuild a Robust Automation Platform: Comprehensive automation frameworks ensure end-to-end execution of tasks and seamless integration of intelligent infrastructure information.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe shift from basic connectivity to dynamic networks is not just technological\u2014it's strategic. Modern enterprises must see networks as central to their digital ecosystems, enhancing business agility, efficiency, and data strategies. By integrating advanced technologies and adopting holistic network management, businesses can unlock their networks' full potential. This transformation makes networks foundational for digital transformation, supporting multi-cloud and hybrid workspaces.\n\nAuthored by Saju Sankarankutty, Senior Vice President and Unit Technology Officer, Cloud and Infrastructure Services, Infosys"

        "article_content": "Darien Craig and Brandon Echols have known each other since they were 6 years old in small-town Hayden, Alabama. They attended the same high school and even dropped out of college in tandem, they said on Friday's episode of ABC's \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nDuring that episode, the pair hit another milestone together: agreeing to an investment offer for their jointly owned business. Craig and Echols co-own Y'all Sweet Tea, which Craig founded in 2021 \u2014 after getting fired from his previous job, he wrote on his company's website.\n\n\"The week I got fired, I had $7 to my name,\" wrote Craig. \"With the last paycheck I received, I used the $300 from that check to purchase the first jars, sugar, and tea that would eventually catapult this idea.\"\n\nY'all sells its tea direct-to-consumer and in roughly 600 grocery store locations, mostly across the southeastern United States, Echols said on \"Shark Tank.\" It brought in $4 million in revenue, including nearly $800,000 in profit, last year, he added.\n\nThose numbers included a detail that the show's investor judges found particularly interesting: Y'all added flavored teas to its lineup last year, and sold 10,000 units of its first flavor, \"Georgia Peach,\" in just 35 minutes, Craig said. The first eight of those minutes were responsible for $100,000 in sales, he noted.\n\n\"When you're dropping that amount in that short period on your own site, that's rare,\" Kevin O'Leary said. Barbara Corcoran chimed in: \"Do you know how few entrepreneurs can make that claim?\"\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"That is beautiful. That is like beauty,\" Mark Cuban added.\n\n'You don't need me to tell you how to run this business'\n\nCraig and Echols asked the investors for $500,000, in exchange for a 5% equity stake in their company. Guest investor Rashaun Williams, a venture capitalist and minority-stake owner of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, quickly offered them $500,000 for 10%.\n\n\"I'll let you figure out if you want to go to Walmart, if you want to stay direct-to-consumer, or what balance of both,\" said Williams. \"You don't need me to tell you how to run this business ... I think you guys are a rocket ship.\"\n\nCuban and Corcoran bowed out. Y'all was a better fit for Williams' investment style, Cuban said: Craig and Echols noted that they hoped to eventually find an exit for their company, and a professional VC investor could help them grow enough to get acquired or go public.\n\nBut O'Leary wanted in. He proposed a joint offer with Williams \u2014 $500,000 for 20% of Y'all, which the two investors would split down the middle.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lori Greiner added another joint offer with Williams to the table: $500,000 for 15% of Y'all. O'Leary promptly lowered his offer to match.\n\nCraig asked if any of the investors would chip in another $250,000. They declined, with Williams saying Y'all could always raise more money in the future. After quickly deliberating, Craig and Echols accepted Greiner and Williams' joint offer \u2014 prioritizing the combination of Williams' VC knowledge and Greiner's retail experience over the stronger financial terms of Williams' solo proposal.\n\nThe quartet officially inked the deal at Greiner and Williams' proposed terms after the show's taping, Craig confirmed to CNBC Make It.\n\n\"Rashaun is an awesome businessman and Lori has so much experience in retail,\" Echols said on the show. \"It couldn't have been a better deal.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to include Craig's post-taping confirmation of the investment deal.\n\nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nWant to earn more money at work?
