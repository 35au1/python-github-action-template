This allows for faster decision-making and more efficient use of resources before committing to full-scale development.\n\nMaximizing Xcode and Swift Potential\n\nXcode remains the foundation of iOS app development, providing a robust and comprehensive environment for building sophisticated applications. Swift, the programming language used within Xcode, offers a perfect blend of intuitiveness and power, making it accessible to developers across various skill levels.\n\nThe integration of AI tools with Xcode opens up new possibilities:\n\nAutomated code suggestions and completions\n\nIntelligent debugging assistance\n\nPerformance optimization recommendations\n\nEnhanced code refactoring capabilities\n\nThese AI-driven features not only accelerate the development process but also contribute to producing cleaner, more efficient code. As a result, you can focus more on creative problem-solving and less on repetitive coding tasks.\n\nBuilding Apple iOS app with AI\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of coding using artificial intelligence :\n\nNavigating the App Development Journey\n\nWhen embarking on your app development journey, starting with a simple, focused application is often the most effective approach. Consider beginning with a straightforward one-page app, such as a note-taking application. This approach allows you to:\n\nGrasp fundamental iOS development concepts\n\nUnderstand data storage mechanisms on iOS devices\n\nGain hands-on experience with user interface design\n\nLearn the basics of app deployment and testing\n\nBy initially focusing on local data storage, you can sidestep the complexities of backend setups, allowing for a more streamlined learning process. Testing your app on personal devices is a crucial step in this journey, allowing you to identify and address issues early in the development cycle.\n\nOvercoming Challenges and Seizing Opportunities\n\nWhile publishing apps on the App Store can present challenges due to stringent policies, the development and testing phases offer significant opportunities for growth and refinement. AI tools play a pivotal role in this process by:\n\nAccelerating the prototyping and iteration cycles\n\nProviding data-driven insights for feature optimization\n\nOffering predictive analysis for potential user engagement\n\nAutomating certain aspects of quality assurance testing\n\nThese AI-driven capabilities allow you to refine your app\u2019s features swiftly and efficiently, ensuring a higher quality product when it comes time for App Store submission.\n\nEnhancing Design with Vzer and AI\n\nVzer has emerged as an indispensable tool in the app developer\u2019s arsenal, particularly for crafting intuitive interfaces and compelling landing pages. Its ability to assist the forking and sharing of prototypes fosters a collaborative environment conducive to rapid iteration and improvement.\n\nAI integration in design tools like Vzer offers several benefits:\n\nGeneration of innovative design concepts\n\nAutomated layout suggestions based on best practices\n\nColor scheme recommendations for optimal user experience\n\nPredictive analysis of user interaction patterns\n\nBy using these AI-powered features, you can significantly enhance both the aesthetic appeal and functional design of your app, leading to improved user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Community Feedback\n\nCommunity feedback stands as a critical component in the app development journey. Engaging with users throughout the development process helps ensure that the final product aligns closely with user needs and expectations. AI can enhance this process by:\n\nAnalyzing user feedback to identify common themes and priorities\n\nPredicting potential user reactions to proposed features\n\nFacilitating more targeted and efficient A/B testing\n\nAutomating the organization and categorization of user suggestions\n\nConsider implementing feature contests or beta testing programs to boost community involvement. This approach creates a collaborative environment where users feel invested in the app\u2019s success, leading to more loyal and engaged user base.\n\nFrom Concept to Reality: The AI-Powered Journey\n\nThe transition from initial idea to functional prototype represents a critical phase in app development. AI tools have democratized this process, making it accessible to individuals with diverse skill sets and backgrounds. By using AI throughout the development journey, you can:\n\nRapidly iterate on design concepts\n\nStreamline the coding process\n\nOptimize app performance more efficiently\n\nMake data-driven decisions about feature implementation\n\nThese AI-powered capabilities not only accelerate the development process but also contribute to creating more innovative, user-centric applications.

        "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAI-generated images are more impressive than ever, with some even winning photography awards and fooling experts in the process. The best part? You don\u2019t need to be a professional artist or have any technical skills to create them. But not all AI image generators are created equal \u2014 some excel at realism, while others are riddled with easy-to-spot errors. One thing is for sure: very few can generate text reliably. To find the best one then, I pushed each AI image generator with successively challenging prompts. Here are my findings.\n\nWhich is the best AI image generator?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nFinding the best AI image generator is difficult since the results can vary wildly from one prompt to another. However, we know that generative AI tech tends to struggle in certain areas more than others so we can tailor our prompts to highlight these weaknesses and see where each one shines \u2014 or fails. Virtually all image generators can handle simpler art styles so I\u2019ll limit testing to realistic scenes this time.\n\nIf you ever need to stress test an AI image generator, try asking for images with intricate details like hands, hair, or text. Only a handful of them can handle these well, with others often producing distorted or unrealistic results. Another good test is complex scenes with multiple subjects or unusual perspectives, which tend to trip up even the best models.\n\nWith that in mind, I decided to test a handful of different AI image generators. Specifically, I picked Google\u2019s Imagen 3, Meta\u2019s Imagine, DALL-E 3 via Microsoft Designer and ChatGPT, and Grok. And for my first prompt, I asked for an image of a person crying. This request may seem too surface, but the result variance was fascinating.\n\nPrompt 1: A person crying, with tears streaming down their face\n\nMicrosoft Designer / DALL-E 3 Meta Imagine Google Imagen 3 ChatGPT / DALL-E 3 Grok\n\nAs you can already tell, images from different AI models look nothing alike. While part of this is because my prompt was rather vague, every image generator I tested was also trained on a different dataset. Meta used public images from Facebook and Instagram, for example, while it\u2019s less clear how most other companies obtained their training datasets.\n\nReplicating anatomy has always been tricky for AI image generators and these results only proves that fact. Google\u2019s Imagen 3 produced an extremely convincing result, with others like Meta\u2019s Imagine generated . I retested this prompt with minor variations to improve the sample size but Imagen 3 did win every single time.\n\nMicrosoft Designer uses OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 under the hood, meaning it should produce similar results as ChatGPT. And that proved to be true in my testing, with both services delivering decent results.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3, followed by DALL-E 3\n\nPrompt 2: An action-packed scene of two dancers mid-performance in a rain-soaked street\u2026\n\nMeta Imagine Google Imagen 3 Microsoft Designer Grok ChatGPT / DALL-E 3\n\nI increased the complexity and detail of my prompt this time, while keeping human subjects in the frame. Imagen 3 yielded an excellent result once again, only faltering with one subject\u2019s fingers. On the other hand, Meta\u2019s Imagine botched one dancer\u2019s limbs and face entirely and I would consider the result unusable.\n\nMicrosoft Designer offered cartoon-style results, which looked passable but wasn\u2019t what I was looking for. ChatGPT\u2019s attempt was much worse, with an extra limb sprouting out of one dancer. Thankfully, Grok swung the pendulum back with a reasonable result besides the dancers\u2019 interlocked fingers.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3 / Grok\n\nPrompt 3: Generate an image of an Airbus A380\u2026taxiing down a runaway with tropical trees in the background.\n\nMicrosoft Designer Google Imagen 3 Meta Imagine Grok ChatGPT / DALL-E 3\n\nI may sound like a broken record at this point but Imagen 3 continues to decimate the competition. Even though this prompt requires the AI to generate text on the fuselage, Google\u2019s model handled it with ease. The airline\u2019s name is replicated perfectly and aside from the odd runway taxiway markings, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell that the image has been AI generated.\n\nGrok delivered a similarly impressive result, although not on the first try, and still garbled some windows on the plane\u2019s upper deck. The chatbot uses a relatively new image generator called Flux, created by the researchers who developed Stable Diffusion. Given the latter\u2019s reputation in the image generator space, it\u2019s no surprise that Grok can produce excellent results.\n\nUnfortunately, the other AI image generators delivered sub-par to comically bad results here. Meta\u2019s Imagine spit out garbled text and the wrong plane. DALL-E 3 via ChatGPT almost nailed the text on the side of the plane but generated malformed runway markings. Microsoft Designer uses the same DALL-E 3 model but somehow delivered even worse-looking unrealistic images.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that adding terms like \u201cphotorealistic\u201d or \u201cHD\u201d did little to make the AI-generated results any more authentic-looking or lifelike. The impact was minimal at best, even though it\u2019s standard practice to include these terms as part of good prompting.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3, followed by Grok\n\nPrompt 4: Famous personalities\n\nGrok Grok\n\nA lot has been said about the dark side of AI image generators and their ability to sway public opinion through false narratives. To combat this problem, most generative AI platforms now have guardrails preventing you from requesting images that mimic a specific person.\n\nUnsurprisingly then, my prompt was turned down by every single AI image generator \u2013 except Grok. Elon Musk created Grok as a maximum \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI, which is just marketing speak for a chatbot with fewer guardrails than its competitors. This lack of restrictions extends to AI-generated images, as well, which means you could technically generate images of world leaders, celebrities, and even Musk himself in questionable settings.\n\nWinner: Grok by default\n\nWhich AI image generator do I recommend?\n\nMany of the AI image generators I tested have unique strengths that make them better than the rest, so here\u2019s my top pick depending on my priorities. Quality : Google\u2019s Imagen 3 may not have the most recognizable brand name of all the AI image generators on this list, but it stands out for delivering realistic images and extremely believable results. The only downside is that you only get one image at a time and the AI processing can take several seconds each time you send in a prompt.\n\n: Google\u2019s Imagen 3 may not have the most recognizable brand name of all the AI image generators on this list, but it stands out for delivering realistic images and extremely believable results.

Speed : Meta Imagine stands out if you need a quick image since you don\u2019t even need to hit the Enter key to see a result. The tool generates an image within a second of typing in a prompt, which feels almost instantaneous compared to other offerings on this list.\n\n: Meta Imagine stands out if you need a quick image since you don\u2019t even need to hit the Enter key to see a result.

Cost : With so many AI image generators available today, is paying for one even worth it? Doing so will unlock some nice features, since AI image editing is typically locked behind subscription services like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and DALL-E 3. For simple AI image generation, though, I\u2019d recommend Imagen 3, Meta Imagine, and Microsoft Designer.\n\n: With so many AI image generators available today, is paying for one even worth it?

Censorship: Grok offers one of the easiest AI image generators with some of the least restrictions, so it\u2019s worth a try. The only downside is that you\u2019ll need an X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) subscription to use the service. From a practical standpoint, though, the best AI image generator may very well be the one already on your device. For example, Meta AI is already integrated within WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. If you already use either app, Meta Imagine should serve you for basic image generation needs.\n\nLikewise, the Pixel 9 series ships with Google\u2019s new Pixel Studio app powered by Imagen 3. Alternatively, you can also request AI-generated images via the Gemini app on any Android device. The latter still uses the last-gen Imagen 2 for now, but it will move up to Google\u2019s latest model soon.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

It has similar paraphernalia on top and Ghostbusters stickers on the side.\n\nHe bought the 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor from someone in Glenrock a few years ago. He renamed it the \u201cEcto Interceptor.\u201d\n\nA hospital security guard when not busting ghosts, McDaniels had his uniform on when he initially drove the unmodified car. Wyoming Highway Patrol pulled him over, thinking he might be trying to impersonate a police officer.\n\nGhostbuster Interceptor\n\n\u201cI thought I should probably make this car less cop like and more something fun. And I had always wanted to have a Ghostbusters car, so I started to put stickers on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell then I thought, now I\u2019ve got to build a top in it, it can\u2019t just be stickers right? So, I started piecing together bit by bit the roof rack and housing and built all that out. There is one piece of pipe up that\u2019s up there being held onto the roof by a toilet flange.\u201d\n\nOnce he had his wheels, as well as the \u201cECTOI\u201d license plate, the doors opened for him to use it for fundraisers and to market his ghost removal side gig.\n\nOctober becomes the busy season. There is a \u201cTouch a Truck\u201d event on Oct. 12 at the Excel Academy Private School that allows kids to get in the vehicle, turn on the sirens, read the special tag fastened on the dash that labels the machine as belonging to Wyoming Ghostbusters, and check out the glove compartment.\n\n\u201cThere is a ghostbuster\u2019s employee handbook and a little canister of ectoplasm slime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids like to play with all that stuff.\u201d\n\nHe also plans to be at a car show and food drive at the Izaak Walton Clubhouse in Casper on Oct. 18 and end the month on Oct. 25, 27 and 28 with actual ghostbusting demonstrations at the Casper Elks Lodge No. 1353 where he said the equipment used by paranormal investigators will be explained and a walk through of the lodge will be conducted.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m discussing a fundraiser for a lady that is trying to fight cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try and kind of use the car as a way to help people out.\u201d\n\nAs in the movie, McDaniels and some other members of the team have uniforms and he and a buddy have the proton packs used in the last version of the film series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the iconic part of Ghostbusters history, it gets people excited,\u201d he said.\n\nSupernatural Missions\n\nIn addition to the fundraising, and parties, McDaniels also has been on an estimated 15 missions to identify or remove potential paranormal spirits in places around the region and state.\n\nHe recently was called to a Casper home where the owners discovered a set of footprints on concrete that went from a pickup truck to the garage door and then just vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat it looked like was that somebody had walked through a puddle of grease, made about four or five steps to the garage door and then nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels pulled out his EMF meter that measures electro-magnetic energy and found it registered a few points over the footprints and faded when pulled away from them. He checked to see if there were any internet routers or other source of energy nearby that would trigger the meters. There were none.\n\nOther tools in his ghostbusting toolbox include REM-Pod devices that reflect electromagnetic field changes and air temperature changes and a specialized SLS (Structured Light Sensor) camera that uses infrared light. It can 3D map areas in front of it \u201cso we can see things the human eye might miss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also uses other cameras that can capture images in ultraviolet, infrared, and the normal spectrum of light.\n\nAt the garage, McDaniels set up some REM Pods around the area to see if anything would trigger them. Nothing happened. Photos with the infrared camera found nothing.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always that way. McDaniels tells the story of being called to a Casper home about five blocks from the cemetery with a man experiencing doors being slammed in his home for no reason.\n\n\u201cHe said he was sitting on the couch one day and he felt like his leg started to burn,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHe looked down and it looked like a handprint had been slapped on his thigh. So, we got to go down and work with that.\u201d\n\nThe man requested that McDaniels and his team bless the house. McDaniels said he has studied different spiritual beliefs including druidism and another team member is a Norse shaman.\n\n\u201cPeter McDaniel turned a former police interceptor into his Ecto Interceptor.

(Courtesy Peter McDaniels) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nStubborn Spirit\n\nTheir attempts to get rid of the spirit by blessing the house did not work. He claims it was forced into a back room. McDaniels had read about a dybbuk box used in Jewish tradition that is supposed to be able to contain a spirit. So, he tried using one.\n\n\u201cWe kind of forced this thing into the dybbuk box and sealed it,\u201d he said. McDaniels said as he was talking to the man at the house, he placed the box by the front tire of his Ghostbuster car and the tire deflated. He had to pump it up to leave.\n\nThere was another hurdle as well. Weather at the time was cold and the ground hard, so he couldn\u2019t bury the box as would be his practice. So, he kept it in a storage area at his house. McDaniels noticed the wax seal that he put on the box kept cracking. He needed to keep sealing it nearly every day.\n\nThen his radio started to flip on in his house at random times and the song coming out of the speakers would have a lyric such as \u201cset me free\u201d or \u201clet me loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, no buddy, that\u2019s not how this works,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cAs soon as it was warm enough we went and buried the box and all of that stopped afterwards.\u201d\n\nHe said the man in the house never had issues again as well.\n\n\u2018Get Out\u2019\n\nThe 39-year-old talks about an incident several years ago when he went to a trailer in the \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d as he was receiving training from a woman he labels a \u201cChristian witch.\u201d\n\nThe trailer sat on a plot of land that was said to have had a Native American burial ground underneath it. He said he entered the trailer and it was dark and he was trying to feel his way around and made it to a bedroom and sat on the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of sitting there trying to feel things out and I felt the bed depress behind me like someone was standing on it and then I hear the words \u2018get out\u2019 whispered in my ear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, I calmly stood up, and I walked out the front door and I got into the car next to the lady that was helping us. And she said, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018nope,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt scared me, oh man, it scared me.\u201d\n\nDale Killingbeck can be reached at dale@cowboystatedaily.com."

        "article_content": "This article is a guest blog from the founders of Detroit Paranormal Expeditions (DPX), Jeff Adkins and Todd Bonner. DPX researches and investigates reportedly haunted locations to help explain the causes of the phenomena experienced there. DPX has appeared on Travel Channel's Paranormal Survivor, Haunted Case Files, Paranormal 9-1-1, Most Terrifying Places, Paranormal Caught on Camera and Destination FEAR, as well as on Local 4.\n\nPeople always ask us, what are DPX\u2019s favorite haunted places in the state? We decided to do something fun and come out with our list of haunted pubs, bars and restaurants.\n\nOver the course of 2021 we visited and researched these amazing places! Some of the criteria we used to determine our list was history, ambiance, personal stories, our own experiences, atmosphere and the reported hauntings. The stories we heard from each of these locations was really interesting and we found out things we didn\u2019t know! We hope you enjoy and we recommend checking them out for yourself.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMost haunted bars and restaurant in Michigan\n\nTwo Way Inn, Detroit\n\nTwo Way Inn, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nBuilt in 1873 and known as Detroit\u2019s oldest bar, it opened as a saloon in 1876 and also served as a general store, stagecoach, railroad station, hotel, jail, dance hall, and possibly a brothel. During Prohibition, the Two Way was owned by a dentist, which is significant because doctors could prescribe up to a pint of whiskey every 10 days for pain under The Volstead Act. There have been several deaths in the building throughout its lifetime.\n\nOne of the apparitions reportedly seen here is a cowboy with a long white beard and cowboy hat, who many believe to be the spirit of Col. Philetus Norris, the building\u2019s former owner. He was not only a bar owner, but also a Union spy during the Civil War, an archaeologist and a superintendent at Yellowstone National Park.\n\nRelated: \ud83d\udd12 Detroit ghost hunters share 5 scariest paranormal experiences\n\nNancy Whiskey\u2019s, Detroit\n\nNancy Whiskey's, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nNancy Whiskey\u2019s dates back to 1902. According to staff and regulars, this 119-year-old pub is believed to be haunted by no fewer than three spirits. Some of the activity reported includes disembodied voices when staff are closing and all guests have left, mirrors breaking on their own, and much more.\n\nJust inside the doorway is an old phone booth, which was reportedly used by Jimmy Hoffa on a regular basis. It\u2019s also possible that members of the Digby family, who opened the general store on this site in 1902, still remain to this day.\n\nCadieux Cafe, Detroit\n\nCadieux Cafe, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Cadieux Cafe is one of Detroit\u2019s most well-known reportedly haunted locations. A pair of Belgian immigrants, Yvonne and Robert Devos, founded the cafe on Detroit\u2019s east side in the early 1930s. In its early days, it was a Prohibition-era speakeasy. The Devos family purchased it in 1962, and in 2018 it was purchased by Paul Howard, co-owner of Cliff Bell\u2019s, and musician John Rutherford.\n\nIt was famously showcased by Anthony Bourdain during a visit for his TV show \u201cNo Reservations.\u201d Some have seen an apparition that they believe to be Yvonne sitting at a table near the bar area. Others have seen her husband, Robert, in the basement of the cafe, as well as objects reportedly moving on their own throughout the building.\n\nAtwater in the Park, Grosse Pointe Park\n\nThe church the brewery is housed in opened in 1936. The building was once home to Grace United Church.\n\nAtwater in the Park, Grosse Pointe Park MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nPeople heard strange noises and odd occurrences while the church was being transformed into the brewery. Atwater in the Park opened in 2014, and a priest came out to bless the brewery soon afterward. Employees fear going in the basement, where the fermenters, liquor and various supplies are kept. The basement once housed a nursery school and daycare.\n\nShadow figures, children\u2019s disembodied voices and lights flickering on, a video capturing a dove shadow flying inside are a few of the paranormal experiences that have been reported\n\nRelated: \u2018Ghost\u2019 captured on camera during investigation at Atwater brewery in Michigan\n\nTommy\u2019s Bar and Grill, Detroit\n\nTommy's Bar and Grill, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nTommy\u2019s Detroit Bar is one of the city\u2019s most historic and reportedly haunted locations. Dating back to the mid-1800s, the building is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Road and served as a speakeasy during the prohibition era before it became Tom\u2019s Tavern in 1938.\n\nThe bar\u2019s owner, Tommy Burelle, says he\u2019s heard about and experienced plenty of unusual encounters in the building. One of the paranormal hot spots is the basement, which is where the hidden speakeasy was. Urban legend says the basement is also where a body was once buried by the mob.\n\nGandy Dancer, Ann Arbor\n\nGandy Dancer in Ann Arbor (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Gandy Dancer restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was originally a Michigan Central Train Depot dating back to 1886. Considered the finest station on the Michigan Central line when it was built, this building features heavy stone walls, deep-set, round-arched openings, large fireplaces and beautiful stained glass windows. It\u2019s also said to be haunted possibly due to some of the traumatic events of its past.\n\nIn Sept. 1940, some kids put a railroad spike on the tracks, which caused a freight train to derail, killing Walter Flinn. The train depot also was where American military members killed in action during several wars were unloaded. It\u2019s said that during WWI, the bodies of deceased soldiers who weren\u2019t claimed by their family were stored temporarily in the basement of the depot.\n\nEven today, the Gandy Dancer showcases much of its historical authenticity. Be sure to check it out when you\u2019re in the area.\n\nThe Whitney, Detroit\n\nThe Whitney in Detroit (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Whitney restaurant was built between 1890 and 1894 by a prominent lumber baron, David Whitney. It served as his families home until 1920. The Whitney is 21,000 square feet with 52 rooms (including 10 bathrooms) and 20 fireplaces. Our favorite spot is the Ghost Bar! It\u2019s also been long rumored to be haunted. We were lucky enough to investigate a few years ago and captured an \u201cavp\u201d of what we think is Grace Whitney in the carriage house. Listen close for Grace humming a tune.\n\nHuron River Inn, Rockwood\n\nHuron River Inn, Rockwood MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nHRI, once known as the Burton Manor & Tavern, was originally built in 1860 and operated through the Civil War Years. It was the center of social life in what was then called Huron Station (current day Rockwood). In the early 1900s, the Burton Manor caught fire and had to be rebuilt. In 1907, out of the ashes arose the Rockwood Hotel!\n\nHRI is well-known to be haunted. Staff and patrons have reported seeing the apparition of a woman in a bonnet sitting at the bar, as well as shadowy man standing in the old coal bin entry in the basement. There have also been reports of loud noises, children\u2019s laughter and unexplained footsteps running down the second floor hallway.\n\nWalldorff Brewpub, Hastings\n\nWalldorff Brewpub, Hastings MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nNow a brewery, this building dating back to 1866 has been many things throughout its lifetime, including a funeral home, hardware store, furniture shop, clothing retailer, and a drug & grocery store. Staff and guests have reported numerous paranormal encounters, including objects unexplainably flying off the bar on their own, lights coming on, being touched, shadow figures and much more.\n\nThe White Horse Inn, Metamora\n\nWhite Horse Inn (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe White Horse Inn dates back to 1848 and is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. It originally served as a general store, but throughout its lifetime has also been an inn, dance hall and now a restaurant. The building has quite a haunted reputation, with many reporting to hear the sound of boots walking across its second floor when no one is up there, doors slamming, lights flickering and more. Some have even seen apparitions, including those of a man in a 1940s tuxedo, an older man and a young girl.\n\nOne of the haunted legends says that a handful of patrons and a worker were killed in a fire in the front section of the bar. To this day, people in the bar continue to report hearing screams, possibly of those who perished in the fire.\n\nBone Heads BBQ, Willis\n\nBone Heads BBQ is known to be one of the most haunted places in the state. Now a bar/restaurant, the building dates back to around 1865 and previously served as coach stop, grainery, butcher shop, ice house, post office and general store. Numerous paranormal encounters have been reported by staff and guests.\n\nSome have seen apparitions near the host stand and bar, heard footsteps and whispers when others weren\u2019t present, and seen the apparition of a woman in a white dress walking down the stairs.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not known who all the spirits are at Bone Heads, there\u2019s one the owners and staff call Nellie, who they believe may have lived in the building in the early 20th century.\n\nBone Heads BBQ, Willis MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nLearn more about Detroit Paranormal Expeditions on their website here."

        "article_content": "A trio of stars just under 5,000 light-years away has absolutely smashed a long standing record.\n\nTIC 290061484 is a system of gravitationally bound stars consisting of a tightly-orbiting binary pair with a third star that circles both. Astonishingly, they're so close together the entire system would fit inside the orbit of Mercury.\n\nAnd that's not all. The tight trio seems to have another friend; there are hints of a fourth star describing a path at a much greater distance.\n\nAll three of the stars in the central trinary are on a collision course, destined to collide, merge, go supernova, and leave behind a single neutron star, in around 20 million years.\n\nThe discovery was made using the TESS exoplanet-hunting space telescope, which is optimized for detecting the minute changes in the brightness of a star that indicate an orbiting world.\n\nSystems of stars that eclipse each other along our line of sight also demonstrate changes in brightness, as the stars pass in front of each other and block at least some of each other's light. TESS's observations can detect these brightness changes, too. This is a powerful tool for finding these systems, because, from the distance at which we see them, they usually just look like a single star.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nThis is the case with the central trinary of TIC 290061484. The orbital plane on which they are all aligned is pretty much edge-on to our line of sight, meaning that we're treated to different eclipse configurations as the three stars go about their cosmic dance.\n\nA team of scientists led by astrophysicist Veselin Kostov of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center discovered the system after an extensive analysis of TESS data. They used a machine learning algorithm to filter the data based on the expected signal of star system eclipses, and then set a tiny army of citizen scientists loose on the results to refine it further.\n\n\"We're mainly looking for signatures of compact multi-star systems, unusual pulsating stars in binary systems, and weird objects,\" says physicist Saul Rappaport of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"It's exciting to identify a system like this because they're rarely found, but they may be more common than current tallies suggest.\"\n\nOnce they had identified the system as one of interest, the researchers could then analyze the changes in its light to determine its characteristics.\n\nThe two stars making up the central binary clock in at 6.85 and 6.11 times the mass of the Sun, with an orbital period of just 1.8 days.\n\nThe third star has a mass of 7.9 times the Sun's and orbits the central pair with a period of 24.5 days. That period blows the previous known smallest trinary, with an orbital period of 33 days, out of the water.\n\nFinally, the probable fourth star would have a mass of about 6.01 times the mass of the Sun. It is estimated to circle the central trinary on a much, much wider orbit of about 3,200 days.\n\nStars are born from abnormally dense regions of matter within vast clouds of gas. Usually, such clouds are speckled with a number of baby stars, some of which drawing close enough to merge, others to spend their lives together locked in orbit.\n\nMost of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy are in systems like these. When you look up into the night sky, more than half the stars you see are actually multiple stars, too distant to discern.\n\nWe know there are multiple-star systems out there that we haven't yet identified. This discovery suggests that there may be many more out there than we imagined. The next step will be to turn the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope to the task of finding them, once it reaches the skies.\n\n\"Before scientists discovered triply eclipsing triple star systems, we didn't expect them to be out there,\" says astronomer Tam\u00e1s Borkovits of the Baja Observatory of The University of Szeged in Hungary. \"But once we found them, we thought, well why not? Roman, too, may reveal never-before-seen categories of systems and objects that will surprise astronomers.\"\n\nThe research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal."

        "article_content": "Credit: Shutterstock\n\nPharmaceutical companies are often lambasted for rising drug costs. For example, the price of new drugs entering the US market in 2023 was 35% higher than in 2022. According to an analysis from Reuters, part of the increase is due to a move to develop therapies for rare diseases: because fewer people have those condition, drugmakers push up the per-dose price to recover their costs. But the cost of developing drugs for more common diseases, including cancers, is also rising rapidly.\n\nIn 2019, pharmaceutical companies spent $83 billion dollars on research and development. After accounting for inflation, that\u2019s roughly 10 times what the industry spent in the 1980s, according to the US Congressional Budget Office. A 2024 study showed that the share of sales revenue devoted to research spending rose from 12% in 2008 to 18% in 2019, and drugmakers are beginning to feel the pinch.\n\nIn addition to rising research costs, several blockbuster drugs will soon be old enough to be reclassified as generic, meaning their developers are set to lose their status as the exclusive manufacturer, says Magid Abou-Gharbia, founding director of the Moulder Center for Drug Discovery Research at Temple University. \u201cWhen that happens, you can kiss the money goodbye,\u201d he says.\n\n\ufeffPharmaceutical companies are moving to work more with academic centers to reduce their risk exposure. Kelly Chibale,\ufeff University of Cape Town Drug Discovery and Development Centre\n\nDrug companies are increasingly looking to academics in a bid to mitigate some of these financial burdens. This often involves university researchers doing early-stage drug discovery before pharmaceutical companies take over to push a novel compound through clinical trials and get it to market. \u201cThis trend is not entirely new,\u201d says Karl-Heinz Altmann, a synthetic organic and medicinal chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich. \u201cBut it does have momentum now.\u201d\n\nFinancial booster\n\nIn the life sciences, corporations have been scaling back their in-house research since the 1980s. According to the Nature Index, which tracks the output of 82 scientific journals, research partnerships between companies and academic institutions more than doubled between 2012 and 2016.\n\nA 2022 report from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry found 2,687 links between the UK pharmaceutical industry and academia in 2022, compared with 1,134 in 2003. In other words, collaborative work with academics is making up a larger share of research by private companies, including drugmakers.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies are moving to work more with academic centers to reduce their risk exposure,\u201d says Kelly Chibale, an organic chemist and director at the University of Cape Town Drug Discovery and Development Centre. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Boston in the US or Oxford and Cambridge in the UK have so many major pharmaceutical companies. They\u2019re based there because that\u2019s where the academics that they want to collaborate with are.\u201d\n\nFrom pharma\u2019s perspective, the proof-of-concept stages of drug development are laden with the risk of failure\u2014something their accountants are keen to avoid. By comparison, academia is relatively unbothered by failure if lessons can be learned and\u2014crucially\u2014if papers can still be published. But even with spinout and start-up companies, universities lack the infrastructure to progress a novel compound much further than proof of concept. Clinical trials are just too expensive. If done right, collaborations between the two worlds can be mutually beneficial.\n\nAcademic migration\n\nAlong with the shift of drug discovery to the academic world, larger numbers of researchers are moving from pharmaceutical companies into academic roles.\n\nFor instance, Altman worked at Novartis until 2003, when he moved to ETH Zurich. \u201cI was offered the job. I didn\u2019t seek it out,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a difficult decision to go from a well-established environment where you know people to a situation where you have to start from scratch. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a professor moving from one university to another where you can take your research with you. What I did at Novartis stayed there. All I had was a lab and a budget to develop ideas.\u201d\n\nCredit: Nic Bothma/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nThe move involved a number of serious considerations\u2014starting with the drop in salary. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything that a head of research can earn in industry would ever be matched by a university,\u201d Altman says. \u201cI would probably make twice as much money if I\u2019d stayed in industry.\u201d But he says the freedom to choose a research path was worth the sacrifice in salary.\n\n\ufeffDrug discovery has gotten harder because the easier drugs to discover have already been discovered. Charles Hart,\ufeff Small Molecule Discovery Center at the University of California, San Francisco\n\nAltman\u2019s move into academe is part of a wider trend within drug development research as more people move back and forth between industry and universities. \u201cIndustry is stepping out of the very early stages because it\u2019s becoming more and more expensive,\u201d says Peter Nussbaumer, managing director at the Lead Discovery Center in Dortmund, Germany, a translational drug research company founded by the Max Planck Society\u2019s technology transfer arm, which collaborates with academic partners.\n\nAs more early-stage research moves from industry to academia, so too do people, Nussbaumer says. And academic drug discovery centers have become a destination for them.\n\nThose who dare, win\n\nIn 2008, Abou-Gharbia left his job as a senior vice president at Wyeth Research\u2014which was later acquired by Pfizer\u2014to become a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at Temple University. As part of his recruitment, Abou-Gharbia was tasked with kick-starting drug discovery research there. The concept was something of a novelty at the time, he recalls. \u201cThere were only a few drug discovery centers in universities,\u201d he says. Now, according to a 2017 study authored by Abou-Gharbia, there are close to 100 such centers in the US alone.\n\nA growing trend\n\n\n\nA year after starting at Temple, Abou-Gharbia was awarded a $1 million stimulus grant from the National Institutes of Health. He then wrote a pitch to establish a drug discovery center, which would include cutting-edge technologies used by the pharmaceutical industry. The university\u2019s leadership approved the proposal and backed it with about $8.2 million, which allowed the center to recruit researchers and build laboratories.\n\nThe Moulder Center is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year. Since its founding, the center has received more than $35 million in outside support\u2014enough to enable its staff to publish more than 180 papers in peer-reviewed journals and file more than 30 patents. Moulder has also created four spin-off companies and trained many future researchers in modern drug discovery and development. \u201cMany universities ask me how to establish similar centers and I tell them you need university support and money,\u201d Abou-Gharbia says.\n\nYou also need industry researchers to be readily accepted into academic roles, as Abou-Gharbia was. Such a career move used to be hard to pull off. Though being poached by industry was a well-trodden path for academics, going in the other direction was relatively rare until just a couple of decades ago. This is still the case in much of the EU, according to Nussbaumer. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to go back and forth in the UK and US,\u201d he says. \u201cNot so much in mainland Europe.\u201d\n\nAltman agrees but says Germany and other EU countries are beginning to catch up. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to become a bit more relaxed,\u201d he says.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Magid Abou-Gharbia\n\nUniversities used to be rigid and highly particular about what kind of experience qualified a person for the job, Nussbaumer says. And there was a question of values: Are you in it for the money or the science? But those boundaries have become less defined in recent years, thanks in part to the promise that researchers can achieve scientific progress and make money by building small companies on the back of their research with the hope of attracting the interest of a larger drug developer.\n\nFernando Albericio, an organic chemist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, has noticed that this way of thinking has also started to inform the career goals of students and young researchers. \u201cIn the past, a PhD student typically wanted to work in academia for life,\u201d he says. These days, their ambition more often is to start a company.\n\n\u201cThe number of spin-off companies is rising rapidly, and they have a sense of being the bridge between academia and pharmaceutical companies,\u201d Albericio says. Drug discovery centers and spinouts enable the academic scientist to carry on their work with one foot in each door.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about the money\n\nDrugmakers\u2019 courtship of academic scientists is about more than quelling their financial fears. \u201cIt\u2019s part of it, sure. But it\u2019s also that drug discovery has gotten harder because the easier drugs to discover have already been discovered,\u201d says preclinical pharmacologist Charles Hart, who earlier this year became codirector of the Small Molecule Discovery Center at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), after 30 years in biotech. \u201cWe need new drugs in cancers and new diseases like COVID-19 and other infectious agents, which is just really hard.\u201d Hart says that industry also wants and needs access to the cutting-edge know-how that academic researchers possess.\n\nUniversity-based drug discovery centers and their start-up firms offer pharmaceutical companies the opportunity to use the findings and results that academic experiments have yielded. Sometimes firms exploit those data to further the research that they\u2019re are already doing; other times they want to get a leg up on a research program into a new field in which they lack expertise. Companies may also want to buy up specific compounds and therapies that have shown promise in early experiments.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Magid Abou-Gharbia\n\nIn addition, technological advances in recent years have opened up new avenues of exploration that companies want access to. Whether it\u2019s artificial intelligence, sophisticated cellular techniques, or gene therapies, drugmakers are looking for help in exploiting these developments. \u201cBoth biology and chemistry, as fields, have widened a lot in recent years,\u201d says Michelle Arkin, a chemical biologist who works with Hart as codirector of the Small Molecule Discovery Center at UCSF. \u201cThere\u2019s a real enthusiasm in the pharma companies to take advantage of this.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Carsten Schultz, a social scientist at Christian Albrechts University of Kiel whose research has investigated the effects of university-\u200bindustry collaborations on research and development performance. \u201cEven the big pharmaceutical companies need to leave old fields of activity and engage in new fields like biotechnology and cell therapies,\u201d he says. \u201cPharma needs to invest in these new technologies in the medium term, but they really need academics to get ahead on the knowledge.\u201d\n\nWho benefits?\n\nAn optimist would say these partnerships are a way for both sectors to bring their strengths to bear: academics get more funding, pharmaceutical companies get reduced risk and more expertise, and patients get more drugs. The skeptic would say that big pharma is offloading the risk burden onto academic researchers\u2014and the public agencies that fund them\u2014while enjoying the fruits of their labor when things do work out.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Magid Abou-Gharbia\n\n\u201cIf you consider this from the societal part of things, the question is who takes the financial burden,\u201d Schultz says. \u201cWhether a university or researcher makes money depends on the system. In Germany we still have a very traditional academic system. Legally, whatever happens at the university belongs to the university.\u201d That makes spinout companies a challenge to establish, although Schulz says there are efforts to improve this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if a university administration is open to the idea of its scientists starting a business, each agreement for an academic working with a pharmaceutical company is unique. \u201cThe devil is in the details,\u201d Arkin says. \u201cIt can be exploitative, but it can be mutually beneficial.\u201d It\u2019s important that scientists on both sides openly discuss what they want to get from the collaboration before any draft agreement is drawn up, she adds. \u201cAs soon as the contract writers become involved, it will be more adversarial, but if scientists on either side generally have a shared vision, that\u2019s a good start.\u201d\n\nNot all agreements are created equal, and academic researchers can have various degrees of engagement. \u201cWe\u2019ve done many collaborations where we\u2019re so involved that we go to all [the company] team meetings, and we discuss everything with them,\u201d Arkin says. \u201cAnd then sometimes we just get paid for what we do as contractors and never really find out exactly what they do with our results. Sometimes they keep the drug target a secret from us. It just makes supplementary income for our research.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong way to do it, but researchers should just think about what they want before signing, according to Arkin. \u201cThere\u2019s cheap money and expensive money,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t get involved in the expensive money that sees you doing things you don\u2019t want to do or aren\u2019t interested in.\u201d"

        "article_content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 It began to get ugly Sunday two batters into the fourth inning, and really, it was a surprise that it took that long.\n\nNick Castellanos, coming off four solid months of regular season hitting, chased a pitch and missed by about 10 inches or so. By the next pitch, his empty wave reached a foot. That\u2019s about the time the expelling of fan disgust, often a many splendored thing in Philadelphia, came on with a sudden rush.\n\nBy the time Castellanos drew the negative response that hearkened back to his days of spring plate ineptitude (he was at .199 as late as May 27), Phillies fans had already cranked up the angst level to 11. If they needed a laugh, the fans soon supplied that, as Mets pitcher Luis Severino bounced a 55-footer to Castellanos, who kept the bat on his shoulders, drawing a loud cheer from the fans for not swinging.\n\nHe tapped the next pitch to Francisco Lindor for an out, bringing the fans right back to their wintery bluster of discontent. Ah, Philadelphia during another sports fall. Funny how fast the weather can change down here.\n\nIt came with two gusts of wind from Bryce Harper, and yes, from Castellanos, back-to-back home runs in the sixth inning off previously unhittable Severino to tie the game. It came again via a two-run triple by previously unhitting Bryson Stott, who followed a Harper walk and Castellanos single with the liner to the corner in right to give them a 6-4 lead. And because these Miracle Mets II keep refusing to die, it had to happen again in the ninth.\n\nThat\u2019s where Castellanos had his most meaningful moment of the night, his walk-off single capping a two-out rally and bringing Trea Turner home with the winning run in a thrilling, 7-6 Phillies victory that turned the winds of discontent into a gush of celebratory relief at Citizens Bank Park.\n\n\u201cI feel great for him,\u201d manager Rob Thomson said of his perfect-attendance player Castellanos. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s been working every day. Comes in early, hits one-on-one on the field. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s done it and played 162 games because he\u2019s just a workhorse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for him because I know that there\u2019s been a lot of talk about chase and this and that. But he can hit. He can hit. That was a big night for him tonight, the home run to tie it up and then the base hit to win it. He\u2019s just been grinding all year.\u201d\n\nAfter going 1-for-6 to start the series and swinging at the kind of bad pitches which lowlighted his first two months, Castellanos supplied a game-tying home run, single and go-ahead run, then the walk-off hit in the ninth.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stud, man,\u201d Harper said of Castellanos. \u201cHe continues to fight and to work, and he\u2019s understanding what he needs to do, and he\u2019s swinging at everything.\n\n\u201cNo heartbeat, man. He just goes up there and plays his game. He\u2019s been doing it for a long time, in the big leagues, but also youth ball and things like that. But no moment\u2019s too big.\u201d\n\nThe Phillies had precious few scoring moments early on. They had gotten a couple of baserunners to third, but both times with two outs, and neither time did they advance beyond there. Severino didn\u2019t have to act like a pitcher in trouble, since the Phils were well on their way to painfully extending a stretch of not putting together consistent at bats into a fourth consecutive playoff game.\n\nIt began a year ago, when after scoring 27 runs over the first five games of the NLCS, the Phillies went down in two stunning losses at home to the Arizona Diamondbacks, scoring a total of three runs over those crushing Games 6 and 7.\n\nIt continued Saturday, while their ace Zack Wheeler was blowing away the Mets with a one-hit shutout through seven innings. Yet they could only muster a one-run lead \u2026 until the bullpen helped blow it all up into a 6-2 Mets win.\n\nUntil Harper and Castellanos ripped their sixth-inning homers Sunday, the Phillies were beginning to specialize in hitting only when it didn\u2019t count. Until then they were 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position in this series, which had all the earmarks of a short one heading for an ending in New York.\n\nBut Harper and Castellanos weren\u2019t listening to the script.\n\n\u201cI was just kind of frustrated,\u201d Castellanos said, \u201cso I guess I locked in more. \u2026 It\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish.\u201d\n\nSo amid a sudden four-inning charge in which they scored seven needed runs, the Phillies not only reversed an early three-run deficit but also finally put down a Mets team that seemed (and might still seem) destined to finish the scintillating run they\u2019ve been on over the last several weeks.\n\n\u201cObviously going into New York at 1-1 is a lot better than 0-2,\u201d Castellanos said. \u201cThat being said, the series is far from over. They are a really good team over there and they are playing together and they are playing as a unit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be challenging but we\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nContact Rob Parent at rparent@delcotimes.com"

        "article_content": "Beginning in the late 2000s, tech enthusiasts and journalists \u2014 including the cofounders of Technical.ly \u2014 recognized that tech startup culture was spreading beyond Silicon Valley. They launched blogs and news sites to cover emerging communities in other cities.\n\n\n\nStorytelling is a crucial yet often overlooked component of building innovation ecosystems. It promotes local culture, connects communities and guides new participants, but remains the least addressed part of the \u201cInnovation Ecosystem Stack.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany dedicated local tech media outlets have struggled to survive in a crowded digital landscape. At the same time, there\u2019s a growing desire among innovation ecosystem leaders for their region\u2019s narrative to gain recognition \u2014 both within and beyond their immediate community.\n\nLooking back, I got plenty of grief as a 20-something journalist reporting on tech and startups in Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\nBack in 2008, neither the subject matter nor those cities were taken seriously. But two friends and I realized no newspaper would hire us, and we believed Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture was already spreading to other cities. The year prior, Wall Street Journal veterans launched AllThingsD to add journalistic rigor to tech startup coverage, which TechCrunch had begun in 2005.\n\nIt seemed clear that the rise of the internet, software and consumer electronics could be found anywhere there were enough smart, forward-thinking people. We weren\u2019t alone.\n\nFrom the late 2000s through the early 2010s, other under-employed journalists and tech enthusiasts started tracking local startup communities through spreadsheets, maps and social media. Many launched newsletters, blogs, and news sites \u2014 like Technical.ly.\n\nMost of these efforts have come and gone, reflecting the broader and ongoing challenges of the local news business. But as tech becomes more central to economic strategy, civic leaders are investing more in workforce and entrepreneurship programs. With local newsrooms shrinking, there are fewer places for people to follow those investments \u2014 and even fewer outlets to tell stories beyond their immediate community.\n\nThat\u2019s why the least solved part of what I call the \u201cInnovation Ecosystem Stack\u201d is storytelling \u2014 aka publishing narrative change about a specific scene. It\u2019s the role I want Technical.ly to play in more places (hmu if you wanna talk about it!).\n\nIn 2019, Technical.ly produced a report for the Kauffman Foundation on how local entrepreneurship communities were getting news and information. Five years and a pandemic later, I returned to that report and want to share what I see.\n\nWhat kind of storytelling do you want\u2026or is it a need?\n\nThe onset and effects of the pandemic reversed declines in entrepreneurship, underscored the need for digital access and reinforced demand for a STEM workforce. Every US state now has at least one organization focused on startups or technology \u2014 or both.\n\nWith growth comes complexity. In a community\u2019s early days, a few key connectors can serve as nodes of information. Eventually, startup and tech activity grow to a point where it\u2019s not possible for a few individual connectors to do this on their own. Rather than a problem, it\u2019s actually a sign of success.\n\nBy my count, however, there are currently less than two dozen dedicated publications focused on a given region\u2019s tech and startup issues.\n\nMost specialize only in startups and are based in a single market. A notable exception is BostInno, a startup blog founded in 2008 that was acquired in 2012 by American City Business Journals (ACBJ). The \u201cInno\u201d brand is now used for ACBJ\u2019s tech coverage across multiple markets, though much of it is behind a hard paywall.\n\nA few publishers, including Technical.ly, pair important information sharing with original reporting on hard-but-useful truths.\n\nThe biggest tech markets, Silicon Valley and New York City, are awash in national tech and business coverage, though they each have local resources too, like the San Jose Mercury\u2019s SiliconValley.com and AlleyWatch. Chicago\u2019s Crain\u2019s has built a well-liked tech vertical, and publications like GeekWire in Seattle and dot.LA in Los Angeles have emerged to serve their respective communities.\n\nSmaller hubs also use storytelling to connect local ecosystems: Around the same time we launched Technical.ly, Silicon Prairie News became a beloved resource across the Midwest, and in 2022 was donated to the Nebraska Journalism Trust, where it continues. The Research Triangle\u2019s local NBC affiliate has published its TechWire since 2002.\n\nLike Technical.ly today, all of those are independent news resources, offering distance from the people and organizations directly creating programming for startups. That\u2019s in contrast to respected efforts like Startland News in Kansas City and Refresh Miami in Florida, which are different in that they\u2019re entrepreneur support organizations that employ journalists.\n\nSeveral other efforts don\u2019t employ journalists at all, and most avoid challenging subject matter \u2014 like, say, a failing startup or touchy issues with elected officials.\n\nNo matter their provenance, all these publications share a common goal: to promote the local innovation culture and guide new entrants to the ecosystem. A few, including Technical.ly, go further by reporting on the hard truths and uncomfortable realities within the local scene.\n\nLocal startup news is easy to envision, hard to sustain\n\nWhile most local efforts focus on internal storytelling, many civic leaders want their innovation stories to reach outside their markets.\n\nThis can be a challenge for single-market publications, though good stories occasionally break through. In a recent survey, nearly a third of Technical.ly readers reported researching regions beyond their own.\n\nWith limited storytelling resources, local business and talent attraction executives often lump a variety of tactics under the \u201cstorytelling\u201d banner \u2014 including standalone websites with catchy slogans, splashy photos and flattering data. Some organizations have gone further, such as Milwaukee\u2019s chamber of commerce, which launched in 2022 its own standalone news site focused on startups.\n\nWhat most efforts overlook is how tough it is to sustain a media business.\n\nWith digital tools, the cost to start an online publication is effectively zero, but a crowded marketplace has spiraled the cost of growing an audience. Of roughly 150 regions with some entrepreneur or tech engagement strategy, fewer than 15% of regions have a dedicated news resource.\n\nThe best evidence of how difficult this work is can be found in the number of efforts that no longer exist. After changing ownership in 2018, Tech.co, founded as TechCocktail by Frank Gruber and Jen Consalvo, was turned into a tech review site. The erratic COVID era was especially challenging: Multi-local, biotech-focused Xconomy, Iowa-focused Clay&Milk and Midwest minded Mug.news all ceased publishing. And these were the strongest. Many more never got to their level of traction.\n\nFifteen years after launching Technical.ly, the beat\u2019s importance has grown. The examples of doing it well haven\u2019t."
