We assume that it was probably a ship at sea,\" the dispatcher answers him.\n\nThe dispatching service noted that earlier another plane informed them about an alarm received about 2.5 miles (about 4 km) from the airport. According to that aircraft, the warning came from behind the ship. After that, the pilot, with whom the dispatcher was talking, reported that he saw \"a vehicle descending, which he considers unidentified,\" 500 feet (152 m) below his plane.\n\nSearch operations were launched in the airport area \u2014 at sea, in the air and on land. According to DHA, at the moment it is not known why the warnings were received, the search did not bring results.\n\nIn November, Air France suspended flights over the Red Sea after pilots noticed a glowing object in the sky at the time of the flight over Sudan, RBC reminds."

            "article_content": "Josh Stewart Answers the Phone in 'Lifeline' Paranormal Thriller Trailer\n\n\"Can we push back this deadline that you've set?\" Dark Sky Films has revealed an official trailer for indie thriller Lifeline, from director Feras Alfuqaha. Yet another hotline thriller focusing on a person answering a phone - this night he receives an odd, paranormal call. There have been a few of these recently - including The Guilty with Jake Gyllenhaal or Tessa Thompson's The Listener. In Lifeline, a suicide hotline operator gets a late-night call from someone who claims to be him, knowing private details only he would know, and threatening to end his life in an hour. The operator must race against time to stop \"himself\" from suicide. Josh Stewart stars as Steven Thomas, along with August Maturo, Charlene Amoia, Jocelyn Ayanna, Nicole Santiago, Jill Awbrey, & Brecken Merrill. This also reminds me of the film Frequency (2000) about a father and son connecting across time through the phone. Lifeline looks much better than it sounds.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Feras Alfuqaha's film Lifeline, direct from YouTube:\n\nA late-night suicide hotline operator named Steven Thomas (starring Josh Stewart) receives a disturbing call from someone claiming to be him, knowing personal details only he would know. The caller threatens to end his life within the hour, forcing the operator into a tense, emotional race against time. As the clock ticks down, he must confront his deepest fears and uncover the truth before it's too late to save \"himself.\" Lifeline is directed by the indie producer / filmmaker Feras Alfuqaha, now making his feature directorial debut after producing a number of other projects as well. The screenplay is written by Brady Morell and Brian Price. Produced by Feras Alfuqaha and Leal Naim. Dark Sky Films will debut Alfuqaha's Lifeline film in select US theaters + on VOD starting on February 21st, 2025 coming soon. Who wants to watch this?"

Known for their expertise in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), the Constantinos brought a unique blend of humour and skill to the show, making them fan favourites. However, beneath their on-screen chemistry lay a troubled relationship marked by domestic strife.\n\nGhost Adventures stars. Photo: @GhostAdventures (modified by author)\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were notable figures in the paranormal investigation community, particularly recognised for their Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) expertise. They gained fame by appearing on the Travel Channel's popular series Ghost Adventures, where they contributed to various episodes by capturing purported ghostly voices and sounds.\n\nWhat happened to the Constantino couple?\n\nOn a quiet September morning in 2015, in the eerie silence of Sparks, Nevada, the news of the Ghost Adventures couple found dead in Nevada broke out. The couple (Mark and Debby Constantino) had a darker side to their story.\n\nTheir journey from paranormal enthusiasts to tragic figures unfolded with a backdrop of domestic violence and legal battles, culminating in an event that left the paranormal community and fans of the show in disbelief and mourning.\n\nBackground and rise to fame\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were initially celebrated for their work in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), a method used in paranormal research to capture the voices of spirits on recording devices. They appeared on Ghost Adventures, where they helped analyse audio evidence for signs of ghostly communication.\n\nTheir work was not only a part of the show's appeal but also contributed significantly to the field of paranormal investigation, making them beloved figures in this niche community. Their dynamic, often seen as playful banter on the show, made their appearances memorable. However, there were signs of a troubled relationship behind this public persona.\n\nDomestic strife and public records\n\nThe Constantinos' relationship had a history of domestic violence, which became public knowledge through several court documents and police reports.\n\n2012 incident\n\nMark filed for a temporary restraining order against Debby, claiming he feared she might stab him while intoxicated. He withdrew the request the following day, but this incident was the first public hint of their domestic issues.\n\nAugust 2015\n\nA more severe incident led to Mark being charged with kidnapping, domestic battery by strang, and domestic battery. That stemmed from an altercation where Mark allegedly dragged Debby from a car, leading to her filing for divorce and seeking a protective order. Their daughter, Raquel, was also implicated in this incident.\n\n10 September 2015\n\nDebby filed for divorce from Mark, citing his control over their finances and alleging that he was \"bleeding the accounts dry.\" She sought spousal support and the return of their business, which she claimed to have created.\n\nThe Constantinos had a long history of domestic abuse allegations against each other, including multiple restraining orders filed over the years. Debby had previously accused Mark of severe physical abuse, claiming he had beaten and strangled her during confrontations.\n\nIn one instance, she described being dragged from her car and assaulted until police officers intervened. Mark and Debby's history of violence was well-documented in court records and was known to local law enforcement. Both had filed protective orders against each other at various times, indicating a deeply troubled relationship that escalated over time.\n\nThese events painted a starkly different picture from their on-screen camaraderie, revealing a relationship fraught with violence and legal battles.\n\nThe final days\n\nThe events leading to their deaths unfolded tragically on 22 September 2015. They include:\n\n22 September 2015\n\nThe day of the incident began with a disturbing discovery. Debby's roommate found James Anderson, a third roommate, dead from a gunshot wound in their shared apartment. Concerned for Debby's safety, the roommate contacted the police, fearing she might also be in danger.\n\nThe morning of 22 September\n\nPolice tracked Debby's mobile phone to an apartment rented by their daughter, where Mark was staying. When officers knocked on the door around 11:15 AM, they heard shots fired from inside. Mark shouted that he had Debby and demanded time to \"gather his thoughts,\" threatening her life if his demands were not met.\n\nThe police attempted to negotiate with Mark for several hours. However, communication ceased after a certain point, leading authorities to breach the door using explosives.\n\nDiscovery of bodies\n\nUpon entering, police found both Mark and Debby deceased from gunshot wounds. Mark had shot Debby twice before turning the gun on himself. The investigation revealed that Mark had also been involved in the earlier murder of James Anderson.\n\nImpact on the Paranormal Community\n\nGhost Adventures couple Mark and Debby Constantino pose for the camera. Photo: @GhostAdventures\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe paranormal community and Ghost Adventures fans were left in shock and mourning. The show's cast and crew expressed profound sadness and confusion over the incident, with Zak Bagans, the host, tweeting that it was a \"very tragic dark day.\"\n\nThe event sparked discussions about the emotional toll of dealing with the paranormal, possibly exacerbating underlying personal issues.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath included tributes from fans and peers, some of whom speculated on the influence of their paranormal activities on their personal lives, though these theories remain unsubstantiated.\n\nThere was a notable episode of Ghost Adventures where the crew attempted to contact Zak Bagan's friends who passed away, Mark and Debby, which was met with mixed reactions regarding the ethics of such an investigation.\n\nDespite their deaths, Debby and Mark left a legacy in the paranormal community through their contributions to EVP and the cautionary tale of their personal lives. Their story has since been a topic of discussion in forums and among paranormal enthusiasts, often as a lesson on the importance of mental health and the dangers of domestic violence.\n\nFAQs about Mark and Debby Constantino\n\nWhat happened to Debby Constantino from Ghost Adventures?

            "article_content": "But the business continued to operate, and Nu\u00f1ez and a general manager were issued citations in December .\n\nThe decision by the Burrillville Town Council followed months of controversies surrounding the historic property made famous by \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d movie franchise and its owner, Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez, including allegations from former employees that Nu\u00f1ez owed them money.\n\nSince then, there have been \u201cno signs of activity\u201d at the house, Burrillville police Chief Stephen Lynch confirmed to the Globe on Monday.\n\nSpeculation over the future of the property sparked again last week after Burrillville Town Manager Michael C. Wood told The Providence Journal a YouTuber named Elton Castee asked him earlier this month what would be required to reopen the house to the public if he and comedian Matt Rife were able to purchase the property.\n\nGet Rhode Map A weekday briefing from veteran Rhode Island reporters, focused on the things that matter most in the Ocean State. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nIn September, Castee wrote in a post on X that he and Rife were \u201cready and willing to buy\u201d the home if Nu\u00f1ez was \u201ckeen to sell.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWood, who did not respond to inquiries from the Globe on Monday, told the The Journal the property needs a fire alarm and upgrades to its sprinkler system, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe still want it to be a successful venture,\u201d Wood told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019d like to hear from Jacqueline and have some resolution to it. I think there\u2019s a win-win out there.\u201d\n\nNeither Castee nor Rife could be reached for comment on Monday.\n\n\n\nNu\u00f1ez: \u2018I have heard nothing\u2019\n\nIn a text message to the Globe, Nu\u00f1ez wrote she had not heard from either Rife or Castee. She did not answer a question about whether she would consider selling the house or if she has plans to reopen it herself.\n\n\u201cI have heard nothing. I fear for my safety,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez wrote. \u201cI have had kidnapping threats from Burrillville people if I set foot on the Conjuring House property.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLynch, in an email, wrote police are \u201cnot aware of any threats\u201d to Nu\u00f1ez.\n\nAccording to the The Conjuring House website, the business is listed as closed until further notice, and it states that an update will be given on a reopening \u201cas soon as we know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTCH will open for business again,\u201d the website states. \u201cOur stateside and worldwide following is extensive and you, our guests, deserve access to the most famous paranormal location in the world!\u201d\n\nThe website also states Nu\u00f1ez plans to file several lawsuits, including one against the Town of Burrillville for the \u201carbitrary and capricious non-renewal of the TCH Business License in violation of Constitutional and Administrative State, Federal and International Laws.\u201d\n\nNu\u00f1ez has had other issues with town officials, as well, outside of The Conjuring House. In October, she was arrested by police after she allegedly led officers on a chase through town while driving under the influence. She has denied the accusations.\n\nWho else has owned the Conjuring House?\n\nAlso known as the Old Arnold estate, the property was previously home to eight generations of the Arnold family since 1736.\n\nThe house\u2019s infamous backstory came in the 1970s when paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren conducted a seance in 1973 in an attempt to rid the home of spirits said to be tormenting the Perron family, who was living there at the time.\n\nIn later years, Norma Sutcliff lived in the house for more than three decades before she sold the home in 2019.\n\nAfter the release of the 2013 film, \u201cThe Conjuring,\u201d Sutcliff, who has disputed notions of any haunted or otherworldly phenomenon at the home, said she was subjected to constant harassment by thrill-seekers and horror fans who wanted to lay their eyes on the storied property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEver since the movie came out, we\u2019ve been harassed, trespassed, stalked, and besieged,\u201d Sutcliff told the Globe in 2015. \u201cThey come at all times of the day. Last Saturday, I called police at 3:30 a.m. because there was a whole group of them outside the house. It\u2019s horrendous.\u201d\n\nSutcliff ultimately sold the property in 2019 to Cory and Jennifer Heinzen, two paranormal investigators from Maine who had a vision to restore the home and open it up to the curious public.\n\n\u201cWe immediately fell in love with it,\u201d Heinzen told The Sun Journal at the time. \u201cEight-and-a-half acres, a river in the back and a pond, it\u2019s so serene down there, never mind the story behind the house, it\u2019s a beautiful home.\u201d\n\nThe couple later sold the place to Nu\u00f1ez, who purchased it in 2022, paying about $1.525 million, and pledged to keep the business going.\n\n\u201cI know I have big shoes to fill, and I intend to do it,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nChristopher Gavin can be reached at christopher.gavin@globe.com."

The new planet, with a mass six times that of Earth's, orbits a star similar to our Sun. It has been named HD 20794 d and confirmed by an international team of scientists. It was originally found two years ago by Dr Michael Cretignier from Oxford University's physics department and is located in the Eridanus constellation. Dr Cretignier explained: \"With its location in a habitable zone and relatively close proximity to Earth, this planet could play a pivotal role in future missions that will characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for biosignatures indicating potential life.\" He first identified the potential exoplanet signal in 2022 while studying archive data recorded by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Such data analyses light absorbed and emitted by objects.\n\nREAD MORE NASA breakthrough as experts discover there may be life on Uranus moons\n\nThe new planet has a mass six times that of Earth\n\nThe expert spotted periodic shifts in the spectrum of light emitted by the host star, which Oxford University said could have been caused by a nearby planet's gravitational pull. At the time of Dr Cretignier's initial discovery, it was unclear if the signal was caused by a planet, the star or if it was just a technical glitch. Members from the international team of scientists studied \"highly-precise\" measurements taken over 20 years by HARPS and the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO). The two instruments are among the most advanced in the world for measuring tiny variations in light. Detailed in a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the discovery also relied on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Dr Cretignier said scientists worked on the data for years, analysing and eliminating possible sources of contamination to pinpoint the planet's signal. The discovery was confirmed after the results from HARPS and ESPRESSO were combined.\n\nThe new planet was originally found two years ago (file image)\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The firm\u2019s goal is to work with scientists early and help them commercialize their research more quickly by providing expertise and funding.\n\n\u201cDeerfield is in that missing middle: funding initiatives which cannot be conducted under NIH or NSF funding but are too early stage for angel or venture funding,\u201d says Samir Mayekar, associate vice president and managing director of UChicago's Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. \"That\u2019s the hardest money to get.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with Deerfield is the latest move by UChicago to step up its game in technology transfer, or commercializing research and creating startup companies. It was a key goal of former President Bob Zimmer, and the effort is picking up under his successor, Paul Alivisatos, a materials-science researcher who has founded several startups.\n\nUChicago launched a deep-technology incubator and created several venture capital funds to help faculty, staff and students launch new companies. The most recent is UCM Ventures, a $25 million fund focused on healthcare startups.\n\nUChicago also will have space for researchers and a life-sciences incubator in a new 14-story office and lab facility called Hyde Park Labs, which is expected welcome its first tenants soon.\n\nBill Slattery, a partner at Deerfield, praised the university for its \"spirit of entrepreneurship that doesn\u2019t abandon the principles of education, which is a tough line to walk. This is a moment in time for U of C to seize that.\"\n\nDeerfield Management and UChicago are calling their partnership Hyde Park Discovery. A committee made up of leadership from the university, the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Deerfield\u2019s scientific team will evaluate projects.\n\n\"Drug discovery takes time and is expensive,\" Slattery says, adding that Deerfield has made roughly a dozen investments so far at UIC, Northwestern and UIUC."

            "article_content": "OpenAI announced on Tuesday a new version of ChatGPT tailored specifically for government use. ChatGPT Gov, as it is called, appears to be something akin to giving Malibu Stacy a new hat.\n\nThe major difference between this version and the commercial chatbot, according to CNBC, is that with ChatGPT Gov, public agencies can feed \u201cnon-public, sensitive information\u201d into OpenAI models hosted within their own Microsoft Azure commercial cloud, or Azure Government community cloud, and manage their own security and compliance requirements.\n\nThe new version of ChatGPT is not yet approved for government use on non-public data, but of course, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been aligning himself closely with Trump in hopes of accumulating influence, and the company\u2019s head of product Kevin Weil told reporters it hopes that could help grease the wheels of bureaucracy. \u201cI know President Trump is also looking at how we can potentially streamline that, because it\u2019s one way of getting more modern software tooling into the government and helping the government run more efficiently,\u201d Weil said. \u201cSo we\u2019re very excited about that.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has released other versions of ChatGPT, including one built for universities that essentially gives students higher message limits and controls for university IT administrators.\n\nOpenAI demonstrated ChatGPT Gov to reporters, and the applications are more of the same features we have come to expect:\n\nAaron Wilkowitz, a solutions engineer at OpenAI, showed reporters a demo of a day in the life of a new Trump administration employee, allowing the person to sign into ChatGPT Gov and create a five-week plan for some of their job duties, then analyze an uploaded photo of the same printed-out plan with notes and markings all over it. Wilkowitz also demonstrated how ChatGPT Gov could draft a memo to the legal and compliance department summarizing its own AI-generated job plan and then translate the memo into different languages.\n\nIn the first few days of his new term, Trump\u2019s administration has been accused of using AI to write a flurry of executive orders that have been described as sloppy and hard to understand.\n\nSecurity of non-public data has been a major concern surrounding the use of commercial chatbots in the workplace. Early on in the chatbot fervor of 2023, major corporations blocked their employees from accessing the likes of ChatGPT and Claude over fears the models would ingest proprietary corporate data. And Microsoft\u2019s own chatbot for enterprises, called Copilot 365, has received criticism for inadvertently oversharing sensitive data with employees not granted permission to see it.\n\nAnother concern with the use of AI in government is that it is prone to error and could display bias. It has already been shown repeatedly that AI systems have been used to tie people to crimes, leading to false arrests when law enforcement relies too much on the systems. Years ago, ProPublica published an investigation looking at how judges across the country were using AI to decide whether or not to grant bail to defendants. The system was less likely to suggest offering bail to people from poorer neighborhoods with higher crime rates, therefore biasing the system against them. But AI speaks with confidence and makes people complacent even though it is a glorified autocomplete; users are prone to accept what it says as fact.\n\nOpenAI \u201cacknowledges there are special considerations\u201d for government use of AI,\u201d and that users still must comply with its usage policies.\n\nAltman is trying his best to gain power and influence in Washington, stoking fears that China\u2019s artificial intelligence is a major threat to America and simultaneously offering the solution. ChatGPT Gov seems another attempt to entrench his company as quickly as possible and dominate the industry, even as DeepSeek raises questions of whether AI is all a commodity that will not provide the massive profits he might hope for. President Trump says he is dedicated to beating China in the artificial intelligence race; the president says jump, and Altman asks, \u201cHow high?\u201d"

            "article_content": "82% of companies are fed up with Oracle pricing\n\nJava turns 30 years old in 2025. What better time to release the 2025 State of Java Survey and Report? Our second annual survey serves as a guide to understanding Java adoption and trends, and confirms Java\u2019s impact on application performance, developer productivity, and AI development. More than ever before, Java continues to lead in innovation, adaptability, and performance.\n\nWelcome to Azul\u2019s 2025 State of Java Survey & Report, a study of more than 2,000 Java professionals worldwide. The report uncovers how enterprises are tackling Oracle Java pricing and licensing challenges, strategies for addressing cloud costs, factors impacting DevOps productivity, and the role of Java in AI development.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the important results and trends from the 2025 State of Java Survey & Report.\n\nJava\u2019s continuing influence in the enterprise\n\nJava remains a cornerstone for enterprise application development. Only 1% of those contacted to participate in the survey were disqualified because they don\u2019t use Java. In addition, nearly 70% of respondents say that more than half of their applications are built with Java or run on a JVM.\n\n19% of participants use Java 6 or 7, two of the oldest versions still in production (remember Java 6 was originally released in 2006!), and 49% use Java 17 or 21, the two newest Long-Term Support (LTS) versions. The results underscore Java\u2019s role for both maintaining legacy applications and systems and for running modern, scalable applications and architectures.\n\nMore than just a programming language and a force for technical stability, Java is a critical enabler of enterprise innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence (more on that later).\n\nThe Great Oracle Java Migration gains momentum\n\nTwo years after Oracle introduced its employee-based pricing for Oracle Java SE in January 2023, organizations continue to grapple with Oracle\u2019s employee-based pricing model. 82% of Oracle Java users express concern over its cost structure \u2014 a figure unchanged since Azul\u2019s 2023 survey. Oracle Java users are turning their displeasure into action and joining The Great Oracle Java Migration. 88% of Oracle Java users are considering a switch to another Java provider. Nearly half of these companies plan to migrate to an OpenJDK distribution with paid support, preferring a cost-effective yet reliable solution.\n\n88% of Oracle Java users are considering a switch to another Java provider.\n\nAs organizations recognize the value of paid support, they are considering switching Java providers for two main reasons \u2013 cost and experience.\n\nOverall, 79% of Oracle Java users who are considering migrating to another distribution cited Oracle as a reason. In fact, seven of the top eight responses were about Oracle, and four of them were about Oracle\u2019s behavior and the experience of being a customer (including sales tactics, pricing uncertainty, and audits). These responses underscore that organizations increasingly seek cost-effective, flexible, and transparent alternatives to Oracle Java to mitigate financial and operational risks.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n7 of the top 8 reasons for migrating from Oracle Java to an OpenJDK distribution were about Oracle pricing or support, or the experience of being an Oracle Java customer.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAzul Platform Core customers typically pay 70% less than Oracle for licensing fees and support. They also have commercial support available for Java 6 and 7, which they can\u2019t get from any other distribution, and Azul is the only Java provider besides Oracle that delivers stabilized security builds. Azul also delivers full updates every quarter that combine bug fixes, new features, and security patches.\n\nOrganizations tackle cloud costs, but overages are still high\n\nAs organizations increase their public cloud footprint, they are dedicating more than half of their cloud capacity to Java workloads. In a clear sign of inefficient resource allocation, most participants in this survey have more than 20% of their cloud compute capacity sitting idle. Overprovisioning not only inflates operating costs but also diverts funds that they could invest in innovation or growth initiatives.\n\nOptimizing Java in the cloud presents a substantial opportunity to reduce costs without compromising performance. Organizations are taking steps to better align their cloud investments with actual usage. They are making behavioral changes like implementing internal rules and establishing DevOps functions. They are also using more efficient processors and autoscaling their workloads. In addition, a quarter of participants are using a high-performance Java runtime to improve application performance, optimize cloud compute costs, and improve customer experiences.\n\nOrganizations are leveraging many different approaches to curb cloud spend, including utilizing a high-performance JDK.\n\nAzul Platform Prime is an enhanced build of OpenJDK, with additional features for faster and more consistent steady-state performance, faster startup and warmup, and more efficient use of resources. Azul Prime customers enjoy better performance and lower cloud and infrastructure costs.\n\nCode management and security impact DevOps productivity\n\nThe survey reveals significant challenges to application development productivity. Organizations must remove efficiency barriers to development if they are to bring new features to their customers faster. Dead or unused code is a major challenge, and 62% of survey participants report that it affects their DevOps teams\u2019 effectiveness.\n\nA third of participants say their DevOps teams waste more than half their time addressing false positives from Java-related security vulnerabilities. 41% report that they encounter critical production security issues within their Java ecosystem on a weekly or daily basis. The high frequency of false positives can become overwhelming, leading to alert fatigue and reducing employees\u2019 attentiveness to genuine security threats.\n\nFalse positives prevent efficient vulnerability triage.\n\nWhen DevOps can\u2019t separate the real vulnerabilities from the plethora of alerts, notifications, and sometimes even spam, they have to siphon resources away from development and other priorities. But they must remain vigilant. Half of companies still report finding vulnerable versions of the Log4j library in production, more than two years after a patch was made available.\n\nAzul Intelligence Cloud has two unique capabilities to help with DevOps productivity. Azul Code Inventory catalogs what code runs in production across an enterprise\u2019s Java workloads. It slashes the time and burden of identifying dead and unused code, allowing developers to focus on the code that actually matters (and over time prune the code that doesn\u2019t). Azul Vulnerability Detection detects vulnerable code that is actually run in production (versus simply present in the jar or container), eliminating false positives to enable rapid and efficient vulnerability triage.\n\nJava powers enterprise AI development\n\nTypically, when the topic of developing AI or ML functionality arises, people think of Python. Perhaps surprisingly, the survey found that Java was used more often than either Python or other languages. In fact, 50% of organizations use Java to code AI functionality.\n\n50% of companies that build AI functionality build it with Java.\n\nAI impacts the way organizations strategize, build code, and maintain applications and infrastructure. As you might expect, this AI adoption comes with infrastructure implications, and 72% of survey participants say their compute capacity will have to grow for them to support Java applications with AI functionality.\n\nState of Java Survey & Report is available now\n\nThis report shows organizations are actively seeking ways to optimize their Java deployments to drive operational efficiency and cost predictability. As Java continues to be the backbone for business-critical applications in the enterprise, we\u2019re seeing important trends \u2014 from the growing interest in Oracle Java alternatives to cloud optimization strategies, improvements in DevOps productivity, and innovation with AI.

The new planet, with a mass six times that of Earth's, orbits a star similar to our Sun. It has been named HD 20794 d and confirmed by an international team of scientists. It was originally found two years ago by Dr Michael Cretignier from Oxford University's physics department and is located in the Eridanus constellation. Dr Cretignier explained: \"With its location in a habitable zone and relatively close proximity to Earth, this planet could play a pivotal role in future missions that will characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for biosignatures indicating potential life.\" He first identified the potential exoplanet signal in 2022 while studying archive data recorded by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Such data analyses light absorbed and emitted by objects.\n\nREAD MORE NASA breakthrough as experts discover there may be life on Uranus moons\n\nThe new planet has a mass six times that of Earth\n\nThe expert spotted periodic shifts in the spectrum of light emitted by the host star, which Oxford University said could have been caused by a nearby planet's gravitational pull. At the time of Dr Cretignier's initial discovery, it was unclear if the signal was caused by a planet, the star or if it was just a technical glitch. Members from the international team of scientists studied \"highly-precise\" measurements taken over 20 years by HARPS and the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO). The two instruments are among the most advanced in the world for measuring tiny variations in light. Detailed in a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the discovery also relied on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Dr Cretignier said scientists worked on the data for years, analysing and eliminating possible sources of contamination to pinpoint the planet's signal. The discovery was confirmed after the results from HARPS and ESPRESSO were combined.\n\nThe new planet was originally found two years ago (file image)\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Though immensely powerful, volcanoes are not always spewing hot lava around. Many are considered dormant or even extinct and have not shown their strength for hundreds of thousands of years in some cases. However, a team of scientists recently found magma chambers lurking beneath six volcanoes in the Cascade Range. The findings published January 23 in the journal Nature Geoscience are challenging the idea of what separates an active volcano from a dormant one.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. Email address Sign up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nActive vs. dormant volcanoes\n\nObviously, visible lava spewing from a volcano\u2019s caldera, like Hawai\u2019i\u2019s Mount K\u012blauea or Grimsv\u00f6tn in Iceland, indicates that a volcano is active. However, not all active volcanoes are erupting. They have the potential to erupt in the future with young and fresh magma chambers.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a dormant volcano is one that is not erupting now. However, they could still erupt in the future. Some volcanologists will use the qualifier \u201clong-dormant system\u201d to refer to a volcano that has not erupted in thousands of years. A \u201crecently active system\u201d might have erupted a few years or decades or centuries ago. What makes it dormant versus \u201cpotentially active\u201d is that its large magma bodies have typically been expelled during eruptions and have dissipated over time. Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania\u2013which last erupted about 360,000 years ago and Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji\u2013317 years ago\u2013are both currently considered to be dormant volcanoes.\n\nHowever, new research is challenging these definitions.\n\nThe magma beneath\n\nIn the new study, a team from Cornell University and the USGS studied six volcanoes of various size and dormancy status within the Cascade Range in the northwestern United States\u2014Lassen Peak, Crater Lake, the Newberry Volcano, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Rainier. Seismic waves identified persistent and large magma chambers in all of the volcanoes\u2013even the dormant ones. According to the team, these results were surprising since some of the volcanoes\u2013including the Crater Lake volcano in Oregon\u2013have not been active for thousands of years.\n\n\u201cRegardless of eruption frequency, we see large magma bodies beneath many volcanoes,\u201d Guanning Pang, a study co-author and Cornell University postdoctoral researcher, said in a statement. \u201cIt appears that these magma bodies exist beneath volcanoes over their whole lifetime, not just during an active state.\u201d\n\nObserving that more volcanoes have sustained magma bodies is an important factor for researchers that monitor and predict future volcanic activity. As part of the National Volcano Early Warning System, the USGS has spent time expanding and upgrading volcanic monitoring networks within the Cascade Range and elsewhere. The goal is to detect the signs and signals of an impending eruption as early as possible to give people ample warning.\n\n[ Related: Extinct volcanoes could hold rare earth elements. ]\n\n\u201cWe used to think that if we found a large amount of magma, that meant increased likelihood of eruption,\u201d Pang said, \u201cbut now we are shifting perception that this is the baseline situation.\u201d\n\nThese results suggest eruptions do not always completely drain a magma chamber. Instead, it will release some of the excess volume and pressure. The magma chamber can then be slowly expanded and refilled over time as the crust melts gradually.\n\n\u201cIf we had a better general understanding of where magma was, we could do a much better job of targeting and optimizing monitoring,\u201d study co-author and Cornell geophysicist Wiliam Abers said in a statement. Abers also noted that there are a, \u201cgreat many volcanoes that are sparsely monitored or have not been subject to intensive study.\u201d\n\nA portable method\n\nAdditionally, the team found that they could use fewer tools to recover this important data. They used a very small network of seismometers situated around each volcano in the study and leveraged some of the recent upgrades made to seismic broadband stations near Cascade Range volcanoes. They then applied a technique that uses scattered wavefields from distant earthquakes, to create detailed subsurface images.\n\n\u201cPreviously, imaging methods required deploying tens to hundreds of seismometers around a volcano, making for a challenging undertaking,\u201d Abers said.\n\nPlans to expand the magma monitoring system to see if the same discovery in the Cascades can be applied elsewhere are already in the works. One of those locations is Alaska, home to over 130 volcanoes, 90 of which have been active within the last 10,000 years.\n\n\u201cOur method is very portable and can be used at many if not most other volcanoes around the world, with just a small number of modern seismographic stations,\u201d Abers said. \u201cWe think it can help systemize volcano studies, and provide a key piece of global frameworks for volcanic hazard assessment.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Dogecoin has gained 5.22% over the past 30 days, but a recent 8.53% decline in the past two weeks and reliance on hype-based growth have led many investors to question its long-term viability. Amid market optimism fueled by President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-crypto stance, a top Dogecoin holder is seeking utility-driven assets to diversify and strengthen their portfolio.\n\nAmong the standout alternatives, an AI-powered altcoin is emerging as a promising investment opportunity. Harnessing advanced AI technology, a low presale price of $0.10, and a host of innovative benefits, experts predict this altcoin could see its value skyrocket to $1 post-listing.\n\nHowever, the Dogecoin holder remarked that only a select few would invest in this AI-driven altcoin due to its focus on utility over hype. Let\u2019s find out if that\u2019s correct.\n\nDogecoin Drops Gains Amid Market Rally\n\nThe lack of inherent value makes memecoins like Dogecoin highly volatile and speculative, a feature that appeals to some investors. While buying at the right time can yield significant profits, it also carries the risk of rapid losses, especially when purchased at market peaks.\n\nFor instance, Dogecoin has lost approximately 52% from its all-time high of $0.73 during the 2021 bull run, where it surged by 8,000%. Also, despite the current market rally, the asset has also declined by 8.53% over the past two weeks, further highlighting its instability.\n\nThis speculative nature has made some investors cautious. In response, a prominent Dogecoin holder has turned to RCO Finance (RCOF) as a value-driven alternative. Unlike Dogecoin, which is heavily influenced by market trends and hype, RCO Finance offers utility-driven solutions that extend beyond speculation. This positions RCOF as a compelling choice for investors seeking long-term value, stability, and practical applications rather than hype-fueled gains.\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF): Simplifying Decentralized Finance with AI\n\nContrary to hype-driven assets like Dogecoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) is transforming financial management through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Its fully automated, no-code platform empowers users of all experience levels to optimize their investments seamlessly. With over 10,000 users already onboard, RCO Finance is gaining traction as a leading utility-driven solution in the crypto space.\n\nThe platform\u2019s beta version is live, attracting investors seeking long-term growth through innovation. Continuous upgrades are planned to further enhance user experience and functionality, reflecting the team\u2019s commitment to excellence.\n\nNotably, the backbone feature of this platform is the AI-powered Robo Advisor, which delivers real-time, data-driven investment strategies tailored to market trends. Designed for both beginners and seasoned investors, it simplifies portfolio management by providing automated, accurate insights without requiring constant monitoring. Currently in its Alpha phase and undergoing internal testing, the Robo Advisor will soon include advanced monitoring capabilities, further elevating its utility for users.\n\nRCO Finance also provides access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate. This unparalleled diversity allows users to build balanced portfolios for optimal returns. The platform also integrates DeFi features like lending, staking, and crypto debit cards, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for financial growth.\n\nRCOF Token: Powering the RCO Finance Ecosystem\n\nUnlike Dogecoin, which lacks significant use cases, the RCOF token serves as the backbone of the RCO Finance ecosystem. It offers a range of utilities and benefits designed to enhance user experience and drive platform growth:\n\nLiquidity Provision\n\nRCOF tokens are integral to the platform\u2019s automated market-making (AMM) system. By staking their tokens in liquidity pools, investors not only strengthen the platform\u2019s liquidity infrastructure but also earn a share of the trading fees generated from transactions within these pools.\n\nGovernance Rights\n\nHolding RCOF tokens grants users voting rights on critical platform decisions, including protocol upgrades, new feature launches, and resource allocation. This decentralized governance model enables users to actively shape the platform\u2019s future trajectory and growth.\n\nRewards and Cashback Programs\n\nAs the primary currency for the platform\u2019s rewards ecosystem, the RCOF token powers cashback and loyalty programs. Users who engage in activities such as trading, staking, or providing liquidity are rewarded with RCOF tokens, promoting consistent participation and fostering long-term loyalty.\n\nInvest Early In RCO Finance for Potential for Big Gains\n\nWhile a prominent Dogecoin holder remarked that only a few would invest in RCO Finance (RCOF) due to its utility-driven focus rather than speculative appeal, the token\u2019s presale performance tells a different story. RCOF has already surpassed $11.97 million in sales, with over 50 million tokens sold, an undeniable reflection of growing investor confidence.\n\nThe credibility of the RCOF token is further reinforced by a comprehensive audit conducted by SolidProof, certifying its security and reliability. RCO Finance also stands out by offering traders leverage of up to 1000x, enabling substantial returns. For example, a $2,000 investment could yield as much as $20,000, showcasing the platform\u2019s potential for significant profit opportunities.\n\nCurrently priced at $0.10 per token in its fifth presale stage, RCOF\u2019s value is expected to climb to $0.13 in the next phase before its official market launch. Investors can also benefit from a generous 40% bonus on token purchases by using the code \u201cWELCOME40.\u201d\n\nThanks to these attributes, experts project that this altcoin could quickly rise from its $0.10 presale price to $1 post-listing. For those who missed the earlier presale stages, this phase offers an affordable and strategic entry point.\n\nNote that the RCO Finance platform already has a growing user base of over 10,000. Furthermore, the beta version is slated for additional upgrades, while the AI-powered Robo Advisor, currently in its alpha phase of internal testing, will soon feature advanced monitoring capabilities.\n\nJoin RCO Finance (RCOF) now and master your trades with AI-powered precision and boundless possibilities.\n\nFor more information about the RCO Finance Presale:\n\nVisit RCO Finance Presale\n\nJoin The RCO Finance Community"

A report from the National Council for Scientific Research in Lebanon said a preliminary estimate of damages showed that nearly 3,000 buildings in the Dahiya area south of the city had been destroyed, severely damaged or extensively damaged."

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAmerican semiconductor giant Nvidia's stock price, for instance, was down as much as 25 per cent on Monday before closing at US$118.58, down 16.8 per cent, erasing hundreds of billions of US dollars in market value.\n\nBroadcom, Micron Tech, Oracle, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google's parent company, were among the tech firms also seeing losses in Monday trading.\n\nThe shock registered more broadly, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index down throughout the trading day, closing at 19,341.8, down 3.07 per cent, while the S&P 500 was off 1.46 per cent.\n\nSome analysts say Investor excess could be at play in the tech-heavy Nasdaq's dip.

The company said its latest AI model required less than US$6 million worth of Nvidia's less advanced H800 chips.\n\nCharu Chanana of Saxo Bank wrote in a research note on Monday that DeepSeek \"serves as a reminder that competition in the global AI arena is intensifying and Nvidia may not be in the pole position forever\".\n\nThe developments \"could have major implications for both US policy and investor sentiment towards Chinese tech,\" added Chanana.\n\n\"If companies like DeepSeek can innovate despite sanctions, the narrative around China's technological dependence on the US may shift dramatically.\"\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "By ALEX VEIGA AP Business Writer\n\nEconomic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.\n\nDamage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.\n\nInsured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022.\n\nHurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.\n\n\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"\n\nAt least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.\n\nIn addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.\n\nIn a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history."

For starters, insurance premiums often rise \u201cin areas with the highest risk of natural disasters such as hurricanes or wildfires,\u201d according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nFurthermore, natural disasters can also affect property taxes, which can be shocking to homeowners, especially as they head into tax season.\n\nThe problem with property taxes after natural disasters\n\nDaniel Cabrera, founder and CEO of Fire Damage House Buyer, says that natural disasters usually spur property reassessments, which temporarily lower the values of damaged properties while simultaneously reducing homeowners\u2019 taxes.\n\n4 There were 27 weather disaster events in the U.S. in 2024. TNS\n\nIn addition, municipalities might increase property tax rates to compensate for losses during the rebuilding process.\n\n\u201cFor example, many homeowners in Miami saw their properties reassessed after Hurricane Irma. In areas that were not affected, tax rates were increased to help offset the loss in revenue,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Los Angeles, wildfires similarly create more expensive places with taxes to meet increased funding needs.\u201d\n\nHowever, when a \u201chome is destroyed in a wildfire, the property tax assessments don\u2019t automatically reset to reflect this loss,\u201d Newsweek reports.\n\n4 Cabrera said that natural disasters typically come with property reassessments. Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThat means the property\u2019s value \u201cremains unchanged unless the homeowner applies for reassessment.\u201d\n\nHomeowners in Los Angeles County who have been affected can apply for property tax disaster relief under certain circumstances, including that the loss estimate is \u201cat least $10,000 of the current market value of the property,\u201d according to the California State Board of Equalization.\n\nThese owners can be eligible for a temporary reduction in property taxes or a refund if they have already paid the taxes. Some taxes are refunded to the property owner if already paid.\n\n\u201cOnce rebuilt, the property\u2019s pre-damaged value will be restored,\u201d the board added.\n\nWhere you live matters\n\nThe law in New York is different. The state recently enacted a bill to protect owners who have suffered property loss or damages due to natural disasters.\n\nIn December 2024, the state enacted the Climate Change Property Tax Relief bill, which \u201cprovides assessment relief to property owners within eligible municipalities; relates to payments of real property tax refunds and credits as a result of participating in the climate change property tax relief act,\u201d according to the text of the bill.\n\n4 The laws regarding disaster relief can vary from state to state. Getty Images\n\nWhile climate risks have affected many Americans, they haven\u2019t affected the number of people looking to live in these areas, especially those considered desirable. A recent New York Times analysis found that hurricane-prone Florida, for example, \u201cgained millions of new residents between 2000 and 2023.\u201d The analysis also found that wildfire-prone California\u2019s Sierra Nevada has seen \u201can influx of people even as wildfires in the region become more frequent and severe.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cabrera, climate change has not deterred demand because lifestyle and economic opportunities usually win out over risk.\n\nStart and end your day informed with our newsletters Morning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories Thanks for signing up!

Cummings, of the firm Cummings & Cummings Law.\n\nCummings adds that buyers are also wary of rising insurance premiums. For instance, in Miami, waterfront properties have shown slower appreciation rates than inland properties over the past five years.\n\n4 Experts say that climate change can directly affect property values. Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis is partially attributable to the skyrocketing insurance premiums resulting from the nonrenewal of existing policies and refusals by many insurers to write new policies in the Sunshine State,\u201d he adds.\n\nHow living in a flood or fire zone will affect your property taxes\n\nLiving in a disaster-prone area can affect your property taxes in several ways. They may be assessed at a higher rate because of the cost of municipal services that include emergency response, building, and maintaining flood control infrastructure, says Cabrera.\n\n\u201cFor example, in Asheville, NC, poststorm tax reassessments for certain flood-prone areas led to noticeable increases to fund recovery efforts,\u201d he says.\n\nWhere do I find how much property taxes are on a home?\n\nIf you\u2019re a homeowner, you can find out how much you\u2019re paying on your most current property tax statements.\n\nIf you\u2019re a buyer, you can look at the real estate listing for assessment and tax information or go to the county website to find out the annual property tax.\n\nProperty taxes can fluctuate based on various factors, such as the local real estate market.\n\nCan I write off property taxes?\n\nProperty taxes are deductible on the federal tax return, but only if you itemize deductions and your total state and local taxes for the year do not exceed $10,000, says Mark Luscombe, CPA, attorney, principal analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\nIf you\u2019re married and filing separately, the amount should not exceed $5,000, according to H&R Block."

            "article_content": "The father who adopted Natalia Grace, the Ukrainian orphan who allegedly made several attempts to kill him and his wife, broke down during an awkward confrontation that saw the pair reunite.\n\nViewers were stunned when docuseries The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks dropped in 2023, detailing Natalia - who has a rare form of dwarfism - and her adoption story.\n\nHusband and wife Kristine and Michael Barnett took in who they believed to be a six-year-old into their Indiana home in 2010. Then years after she was accused of being a 22-year-old, Michael sat down with Natalia to have a very awkward conversation. Watch below:\n\nJust months after Natalia was adopted, the Barnett family claimed she was an 'adult sociopath masquerading as a child' who allegedly tried to kill them.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"She tried to poison and kill my wife,\" Michael claimed, \"One night, I opened my eyes and Natalia is standing at the foot of the bed with a knife in her hand.\"\n\nNatalia has continuously denied all of the allegations made against her. In 2024 documentary Natalia Speaks, health testing company TruDiagnostic estimated that she was then about 22 years old, meaning she was between six and nine years old when she was adopted by the Barnetts.\n\nIn a clip which was released by Investigation Discovery last year, Natalia is seen reuniting with Michael and asking him: \"Why are we here?\"\n\n\"Why are we here?\" responded Michael, \"If you're talking philosophically.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe confrontation between Natalia Grace and her former adoptive father was very awkward (Investigation Discovery)\n\n\"No, I want to know, why did you adopt me in the first place?\" she then asked.\n\n\"Many of these questions there's not going to be a single answer to,\" he told her, whilst alleging he was manipulated and mistreated by Kristine, his now ex-wife.\n\nIn the documentary, Natalia alleges that she was abused by Kristine, claiming that she pepper-sprayed her multiple times and hit her with a belt.\n\nAdvert\n\nKristine has denied the accusations from both Natalia and Michael.\n\n\"What do you mean by you were a victim?\" Natalia asked, to which Michael replied: \"This is not easy. I had the same monster you did.\"\n\n\"I was exceptionally controlled and put down and threatened, was minimalised, anything that was who I was was ripped from me and I was guided and instructed to be exactly what she wanted me to be,\" he went on.\n\nHe stormed off set (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nMichael seemed to be getting nowhere with his former adopted daughter and stormed out of the interview following a confrontation with people behind the camera.\n\n\"I tried, I tried,\" he repeated as he walked off set.\n\nHaving made headlines a couple of years ago, Natalia has provided a fresh update in season three of her docuseries, titled The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: The Final Chapter.\n\nNatalia has now settled in with Nicole DePaul, 49, and her husband Vince, 51 - who also have dwarfism - in upstate New York. The couple tried to adopt her in 2009, but were turned down."

            "article_content": "Part of our International Year of Quantum Science and Technology coverage Philip Ball peers into the quantum past, and uncovers a little-known paper published by Niels Bohr, Hendrik Kramers and John Slater in 1924, that proposed that the first law of thermodynamics may no longer hold firm. Their idea turned out to be wrong, but in interesting and provocative ways, and it demonstrates the intense turmoil in physics on the brink of quantum mechanics\n\nBrilliant mind Illustration of the Danish physicist and Nobel laureate Niels Bohr (1885-1962). Bohr made numerous contributions to physics during his career, but it was his work on atomic structure and quantum theory that won him the 1922 Nobel Prize for Physics. (Courtesy: Sam Falconer, Debut Art/Science Photo Library)\n\nOne hundred and one years ago, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed a radical theory together with two young colleagues \u2013 Hendrik Kramers and John Slater \u2013 in an attempt to resolve some of the most perplexing issues in fundamental physics at the time. Entitled \u201cThe Quantum Theory of Radiation\u201d, and published in the Philosophical Magazine, their hypothesis was quickly proved wrong, and has since become a mere footnote in the history of quantum mechanics.\n\nDespite its swift demise, their theory perfectly illustrates the sense of crisis felt by physicists at that moment, and the radical ideas they were prepared to contemplate to resolve it. For in their 1924 paper Bohr and his colleagues argued that the discovery of the \u201cquantum of action\u201d might require the abandonment of nothing less than the first law of thermodynamics: the conservation of energy.\n\nAs we celebrate the centenary of Werner Heisenberg\u2019s 1925 quantum breakthrough with the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ) 2025, Bohr\u2019s 1924 paper offers a lens through which to look at how the quantum revolution unfolded. Most physicists at that time felt that if anyone was going to rescue the field from the crisis, it would be Bohr. Indeed, this attempt clearly shows signs of the early rift between Bohr and Albert Einstein about the quantum realm, that would turn into a lifelong argument. Remarkably, the paper also drew on an idea that later featured in one of today\u2019s most prominent alternatives to Bohr\u2019s \u201cCopenhagen\u201d interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\nGenesis of a crisis\n\nThe quantum crisis began when German physicist Max Planck proposed the quantization of energy in 1900, as a mathematical trick for calculating the spectrum of radiation from a warm, perfectly absorbing \u201cblack body\u201d. Later, in 1905, Einstein suggested taking this idea literally to account for the photoelectric effect, arguing that light consisted of packets or quanta of electromagnetic energy, which we now call photons.\n\nBohr entered the story in 1912 when, working in the laboratory of Ernest Rutherford in Manchester, he devised a quantum theory of the atom. In Bohr\u2019s picture, the electrons encircling the atomic nucleus (that Rutherford had discovered in 1909) are constrained to specific orbits with quantized energies. The electrons can hop in \u201cquantum jumps\u201d by emitting or absorbing photons with the corresponding energy.\n\nConflicting views Stalwart physicists Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr had opposing views on quantum fundamentals from early on, which turned into a lifelong scientific argument between the two. (Paul Ehrenfest/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nBohr had no theoretical justification for this ad hoc assumption, but he showed that, by accepting it, he could predict (more or less) the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. For this work Bohr was awarded the 1922 Nobel Prize for Physics, the same year that Einstein collected the prize for his work on light quanta and the photoelectric effect (he had been awarded it in 1921 but was unable to attend the ceremony).\n\nAfter establishing an institute of theoretical physics (now the Niels Bohr Institute) in Copenhagen in 1917, Bohr\u2019s mission was to find a true theory of the quantum: a mechanics to replace, at the atomic scale, the classical physics of Isaac Newton that worked at larger scales. It was clear that classical physics did not work at the scale of the atom, although Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle asserted that quantum theory should give the same results as classical physics at a large enough scale.\n\nMathematical mind Dutch physicist Hendrik Kramers spent 10 years as Niels Bohr\u2019s assistant in Copenhagen. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nQuantum theory was at the forefront of physics at the time, and so was the most exciting topic for any aspiring young physicist. Three groups stood out as the most desirable places to work for anyone seeking a fundamental mathematical theory to replace the makeshift and sometimes contradictory \u201cold\u201d quantum theory that Bohr had cobbled together: that of Arnold Sommerfeld in M\u00fcnich, of Max Born in G\u00f6ttingen, and of Bohr in Copenhagen.\n\nDutch physicist Hendrik Kramers had hoped to work on his doctorate with Born \u2013 but in 1916 the First World War ruled that out, and so he opted instead for Copenhagen, in politically neutral Denmark. There he became Bohr\u2019s assistant for ten years: as was the case with several of Bohr\u2019s students, Kramers did the maths (it was never Bohr\u2019s forte) while Bohr supplied the ideas, philosophy and kudos. Kramers ended up working on an impressive range of problems, from chemical physics to pure mathematics.\n\nReckless and radical\n\nOne of the most vexing question for Bohr and his Copenhagen circle in the early 1920s was how to think about electron orbits in atoms. Try as they might, they couldn\u2019t find a way to make the orbits \u201cfit\u201d with experimental observations of atomic spectra.\n\nPerhaps, in quantum systems like atoms, we have to abandon any attempt to construct a physical picture at all\n\nBohr and others, including Heisenberg, began to voice a possibility that seemed almost reckless: perhaps, in quantum systems like atoms, we have to abandon any attempt to construct a physical picture at all. Maybe we just can\u2019t think of quantum particles as objects moving along trajectories in space and time.\n\nThis struck others, such as Einstein, as desperate, if not crazy. Surely the goal of science had always been to offer a picture of the world in terms of \u201cthings happening to objects in space\u201d. What else could there be than that? How could we just give it all up?\n\nBut it was worse than that. For one thing, Bohr\u2019s quantum jumps were supposed to happen instantaneously: an electron, say, jumping from one orbit to another in no time at all. In classical physics, everything happens continuously: a particle gets from here to there by moving smoothly across the intervening space, in some finite time. The discontinuities of quantum jumps seemed to some \u2013 like Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in Vienna \u2013 bordering on the obscene.\n\nWorse still was the fact that while the old quantum theory stipulated the energy of quantum jumps, there was nothing to dictate when they would happen \u2013 they simply did. In other words, there was no causal kick that instigated a quantum jump: the electron just seemed to make up its own mind about when to jump. As Heisenberg would later proclaim in his 1927 paper on the uncertainty principle (Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik 43 172), quantum theory \u201cestablishes the final failure of causality\u201d.\n\nSuch notions were not the only source of friction between the Copenhagen team and Einstein. Bohr didn\u2019t like light quanta. While they seemed to explain the photoelectric effect, Bohr was convinced that light had to be fundamentally wave-like, so that photons (to use the anachronistic term) were only a way of speaking, not real entities.\n\nTo add to the turmoil in 1924, the French physicist Louis de Broglie had, in his doctoral thesis for the Sorbonne, turned the quantum idea on its head by proposing that particles such as electrons might show wave-like behaviour. Einstein had at first considered this too wild, but soon came round to the idea.\n\nGo where the waves take you\n\nIn 1924 these virtually heretical ideas were only beginning to surface, but they were creating such a sense of crisis that it seemed anything was possible. In the 1960s, science historian Paul Forman suggested that the feverish atmosphere in physics was part of an even wider cultural current. By rejecting causality and materialism, the German quantum physicists, Forman said, were attempting to align their ideas with a rejection of mechanistic thinking while embracing the irrational \u2013 as was the fashion in the philosophical and intellectual circles of the beleaguered Weimar republic. The idea has been hotly debated by historians and philosophers of science \u2013 but it was surely in Copenhagen, not Munich or G\u00f6ttingen, that the most radical attitudes to quantum theory were developing.\n\nParticle pilot In 1923, US physicist John Clark Slater moved to Copenhagen, and suggested the concept of a \u201cvirtual field\u201d that spread throughout a quantum system. (Emilio Segr\u00e8 Visual Archives General Collection/MIT News Office)\n\nThen, just before Christmas in 1923, a new student arrived at Copenhagen. John Clarke Slater, who had a PhD in physics from Harvard, turned up at Bohr\u2019s institute with a bold idea. \u201cYou know those difficulties about not knowing whether light is old-fashioned waves or Mr Einstein\u2019s light particles\u201d, he wrote to his family during a spell in Cambridge that November. \u201cI had a really hopeful idea\u2026 I have both the waves and the particles, and the particles are sort of carried along by the waves, so that the particles go where the waves take them.\u201d The waves were manifested in a kind of \u201cvirtual field\u201d of some kind that spread throughout the system, and they acted to \u201cpilot\u201d the particles.\n\nBohr was mostly not a fan of Slater\u2019s idea, not least because it retained the light particles that he wished to dispose of. But he liked Slater\u2019s notion of a virtual field that could put one part of a quantum system in touch with others. Together with Slater and Kramers, Bohr prepared a paper in a remarkably short time (especially for him) outlining what became known as the Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory. They sent it off to the Philosophical Magazine (where Bohr had published his seminal papers on the quantum atom) at the end of January 1924, and it was published in May (47(281) 785). As was increasingly characteristic of Bohr\u2019s style, it was free of any mathematics (beyond Einstein\u2019s quantum relationship E=h\u03bd).\n\nIn the BKS picture, an excited atom about to emit light can \u201ccommunicate continually\u201d with the other atoms around it via the virtual field. The transition, with emission of a light quantum, is then not spontaneous but induced by the virtual field. This mechanism could solve the long-standing question of how an atom \u201cknows\u201d which frequency of light to emit in order to reach another energy level: the virtual field effectively puts the atom \u201cin touch\u201d with all the possible energy states of the system.\n\nThe problem was that this meant the emitting atom was in instant communication with its environment all around \u2013 which violated the law of causality. Well then, so much the worse for causality: BKS abandoned it. The trio\u2019s theory also violated the conservation of energy and momentum \u2013 so they had to go too.\n\nCausality and conservation, abandoned\n\nBut wait: hadn\u2019t these conservation laws been proved? In 1923 the American physicist Arthur Compton in Cambridge had shown that when light is scattered by electrons, they exchange energy, and the frequency of the light decreases as it gives up energy to the electrons. The results of Compton\u2019s experiments agreed perfectly with predictions made on the assumptions that light is a stream of quanta (photons) and that their collisions with electrons conserve energy and momentum.\n\nAh, said BKS, but that\u2019s only true statistically. The quantities are conserved on average, but not in individual collisions. After all, such statistical outcomes were familiar to physicists: that was the basis of the second law of thermodynamics, which presented the inexorable increase in entropy as a statistical phenomenon that need not constrain processes involving single particles.\n\nThe radicalism of the BKS paper got a mixed reception. Einstein, perhaps predictably, was dismissive. \u201cAbandonment of causality as a matter of principle should be permitted only in the most extreme emergency\u201d, he wrote. Wolfgang Pauli, who had worked in Copenhagen in 1922\u201323, confessed to being \u201ccompletely negative\u201d about the idea. Born and Schr\u00f6dinger were more favourable.\n\nBut the ultimate arbiter is experiment. Was energy conservation really violated in single-particle interactions? The BKS paper motivated others to find out. In early 1925, German physicists Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger in Berlin looked more closely at Compton\u2019s X-ray scattering by electrons. Having read the BKS paper, Bothe felt that \u201cit was immediately obvious that this question would have to be decided experimentally, before definite progress could be made.\u201d\n\nExperimental arbitrators German physicists Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger (right) conducted an experiment to explore the BKS paper, that looked at X-ray scattering from electrons to determine the conservation of energy at microscopic scales. (IPP/\u00a9 Archives of the Max Planck Society)\n\nGeiger agreed, and the duo devised a scheme for detecting both the scattered electron and the scattered photon in separate detectors. If causality and energy conservation were preserved, the detections should be simultaneous; while any delay between them could indicate a violation. As Bothe would later recall \u201cThe \u2018question to Nature\u2019 which the experiment was designed to answer could therefore be formulated as follows: is it exactly a scatter quantum and a recoil electron that are simultaneously emitted in the elementary process, or is there merely a statistical relationship between the two?\u201d It was incredibly painstaking work to seek such coincident detections using the resources then available. But in April 1925 Geiger and Bothe reported simultaneity within a millisecond \u2013 close enough to make a strong case that Compton\u2019s treatment, which assumed energy conservation, was correct. Compton himself, working with Alfred Simon using a cloud chamber, confirmed that energy and momentum were conserved for individual events (Phys. Rev. 26 289).\n\nRevolutionary defeat\u2026 singularly important\n\nBothe was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for Physics for the work. He shared it with Born for his work on quantum theory, and Geiger would surely have been a third recipient, if he had not died in 1945. In his Nobel speech, Bothe definitively stated that \u201cthe strict validity of the law of the conservation of energy even in the elementary process had been demonstrated, and the ingenious way out of the wave-particle problem discussed by Bohr, Kramers, and Slater was shown to be a blind alley.\u201d\n\nBohr was gracious in his defeat, writing to a colleague in April 1925 that \u201cIt seems\u2026 there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible.\u201d Yet he was soon to have no need of that particular revolution, for just a few months later Heisenberg, who had returned to G\u00f6ttingen after working with Bohr in Copenhagen for six months, came up the first proper theory of quantum mechanics, later called matrix mechanics.\n\n\u201cIn spite of its short lifetime, the BKS theory was singularly important,\u201d says historian of science Helge Kragh, now emeritus professor at the Niels Bohr Institute. \u201cIts radically new approach paved the way for a greater understanding, that methods and concepts of classical physics could not be carried over in a future quantum mechanics.\u201d\n\nThe Bothe-Geiger experiment that [the paper] inspired was not just an important milestone in early particle physics. It was also a crucial factor in Heisenberg\u2019s argument [about] the probabilistic character of his matrix mechanics\n\nThe BKS paper was thus in a sense merely a mistaken curtain-raiser for the main event. But the Bothe-Geiger experiment that it inspired was not just an important milestone in early particle physics. It was also a crucial factor in Heisenberg\u2019s argument that the probabilistic character of his matrix mechanics (and also of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s 1926 version of quantum mechanics, called wave mechanics) couldn\u2019t be explained away as a statistical expression of our ignorance about the details, as it is in classical statistical mechanics.\n\nRadical approach Despite its swift defeat, the BKS proposal showed how classical concepts could not apply to a quantum reality. (Courtesy: Shutterstock/Vink Fan)\n\nRather, the probabilities that emerged from Heisenberg\u2019s and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s theories applied to individual events: they were, Heisenberg said, fundamental to the way single particles behave. Schr\u00f6dinger was never happy with that idea, but today it seems inescapable.\n\nOver the next few years, Bohr and Heisenberg argued that the new quantum mechanics indeed smashed causality and shattered the conventional picture of reality as an objective world of objects moving in space\u2013time with fixed properties. Assisted by Born, Wolfgang Pauli and others, they articulated the \u201cCopenhagen interpretation\u201d, which became the predominant vision of the quantum world for the rest of the century.\n\nFailed connections\n\nSlater wasn\u2019t at all pleased with what became of the idea he took to Copenhagen. Bohr and Kramers had pressured him into accepting their take on it, \u201cwithout the little lump carried along on the waves\u201d, as he put it in mid-January. \u201cI am willing to let them have their way\u201d, he wrote at the time, but in retrospect he felt very unhappy about his time in Denmark. After the BKS theory was disproved, Bohr wrote to Slater saying \u201cI have a bad conscience in persuading you to our views\u201d.\n\nSlater replied that there was no need for that. But in later life \u2013 after he had made a name for himself in solid-state physics \u2013 Slater admitted to a great deal of resentment. \u201cI completely failed to make any connection with Bohr\u201d, he said in a 1963 interview with the historian of science Thomas Kuhn. \u201cI fought with them [Bohr and Kramers] so seriously that I\u2019ve never had any respect for those people since. I had a horrible time in Copenhagen.\u201d While most of Bohr\u2019s colleagues and students expressed adulation, Slater\u2019s was a rare dissenting voice.\n\nBut Slater might have reasonably felt more aggrieved at what became of his \u201cpilot-wave\u201d idea. Today, that interpretation of quantum theory is generally attributed to de Broglie \u2013 who intimated a similar notion in his 1924 thesis, before presenting the theory in more detail at the famous 1927 Solvay Conference \u2013 and to American physicist David Bohm, who revitalized the idea in the 1950s. Initially dismissed on both occasions, the de Broglie-Bohm theory has gained advocates in recent years, not least because it can be applied to a classical hydrodynamic analogue, in which oil droplets are steered by waves on an oil surface.\n\nWhether or not it is the right way to think about quantum mechanics, the pilot-wave theory touches on the deep philosophical problems of the field. Can we rescue an objective reality of concrete particles with properties described by hidden variables, as Einstein had advocated, from the fuzzy veil that Bohr and Heisenberg seemed to draw over the quantum world? Perhaps Slater would at least be gratified to know that Bohr has not yet had the last word.\n\nThis article forms part of Physics World\u2018s contribution to the 2025 International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ), which aims to raise global awareness of quantum physics and its applications.
