            "article_content": "An Air Force veteran has made shocking claims about UFOs and alien retrieval programs long-rumored to be operated by the US government.\n\nJake Barber said he was working for the government to assist downed craft when one night, the 'communication process and procedure was modified' and he witnessed something that he believes was of extraterrestrial origin.\n\nHe was told to fly a helicopter to a specific area when came 150 feet from an 'egg-shaped' object with no engine or thermal signals.\n\n'I saw an egg, a white egg,' the pilot explained. 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before,' Barber told NewsNation.\n\nHis next order was to retrieve it from the ground, which he said was when he knew for sure the craft was not of this world.\n\n'I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary,' the pilot said.\n\n'Over the last couple of years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI [non-human intelligence] and it was not a unique experience,' he said.\n\nUAP stands for 'unidentified anomalous phenomena' and is a term used by the Department of Defense to describe mysterious objects in the sky.\n\nThree high-level military veterans are said to corroborate Barber's story, according to NewsNation.\n\nJake Barber, now a chief helicopter pilot in California, said he has witnessed alien craft while working for a secret UFO retrieval program\n\nHe spoke with NewsNation special network correspondent Ross Coulthart in his first whistleblower interview.\n\nWhen asked exactly how he knew the 'egg' was of alien origin, Barber said: 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was it was not human.\n\nBarber's LinkedIn profile states he is a 'disabled veteran,' but the account does not list his years in the Air Force.\n\nThe page shows that he is from California where he works as a chief pilot at San Joaquin Helicopters & Coastal Helicopters.\n\nThe full interview with Barber, titled 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower,' is set to air on Saturday, January 18th at 8pm ET.\n\nBarber's description matched another witness report from 1957 when two Civil Aeronautics Administration controllers in the tower at New Mexico's Kirtland Air Force Base saw 'an egg-shaped object.'\n\nM. Kaser and E. G. Brink claimed they witnessed a white light traveling eastwards across the runway, left, then crossed other runways and areas of the airfield.\n\nThey claimed the mysterious object did not have wings, a tail or a fuselage, and was elongated vertically.\n\nMany military personnel claimed to have witnessed UFOs. This image, obtained April 28, 2020, was taken by Navy pilots in 2017. Navy Cmdr David Fravor, who saw it, testified under oath in a hearing where he discussed the experience\n\nAnd it appeared to be 12 to 20 feet tall, according to a report in UFO Evidence.\n\nThe men reported the object was about the size of an automobile standing on its nose, and had a single white light at its base.\n\n'When the object was about 3000 feet ENE of the tower, it stopped completely and hovered for about a minute,' reads the case report.\n\n'Then it began moving again, slowly at first, but then suddenly climbing at an extremely rapid rate of speed until it disappeared into the overcast sky.\n\n'The object was in clear view at all time, with no intervening obstructions, according to the two men.'\n\nThey requested the radar control team track the object as it moved east, with radar showing it turning south at very high speeds 'until it reached the vicinity of the Albuquerque Low-Frequency Range Station, where it circled for several minutes.'\n\nThe object was then said to circle back to the Air Force base and follow behind a plane that had just taken off if to avoid detection."

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "The feature I dislike the most about Apple Intelligence has to be the AI-powered notification summaries.\n\nThese notification summaries are supposed to provide you with a quick way to glance at important information from your apps. If you have multiple notifications from an app like Apple News, the notification summaries feature recaps all your notifications into a short sentence or two, so that you don't have to read each individual notification you've received.\n\nUnfortunately, these notification summaries produce some truly absurd and inaccurate content.\n\nIn fact, it's been so bad that Apple has paused these AI-generated notification summaries as part of the latest iOS 18.3 beta released on Thursday.\n\nHowever, if you're on iOS 18.2, you still have these summaries on by default. However, if you're as unhappy with them as I've been, there is a way to disable notification summaries. Here's how.\n\nRead more: How to Get Apple Intelligence on Your iPhone With iOS 18.1\n\nWatch this: Apple's Monster iPhone Update: How Apple Intelligence Works on iOS 18.1 07:53\n\nI know Apple Intelligence is trying to help, but...\n\nThe new notification summary feature on Apple Intelligence uses AI to \"intelligently\" summarize your notifications, so you can quickly scan through key details from your busiest apps. And while the feature works pretty well for summarizing long emails into succinct points, it doesn't always make sense with text messages.\n\nApple Intelligence takes things too literally sometimes.\n\nThe other day, I received several text messages about how bad a hike was and how that person felt \"dead\" (tired) after, along with some other sparse details. This is how Apple Intelligence summarized those few messages for me:\n\nNot the greatest message to wake up to. Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nThis is a text about how a trainer \"killed\" my friend with a particular tough workout.\n\nThe trainer killed my friend? Or the other way round? Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nApple Intelligence, and more specifically the notification summaries feature, just doesn't do well with sarcasm, exaggerations, jokes and slang. And that's a problem, especially with how informal text messaging can be. There's even a subreddit with a ton of terrible notification summaries that people have received from Apple Intelligence. It takes everything at face value, which can lead to some pretty horrifying, incorrect or simply annoying summaries for text messages.\n\nHow to turn off notification summaries for text messages\n\nInstead of stressing each time a disturbing summary appears, I disabled notification summaries for text messages. If you want to do the same, it's easy:\n\nLaunch the Settings application Go to Notifications > Summarize Previews Toggle off Messages\n\nYou can disable notification summaries for any app on your iPhone. Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nIn place of receiving condensed summaries of multiple text messages, you'll see every individual text message on your lock screen or notification center like usual. You could completely disable notification summaries (turn off Summarize Previews) for every single app on your phone, but as I mentioned earlier, it works pretty well for emails and third-party apps.\n\nFor now, it's doing a really great job with text messages. See Siri? That's sarcasm."

While the museum itself is fascinating, boasting over 40 rooms of pioneer exhibits and Native American artifacts, the kicker is that it's housed in a nearly century-old hospital. If that wasn't creepy enough already, just wait until you hear the ghost stories that haunt the building to this day.\n\nOpened in 1932, the Alva General Hospital operated for 40 years until a new facility was built on the South side of town. The hospital had a bit of a reputation for botched surgeries, and rumor has it that the restless spirits of the wronged patients still roam the halls in search of vindication. In support of this theory, multiple people have reported seeing mysterious lights and shadows in the building after dark.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf you visit the museum, you'll see several nods to its past life, including a vintage medical equipment display with an embalming table and many other instruments. Only the first floor of the building is open to the public; the other two have long since been boarded up, which adds to the eeriness. There's also a player piano that allegedly sounds at random and a blood spot on the floor that magically reappears each time it's wiped away.\n\nWhether or not you have a paranormal experience at the museum (or even believe in ghosts, for that matter), the building's rich history alone makes it worth visiting. Plus, the rest of the exhibits are heaven for history buffs, with rooms modeled after everything from a historic schoolhouse to an old-fashioned drug store. Educational events such as blacksmithing workshops are held throughout the year, and elementary students come from all over the state to experience a realistic school day in early-1900s, small-town Oklahoma.\n\nVisit the Cherokee Strip Museum website for more information, including current hours of operation and entrance fees. You can also visit the Cherokee Strip Museum's Facebook page to see additional photos.\n\nHave you ever been to the Cherokee Strip Museum? If so, do you think it's one of the most haunted places in Oklahoma? We'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nCan't get enough frightful fun? Check out this hike to an abandoned castle in Oklahoma. It's one of the coolest (and creepiest) trails in the Sooner State \u2014 but decidedly less creepy if you have AllTrails+ in your pocket to keep you on the right track."

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "When we think of artificial intelligence (AI), data science and the potential real-world impact of these rapidly developing fields, we tend to look to the future\u2014particularly when it comes to health.\n\nIn life sciences, AI is already having a significant impact on our ability to bring new medicines to patients, from accelerating drug discovery to supporting the early detection of disease, improving clinical research and shaping our understanding of complex biology.\n\nAt AstraZeneca, an early adopter of AI and data science for healthcare, these tools are helping scientists in their quest to find life-changing new treatments for some of the world's most challenging diseases, in order to transform patient outcomes.\n\nJim Weatherall is the Chief Data Scientist, Biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. For the past five years, working closely with partners across the organization, he has played a key role in integrating data science and AI into drug discovery and development\u2014from answering specific scientific questions to improving the ways of working for chemists, biologists, and clinicians who are striving to solve them.\n\n\"Biology is still an unsolved problem,\" Weatherall says, \"It's characterized by a lot of uncertainty and a lot of variety\u2014variety between individuals, between cells in the body, variety between what the proteins in those cells do and how they talk to each other.\n\n\"There's still so much we don't understand. However, the good news is that we have extensive historical data from experiments and clinical trials. We're also continuously generating new data, more than ever before, and can use AI to turn it into value for patients at unprecedented speed and scale, in order to deliver much needed biomedical insights.\"\n\nOne of the key ways in which AI has transformed AstraZeneca's research is in the discovery and design of drugs. Historically, medicines have been discovered and designed manually by scientists in the laboratory\u2014this needs to be rigorous and deliberate, but can often be a slow and painstaking process, contributing to the lengthy development process of new medicines.\n\nNow, AstraZeneca chemists are armed with AI tools inspired by \"reinforcement learning.\" This technique is, in part, inspired and borrowed from its success in other tasks\u2014such as applications where computers can exceed human levels of performance in winning at games such as chess and Go.\n\n\"In reinforcement learning, you're asking AI to maximize a score, to find as many different outcomes as possible and choose the best one\u2014which is something that can be applied just as well to the design of a molecule that might one day become a new medicine,\" Weatherall explains.\n\nIt means that instead of synthesizing hundreds of molecules by hand, machine learning tools can quickly sift through thousands of possibilities, highlighting the most promising candidates for further study.\n\nIt also allows researchers to take a more \"zoomed-out perspective,\" Weatherall says, \"to help us make better scientific decisions, so that we can have a higher probability of success, and the potential for medicines to reach patients faster.\"\n\nGoing forward, AstraZeneca researchers are applying that same approach to different classes of medicines, such as antibodies, which are often used to treat diseases."

Sure, the company had a monster month of announcements in December. OpenAI took the o1 reasoning model out of beta, making it available to more ChatGPT users. The text-to-video Sora tool is now available to users in certain markets. The o3 reasoning model has also been announced and is currently undergoing testing.\n\nThese are just a few of the AI announcements OpenAI made in December, but there\u2019s no word on when the GPT-4o upgrade will drop. Unofficially, reports say that ChatGPT GPT-5, or whatever it ends up being called, is running behind schedule, as OpenAI has had issues training the next-gen AI model. OpenAI isn\u2019t the only AI company experiencing such problems.\n\nSam Altman has been hyping OpenAI\u2019s accomplishments recently, teasing potential ChatGPT features to come in 2025 while also talking about the larger goals. AGI (artificial general intelligence) is the next big thing, an AI that can tackle any task just like a human would. After AGI, we get to artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is AI that exceeds the capabilities of the human mind.\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\u201d Altman said in a blog post recently, adding that OpenAI is already starting to look at superintelligence development.\n\nTech.

Some people think the recent excitement that some OpenAI engineers are displaying online suggests that the company is indeed close to some sort of big advancement in AI.\n\nSome AI fans noticed the recent teasers from OpenAI employees, as well as an essay from an AI researcher who goes by the name of \u201cGwern\u201d online.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 AI Researcher Gwern just dropped the latest essay on OpenAI o3, o4, o5\n\n\n\nHere are a few important points from the essay:\n\n\n\n\u2013 openAI may have chosen to keep its \"o1-pro\" model private, using its computational resources to train a more advanced model like \"o3\", similar to the\u2026 https://t.co/p10BXXjuQH pic.twitter.com/Zcu7a1uY7C \u2014 Haider. (@slow_developer) January 16, 2025\n\nGwern theorized that OpenAI may hold the key to developing AGI and superintelligence. A powerful reasoning model like the o1 or o1 pro can produce the data needed to train more advanced reasoning models.\n\nThe essay author in the tweet above also said they\u2019re surprised OpenAI isn\u2019t keeping o1-pro private so they can use it for training o3 and newer models. Eventually, AI models will train themselves, leading to the big AGI and ASI breakthroughs we\u2019re waiting for.\n\nGwern suggests that OpenAI may already be on the verge of a big breakthrough, or they\u2019ve already done it behind closed doors:\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why OAers are suddenly weirdly, almost euphorically, optimistic on Twitter, watching the improvement from the original 4o model to o3 (and wherever it is now!) may be why. It\u2019s like watching the AlphaGo Elo curves: it just keeps going up\u2026 and up\u2026 and up\u2026 There may be a sense that they\u2019ve \u2018broken out\u2019 and have finally crossed the last threshold of criticality, from merely cutting-edge Al work, which everyone else will replicate in a few years, to takeoff \u2013 cracked intelligence to the point of being recursively self-improving and where o4 or o5 will be able to automate AI R&D and finish off the rest.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about OpenAI being close to the next massive improvement in AI but also the future beyond that. Access to superintelligence will make subsequent AI developments easier and more efficient because an AI mind will handle the next innovations.\n\nAlso, in a scenario where OpenAI might be close to AGI and ASI, it would obtain an incredible advantage over competitors. Other AI firms that have not established their own superintelligence will have to develop AI with traditional methods. In contrast, OpenAI would have ASI employing its own discoveries to create better AI, and it\u2019ll do it more efficiently.\n\nThis is all speculation at this point, as OpenAI has yet to make any announcements. But it\u2019s all based on the recent hype from Sam Altman and other OpenAI engineers. Of course, they always seem to go out of their way to hype OpenAI\u2019s efforts on social media, so this all could simply be more of the same.\n\nAlso, if and when ChatGPT AGI and ASI are reached, don\u2019t expect it to be affordable or even available publicly. At least, not initially. OpenAI rivals might be just as close to AGI and ASI, but they might be more restrained in teasing imminent breakthroughs.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also the safety aspect to consider. Artificial intelligence, from the current ChatGPT models to AGI and ASI, will have to be aligned with humanity\u2019s interests so it doesn\u2019t develop its own agenda, which could almost certainly endanger our species.\n\nBack to GPT-5, it\u2019ll still be interesting to see what OpenAI does next in terms of ChatGPT upgrades. More news about o3 should come soon. Then, GPT-4o will celebrate its first anniversary this summer. Some sort of upgrade for the base ChatGPT model is surely due soon."

            "article_content": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\n\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\n\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman\u2019s departure.\n\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company\u2019s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company\u2019s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\n\nThe move was a blow to Altman. \u201cI was like, that feels really bad,\u201d he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati\u2019s promotion as \u201cthe low point\u201d of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\n\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. \u201cShe did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,\u201d Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,\u201d she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was \u201cstepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\u201d A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever\u2019s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon."

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) have historically focused their virtual health care enforcement efforts on \u201ctraditional\u201d telemarketing, broker, runner, and related schemes. These arrangements generally involve sales agents, recruiters, or marketers who direct patients to purported telemedicine companies, which then enter into payment arrangements with physicians and/or non-physician practitioners for the provision of medically unnecessary health care services. The practitioners often have limited or no interaction with the supposed patients, do not review or have access to patient medical records, and order or prescribe medically unnecessary items or services from a predetermined list.\n\nIn July 2022, the OIG formalized its concerns regarding such arrangements in a Special Fraud Alert. As noted by the OIG, these schemes implicate multiple civil and criminal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the civil False Claims Act (FCA), and criminal fraud statutes. The OIG further stated that these arrangements have the potential for considerable harm to both federal health care programs and program beneficiaries, including (1) inappropriate increases in costs for medically unnecessary items and services, (2) patient harm or delayed clinical services, and (3) corruption of medical decision-making.\n\nWhile DOJ and the OIG have continued to pursue and investigate telefraud schemes, two cases announced in 2024 demonstrate a shift in telemedicine enforcement from \u201ctraditional\u201d schemes to more sophisticated investigations and potential criminal exposure in certain matters.\n\nFirst, in June 2024, Ruthie He, the founder, CEO, and clinical president of Done Global (Done), and David Brody, clinical president of Done and the sole physician shareholder of Done Health, P.C., were indicted, arrested, and arraigned in a first-of-its-kind telemedicine criminal prosecution (see our prior post here). Both He and Brody face a seven-count indictment alleging conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nThe indictment alleges that He and Brody orchestrated a scheme to generate over $100 million in revenue by inappropriately offering Adderall and other stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Among other allegations, the defendants purportedly violated the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine and directed practitioners to prescribe and renew Adderall prescriptions without clinical justification. The practitioners were allegedly paid based upon an above-market pay structure tied to the number of patients ultimately receiving prescriptions. Indeed, the indictment asserts that prescribing practitioners often were not licensed in the states where prescriptions were issued and that Adderall and other stimulants were ordered in violation of state physician supervision requirements.\n\nThe prosecution of He and Brody is proceeding in federal court in the Northern District of California before Judge Breyer. In October 2024, He\u2019s bond was revoked, and she was remanded to custody as a flight risk. On December 2, 2024, He filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, moved to compel disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion asserts that the indictment fails to satisfy the knowledge requirement under the Controlled Substances Act, that the health care fraud conspiracy elements have not been adequately alleged, and, in the alternative, that He should be entitled to grand jury materials. On December 16, 2024, DOJ opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing the sufficiency of the indictment and contesting the disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion to dismiss is currently pending.\n\nIn addition to He and Brody, several other Done personnel have cases pending in the Northern District of California. Two Done nurse practitioners and an executive leader have cases pending before Judge Breyer. In the last related case, a Done physician has entered a plea agreement.\n\nSecond, also in June 2024, a behavioral health telemedicine holding company and its practice affiliates (collectively, Supportive Care) agreed to pay approximately $4.6 million to resolve allegations related to the submission of false claims to Medicare and the Connecticut Medicaid program. Interestingly, DOJ alleged that the telemedicine company submitted false claims for \u201ctelehealth originating site facility fees.\u201d Under the applicable Medicare billing code, telehealth originating site fees are only billable when the originating site (in this case the nursing facility) provides administrative and clinical support for the telehealth patient. Instead, here, the telemedicine company and its affiliates billed for the originating site facility code.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ alleged that Supportive Care submitted false claims for psychological services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. DOJ alleged, however, that the beneficiaries were not in fact residing in the nursing facilities and had been transferred to various hospitals and admitted as inpatients. The settlement resolved both sets of FCA allegations.\n\nThese two cases demonstrate that DOJ and the OIG are expanding their investigation and enforcement activities beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d telefraud arrangements into more complex areas. In the Done prosecution, DOJ is seeking to criminally enforce allegedly fraudulent telehealth activity implicating compliance with state corporate practice and physician supervision requirements. In the Supportive Care resolution, DOJ and the OIG focused on the alleged failure to adhere to telehealth-specific codes. Both matters portend a trend likely to continue in 2025 whereby a maturing telehealth industry is subject to more sophisticated government investigations.\n\n[View source.]"

            "article_content": "When we think of artificial intelligence (AI), data science and the potential real-world impact of these rapidly developing fields, we tend to look to the future\u2014particularly when it comes to health.\n\nIn life sciences, AI is already having a significant impact on our ability to bring new medicines to patients, from accelerating drug discovery to supporting the early detection of disease, improving clinical research and shaping our understanding of complex biology.\n\nAt AstraZeneca, an early adopter of AI and data science for healthcare, these tools are helping scientists in their quest to find life-changing new treatments for some of the world's most challenging diseases, in order to transform patient outcomes.\n\nJim Weatherall is the Chief Data Scientist, Biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. For the past five years, working closely with partners across the organization, he has played a key role in integrating data science and AI into drug discovery and development\u2014from answering specific scientific questions to improving the ways of working for chemists, biologists, and clinicians who are striving to solve them.\n\n\"Biology is still an unsolved problem,\" Weatherall says, \"It's characterized by a lot of uncertainty and a lot of variety\u2014variety between individuals, between cells in the body, variety between what the proteins in those cells do and how they talk to each other.\n\n\"There's still so much we don't understand. However, the good news is that we have extensive historical data from experiments and clinical trials. We're also continuously generating new data, more than ever before, and can use AI to turn it into value for patients at unprecedented speed and scale, in order to deliver much needed biomedical insights.\"\n\nOne of the key ways in which AI has transformed AstraZeneca's research is in the discovery and design of drugs. Historically, medicines have been discovered and designed manually by scientists in the laboratory\u2014this needs to be rigorous and deliberate, but can often be a slow and painstaking process, contributing to the lengthy development process of new medicines.\n\nNow, AstraZeneca chemists are armed with AI tools inspired by \"reinforcement learning.\" This technique is, in part, inspired and borrowed from its success in other tasks\u2014such as applications where computers can exceed human levels of performance in winning at games such as chess and Go.\n\n\"In reinforcement learning, you're asking AI to maximize a score, to find as many different outcomes as possible and choose the best one\u2014which is something that can be applied just as well to the design of a molecule that might one day become a new medicine,\" Weatherall explains.\n\nIt means that instead of synthesizing hundreds of molecules by hand, machine learning tools can quickly sift through thousands of possibilities, highlighting the most promising candidates for further study.\n\nIt also allows researchers to take a more \"zoomed-out perspective,\" Weatherall says, \"to help us make better scientific decisions, so that we can have a higher probability of success, and the potential for medicines to reach patients faster.\"\n\nGoing forward, AstraZeneca researchers are applying that same approach to different classes of medicines, such as antibodies, which are often used to treat diseases."

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\n\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\n\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman\u2019s departure.\n\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company\u2019s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company\u2019s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\n\nThe move was a blow to Altman. \u201cI was like, that feels really bad,\u201d he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati\u2019s promotion as \u201cthe low point\u201d of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\n\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. \u201cShe did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,\u201d Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,\u201d she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was \u201cstepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\u201d A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever\u2019s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon."

Tobias H\u00fcttl, Head of Design Studio at Porsche, kindly sat down with me to answer a few questions on this automotive design collaboration for Honor's new Magic 7 series.\n\nHonor and Porsche have collaborated for three generations of smartphones now, starting with the Honor Magic V2, followed by the Porsche Design Magic 6. The newest Honor Magic7 RSR from Porshe Design however takes this to new levels, yet continues the iconic hexagonal camera design trend that we\u2019ve seen on previous Porsche X Honor handsets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was invited by Honor to the stunning resort of Bled in Slovenia this week to see first-hand the new Magic 7 AI devices (including the indestructible Magic 7 Lite), and to experience the company's innovations in advanced durable AI technology. This Porsche handset is not only exquisite, but ignites an existing trend of merging premium sports car-inspired design with the latest tech. Tobias H\u00fcttl shares the Magic7 RSR colour selection and design process.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nDo you have a favourite aspect of the RSR 7 phone? A favourite design element?\n\nI like the fact that you can hold it in your hand and it feels premium and special, right? Without needing a visual of it. So I think that's very nice. And I also like the sharp edges that you can feel around the camera unit at the back, I think that's adding this very central quality that helps people appreciate the project.\n\nCan you tell me a bit about the colours of the Honor Magic7 RSR Porsche design?\n\nThe two colours that we have are Agate Grey and Provence. With those colours, we hoped to differentiate quite strongly between customer choices. Provence is much more subtle than the Frozen Berry Metallic [this was a colour option available with the Magic 6] which is more vibrant, and as the name suggests, more like an ice cream. But the Provence is something that\u2019s toned down, less reflective, with less saturation. I think it's also a little bit more bluish compared to the Frozen Berry.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe've tried different directions, and then the choice finally fell on the Provence. We think it's a bit of a mystery colour, and it's something that's still subtle, but at the same time, I think that's something that we like a lot about it. It's not resembling a super strong race car colour or anything. It's elegant still, even though it's something that people can recognize and see as something special.\n\nIs there a reason why you didn't opt for turbonite as a colour choice for the phone?\n\n[This is the popular grey Pantone hue that was made exclusively for Porsche].\n\nSo the turbonite is interesting because it's dedicated to Porsche's turbo collection, right? So with our phone not being a turbo phone, it would not have been a very consistent story.\n\nRead more: Porsche's turbonite is the most surprising colour trend of NYFW\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nIs this handset trying to sell a smartphone to a Porsche owner, or a Porsche to Honor customers?\n\nIt can work both ways. I mean, in the end, I think that the product should stand for itself. It should have a quality for itself, character for itself. There is a connection, for sure, with everything that's in the Porsche cosmos and with the Porsche DNA as well. We think that it's grown up enough to hold its own justification and attraction as a product.\n\nHow did you work with Honor over decisions such as colour, material, and form?\n\nIn the beginning, with the ideation phase, we're very broad. So we are looking into all different kinds of directions and ideas, but then there are certain colours which work in certain settings and maybe not in others. Some things make sense with the design of the car but not so much within the phone world.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith Honor, we kind of sit down and discuss together what's the common denominator within our understanding of aesthetics, and then we find the right material for the right product. Materials are always something that we are interested in. If you look at the phones, materials are one of the differentiating factors.\n\nDid you seek any feedback from customers and fans of the brand?\n\nThere's lots of input from all kinds of dimensions. So there are customer inputs, and there's also market inputs that we have within our broader corporation, but eventually, we made a decision with what colour to go with on an informed basis.\n\nWere there any big design decisions that you couldn't agree on?\n\nIt's always like that. I think that\u2019s the nature of design. You come up with a lot of ideas, but then again, I think it's very important to also have restrictions in the design process. So it was the balance between something that people think of without any kind of limitations, and that's what's possible on the other side, and in the end, you find the best solution with a product that's feasible and aesthetically pleasing. There are mostly technical limitations. Things like user habits and economics people have that we have to take into account.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDid Porsche Design have any input on the software within the Magic 7 series?\n\nSo what was important for us on the software part is that we have one design, for hardware and software, and we had a strong impact on the graphics for the user interface buttons as well, to make it a homogeneous experience as a user. There are new software features [compared with the Honor Magic 6] within the new iOS, so we've also taken that into account for the design elements.\n\nDo you feel that the crossover between automotive design and global fashion trends will eventually have the same weight in the smartphone industry?\n\nThat's very interesting. I think that people hold phones very dearly, and I think that's something that everyone has to deal with. So naturally, I think phones and cars are things that people will consider a very attractive product in their minds. So to think about the relationship of those two things is always important.\n\nIs there a colour that you absolutely would not consider for this particular brand of phone?\n\nI think it's always content-specific. It has to fit with the nature of the product and in this case with the RSR 7, I think the two colours that we have address a lot of customer needs. So you can have a buyer who is the subtle type, and the other one might be a bit more of the extrovert type. And I think it's a good mixture of colours. So I would say we keep this open. I wouldn't include all the colours. But logistically it's interesting.\n\nThe new Honor Magic7 RSR phone design incorporates some of Porsche's signature elements, including the hexagonal shape of the camera unit (resembling sports car headlights) and the seamless integration and nods to the aerodynamic aesthetics of the Porsche Taycan Turbo S sports car.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen I asked Tobias which phone colour he preferred out of the two options, he suggested, \"personally, I would just get both\".\n\nIf you're interested in owning this ultra-premium smartphone for yourself, expect to spend a staggering \u00a31,549. This exclusive and limited smartphone will be available soon, but to be notified and register your interest, be sure to head to the Porsche website for all the details."

China has been making agile policies that allow fast proof of concept, [as well as] failure and retry, which facilitates really quick iterations,\u201d said Ann Shi Yu, vice-president of autonomous driving company Pony.ai.\n\n\u201cThe competition in China is fiercer, which forces [companies] to progress,\u201d Shi said, noting that in the US only Alphabet-backed Waymo is capable of operating hundreds of fully autonomous robotaxis on public roads. In China, there is \u201cdefinitely more than one company doing that\u201d.\n\nPony.ai was operating around 250 robotaxis and roughly 190 robotrucks as of the end of 2024, according to Shi. Domestic rivals have also achieved a fleet size in the hundreds, including Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go which operates more than 400 robotaxis in Wuhan, Hubei province.\n\nThe panel discussion on AI at the Post\u2019s China Conference in Nansha on Wednesday.

            "article_content": "Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors.\n\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive thinks his company has the best artificial-intelligence technology on the market. Now he has to get consumers to care.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors and he wants the chatbot built on it to be used by 500 million people by the end of 2025, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t said how many people currently use Gemini, but market leader ChatGPT has about 300 million weekly users. The Gemini app was the 54th most downloaded free app on iPhones Wednesday. ChatGPT was No. 4.\n\nGoogle was caught flat-footed by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, despite being one of the pioneers of AI and spending years working on similar chatbots. The company has been scrambling to catch up ever since.\n\nGemini isn\u2019t yet a serious moneymaker, but it is central to Google\u2019s push to stay on the cutting edge of AI, a technology already starting to reshape the company\u2019s core search and ads businesses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s newest AI technology jumped ahead of ChatGPT maker OpenAI\u2019s technology last month on the Chatbot Arena rankings closely watched by people in Silicon Valley. OpenAI dominated the rankings for much of the past year.\n\nGoogle launched the Gemini chatbot, formerly Bard, a few months after ChatGPT and has updated it with dozens of new features in an effort to gain ground. OpenAI, meanwhile, began directly targeting Google last summer when it added a web-search function to ChatGPT.\n\nThe ChatGPT mobile app has been downloaded about 465 million times on Android and iOS devices, compared with 106 million for Gemini, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nMost of those downloads came on Android phones. Until recently, Gemini was part of Google\u2019s search app on Apple devices. A separate Gemini app for iOS made its debut in November. Google said it was downloaded more than 10 million times through the end of the year.\n\nUsage of AI features built into other applications, such as Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, aren\u2019t captured by publicly available measures.\n\nUntil recently, the Gemini chatbot team reported to the executive in charge of search and ads, but a recent reorganization moved it to the Google DeepMind division that does advanced research.\n\nPichai said at the time that the move would \u201cenable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app.\"\n\nGrowth in search advertising has slowed in recent years, and Google has increasingly looked to new business lines including subscriptions. It offers a premium version of Gemini with more features for $20 a month, similar to other chatbots.\n\nBut unlike its competitors, Google packages its Gemini subscription with perks including AI features in apps like Gmail and two terabytes of file storage.\n\nSifei Han, a data scientist living in Philadelphia, upgraded to the Gemini premium plan last year after being offered a two-month free trial. He said he mainly uses it for the extra storage, not the AI features.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with ChatGPT\u2019s style,\" said Han, who also pays for ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAbout 60% of Gemini\u2019s paying users kept their subscriptions six months after first signing up, according to an Earnest Analytics analysis of debit- and credit-card data from millions of anonymous consumers. That was better than some competitors such as Character.AI and Perplexity, but lagged behind OpenAI and Anthropic, which makes the chatbot Claude.\n\nSubscriptions to Gemini were a fraction of the $10.7 billion in revenue Google parent Alphabet made from subscriptions, device sales and purchases in its mobile app store in the three months ended September. Google\u2019s core advertising business brought in $65.9 billion during the same period. The company hasn\u2019t introduced ads in Gemini.\n\nGemini has been a source of controversy in the past. Google apologized to users and rolled back an image-generation feature last year after the chatbot produced images of Black soldiers in Nazi garb and sometimes refused to generate depictions of white people. It restored the feature six months later.\n\nIn addition to the chatbot, Gemini is powering features that perform complex tasks for users, like preparing research reports and generating podcasts based on a set of documents.\n\nGoogle sells the technology that powers Gemini to developers, uses it for the \u201cAI overviews\" that sometimes appear at the top of search results and recently began packaging it with the business versions of Gmail and Google Drive. Pichai has said all of Google\u2019s products with more than two billion users now have features powered by Gemini.\n\nThe company has also tried to convince device manufacturers to make Gemini the default assistant on mobile phones, which it already does on its own Pixel phones. Motorola and OnePlus, which both use Google\u2019s Android mobile software, made Gemini the default on some of their phones last year.\n\nWrite to Miles Kruppa at"

            "article_content": "The retail industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, thanks to the transformative power of machine learning. A recent article by Akhilesh Kota sheds light on how machine learning is revolutionizing the dynamic pricing landscape, enabling retailers to make more informed and adaptive decisions. The insights delve into the nuances of this innovative approach, emphasizing its role in reshaping consumer experiences and business profitability.\n\nUnderstanding Dynamic Pricing\n\nDynamic pricing is a strategy that adjusts prices in real-time, responding to fluctuations in demand, competition, and external factors. Unlike traditional static pricing, it uses advanced algorithms to analyze and react to market conditions with accuracy and speed. When combined with machine learning, dynamic pricing becomes even more powerful. Machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and refine pricing strategies based on actionable insights. This enables businesses to stay competitive, meet customer expectations, and maximize revenue. By ensuring prices are neither excessively high nor unsustainably low, dynamic pricing balances profitability with customer satisfaction, driving sustainable business growth.\n\nMachine Learning: The Game Changer\n\nThe application of machine learning in dynamic pricing brings unprecedented sophistication to pricing strategies, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Machine learning algorithms excel in several key areas:\n\nAnalyzing Market Trends: These systems detect subtle shifts in consumer preferences, competitor pricing, and market conditions, enabling proactive and informed pricing adjustments.\n\nPredicting Demand: By forecasting demand patterns for specific products and timeframes, businesses can optimize inventory levels, avoid stockouts, and maximize revenue opportunities.\n\nEnhancing Personalization: Tailored pricing strategies based on individual customer profiles, preferences, and purchase history create a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.\n\nBy automating complex analytical processes, machine learning not only reduces human error but also enables faster, more accurate responses to dynamic market conditions, empowering businesses to stay competitive.\n\nData as the Backbone\n\nThe success of machine learning in dynamic pricing hinges on the quality and diversity of data inputs. Retailers need to collect extensive information, such as historical sales trends, customer demographics, competitor pricing, and broader economic indicators. These datasets are essential for training algorithms that evolve and optimize pricing strategies over time. Furthermore, integrating real-time data allows these models to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions, ensuring prices remain competitive and aligned with current demand. This combination of comprehensive data and real-time updates empowers businesses to make informed, agile decisions, helping them gain an edge in today\u2019s fast-paced and competitive markets.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nThe potential of machine learning in dynamic pricing is vast, but it comes with challenges that businesses must navigate carefully. Ethical concerns, such as unintentional price discrimination, can erode consumer trust if not addressed transparently. Moreover, the implementation of machine learning systems demands substantial investment in infrastructure, skilled professionals, and technical expertise. These hurdles can be daunting, particularly for smaller organizations. To overcome them, businesses should prioritize transparency in pricing strategies and ensure algorithms adhere to ethical standards. Investing in scalable, user-friendly technologies and fostering a workforce skilled in data science can simplify adoption, ensuring the benefits outweigh the challenges.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThe integration of machine learning into dynamic pricing represents a transformative shift toward a smarter and more adaptive retail landscape. As technology continues to advance, several key developments are expected to shape the future of pricing strategies:\n\nImproved Algorithms: Enhanced models will delve deeper into consumer behavior, identifying subtle trends and preferences for precise price adjustments.\n\nSeamless Integration: Dynamic pricing systems will increasingly connect with inventory management, marketing, and customer engagement tools, creating unified ecosystems.\n\nGlobal Applications: Machine learning will enable region-specific pricing strategies, catering to the unique demands of diverse markets and cultural contexts.\n\nThese advancements will not only empower retailers with better decision-making tools but also foster customer satisfaction by ensuring transparent, fair, and competitive pricing tailored to individual needs.\n\nIn conclusion, Akhilesh Kota\u2019s insights into machine learning-powered dynamic pricing reveal its immense potential to transform retail. Leveraging data and advanced algorithms enables businesses to enhance efficiency, boost profitability, and adapt to evolving market demands. Embracing these innovations will be essential for retailers aiming to thrive in a competitive and rapidly changing industry landscape."

            "article_content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 After more than a year of painstaking negotiations, Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to a ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip that, if implemented, could see nearly three dozen Israeli hostages reunited with their families and give hungry and displaced Palestinians a reprieve from months of violence.\n\nIsrael\u2019s government still needs to formally approve the deal, in a vote officials say will take place Thursday morning. But the agreement could mark a first step toward ending a 15-month war that has destroyed Gaza and divided Israelis.\n\nThe truce, mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, would begin on Sunday and cover an initial period of 42 days.\n\nPalestinians in Khan Younis celebrated the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. (Video: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis is one of the toughest negotiations I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d President Joe Biden said Wednesday in remarks from the White House. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply satisfied this day has come \u2026 for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nplay Play now NaN min Follow on Podcast episode Spotify Apple Google Amazon\n\nUnder the first six-week phase of what mediators hope will evolve into a three-stage process for peace, 33 of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2014 mainly women, children, the elderly and wounded \u2014 will be released from Hamas captivity in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli detention, in a carefully choreographed sequence that will involve humanitarian groups and coordination between Hamas, Egypt and Israel.\n\nAmong the 33 captives slated for release are Americans Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nDekel-Chen was wounded in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Siegel, 65, will be freed because of his age. A third U.S. citizen, Edan Alexander, was abducted near Gaza while serving in the Israeli military and won\u2019t be released until the second phase of the ceasefire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas agreed to release five female Israeli soldiers in the first phase. The remains of at least four more Americans are also still in Gaza. \u201cWe are committed to getting the remains out,\u201d the official said.\n\nIsrael and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Jan. 15, following more than 15 months of devastating war. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)\n\nIsrael will withdraw troops from some parts of Gaza and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into the enclave, where 90 percent of the population, or 1.9 million people, are displaced in squalid conditions with little food, water or shelter from the cold.\n\nDuring the first phase, the volume of aid entering Gaza is supposed to reach more than 500 trucks per day, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday \u2014 a more than sixfold increase over the average number in December.\n\nBut even once the bombs stop falling, steep challenges will remain in getting lifesaving assistance to civilians who need it, including abiding lawlessness in Gaza, destroyed roads and onerous Israeli inspection processes for cargoes entering the territory, aid workers say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of hope and opportunity, but we should be under no illusions how tough it will still be to get support to survivors,\u201d U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said in a statement. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nMohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign affairs minister, spoke on Jan. 15, as Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire. (Video: Reuters)\n\nIsraeli forces will remain in a buffer zone along Gaza\u2019s borders, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a news conference in Doha, where negotiators spent the last few days hammering out the deal. After a week, if the truce holds, Palestinian civilians sheltering in southern and central Gaza will be allowed to return to the north, which in recent months has been decimated by intense Israeli bombardment and clashes with Hamas militants.\n\nSince October, Israeli forces have besieged the northernmost part of the enclave, blocking most aid and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. Israel divided the territory into a north and south with a line of fortified checkpoints known as the Netzarim Corridor just outside Gaza City, only occasionally allowing humanitarians to cross into northern areas.\n\nNegotiations for Phase 2 of the deal \u2014 during which the remaining living hostages would be released and Israel would withdraw completely from Gaza \u2014 are supposed to begin in the coming weeks. During Phase 3, Hamas would return the bodies of hostages who were killed and the reconstruction of Gaza would get underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal has offered a glimmer of hope in a conflict that has taken an immense human toll: Israeli attacks have killed more than 46,700 people in Gaza and injured more than 110,200, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 405 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.\n\nA war that began with Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel spiraled into a regional conflagration, marked by more than a year of exchanges of fire between Israel and its allies and Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThere was still much that could go wrong during the deal\u2019s implementation, and Israeli officials have emphasized that so far, it is a temporary pause. The thorniest questions \u2014 including who will govern and secure Gaza \u2014 remain unresolved, and negotiations over these and other issues are expected to begin later in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombardment of Gaza hasn\u2019t let up: At least 19 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across the territory on Wednesday night after the ceasefire was announced.\n\nStill, even before mediator Qatar declared that a deal was reached, celebrations broke out in Gaza and among hostage families and supporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a statement shortly after the announcement insisting that some details still needed to be worked out. But President-elect Donald Trump had already blasted out the news to the world, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cWE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday night, the parties were still arguing over the names of high-profile prisoners to be released under the agreement, according to an official familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s cabinet and members of his coalition government must vote on Thursday morning to approve the deal. His far-right allies in government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, both slammed the agreement as a bad deal that spares Hamas and threatened to withdraw from Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\nStill, the prime minister is widely expected to have enough votes to push through the agreement, and Israel\u2019s Supreme Court is expected to dismiss possible legal challenges to the deal.\n\n\u201cThis is an important move. This is a necessary move,\u201d Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in televised remarks Wednesday night, urging the government to make the ceasefire official. \u201cThere is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us \u2014 whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.\u201d\n\nLeaders from mediating countries appeared to dismiss the procedural steps in Israel as mere formalities. Qatar\u2019s Mohammed, Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi each declared victory after months of stop-and-start negotiations that repeatedly saw negotiators and intelligence chiefs huddle in Middle Eastern capitals, only to return home empty-handed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cToo many innocent people have died. Too many communities have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe mediators, at least for now, overcame the herculean task of reconciling the diametrically opposed positions of Israel and Hamas. Israel wanted to continue the fighting after a temporary pause and hostage-for-prisoner exchange, while Hamas insisted on a permanent end to the war before it would surrender any captives.\n\nBut pressure on both parties pushed them to close the gap. Netanyahu was under fire from hostage families and those who lost loved ones in the war. He was also in potential legal peril abroad, after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas was severely weakened after Israel killed its top leaders and kneecapped regional allies. Residents grew increasingly angry as they struggled to survive the punishing campaign Israel launched in response to the Hamas attacks.\n\nIn the end, the deal agreed to Wednesday aligns to a large extent with the phased approach Biden proposed in May: An initial pause in hostilities and release of hostages is intended to lead to \u201csustainable calm,\u201d according to a joint statement by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. Those three countries are meant to serve as guarantors of the deal, and Mohammed said a monitoring body would be established in Cairo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden and Trump each claimed credit for a diplomatic achievement closed through rare foreign-policy collaboration between the outgoing and incoming administrations. As Biden officials carried out the formal diplomacy, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, met with Netanyahu over the weekend to pressure the Israeli prime minister to agree to a deal before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nBiden said \u201cthis deal was developed and negotiated under my administration\u201d but that his officials had been speaking \u201cas one team\u201d with their soon-to-be successors in recent days.\n\nHamas leader Khalil al-Hayya hailed the ceasefire as a triumph for the militant group: \u201cToday we prove that the occupation will never defeat our people and their resistance,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHospitals in Israel are preparing to receive hostages who may be malnourished, injured or ill \u2014 and will certainly be traumatized, Israeli media reported.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, where thousands have gathered for months each Saturday night to protest the government\u2019s failure to bring all of the hostages home sooner, crowds beat drums and chanted.\n\n\u201cI hope it will not just be a ceasefire but a stop to the war,\u201d said Benjamin Terem, 65, from Tel Aviv. \u201cWe cannot stay in this situation.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, 20-year-old Farah Hathout said she was displaced nine times throughout the war. She woke up where she is sheltering in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, to check the news.\n\n\u201cIs it real? Have they signed?\u201d she said she asked herself.\n\n\u201cI pray it goes through,\u201d said Hathout, who was in tears. \u201cMay God compensate us for what we experienced.\u201d\n\nDeYoung reported from Washington, Shih from Jerusalem, Balousha from Toronto and Mahfouz from Cairo. Miriam Berger and Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv, Mohamad El Chamaa in Beirut, and Hajar Harb in London contributed to this report."

Strong discounts on previously launched iPhone models resulted into double-digit growth in Apple\u2019s shipments last year.\n\n\u201cApple, with its aspirational image and rising footprint, has become an obvious choice for young consumers in India, especially beyond tier-II cities. For Indians, the iPhone is more than a smartphone\u2014it\u2019s a lifestyle statement,\u201d said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint India.\n\nAlso Read Rural India extends lead in internet usage: IAMAI-Kantar Foxconn pulls plug on Chinese workers to India, equipment from China also paused to iPhone plants: Report KOEL Vs SEBI: KBL intervention application allowed Flipkart puts all iPhones on sale: iPhone 16 at Rs 63,999, iPhone 14 at Rs 46,999 \u2014 top deals\n\nAnalysts note that upper and middle-class segments, particularly the youth, are driving this incremental purchase behaviour.\n\nApple\u2019s market share stood at 8.6% in the July-September quarter, as per IDC, with shipments growing 58.5% year-on-year during that period. For the full year, Apple shipped over 12 million iPhones in India, marking a 35% year-on-year growth.\n\n\u201cAs we analyse Apple\u2019s strategic approach, we observe the implementation of a comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) strategy, centered around key pillars of domestic manufacturing, distribution, and driving premiumisation. This multi-faceted approach reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to staying ahead in the market and catering to the evolving needs of consumers,\u201d Pathak added.\n\nIn September, Apple launched its latest iPhone 16 series, further boosting its sales momentum. The company\u2019s flagship retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai have also contributed significantly to its growing footprint.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to bring four new stores to customers in India,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook had said recently.\n\nApple is also launching four more retail stores in the country. The company has set an all-time revenue record in India in the July-September quarter."

            "article_content": "Senators on Thursday pressed some of President-elect Donald Trump's top Cabinet picks on his central campaign promises, critical natural disaster relief and more.\n\nInterior secretary nominee Doug Burgum, proposed Environmental Protection Agency director Lee Zeldin, Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent and Housing secretary nominee Scott Turner all went before lawmakers. After fiery faceoffs earlier in the week, they were asked in calmer hearings about the nation's economy and readiness for natural disasters.\n\nBessent would be Trump\u2019s point person on GOP priorities such as tax cuts and tariffs. Meanwhile, Burgum and Zeldin would both have sway over the Trump administration's energy policy, a cornerstone of the president-elect's reelection bid.\n\nHere are USA TODAY's top takeaways from the hearings.\n\nMore:Takeaways from Senate confirmation hearings: Democrats grill Trump Cabinet nominee\n\nBipartisan concerns about tariffs\n\nTrump often talks about implementing tariffs on foreign goods, deploying them during his first term and promising more in a second administration.\n\n\u201cThe word tariff, properly used, is a beautiful word - one of the most beautiful words I've ever heard,\u201d Trump told a crowd of Georgia supporters in September. \u201cIt's music to my ears.\u201d\n\nBessent, a prominent hedge fund manager, said Americans should think about tariffs in three ways under Trump: A negotiating tactic, a tool to remedy \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d and a way to raise revenue.\n\nBut some lawmakers are nervous about mores tariffs.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Bessent that tariffs on Canadian goods could strike the economy in his New England state.\n\n\u201cWhat reassurance can we get from the Trump administration that there\u2019s going to be a do-no-harm policy to American consumers and Vermont workers and small businesses with a tariff policy?\u201d Welch asked.\n\nBessent argued Trump is sensitive to the needs of \"working America,\" but he admitted to lawmakers it's \u201cvery difficult for me to isolate Vermont especially.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., raised concerns about the impact of tariffs on U.S. farmers\n\n\u201cOveruse of tariffs can inflate costs and provoke trade retaliation,\u201d Young told Bessent. \u201cAs Hoosier farmers have experienced first hand over the years, they often bare the impact.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to impose massive tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status are likely to reignite inflation and dampen economic growth, according to forecasters.\n\nYet his pledge to extend and expand the sweeping tax cuts passed in his first term and ease the regulatory burden on businesses could juice the economy and have mixed effects on inflation.\n\nClimate questions\n\nTrump has promised to expand oil production in the U.S., and he'll lean on Burgum to help. The former North Dakota governor told senators he believes America has reached an energy crisis, but he also believes climate change exists.\n\nRepublicans like West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who owns a coal mining business, told Burgum energy is \u201ca key that opens every door.\u201d\n\nDemocrats like Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, pointed to testimonies previously given by former Secretaries of Defense James Mattis and Chuck Hagel. They said climate change is a national security threat that affects areas where troops are stationed.\n\nMore:'When can he start?': Trump allies bullish on Cabinet nominees getting confirmed\n\n\u201cWithin fossil fuels, the concern has been about emissions, and within emissions, we have the technology to do things like carbon capture to eliminate harmful emission,\u201d Burgum said.\n\nMore:What is carbon capture and how does it work? Inside the process that could slow global warming\n\n\u201cYou have military leaders who acknowledge that climate change is a major issue,\" Hirono shot back. \"For you to take the position that you're going to engage in active actions that will result in the burden of burning more fossil fuel, it's troubling.\"\n\nZeldin was also questioned about climate change.\n\n\u201cDo you agree with President-elect Trump that climate change is a hoax?\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked.\n\nZeldin replied that he believes climate change is real, before defending his potential future boss.\n\n\u201cAs far as President Trump goes, the context that I have heard him speak about it was with a criticism of policies that have been enacted because of climate change,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cAnd I think that he\u2019s concerned about the economic costs of some policies where there\u2019s a debate and a difference of opinion between parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would respectfully disagree with you,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWildfire control \u2018very key\u2019\n\nCalifornia wildfires have left 25 dead and thousands of schools, businesses and other structures destroyed in the Greater Los Angeles area. Lawmakers asked Trump's nominees about the blazes during Thursday's hearings.\n\nSens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., opened their remarks by addressing the fires. Lee directed Burgum that, if he's confirmed, addressing wildfires that shocked Western states should be a \"very key priority\" for the country's future.\n\nElsewhere, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned Zeldin on his willingness to advocate for Californians affected by the Los Angeles-area wildfires fires. Trump and certain House Republicans have signaled their interest in placing conditions on disaster aid for California, amid tense relations between the president-elect and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\u201cI assume, Mr. Zeldin, your response will not depend on whether disaster strikes a red state or a blue state, you will equally work to speed relief to those Americans affected?\u201d Schiff asked.\n\n\u201cYes, senator,\u201d Zeldin replied. The potential Trump pick vowed he would \"do everything in my power to be able to assist\" devastated communities.\n\nTax fight preview\n\nTrump\u2019s signature achievement during his first administration was a massive tax cut.\n\nSome of those tax cut provisions expire at the end of 2025. Trump wants to extend them and has promised new cuts, including ending taxes on tipped wages and Social Security payments.\n\nBessent said extending the Trump tax cuts is the single most important economic issue of the day.\n\n\u201cThis is pass- fail, that if we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing an economic calamity,\u201d he said.\n\nBessent was also asked about everything from increasing the federal minimum wage to capping credit card interest rates and increasing economic sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBessent said he doesn\u2019t support increasing minimum wage nationally. He argued it's a step that should be taken by states instead.\n\nLater, he was open to increasing sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"If any officials in the Russian Federation are watching this confirmation hearing they should know that if I'm confirmed, and if President Trump requests as part of his strategy to end the Ukraine war, that I would be 100% on board for taking sanctions up,\" Bessent said.\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson"

The complexity of implementing and managing secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining network integrity has become a critical concern for both IT administrators and Security practitioners.\n\nCommon security vulnerabilities\n\nModern guest Wi-Fi networks face several significant security threats:\n\nLack of Network Micro-Segmentation: Networks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.\n\nNetworks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data. Weak Encryption: Most of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association.\n\nMost of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data.\n\nAttackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data. Inadequate Authentication: Some networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks.\n\nSome networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks. Rogue Access Points (APs): Attackers can set up rogue APs mimicking legitimate Guest Wi-Fi to lure users and steal sensitive information.\n\nIf not properly secured, the Wi-Fi guest networks pose significant security risks. Weak access controls allow unauthorized users to exploit the network, leading to data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. A critical issue is the lack of network segmentation; without proper isolation, attackers on the guest network may access internal systems, risking data breaches.\n\nInsufficient authentication and weak password practices further heighten vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement VLANs, strict authentication, and active monitoring. A well-segmented guest network helps maintain security while offering convenient access to visitors.\n\nWhy is BYOD the most critical category to monitor?\n\nBYOD introduces a mix of unmanaged and potentially insecure devices into the network. These devices often lack corporate-level security controls and might already be compromised with malware, creating a direct entry point for attackers once connected to the network.\n\nIf the attacker has access to the network through a BYOD, sensitive corporate data accessed via BYOD devices may increase the likelihood of unintentional or malicious data leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the potential actions that can be implemented to mitigate such issues :\n\nProper Network Segmentation\n\nAsset inventory\n\nEncryption\n\nAuthentication Mechanism (like Captive Portal)\n\nProfiled Security Policies\n\nMonitoring and Threat Detection\n\nZero Trust Approach\n\nPotential consequences for businesses\n\nSecurity breaches in guest Wi-Fi networks can have devastating impacts on organizations. Recent studies indicate that 40% of businesses have experienced information compromise through public Wi-Fi networks. The financial implications are significant, with some companies reporting ransomware payments exceeding $1 million to recover their data.\n\nBeyond immediate financial losses, businesses face:\n\nDamage to brand reputation and customer trust\n\nDisruption of normal business operations\n\nPotential loss of intellectual property\n\nCompromise of internal network resources\n\nLegal and compliance considerations\n\nOrganizations must navigate complex regulatory requirements when implementing guest Wi-Fi management systems. The legal framework includes multiple layers of compliance, they need to warrant the security level for their network while ensuring the confidentiality of the users' data, and they need to cooperate with the authorities when required while complying with limited data retention period obligation. It is even more difficult for international organizations because they need to monitor and stay updated on any regulations' changes in various countries and jurisdictions, operating at international levels creates diverse and even contradictory obligations, for example, the data retention policies are different among countries, in France, it is required to retain data logs for 1 year, but it is 6 years in Italy, while the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires users' data to be deleted after the purposes have been achieved. Some key regulations need to be taken into consideration:\n\nTherefore, businesses must implement proper documentation, monitoring systems, and security controls to maintain compliance with these regulations. Regular security audits and network infrastructure updates are essential to maintaining legal compliance while providing secure guest access.\n\nLeveraging Cloud Captive Portals for Enhanced Security\n\nCloud-based captive portal solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern network security infrastructure. These sophisticated systems provide organizations with centralized control over guest access while maintaining robust security protocols.\n\nHow Cloud Captive Portals Work\n\nCloud-captive portals function as gateway systems that authenticate users before granting network access. The system intercepts initial connection attempts and redirects users to a secure login page. Organizations can implement various authentication methods, including:\n\nSocial login integration\n\nSponsor\n\nDeclarative Email\n\nSMS Authentication\n\nThese solutions operate without additional hardware requirements, making them infrastructure-agnostic and instantly deployable across global locations.\n\nIntegration with Zero Trust frameworks\n\nModern Cloud Captive Portals should align seamlessly with Zero Trust security principles by implementing continuous verification and limited access protocols.\n\nThe integration enables:\n\nDevice Profiling & Authentication\n\nIntegrity\n\nAccess Control\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\nAutomation\n\nTraffic Monitoring & Compliance\n\nRequired security features to deploy a cloud captive portals solution\n\nModern captive portal solutions shall incorporate multiple layers of security protection. Innovative solutions now integrate with leading security solutions, enabling administrators to implement granular access controls and URL filtering.\n\nCloudi-Fi platform supports comprehensive compliance requirements through regional data center deployment, ensuring adherence to local privacy regulations. Automated encryption of personal data and transparent collection processes provide users and administrators complete control over information handling.\n\nAdvanced features include integration with cloud-based security platforms, enabling:\n\nCloud firewall implementation\n\nContent filtering capabilities\n\nBandwidth Control\n\nAutomated device onboarding\n\nThese capabilities offer a robust security framework that protects both the organization's network and user data while maintaining seamless access for authorized users.\n\nBenefits of a Zero Trust Captive Portal Solution\n\nThe implementation of Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift in securing guest Wi-Fi networks, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more comprehensive verification model. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations manage and secure guest network access.\n\nZero Trust Cloud Captive Portal solutions provide a scalable, centralized access control layer across multiple sites or large office campuses. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, they allow seamless deployment without needing extensive on-prem hardware, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and secure, device-specific access. The cloud-based platform dynamically scales to handle high volumes of traffic and multiple entry points, while continuously monitoring user behaviors. This architecture not only simplifies management but also enhances security, as threats are isolated, and access is tightly controlled based on identity, device, and risk assessment, all through a unified, cloud-driven approach.\n\nAdapting Zero Trust principles for guest access\n\nOrganizations must carefully adapt Zero Trust principles to maintain security while ensuring a seamless guest experience. The implementation requires a balanced approach that considers security requirements and user convenience. Key adaptation strategies include:\n\nRole-based permissions for the access control\n\nSponsoring, social login with MFA, mail address, \u2026 for user authentication\n\nSegmentation for network isolation\n\nTime-limited access tokens for session management\n\nBenefits of traditional security models\n\nZero Trust Architecture offers significant advantages compared to conventional security approaches. The model eliminates the inherent vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security by implementing continuous verification and granular access controls.\n\nThe transformation from traditional to zero-trust security brings multiple operational improvements:\n\nEnhanced Security Posture Elimination of lateral movement threats\n\nReal-time threat detection and response\n\nComprehensive audit trails Operational Efficiency Automated device onboarding\n\nCentralized policy management\n\nSimplified compliance reporting\n\nThe architecture's ability to maintain strict security controls while supporting dynamic access requirements makes it particularly effective for guest Wi-Fi environments. By implementing least-privilege access principles, organizations can ensure that guests receive only the necessary network resources while maintaining complete visibility and control over all network activities.\n\nIntegrating Zero Trust principles with cloud-based management platforms enables distributed organizations to effortlessly scale their guest Wi-Fi security efficiently. This combination offers network and security administrators powerful tools for monitoring network usage, enforcing security policies, and responding to potential threats in real time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transformation of guest Wi-Fi security through cloud-captive portals and Zero Trust Architecture marks a significant advancement in corporate network protection. Modern organizations require robust security solutions that extend beyond traditional perimeter defenses. The combination of continuous verification, granular access controls, and advanced monitoring capabilities creates a comprehensive security framework that addresses current and emerging threats while maintaining operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness leaders must recognize the critical role of secure guest Wi-Fi in maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data. Organizations ready to strengthen their network security should consider implementing a Zero Trust Captive Portal solution - Cloudi-Fi offers extensive resources and guidance for this essential security upgrade.

            "article_content": "Let\u2019s imagine a fictional company, Global Retail Corporation, a multinational retail chain struggling with its initial approach to AI integration. They built custom generative AI applications on their cloud provider using OpenAI\u2019s APIs for broader analysis, providing access to their LLMs (large language models) and ChatGPT to get more strategic and valuable answers to their business questions. The process was costly and complex, and it delivered suboptimal results. That all changed when they adopted federated learning.\n\nThe strategy of federation in AI deployments\n\nFederated learning is emerging as a game-changing approach for enterprises looking to leverage the power of LLMs while maintaining data privacy and security. Rather than moving sensitive data to LLM providers or building isolated small language models (SLMs), federated learning enables organizations to train LLMs using their private data where it resides. Everyone who worries about moving private enterprise data to a public space, such as uploading it to an LLM, can continue to have \u201cprivate data.\u201d Private data may exist on a public cloud provider or in your data center.\n\nThe real power of federation comes from the tight integration between private enterprise data and sophisticated LLM capabilities. This integration allows companies to leverage their proprietary information and broader knowledge in models like GPT-4 or Google Gemini without compromising security. More importantly, it means not having to deal with moving petabytes of data to a public cloud that\u2019s also hosting an LLM."

The Apollo moon landings were fake\n\nNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin assemble the American flag on the moon during their Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969. NASA astronauts on the International Space Station marked the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch with a video message on July 16. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nTwelve NASA astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, but in the decades since Apollo 11 astronauts first set foot on the moon, many theories have been put forward claiming that the whole Apollo program was staged. However, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has since released photos of the landing sites as they appear on the lunar surface many years later.\n\nSome of the questions moon landing deniers ask are \"Why are there no stars in the sky in the moonwalkers' photos? Why are the U.S. flags fluttering on the surface? Why do you see footprints in the pictures, but no marks from the lunar modules that landed there?\"\n\nIt turns out those questions are easy to answer than you may think.\n\nThere are no stars in the sky for the same reason you don't see stars during the day on Earth, according to NASA: The bright glow of daylight on the surface washes them out.\n\nU.S. flags planted into the lunar soil had metal rods sewn in them to appear as though they were moving, according to NASA. Without these wires, the flag would have hung straight down, making for a pretty lackluster photo prop.\n\nAnd the lunar modules, though heavier, didn't put prominent marks in the surface in some places because their mass was more evenly distributed than the astronauts' weight was in their boots.\n\n2. NASA is a lie\n\nNASA's Artemis 1 moon rocket arrives at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building on Sept. 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA's Kennedy Space Center)\n\nSome people actually believe NASA's whole function is not to explore space, but to generate space-related hoaxes. (The Apollo moon landing is a famous example that we'll explore in the next slide.) People who believe this conspiracy, sometimes flagged with the hashtag \"#NASAhoax\" on social media, will say that amazing space pictures of Mars, Pluto and even Earth are fake, computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nNASA was formed in 1958 \"to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes,\" according to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law shortly after the start of the space race against the Soviet Union.\n\nSince then, NASA has launched hundreds of satellites into orbit around Earth, the moon and several other worlds. In fact, NASA spacecraft have orbited, flown by or landed on every planet in the solar system. NASA also sends astronauts into orbit, where they conduct research at the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n\n\nIf you're not convinced, you are free to travel to Florida's Space Coast to watch a rocket launch for yourself. It's also quite easy to see the space station and other satellites with your own eyes with the help of a satellite tracker.\n\n3. The Earth is flat\n\nEarth as seen from space (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThis myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space \u2014 which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.\n\n\n\nOne way of demonstrating to yourself that the Earth is round is to consider how orbits of satellites work. Satellites constantly \"fall\" around the Earth as they are pulled around by our planet's gravity; they just need to be traveling fast enough at a high enough altitude to not slam into the atmosphere. Or, you can look at the amazing pictures taken by astronauts at the ISS.\n\n4. Planet Nine will kill us\n\nArtist's illustration of the hypothetical Planet Nine, which may lie undiscovered in the outer solar system. (Image credit: Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nIn April 2016, the New York Post tweeted, \"A newly discovered planet could destroy Earth as soon as this month.\" The newspaper was referring to Planet Nine, a theoretical planet at the edge of the solar system. An accompanying video also claimed that the new planet would be throwing all sorts of asteroids and comets at Earth, which would supposedly end up pummeling our planet.\n\n\n\nAlthough the existence of a ninth planet has not been confirmed, astronomers are actively looking for one to help explain motions of some objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects beyond Neptune. If the planet is actually found, the planet will pose no threat to us, according to the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown (who is one of the original backers of the Planet Nine theory).\n\n5. Alien research is happening at Area 51\n\nArea 51's restricted area covers over 90,000 acres (36,000 hectares) . (Image credit: Roger Holden via Getty Images)\n\nThe 1996 movie \"Independence Day\" is one of the main sources of the Area 51 hoax, which claims that aliens and their technology \u2014 recovered from crashed flying saucers \u2014 are being studied secretly at a classified military base about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. Some people in the area around the base claim that they have seen strange lights or objects flying in or out of this area.\n\n\n\nWhile the testing and development conducted at Area 51 is classified, the U.S. government has acknowledged its existence (although the CIA officially calls it \"Homey Airport\" or \"Groom Lake\").\n\nA part of Edwards Air Force Base, the area was a known location for high-technology airplane flights in the 1960s and 1970s. It first served as a proving ground for Lockheed U-2 and A-12 OXCART spy planes as early as 1955. UFO sightings reported in the area were indeed unidentified objects, but only because the planes were top-secret \u2014 not because they were flown by aliens.\n\n6. There is a killer planet known as \"Nibiru\"\n\nArtist's conception of the fictional rogue planet Nibiru, or Planet X. Nibiru does not exist, so don't be fooled. (Image credit: gilderm | sxc.hu)\n\nConspiracy theorists say another dangerous planet is Nibiru, which was first mentioned in the 1976 book \"The Twelfth Planet,\" by Zecharia Sitchin. In the book, Sitchin translated ancient Sumerian cuneiform and claimed that the text is proof of a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru that orbits the sun every 3,600 years.\n\n\n\nYears later, self-proclaimed psychic Nancy Lieder claimed to have communicated with extraterrestrials who said Nibiru would collide with Earth in 2003. When that didn't happen, the date was moved to 2012 (and linked, of course, with the 2012 doomsday predictions). Of course, the collision never occurred, the world didn't end in 2012 and no astronomer has ever found a planet on a collision course with Earth.\n\n7. There is a face on Mars\n\nThe original 'Face on Mars' image taken by NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, in grey scale, on July, 25 1976. Image shows a remnant massif located in the Cydonia region. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took a picture of what appeared to be a face on Mars. Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.\n\n\n\nNASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.\n\n8. The moon Iapetus is an alien Death Star\n\nSaturn's moon Iapetus. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIapetus is a moon of Saturn that looks somewhat like the infamous Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with a large crater that resembles the fictional weapon's superlaser focus lens. The Death Star is a planet-killing machine that destroys entire worlds with its outrageously powerful laser. It was prominently featured in the 2016 movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" as well as in 1977's \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\"\n\n\n\nA Daily Mail article published in May 2016 claimed Iapetus is an artificial object crafted by aliens. As \"evidence,\" the article cited a photo taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. In the photo, there's a line around the moon's equator that resembles the equatorial trench around the Death Star.\n\nBut this line isn't nearly as interesting as the Death Star's trench, which houses the battle station's engines, thrusters and docking bays. That line is nothing more than a mountain ridge, and Iapetus is actually just made up of boring old rock and ice. Cassini has flown by the moon to take pictures several times without being blasted by deadly alien lasers.\n\nSaturn's moon Mimas, with it's giant crater Herschel, also looks surprisingly like the Death Star.\n\n9. Saturn's hexagon is alien technology\n\nThis movie, made from images obtained by Cassini's imaging cameras, is the first to show Saturn's hexagon in color filters and the first movie to show a complete view from the north pole down to about 70 degrees north latitude. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/Hampton University)\n\nSaturn's hexagon was first spotted when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by the giant, ringed planet in 1980. The bizarre, six-sided structure on the round planet's north pole caused quite the stir, because straight lines and polygons are not so common in nature.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the Voyager returned its first images of Saturn's strange feature, even stranger theories arose to explain it, including that it was somehow related to alien technology, or perhaps even was a gateway to hell. The hexagon is not artificial, but rather a weird-looking hurricane at Saturn's pole.\n\nNASA has done several flybys of this region with the Cassini spacecraft, studying the haze particles and other features of the storm, to try to learn more about its unusual properties.\n\n10. Mars is as big as the moon\n\nThe solar system to scale. The diameter of Jupiter (middle, with red spot) is about 11 times that of Earth (third planet from the left). Mars is the second-smallest planet in the solar system (fourth planet from left). (Image credit: Lunar and Planetary Institute)\n\nOriginating in 2003, the infamous Mars hoax asserts that Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in the 60,000 years prior, and that the planet will appear as large as the full moon. What started out as a misconstrued email turned into a recurring rumor that gets reshared every August and, naturally, has spread to social media as it became more popular.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mars is indeed relatively close to Earth in a cosmic sense, it will never be as large as the full moon. It will appear as a red dot in the sky, just as the ancient astronomers saw it. If you'd like to see Mars magnified, take out a telescope or look at one of NASA's spectacular Mars pictures."

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.
