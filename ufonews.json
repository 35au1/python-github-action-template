            "article_content": "A US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed his own late night encounter with a UFO, that lit up his campsite and 'made absolutely no noise.'\n\nThe event came less than a month before a more senior ex-Pentagon counter-intel official, Luis Elizondo, testified before Congress accusing government actors of secretly working to 'hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.'\n\nThe October 21, 2024 campsite UFO, according to the military witness who requested anonymity, hovered as close as 100 yards above him along the treeline: 'The entire area lit up brighter than the brightest full moon I\u2019ve ever seen,' he reported.\n\n'I knew it wasn\u2019t the moon because I had already located the moon prior,' the trained observer noted of this 20\u201330 foot UFO. '[The moon] was a dimly lit waning gibbous.'\n\nThe career military man, who reported this episode to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), added: 'I observed it for at least a minute before fear took over and I sank back down into the bed of my truck and into my sleeping bag.'\n\nThe oval-shaped 'stationary, bright white light' resembles one newly public case reported this November by Connecticut policeman Robert Klein, who professed that an orb UFO, the size of a Mini Cooper, 'lit up the entire cab' of his patrol car in 2022.\n\nFear over roughly car-sized 'unidentified aerial phenomena' (UAP), often described as 'mystery drones,' has swept the nation since November as sightings across New Jersey and surrounding states have eerily matched cases over US military bases.\n\nLocal leaders in the Garden State are 'livid,' according to journalist and author Michael Shellenberger, who obtained audio from a video briefing delivered to more than 500 New Jersey mayors by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nA US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed a late night encounter with a UFO that lit up his campsite. Above, Nest camera footage from a July 24, 2019 UFO case in Leominster, MA, in which a similar brightly lit object (a possible meteor) zoomed across the sky\n\nThe US military witness saw their 30-40 foot long, oval shaped UFO while camping at the the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California. Above: the Milky Way galaxy seen over a Joshua Tree in the park on May 12, 2024\n\n'One of them [i.e. a mayor] got up there,' Shellenberger told Fox News, 'and said, \"I had two automobile-sized drones hovering over my house.\"'\n\nThe newly public military witness's case, as he told NUFORC was itself roughly 8\u201310 feet tall, making this bright oval UFO about the size of a school bus.\n\nThe sighting, which the military man said lasted for over a full minute, occurred at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites, just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California where he was 'the only camper/hunter in the area that night.'\n\n'I was laying in the tarped bed of my truck,' he told NURFOC, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that has coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on UFOs for decades.\n\n'It was pitch black out,' he said, as the waning gibbous moon was shining weakly \u2014 when 'instantly' the ordinary noises of the insects and animals in the wild 'went completely silent' as the UFO appeared.\n\n'It made absolutely no noise, didn\u2019t pulsate or move, and did not radiate any sort of heat,' he said, adding the temperature was 'about 40 degrees Fahrenheit' that night.\n\nBy his estimation, this 'stationary, bright white light' was 'about the size of a medium sized helicopter but with the light encompassing the entire object' as it hovered at 'tree top level, behind an about 30-40 foot tall pine tree, only about 100 yards away.'\n\nThe encounter, which ended as abruptly as it began, differed from Officer Klein's encounter with a car-sized glowing orb UFO in that the Connecticut policeman's sighting pulsated its light from white to red to green to orange.\n\nThe veteran cop took pains to emphasize to NewsNation that, in the early moments of his encounter, he was able to get 'a very close-up view of it' from 30 feet below the hovering, orb-like object: 'It wasn't a drone \u2014 I can guarantee you that.'\n\nSwarms of drones have been spotted in the skies of New Jersey for weeks, sparking officials to call for a 'limited state of emergency' - with drone bans taking effect in some areas\n\nMayor Mike Ghassali of Montvale, New Jersey took to Facebook to reveal what happened to a resident's quadcopter drone when they had a run-in with a mysterious drone UFO hovering in the air nearby - noting there was 'sophisticated' technology at play in this December 15 event\n\nThe military witness delivered the coordinates of his October 2024 UFO sighting as 33 degrees 32' 12.8\" North and 116 degrees 27' 38.7\" West (red pin, above) - placing him at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsite east of Los Angeles at the time of his\n\n'I froze,' Klein said, recalling that moment looking up at the object. 'I wasn't in fear. I just was really trying to understand what exactly I was looking at.'\n\n'I was trying to just process what I was looking at,' he said. 'Still to this day, I'm perplexed.'\n\nSpeaking before Congress this past November, Luis Elizondo, the former head of the Defense Department's UFO-hunting Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), criticized federal officials for 'excessive secrecy' on the UFO issue.\n\n'I believe that we as Americans can handle the truth. And I also believe the world deserves the truth,' Elizondo said.\n\nThe former intelligence officer also urged Congress to pass legislation that would protect government whistleblowers afraid to reveal what they know about UFOs, a common refrain among those testifying at the November 13, 2024 open hearing.\n\nThe hearing, held by the House Oversight committee, was part of a larger investigation into UFOs to determine whether any government officials have been withholding evidence from Congress.\n\n'Advanced technologies not made by our government, or any other government, are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,' Elizondo insisted, raising unsettling implications for the rash of 'mystery drone' sightings at US bases.\n\nIn recent months, the Garden State has been ravaged by thousands of unexplained drone sightings, as over 5,000 reports of odd drones have been filed with federal law enforcement\n\nAlthough misidentifications of conventional planes have been rife amid the growing public panic, reports by from US military officials across America and Europe, alongside local police, have told matching accounts of these car-sized drones.\n\nThe drone swarm's lighting colors, as well as its behavior, match those that also made repeated brazen incursions over the restricted airspace above Air Force joint-base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, then home to America's stealth F-22 fighter fleet.\n\nFor at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of these noisy, small UFOs were also seen at dusk 'moving at rapid speeds' and 'flashing red, green, and white lights.'\n\nAnd these cases are almost identical to what has been reported above sensitive sites in New Jersey, like the US Army's Picatinny Arsenal, since mid-November 2024.\n\nBase police have reported 11 confirmed and unauthorized drone sightings over the arsenal since November 13, meaning security officers 'visibly witnessed a drone.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last October that the unexplained incursions over Langley-Eustis were 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' as Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

            "article_content": "Copilot+ PCs are the first PCs to run Small Language Models (SLM) on-device. It means these AI models are powered by local processing capabilities rather than relying on cloud, which is typically done by AIs like ChatGPT. This approach can result in faster responses as compared to the cloud-based Copilot or ChatGPT.\n\nNow, Microsoft has introduced AI Dev Gallery, which makes it easy to add on-device AI features to any app.\n\nThe AI Dev Gallery app is for developers who want to try multiple models to integrate an AI feature into their app. AI Dev Gallery has over 25 samples to download and run on Windows 10. Moreover, you can export the project or source code directly into your app and get it working instantly.\n\nIt works with Windows 10 and 11 and supports x64 and ARM64 architectures.\n\nOut of curiosity, Windows Latest cloned the AI Dev Gallery from its GitHub repository and compiled our own version of AI Dev Gallery.\n\nCurrently, the only way to access it is by building the project in Visual Studio and then running it. In addition, you\u2019ll need at least 20GB of space and a multi-core CPU. It also suggests a GPU with 8GB VRAM, but those are for heavy models only.\n\nWe started with a 4-core CPU, 4GB RAM, or a Windows 11 PC. The app has two modes: Sample and models. We used the sample view to check out all the available models.\n\nThe app categorizes them into Text, Image, Code, Audio and video, and Smart Controls.\n\nTesting the models\n\nModels for image generation and video generation need about 5GB of bandwidth to download and save it to your PC. To better understand how things work, we started with a small one related to image upscaling, which was under 100 MB.\n\nWe took a screenshot of the screen and tried to upscale it using the CPU. Note that you can switch between CPU and GPU for processing the request.\n\nThe upscaling happened in under 30 seconds in this inferior virtual machine, where the RAM usage increased to 1GB. As you can see in the screenshots below, App Gallery produced an upscaled version of the image with a 9272*4900 resolution.\n\nHowever, the 100MB upscale model has its own issues. While it used our local resources to upscale images, elements, especially text, were ruined. You can barely read the texts.\n\nThere\u2019s no option to preview this generated image in a bigger window or full-screen. Even the download option isn\u2019t there to save it to disk.\n\nWe tried another model called Detect Human Pose. It identifies someone\u2019s position in an image. While it accurately identified a basic walking person, it even started showing position marks for screenshots of our desktop with a few apps open.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how these models can be integrated into the app, but some of these features can be run locally. Of course, PCs will need bigger storage for these models and powerful CPUs with 16GB or more RAM.\n\nWhat do you think? It is worth downloading a 5GB model to convert a text prompt into an image or wait for 30 seconds to do that on a web app. Clearly, most of these features have very niche use cases and implementation environments rather than appealing to the whole Windows 11 user base."

The Queen Mary, California, USA\n\nComing in ninth place as one of the world's most haunted hotspots is the Queen Mary, a British ocean liner permanently docked since 1967 on Long Beach in California, USA.\n\nAt least 49 deaths are said to have taken place on the Queen Mary since its maiden voyage in 1936 - accordingly, ghoulish sightings have been reported in several areas on board.\n\nHatch door 13, also known as Shaft Alley on the vessel, is the site of a gruesome accident that saw a crewman crushed to death in 1966.\n\nHis ghost is now regularly seen around the area, with visitors reporting the sound of someone running behind them and whistling.\n\nThese days, the hotel offers ghost tours by day and night to take full advantage of the spooky stories.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, where reviews have amassed a staggering 324 mentions of the word 'haunted,' one spooked visitor wrote: 'I went into this tour half-way as a sceptic but definitely left this place a full on believer.\n\n'When we went into the room under the front deck of the ship we heard screaming and banging on the pipes coming from under us.'\n\nComing in ninth place as one of the world's most haunted hotspots is the Queen Mary, a British ocean liner permanently docked since 1967 on Long Beach in California, USA\n\nAt least 49 deaths are said to have taken place on the Queen Mary since its maiden voyage in 1936 - accordingly, ghoulish sightings have been reported in several areas on board\n\nOn TripAdvisor, where reviews have amassed a staggering 324 mentions of the word 'haunted,' one spooked visitor wrote: 'I went into this tour half-way as a sceptic but definitely left this place a full on believer.'\n\n8. Bonaventure Cemetery Savannah, Georgia, USA\n\nIn eighth place is Bonaventure Cemetery Savannah, built on the historic Bonaventure Plantation in Georgia, with 67 mentions of 'haunted' and 156 mentions of 'spooky' on TripAdvisor.\n\nStatues once stationed in the cemetery, such as Little Wendy, are central to local legends - including claims of ghostly sightings of Lorraine Greenman, the eight-year-old girl who posed for the artist behind the sculpture in the 1930s.\n\nAnother famous sculpture in the cemetery that has elicited fantastical stories is that of Gracie Watson, also known as Little Gracie.\n\nThe six-year-old girl died of pneumonia in 1889, and was memorialised in marble by artist John Walz from nothing but a photograph.\n\nVisitors and locals leave toys for her to play with, especially around Christmas time, who claim she cries tears of blood if her toys are removed.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one visitor wrote: 'This is one of the coolest/spookiest cemeteries I've ever visited... It gives you this feeling that you are in the beginning of a scary movie.'\n\nIn eighth place is Bonaventure Cemetery Savannah, built on the historic Bonaventure Plantation in Georgia, with 67 mentions of 'haunted' and 156 mentions of 'spooky' on TripAdvisor\n\nOne famous sculpture in the cemetery that has elicited fantastical stories is that of Gracie Watson, also known as Little Gracie (pictured) - which is claimed to cry tears of blood\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one visitor wrote: 'This is one of the coolest/spookiest cemeteries I've ever visited...'\n\n7. The Stanley Hotel, Estes Park Colorado, USA\n\nThe Stanley Hotel in Colorado has the second highest amount of 'haunted' mentions at 443, but is let down by the lowest TripAdvisor rating overall at 3.5.\n\nFamous as the inspiration for Stephen King's The Shining, The Stanley Hotel is widely considered to be one of the most haunted destinations in the United States.\n\nVisitors report hearing children's footsteps and laughter on the fourth floor, while the hotel's staircase - also known as 'The Vortex' - is suggested to serve as a paranormal portal that connects the lobby to the second floor, according to Ghost City Tours.\n\nRoom 428 on the fourth floor of the hotel is reported to be the 'most active' with ghost sightings, with former guests claiming they could hear heavy footsteps moving across the room and furniture being rearranged as they slept.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one brave visitor wrote: 'We experienced a lot of static energy on the 4th floor, but nothing too paranormal.\n\n'However, when we were leaving in the morning we walked out with our bags, said goodbye to the ghosts and 2 empty beverage cans flew off the desk. Worth the price for us.'\n\nFamous as the inspiration for Stephen King's The Shining, The Stanley Hotel is widely considered to be one of the most haunted destinations in the United States\n\nVisitors report hearing children's footsteps and laughter on the fourth floor of the hotel\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one brave visitor wrote: 'We experienced a lot of static energy on the 4th floor, but nothing too paranormal.'\n\n6. Myrtles Plantation Louisiana, USA\n\nMyrtles Plantation in Louisiana takes sixth place with 47 mentions of 'spooky' and 73 mentions of 'scary.'\n\nLocated in the deep American south, Myrtles Plantation has long been reputed as one of America's most haunted homes due to its history of overworked slaves and brutal masters.\n\nSpooky experiences reported by former visitors include ghostly apparitions, particularly of a former enslaved woman named Chloe, and unexplained footsteps.\n\nFor many years, Chloe fell victim to her master, Mr. Woodruff's, cruelty.\n\nThe prestigious Judge ordered Chloe to have her ears removed after she was caught eavesdropping, and she was later hung before being dropped into the Mississippi River after she poisoned Mr. Woodruff's children.\n\nThe plantation was the sight of other gruesome activity after Chloe\u2019s death, with visitors reporting seeing Woodruff's children - as well as their handprints - appear in the mirror near the room where they were poisoned.\n\nToday, this residence is known as the Myrtles Plantation Bed and Breakfast, where visitors are offered historical tours through the day and into the dark of night.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one guest wrote: 'The spirits did not disappoint the night of my birthday. The pillows had moved on the bed upon our return from dinner and the dresser in our room \u201crocked\u201d several times on the floor making a horrendous noise.'\n\nLocated in the deep American south, Myrtles Plantation has long been reputed as one of America's most haunted homes due to its history of overworked slaves and brutal masters\n\nA husband and wife enjoying a weekend away in 'one of America's most haunted houses' got more than they bargained for when the filmed a TRIO of 'ghosts' feet' walking past them\n\nToday, this residence is known as the Myrtles Plantation Bed and Breakfast, where visitors are offered historical tours through the day and into the dark of night\n\n5. St. Augustine Lighthouse Florida, USA\n\nSt Augustine Lighthouse in Florida takes fifth place, with a total of 166 mentions of 'haunted' on TripAdvisor.\n\nTales of ghostly lighthouse keepers and tragic accidents make this a popular spot for paranormal seekers.\n\nMany visitors have reported hearing children's voices and seeing unexplained shadows while exploring the lighthouse, where visitors climb 219 to reach the top of the structure, which began guiding ships at sea into shore in 1874\n\nWorkers say that they lock the door at the top of the tower each night before leaving - yet the door is often open in the morning when they arrive for work.\n\nMeanwhile, visitors regularly claim to spot the spirit of former keeper, Joseph Andreu, at the top of the tower. His presence at the lighthouse could be explained by the fact that he fell to his death while painting the outside of the tower.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one visitor wrote: 'Very spooky, lots of goose bumps. We rented an EMF meter for $5 and saw a few good spikes throughout the tour.'\n\nSt Augustine Lighthouse in Florida takes fifth place, with a total of 166 mentions of 'haunted' on TripAdvisor\n\nTales of ghostly lighthouse keepers and tragic accidents make this a popular spot for paranormal seekers\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one visitor wrote: 'Very spooky, lots of goose bumps.

Bhangarh Fort India\n\nIn fourth place is Bhangarh Fort in India, with 322 mentions of 'haunted' and 64 mentions of 'spooky' on TripAdvisor.\n\nThe fort, located in the Alwar district of Rajasthan, near the Sariska Tiger Reserve, is considered haunted by some due to a number of legends and superstitions - and is considered so spooky that entry is prohibited between sunset and sunrise.\n\nThe fort was built in the 16th century and quickly abandoned, with local legend saying this was due to a tantric cursing the fort and its inhabitants.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one brazen visitor wrote: 'After reading multiple reviews of this place, I couldn't resist myself from visiting it \"AT NIGHT.\"\n\n'Indeed it feels spooky cos there isn't any civilization around 3 kms of the fort. Even with the sound of your own footsteps on those parched leaves & the fear of someone following you runs down your spine...'\n\nIn fourth place is Bhangarh Fort in India, with 322 mentions of 'haunted' and 64 mentions of 'spooky' on TripAdvisor\n\nAccording to The Hindu , the fort was built in the 16th century and quickly abandoned, with many believing this was due to a local tantric cursing the fort and its inhabitants\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one brazen visitor wrote: 'After reading multiple reviews of this place, I couldn't resist myself from visiting it \"AT NIGHT.\"'\n\n3. Crumlin Road Gaol Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK\n\nIn third place is the historical site Crumlin Road Gaol in Belfast, with a total of 53 mentions of 'haunted,' 155 mentions of 'spooky' and 139 mentions of 'scary.'\n\nCrumlin Road Gaol is a jail that closed in 1996 - and has since been plagued with paranormal sightings and associated with tales of sadness, tragedy and grief.\n\nAccording the the Gaol's official website, seventeen executions of male prisoners took place between 1854 and 1961.\n\nOn June 21, 1854, soldier Robert Henry O'Neill was the first prisoner to be executed. His body and 14 others are still interred in unmarked graves within the grounds of the Gaol.\n\nThe Gaol had a stone execution chamber, used for the first time in C Wing in 1901, and a Padded Cell in B Wing.\n\nThe disused jail now hosts public tours, live music and paranormal investigation events.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one visitor wrote: 'Apparently there has been paranormal activity in the gaol... We had a spooky experience in the Tunnel... a man shouting and banging going on.'\n\nCrumlin Road Gaol is a jail that closed in 1996 - and has since been plagued with paranormal sightings and associated with tales of sadness, tragedy and grief (stock image)\n\nAccording the the Gaol's official website, seventeen executions of male prisoners took place between 1854 and 1961\n\nThe disused jail now hosts public tours, live music and paranormal investigation events\n\n2. Eastern State Penitentiary Philadelphia, USA\n\nEastern State Penitentiary located in Philadelphia, has the greatest number of 'haunted' mentions on reviews on TripAdvisor, at a huge 534, as well as 236 'spooky' and 340 'scary' mentions.\n\nBuilt in 1829 and famous for introducing solitary confinement, Eastern State Penitentiary is believed to be haunted by former inmates.\n\nAccording to the Eastern State Penitentiary official website, its vaulted, sky-lit cells held nearly 85,000 people over its long history, including bank robber \"Slick Willie\" Sutton and \"Scarface\" Al Capone.\n\nVisitors recount chilling sounds, whispers, and shadowy figures moving through its decaying halls while exploring the decaying castle.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one spooked visitor wrote: 'This place is positively dripping with bad energy and restless spirits.\n\n'Even during a daytime tour you can feel the oppressive feelings of those who have suffered in the past and their resentment towards those who invade their space.'\n\nBuilt in 1829 and famous for introducing solitary confinement, Eastern State Penitentiary is believed to be haunted by former inmates\n\nVisitors recount chilling sounds, whispers, and shadowy figures moving through its decaying halls while exploring the ravaged building\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one spooked visitor wrote: 'This place is positively dripping with bad energy and restless spirits.'\n\n1. Mary King's Close, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nLying deep beneath the streets of Edinburgh's Old Town is Mary King's Close - which has been crowned the world's most haunted tourist hotspot.\n\nThe dark maze of underground closes received the most 'scary' and 'spooky' mentions (604 and 534 respectively) on TripAdvisor - as well as a rating of 4.5.\n\nUnder the Royal Mile, Mary King's Close is a place where people lived, worked and died between the 1600 to 1800s.\n\nDuring their miserable lives, poorer residents living on the bottom floors and the wealthy living on the top floors.\n\nAs legend has it, the tourist hotspot is haunted by plague victims from the 1600s.\n\nVisitors have reported hearing ghostly sounds, skin-prickling sensations - and even glimpses of the ghostly little girl Annie, whose tormented spirit roams the closes looking for her lost doll.\n\nTo help put her soul at rest, visitors who flock there leave dolls and gifts in the corner of a room where the ghostly girl was reportedly seen.\n\nOn TripAdvisor, one visitor wrote: 'We had our photo taken at the end with a very strange and unexplained addition in the developed picture!\n\n'We showed the staff and they said they had never seen anything like that on a person before, the circle to us looked like an orb - not surprisingly as the place is very haunted!'\n\nMary King's Close in Edinburgh, Scotland, takes the top spot for the spookiest destination location in the world\n\nThis eerie site is said to be haunted by plague victims from the 1600s"

            "article_content": "or every pop culture phenomenon like The X-Files, True Blood, or Game of Thrones, there are dozens of other TV series that elicit the same reaction in viewers: How the heck did this get made? Just because Baywatch has an audience, does that mean fans will watch a supernatural version called Baywatch Nights? Did Friends fans still act friendly to Joey \u2014 a spin-off about one character from the ensemble sitcom? The answer to both questions is a resounding \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe following underwhelming TV shows all aired and disappeared without much fanfare from U.S. audiences. When they pop up on streaming services, will you roll the dice?\n\nCop Rock (1990)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox Television.\n\nA lot of people, including yours truly, have a knee-jerk aversion to musicals. That didn\u2019t deter the makers of Cop Rock from blending a dramatic police procedural and musical numbers.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShockingly, it turns out that although Americans love police procedurals, they don\u2019t tune in when detectives bust out in song-and-dance numbers in the middle of solving crimes. When TV Guide Magazine ranked the \u201cWorst TV Shows Ever\u201d in 2002, Cop Rock made the top 10. In this case, justice was served.\n\nJoey (2004-2006)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Television.\n\nFriends barely ended its long run before the spin-off sitcom Joey, starring Matt LeBlanc returning as Joey Tribbiani, premiered the same year on NBC.\n\nThe reason why Friends worked is the chemistry between the cast. On Joey, the lead character seems more like a loser instead of a charming moron without his castmates to bounce lines off. Friends fans wanted to see Joey with his old friends, not these unfamiliar new ones.\n\nAs a result, NBC unfriended Joey and canceled the struggling sitcom after two seasons. Although 18.1 million curious Friends fans tuned in for the pilot, ratings plummeted to a low of 4.1 million in season two. You can understand why NBC would try a Friends spin-off, but Joey needed more engaging friends to surround the lead character.\n\nSaved by the Bell: The New Class (1993-2000)\n\nImage Credit: NBC Studios.\n\nSaved by the Bell: The New Class somehow ran for seven seasons while the original Saved by the Bell only had four. Two characters, Principal Mr. Belding (Dennis Haskins) and Screech (Dustin Diamond), returned for The New Class.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original Saved by the Bell didn\u2019t reinvent television but still had some unintentionally hilarious moments that later went viral, like when Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkley) took too many caffeine pills to help her get accepted to Stanford.\n\nThe New Class, despite a seven-season run, didn\u2019t have the campy charm of the original show or its cast. Even though it aired longer, The New Class flunked with audiences and critics, mostly due to frequent cast changes that prevented viewers from getting to know the new characters.\n\nSupertrain (1979)\n\nImage Credit: NBC Productions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pricy failure Supertrain \u2014 essentially The Love Boat on a train track \u2014 lost steam after only nine episodes. The show follows the lives of passengers and crew on board a high-speed, nuclear-powered U.S. train tricked out with a swimming pool, retail stores, a gym, and even a medical center and nightclub.\n\nSupertrain is notorious as the most expensive U.S. TV series at the time. When the producers saw trouble ahead and tried to retool the sci-fi drama as more of a sitcom, public interest had already left the station. If the premise of Supertrain still sounds intriguing to you, however, check out the riveting TV series Snowpiercer instead, which just ended its four-season run.\n\nMy Mother the Car (1965-1966)\n\nImage Credit: United Artists Television.\n\nThe premise of My Mother the Car is out there: a man\u2019s deceased mother is reincarnated as a 1928 porter touring car and she communicates with her son via the car\u2019s radio.\n\nWith fantasy series such as Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie connecting with audiences in the swinging \u201960s, it\u2019s almost understandable why some TV producer green-lit a story about a car that comes to life. How about not as someone\u2019s dead mom, though?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy Mother the Car came in second only to The Jerry Springer Show on TV Guide\u2018s 2002 list of the 50 worst TV shows.\n\nBaywatch Nights (1995-1997)\n\nImage Credit: The Baywatch Company.\n\nIn the Baywatch spin-off Baywatch Nights, Sgt. Garner Ellerbee (Gregory Alan Williams) and Mitch Buchannon (David Hasselhoff) team up to form a detective agency with an office located above a bustling nightclub.\n\nFor season one, Baywatch Nights tried a mystery-drama approach. With ratings in decline, the producers switched it up in season two by introducing sci-fi and paranormal themes into the storylines \u00e0 la The X-Files. The syndicated Baywatch Nights then said \u201cgoodnight\u201d after 2 seasons and 44 episodes.\n\nThe viewers were, and still are, out there for The X-Files, but not so much for Baywatch Nights. Instead of trying to replicate the success of the very different pop culture phenom starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, the makers of Baywatch Nights should have first asked themselves what it was about Baywatch that made it such a success. Hint: it had nothing to do with ghosts or sea monsters.\n\nMrs. Brown\u2019s Boys (2011)\n\nImage Credit: BBC Studios Comedy Productions.\n\nThe BBC sitcom Mrs. Brown\u2019s Boys takes place in Ireland and became popular in the U.K. and Australia. Brendan O\u2019Carroll performs in drag to play family matriarch Agnes Brown.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSometimes British humor gets lost in translation on this side of the pond, especially when the intended laughs involve male actors dressing up in old-lady drag. Mrs. Brown\u2019s Boys also breaks the fourth wall regularly by directly addressing the audience, which makes the antics even sillier.\n\nMrs. Brown\u2019s Boys continued with various one-off specials and even a fourth season that premiered in 2023. The loosey-goosey production never caught on in America, which prefers the drag performers on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race to O\u2019Carroll\u2019s crass sassy senior.\n\nThe Secret Life of the American Teenager (2008-2013)\n\nImage Credit: Brendavision!.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nShailene Woodley stars as a 15-year-old girl who gets knocked up and must go to high school with the baby\u2019s father on The Secret Life of the American Teenager. The show ran for five seasons on ABC Family between 2008 and 2013.\n\nA show with this kind of time-sensitive premise doesn\u2019t work for more than four years because once the baby\u2019s parents graduate high school, they no longer have to interact daily. Although the first few seasons of The Secret Life of the American Teenager did surprisingly well with its target demo of young females even though critics trashed it, the appeal was not sustainable. Ratings dropped each season and, like the word \u201cfetch\u201d in Mean Girls, the producers came to realize that The Secret Life of the American High School Graduate was never going to happen.\n\nMelody Rules (1994-1995)\n\nImage Credit: Ross Jennings Productions.\n\nMelody Rules is an American-style New Zealand sitcom about an even-tempered travel agent named Melody Robbins (Belinda Todd) who struggles to handle her siblings while their mother is off on an archaeological dig. The show ran for two seasons and is considered one of the worst sitcoms in history.\n\nBefore Melody Rules, Todd was best known as the cohost of the late-night news program Nightline, not for her comedic chops. This plus the fact that the network TV3 paid an American writer to school the Melody Rules writers in the way of American sitcoms made the show awkwardly unfunny to audiences in both countries. The addition of an American-style sitcom laugh track didn\u2019t help.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAn excellent example of a New Zealand comedy series that accurately reflects the country\u2019s quirky sense of humor is Wellington Paranormal, which generates genuine laughs and has no need for a laugh track.\n\nWhat/If (2019)\n\nImage Credit: Netflix.\n\nThe miniseries What/If starring Jane Levy and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger explores the ripple effects of what happens when otherwise acceptable members of society make poor moral choices. Although intended as a recurring series with each season featuring a different cast \u00e0 la The White Lotus, Netflix never ordered a second helping after 2019\u2019s season one.\n\nCritics may have praised Zellweger for sinking her teeth into the role of a campy cougar seductress, but the overall consensus of What/If was \u201cmediocre.\u201d\n\nSunset Beach (1997-1999)\n\nImage Credit: NBC Studios.\n\nThe daytime soap opera Sunset Beach about the romantic lives of an Orange County beach community tried to capitalize on the public\u2019s appetite for SoCal-based soaps such as Melrose Place. Although Sunset Beach lasted for 3 seasons and 755 episodes, it never achieved the ratings numbers of its daytime contemporaries such as Days of Our Lives and The Young and the Restless.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter NBC canceled Sunset Beach in 1999, U.K. college students unexpectedly embraced the soap as a Channel 5 favorite. Much like the Melrose Place soirees of the 1990s in America \u2014 a few of which I hosted \u2014 some universities in the U.K. had Sunset Beach parties at which guests dressed up as their favorite characters.\n\nHull High (1990)\n\nImage Credit: Touchstone Television.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRemember reading about the musical police procedural Cop Rock a little earlier? That musical misfire debuted one month after Hull High, a musical teen comedy set at the racially diverse Cordell Hull High School.\n\nAlthough audiences later embraced Glee and High School Musical as well as tolerated the musical episodes of Riverdale, Hull High hit a sour note with audiences from the first day of school. NBC canceled the low-rated series after only six episodes, leaving three unaired. Somehow Glee sidestepped Hull High\u2018s mistakes and made teen musicals great again.\n\nHello, Larry (1979-1980)\n\nImage Credit: T.A.T. Communications Company.\n\nThe sitcom Hello, Larry stars McLean Stevenson as Larry Alder, a divorced radio talk show host who moves to Portland, Oregon with his two teen daughters. The series ran for 2 seasons for a total of 38 lackluster episodes.\n\nHello, Larry had several crossover episodes with Diff\u2019rent Strokes, a popular sitcom of the era. Despite airing back-to-back with Diff\u2019rent Strokes, audiences didn\u2019t stick around to say hello to Hello, Larry. In 2002, TV Guide ranked Hello, Larry number 12 on its list of the \u201c50 Worst Shows of All Time.\u201d The name Hello, Larry even became shorthand for things that have failed.\n\nGoodnight Sweetheart (1993-2016)\n\nImage Credit: Alomo Productions.\n\nGoodnight Sweetheart is just your average British time-travel comedy \u2014 with an emphasis on the word \u201caverage\u201d \u2014 about a man who leads a double life with families in 1940s London and 1990s London after discovering a time portal.\n\nThe series ran for six seasons between 1993 and 1999, returning with a one-off special in 2016. Although British audiences embraced the silly series and talk about a musical remake continues to this day, Goodnight Sweetheart is another one of those uniquely British series that American audiences just do not get no matter what time period it is set in.\n\nL.A\u2019s Finest (2019-2020)\n\nImage Credit: Sony Pictures Television.\n\nThe short-lived Spectrum action-crime drama L.A.\u2019s Finest is a spin-off of the Bad Boys movie franchise in which Gabrielle Union plays Detective Lieutenant Sydney \u201cSyd\u201d Burnett. Jessica Alba plays Detective Nancy McKenna, Syd\u2019s new partner as well as secretly a former criminal. Shh!\n\nCritics pointed out the series\u2019 \u201coutdated sensibilities\u201d when it aired during the 2020 social justice protests. Suddenly, police procedurals came under scrutiny for their depiction of violence, which resulted in the cancellation of long-running shows such as Cops and Live PD. L.A.\u2019s Finest got caught up in the abrupt culture shift, and Spectrum canceled it after two seasons."

Credit: Schmidt Ocean Institute / YouTube\n\nAn age of discovery is upon us.\n\nEarth is an ocean planet, with over 70 percent of its surface covered in seas. With deep-sea robots, scientists regularly reveal new insights into the most mysterious realms of these expansive waters. Many alien ecosystems dwell in previously unknown canyons or cling to submerged mountains.\n\nIn 2024, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, an ocean exploration group that uses a robot capable of probing depths down to 14,760 feet (4,500 meters), embarked on a 55-day expedition that exemplifies the wild sightings found at these depths. Their remotely operated vehicle (ROV), SuBastian, spotted a colossal meeting or migration of crabs, a shimmering, psychedelic marine worm, life flourishing around deep methane seeps, and possibly 60 new species.\n\n\"Every time we put the ROV down with its 4K cameras onboard, we see some amazing biodiversity,\" Jyotika Virmani, an oceanographer and executive director of the Schmidt Ocean Institute, told Mashable.\n\n\"It was just one thing after another,\" she added.\n\nThe view below shows the impressive, uncountable amassing of crabs during Schmidt's recent Chile Margin expedition. \"Yesterday, we came across a crazy conflagration of crabs 400 meters down. Migration route? Mating season?\" Jeffrey Marlow, a biologist from Boston University and chief scientist of the trip, posted online.\n\nSubmersibles crewed by biologists can certainly perform unique science, but ROVs have exploration benefits. Unlike people, they don't need oxygen, and can stay down for a long time. \"We can operate it for two days if we need to,\" Virmani said. It's relatively easy to try out new technologies aboard these robots, and the ROV can also collect and bring samples back to the surface.\n\nBelow, you'll find the otherworldly scenes captured by the Schmidt Ocean Institute and other deep sea explorers in 2024.\n\nFootage of extremely ancient deep sea creatures\n\nA deep sea mission, undertaken by the Ocean Exploration Trust aboard their 223-foot vessel (E/V) Nautilus, spotted four nautilus individuals. Creatures similar to these modern-day nautiloids \u2014 swimming mollusks residing in large shells \u2014 have been on Earth for some 500 million years, evolving much earlier than the dinosaurs.\n\nBut the creatures aren't easy to find. The Ocean Trust explorers have endeavored into the deep sea for 15 years and taken over 1,000 dives with their remotely operated vehicle. But these are the first nautiloids they've spotted.\n\n\"It's finally happened,\" a member of the exploration team said at the beginning of the footage, shown in the video below. The nautiloids were swimming in a south Pacific Ocean channel off Palau.\n\nSquid with a huge brood of eggs\n\nDuring their 55-day voyage through the Chile Margin, the Schmidt Ocean Institute serendipitously spotted a mother black-eyed squid clutching a large brood of eggs. Gonatus squids can brood up to 3,000 eggs at a time.\n\n\"It's not often you get to see that,\" Virmani said.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

OceanX often explores the deep ocean, but this scene is from shallower depths.\n\n\"The octopuses appeared to punch the fish to enforce social order and keep the hunting group moving along,\" OceanX explained in their video, below. \"Researchers theorize that the octopuses hunt with the fish to find prey more easily, and the fish hunt with the octopuses to root out prey hiding in crevices.\"\n\nDiscovery of the \"mystery mollusc\"\n\nScientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute identified an intriguing new deep sea species off California. It's see-through, can glow, and nabs prey with a large hood. At one point while filming, researchers watched it detach one of its finger-like appendages, likely as a decoy for a predator. The glowing appendage then floated away.\n\n\"When we first filmed it glowing with the ROV, everyone in the control room let out a loud 'Oooooh!' at the same time. We were all enchanted by the sight,\" Steven Haddock, a senior scientist at the institute, said in a statement.\n\nBelow, you can view brilliant footage of the animal, which biologists have dubbed the \"mystery mollusc.\" It now also has a scientific name, Bathydevius caudactylus, and after years of observation and genetic testing, scientists have concluded it's a species of nudibranch, more popularly known as sea slugs.\n\nWild deep sea squid sighting\n\nA baited robotic lander lured a magnapinna \u2014 a rarely seen bigfin squid \u2014 and allowed researchers from Minderoo-UWA Deep-Sea Research Centre and Inkfish to film this cryptic footage. The squid was observed in the Tonga Trench, located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"Exceptional\" footage of two deep sea critters\n\n\"While diving on an unnamed seamount west of Babeldaob near the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, ROV Hercules happened upon two gorgeous deep sea creatures,\" writes the Ocean Exploration Trust.\n\nSeen first is a Chaunacops, an anglerfish with a large lure. Next is a clear view of a dumbo octopus, named for its ear-like fins.\n\nShimmering creature in the remote ocean\n\nWhile investigating the little-explored Chilean coast \u2014 with seeps and vents emitting nutrients into the water \u2014 the Schmidt Ocean Institute spotted a curious, almost alien-looking species: a shimmering species of polychaete crawling on the seafloor. It's a psychedelic marine worm.\n\nYou can see this slow-moving creature's sparkling bristles, or chaetae, in the video below.\n\nPolychaetes are extremely diverse organisms.\n\n\"The visual variety among the more than 10,000 described species means a polychaete enthusiast is never bored,\" Karen Osborn, the curator of Marine Invertebrates at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, explains. \"They come in every imaginable color and pattern, from completely transparent to iridescent to candy-striped.\"\n\nPredator discovery at 26,000 feet down\n\nThe newly discovered deep sea predator, Dulcibella camanchaca. Credit: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nDeep Sea biologists found a new animal some 26,000 feet (7,902 meters) underwater in the ocean's \"hadal zone,\" named for the Greek god of the underworld, Hades. These researchers lowered baited traps into the Atacama Trench off of Chile, and brought up four individuals of a species now called Dulcibella camanchaca.\n\n\"Dulcibella camanchaca is a fast-swimming predator that we named after 'darkness' in the languages of the peoples from the Andes region to signify the deep, dark ocean from where it predates,\" Johanna Weston, a hadal ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who coauthored the discovery, said in a statement.\n\nIn the hadal zone, the deepest ocean realm, many critters depend on food sinking down from the more productive waters above. But Dulcibella camanchaca isn't a scavenger. The four-centimeter (1.5-inch) crustacean (an arthropod with a hard shell like a crab) captures smaller hadal crustaceans.\n\nDeep sea exploration does much more than illuminate wonder.\n\nScientists want to shine a light \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 on what's down there. The implications of knowing are incalculable, particularly as deep sea mineral prospectors prepare to run tank-like industrial equipment across parts of the seafloor. For example, research expeditions have found that ocean life carries great potential for novel medicines. \"Systematic searches for new drugs have shown that marine invertebrates produce more antibiotic, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory substances than any group of terrestrial organisms,\" notes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\n\n\"There's life down there that has the potential to provide and has provided us with medicines,\" Virmani said."

A dark, vertical line near the center shows the curve of a dusty disk orbiting the core, whose presence suggests a supermassive black hole within. The disk and black hole share the same orientation, fully tipped over from the horizontal orientation of the galaxy.\n\nProbing a distant galaxy like a \"cosmic crime scene\" with the Hubble Space Telescope after a \"tip-off\" from the Chandra X-ray telescope, NASA scientists have discovered a strange black hole that is tipped onto its side.\n\nThe sideways black hole was discovered in the galaxy NGC 5084, a lenticular (lens-shaped) galaxy located around 80 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The black hole rotates in an unexpected direction in relation to its surrounding galaxy.\n\nThe team was tipped off to the existence of this black hole when they discovered two plumes of plasma, one that extends above and below the plane of the galaxy and one that stretches through the galaxy, crossing each other and making an \"X\" shape. This galactic structure is something astronomers have never seen before.\n\n\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" team member and Ames Research Center astrophysicist Pamela Marcum said in a statement . \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"\n\nThe scientists behind the discovery think that a dramatic event in the history of NGC 5084 may be responsible for knocking this black hole over on its side like a \"cosmic hit and run.\"\n\nX marks the WHAT?\n\nThe team made the discovery in archival data from Chandra thanks to a new image analysis they developed. This technique, \"Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal\" or \"SAUNAS,\" teases out low-brightness X-ray emissions from NASA's powerful X-ray space telescope, revealing the strange X-shaped twin plasma plumes.\n\nThis was odd because when astronomers see X-rays emitted from massive galaxies, they expect to find them evenly spread out. This homogeneity would result in a sphere of high-energy light. The sight of a concentrated shape of X-rays indicates a dramatic event in the history of a galaxy.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They did this by scouring the archives of other telescopes and with new observations from two powerful ground-based observatories.\n\nAn illustration shows a supermassive black tilted on its side (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nObservations from Hubble backed by data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) , 66 radio antennas based in northern Chile, showed a dusty ring of material at the heart of NGC 5084, turning on its side. This indicated not only a black hole lurking at the center of this galaxy but that object was bizarrely rotated at a 90-degree angle to NGC 5084.\n\nThe follow-up examinations of NGC 5084 helped the team see this galaxy and its sideways black hole across a wide range of light wavelengths.\n\n\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" team leader and Ames Research Center scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff said in a statement. \u201cPutting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"\n\nSo what \"crime\" does the team suspect has taken place in NGC 5084 and knocked over this black hole?\n\n\n\nCurrently, the \"prime suspect\" in this cosmic whodunnit is a collision with another galaxy that generated a \"chimney\" of plasma that erupted from the top and bottom of NGC 5084's plane.\n\nThough more investigations of NGC 5084 will be needed to properly determine the violent event that sculpted its strange structure, this research demonstrates the power of archival data, even dating back as far as three decades, to help scientists make new and unique discoveries.\n\nThis data is especially powerful when coupled with an innovative processing technique, such as that developed by Borlaff and colleagues.\n\nThe team's research was published Dec. 18 in the Astrophysical Journal ."

According to leaked documents obtained by The Information, the two companies came to agree in 2023 that AGI will be achieved once OpenAI has developed an AI system that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nThere has long been a debate in the AI community about what AGI really means, or whether computers will ever be good enough to outperform humans at most tasks and wipe out major swaths of the economy.\n\nThe term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d itself is something of a misnomer because much of it is really just a prediction machine, taking in keywords and searching large amounts of data without really understanding the underlying concepts. But OpenAI has received more than $13 billion in funding from Microsoft over the years, and that money has come with a strange contractual agreement that OpenAI would stop allowing Microsoft to use any new technology it develops after AGI is achieved.\n\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit under the guise that its technology was supposed to benefit humanity. The idea behind cutting off Microsoft once AGI is attained is that AGI would cause harm to humanity in the hands of a for-profit company. In exchange for investing billions in a nonprofit, Microsoft\u2019s current agreement with OpenAI guarantees it a slice of profits until it reaches a predetermined cap somewhere in the tens of billions; the cap is meant to ensure most profit goes back to building products that benefit humanity, supposedly.\n\nAs has been well documented at this point, OpenAI is no longer interested in this non-profit model, because the structure makes it difficult to raise more money and compete against other AI players. Since October, The Information says Microsoft and OpenAI have been negotiating changes to their arrangement, which also includes the tech giant serving as OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud hosting provider.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have been on diverging paths for some time now. It was recently reported that the latter has begun incorporating AI models developed in-house into its 365 Copilot product in order to improve cost and efficiency. It doesn\u2019t make sense for Microsoft to continue relying on OpenAI, an independent company, for technology that it believes will be the backbone of its productivity software going forward. Microsoft needs proprietary tech.\n\nOpenAI, for its part, is far away from achieving $100 billion in profit on technology whose true value remains speculative, which means it would likely have to keep giving its technology to Microsoft for a long time\u2014not great when it looks like they are headed towards being competitors. And handing over large amounts of its revenue makes it less attractive to new investors, which it will need as it continues to burn cash. Getting rid of the cloud hosting agreement could also allow OpenAI to negotiate better hosting costs with an alternative provider."

            "article_content": "Sam Altman asked his followers on X for ideas to improve OpenAI in 2025.\n\nAltman responded to suggestions about creating family accounts and improving video features.\n\nOpenAI had a rocky year following new litigation from competitor Elon Musk.\n\nSam Altman wants your suggestions for improving OpenAI in the new year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Christmas Eve, OpenAI's CEO opened the floor to his followers on X with a simple question: \"what would you like openai to build/fix in 2025?\"\n\nAltman's post comes toward the end of a tumultuous year for OpenAI. Elon Musk, who cofounded the company but left the board in 2018, filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI in February. Musk withdrew the lawsuit in June but filed a new lawsuit in August in which he argued that OpenAI executives \"deceived\" him into cofounding the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid its legal challenges, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in funding in October \u2014 a record-high funding round for tech in Silicon Valley \u2014 pushing the company's valuation to $157 billion.\n\nNow, Altman is looking at what's in store for the new year, and he's crowdsourcing ideas on how to continue advancing and improving not just ChatGPT but all of the company's existing and emerging products.\n\nHere are three ideas Altman appears to be eyeing so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily accounts\n\nOne X follower responded to Altman's post with a suggestion to allow OpenAI users to create accounts for families that include guardrails, allowing kids to use the platform safely.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Let their curiosity take off, but within reasonable limits, as determined by the parent,\" the user wrote, to which Altman responded: \"this is a good idea!\"\n\nOpenAI's website states that ChatGPT isn't meant for children under 13 and requires parental consent for children ages 13 to 18 to use the platform, but does not actively verify the consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImprovements to voice chats\n\nChatGPT developed a voice feature that allows users to speak directly to the chatbot. One of Altman's followers suggested that the feature be improved because, as of now, per the user, \"you can't just silently think for 5 seconds without being interrupted.\"\n\nAltman wrote that that's a \"good point.\" Users have struggled with the feature since it was rolled out, with some having reported bugs and misinterpretations from the chatbot.\n\nBetter video generation\n\nMultiple users urged Altman to improve Sora, OpenAI's text-to-video model. Sora allows users to describe a video they want the platform to create with a written prompt, which Sora will generate based on the text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSora officially launched on December 9 after being piloted to a limited group of creators in February. Rohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said at the launch that the product would begin more conservatively because its team wants to prevent illegal activity like copyright violations while allowing for creative expression.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."

            "article_content": "The bill tabled on 19 November by Ugo Bernalicis, a member of the left-wing party France Unbowed (La France insoumise, LFI), to remove the incrimination of \"apology for terrorism\" from the penal code has sparked a fierce controversy in the country.\n\nThis provision has, in fact, been widely used since 7 October 2023 to criminalise statements of support for the Palestinians.\n\nCritics immediately went wild. \"It must be fought with the greatest force,\" declared Justice Minister Didier Migaud. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was outraged, saying: \"It is difficult to do [anything] more despicable.\"\n\nEven within the ranks of the Socialist Party (Parti socialist, PS), an ally of France Unbowed, regional elected official Carole Delga denounced a \"moral failure in the face of the victims of terrorism and the bereaved families\".\n\nThe less severe commentators criticised LFI for a justified but solitary and poorly worded initiative. However, no political leader and few TV debate hosts considered it necessary and legitimate to address the substance of the subject.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nLFI MP Manuel Bompard commented by saying that he was \"flabbergasted by the Trumpification of the debate\" and \"the intellectual laziness of the media class\".\n\nThe intent of the bill was not simply to repeal the criminal offence of apology for terrorism but to return it to the press law, from which it had been taken and integrated into the penal code by legislation adopted on 13 November 2014.\n\nThe urgent need at the time was to counter the propaganda of organisations claiming to be part of the so-called \"international jihad\" in the context of the proclamation of a caliphate by the Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq in June 2014.\n\nThe group\u2019s propaganda aimed to seduce young Europeans by glorifying its fighters, with the goal of enlisting them or mobilising them to commit attacks in Europe. The press law was totally unsuitable for facing this phenomenon.\n\nThe point of the 2014 legal change was mainly to lift the constraints that slowed down investigations, authorise pretrial detentions and immediate court appearances, allow for evidence seizures, and mobilise anti-terrorism surveillance resources.\n\nIn the traumatic, if not hysterical, atmosphere generated in France by the January and November 2015 attacks, the number of reports - encouraged by the government - for comments made on social media, in the workplace or even at school increased from 1,500 to 35,000 in one year.\n\nCriminalisation of simple comments\n\nBut since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October last year, the use of the qualification of apology for terrorism has experienced a new surge.\n\nAs early as 10 October, then-Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti instructed prosecutors to pursue \"public remarks praising [these] attacks, presenting them as legitimate resistance to Israel, or the public propagation of messages inciting a favourable judgment on Hamas or Islamic Jihad because of the attacks they organised\".\n\nHundreds of investigations have been launched. By the end of January 2024, Le Monde counted 626 such enquiries targeting ordinary citizens, influencers, students, members of civil society organisations, union activists, journalists, academics (such as Francois Burgat), political leaders, local elected officials and even two LFI high-profile members: MP Mathilde Panot and future MEP Rima Hassan.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\"\n\nFor having equated Hamas\u2019 \"heroic\" action to an act of \"resistance\", an activist was sentenced to pay \u20ac3,000 ($3,120) in damages to Jewish organisations that filed a civil suit against him. He was also added to the national register of terrorist offences perpetrators, FIJAIT, for 10 years, requiring him to report his home address every three months and notify authorities of any international travel at least two weeks in advance.\n\nAmong the most emblematic cases was that of a union leader, Jean-Paul Delescaut, sentenced in April to a one-year suspended prison sentence for a leaflet published by his organisation which stated that \u201cthe horrors of the illegal occupation have accumulated. Since Saturday, they have been receiving the responses they provoked\u201d.\n\nThe mere reminder of the historical context was considered a justification, as it failed to express sufficient moral disapproval, according to the terms of the judgment.\n\nPeople with Arab-sounding names have particularly aroused suspicion and police have paid a lot of attention to signs of religious practice, as though such practices indicate a predisposition to terrorism - reducing the conflict to a confessional clash devoid of any political rationality.\n\nWarnings ignored\n\nCritics of the legislation proposed by LFI have deliberately ignored years of warnings issued by various authoritative human rights organisations about France's apology for terrorism law.\n\nIn 2017, ombudsman Jacques Toubon expressed his deep concern for \"a vagueness incompatible with freedom of expression and information\" and warned against the \u201ctargeting of a section of the population\" (ie Muslims).\n\nIn a report issued in May 2019, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism highlighted \u201cthe weighty effects of the offence of \u2018apology for terrorism\u2019 on the right to freedom of expression\".\n\nFrance's 'apology for terrorism' law used to 'criminalise' Palestine solidarity Read More \u00bb\n\nThe report stated: \"The law is broadly drafted, engaging significant legal uncertainty, enabling discretionary overreach and affecting the protection of free expression and the open exchange of ideas in a robust democracy.\"\n\nMore recently, in April, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH) explained to the justice minister that its circular \"may have generated confusion between approval, praise of a crime and/or criminals, and stances relating to the context in which they were committed. The latter are part of a debate of ideas and should therefore be able to enjoy freedom of expression\".\n\nEven a former anti-terrorist judge, Marc Trevidic, who had recommended the inclusion of the apology for terrorism offence in the penal code at the time, denounced\"a totally perverted use of the law\" last October.\n\n\"A simple tag in support of Palestine makes you risk prison,\" he wrote, calling for \"a U-turn\".\n\nJudges as guardians of dogma\n\nIn such an atmosphere, the LFI bill has little chance of being included on the parliamentary agenda. On the other hand, the irrational fury it has triggered says a lot about the evolution of the public debate in France.\n\nThe time when Jean-Paul Sartre could say, the day after the hostage-taking of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games by the Black September organisation, that \"the Palestinians have no other choice for lack of weapons, defenders than to resort to terrorism\" seems far removed from today.\n\nBy granting immunity to Netanyahu, France is fuelling the genocide Read More \u00bb\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s statement, while not consensual, resonated with the still vivid historical memory of national liberation struggles.\n\nOne may even think that if two former presidents, Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, were alive in our time, they could have been targeted by a denunciation for the apology for terrorism. In November 1967, Charles de Gaulle declared: \u201cIsrael is setting up in the territories it has captured an occupation that will inevitably involve oppression, repression and expulsions, and a resistance to this occupation is forming, which Israel in turn classes as terrorism.\u201d\n\nAfter the Munich events, Pompidou said: \"We will not eliminate Palestinian terrorism if we do not have some kind of solution to the Palestinian problem.\"\n\nSince 11 September 2001, the US \"war on terror\" rhetoric has progressively globalised the definition of terrorism as the figure of absolute evil, abstracted from any historical context, for which only the perpetrator bears responsibility.\n\nThe attacks committed on European soil by IS have allowed Israeli leaders to popularise their narrative of terrorism as a global threat against the West and an ideology carried by political Islam - or even by Muslims as a whole.\n\nTherefore, any attempt to rationally explain its causes is regarded as a reprehensible way of justifying it. Faced with this vital danger, only the use of limitless violence is seen as the legitimate response.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative into the republican orthodoxy. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, if not \u201cinner enemies\u201d, labelled either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\" - a term loaded with historical significance in France, where it was used to describe Nazi allies during the occupation from 1940 to 1944.\n\nJudges, contrary to their traditional calling as \"guardians of freedoms\", are set to become the guardians of dogma. Contrary to Clausewitz's adage, according to which war is the continuation of politics by other means, in France, the law - or rather, the political use of the law - has become the prolongation of war in the realm of public opinion.\n\nThe same trend is at work in Germany and the United States. The war waged by Israel is accelerating the authoritarian and xenophobic drift of the states that support it.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "The end of the year typically brings with it an emotional look back at the days gone by. For archaeologists, looking back into the past is pretty much an every day thing. That said, here are 10 of the most interesting archeological findings that Popular Science covered this year.\n\nNeanderthals and early humans intermingled Europe earlier\n\nStone tools from the Lincombian\u2013Ranisian\u2013Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture uncovered at Ranis. Item 1 is a partial bifacial blade point characteristic of the LRJ. Item 2 also contains finely made bifacial leaf points. CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area. CREDIT: NASA / ISSAP\n\nThe icy cold reaches of space is not exactly the first place to come to mind for archaeological discoveries. That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens. While it is only an initial survey into this subject matter, it\u2019s the first of its kind to document how humans adapt to a novel environment completely removed from what we as a species evolved to handle.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

            "article_content": "As science continues its evolution, discoveries and technologies can act like a master key that opens doors that lead to novel advancements. Artificial intelligence is one such key, making innovations possible by solving complex problems, automating tasks and enabling research that would have been impossible, or very time-consuming, without it.\n\nBut do we want to do research on all topics, and shall we try the AI master key on every door? To explore this question, let\u2019s consider the use of AI by genomics experts as an example.\n\nIn recent years, genomics experts have added unbelievable depth to what we know about the world and ourselves. For example, genetics researchers have revealed facts about when certain animals and plants were domesticated. In another example, DNA found in 30,000-year-old permafrost was used to create fertile samples of a plant called narrow-leafed campion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR facilitate extraordinary advances in the treatment of complicated conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia.\n\nThanks to AI developments, we are witnessing a dramatic increase in the pace and scalability of genomic techniques, which will allow researchers to embark on exploratory journeys \u2014 and at the same time, add urgency to already-existing ethical issues. AI companies are also most interested in the scientific implications of this technology. We see this demonstrated in a recent interview between Harvard Business School officials and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In response to the question, \u201cWhat are the pieces of AI that you are most excited about?\u201d Altman said: \u201cGreatly increasing the rate of scientific discovery is what I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the risks and possible consequences of AI use in science, should we rush headlong into using AI in all kinds of projects?\n\nOne relevant example is research on Neanderthals, our closest relatives, who lived until about 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals have been studied for several years now through genetic investigation of their fossils and their DNA. Genetic engineering can potentially use ancient DNA and genome editing methods to re-create a Neanderthal or aspects of a Neanderthal\u2019s genetics and physiology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, scientists could start by figuring out the DNA sequence of a Neanderthal by comparing it with the DNA of modern humans, since they are closely related. Then, scientists could use CRISPR to swap out parts of human DNA with Neanderthal DNA. This process would require a lot of trial and error and might not succeed soon, but based on what we know about genetics, if something is possible, AI can help make it happen faster, cheaper and with less effort.\n\nScientists are excited about these developments because they could facilitate new discoveries and open up many new research opportunities in genetic research.\n\nWith or without AI, research on Neanderthals will proceed, but the extraordinary power of AI could give the final push to these discoveries and facilitate this kind of resurrection. At that point, the scientific community must develop norms and guidelines about how to treat these resurrected beings with dispositions very similar to humans. We would need to carefully consider their rights and well-being almost in the same way as when humans are involved and not as research subjects or artifacts of scientific curiosity. These ethical issues are discussed in more detail in a new paper published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.\n\nA more holistic question to consider is: Should we prioritize the use of resource-intensive AI, researchers\u2019 time and public funds to resurrect extinct beings? Or should we invest these resources into conserving species that are critically endangered today to prevent biodiversity from more degradation?\n\n_____\n\nMohammad Hosseini, Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n_____"

            "article_content": "Hubble Space Telescope image of galaxy NGC 5084's core. A dark, vertical line near the center shows the curve of a dusty disk orbiting the core, whose presence suggests a supermassive black hole within. The disk and black hole share the same orientation, fully tipped over from the horizontal orientation of the galaxy.\n\nProbing a distant galaxy like a \"cosmic crime scene\" with the Hubble Space Telescope after a \"tip-off\" from the Chandra X-ray telescope, NASA scientists have discovered a strange black hole that is tipped onto its side.\n\nThe sideways black hole was discovered in the galaxy NGC 5084, a lenticular (lens-shaped) galaxy located around 80 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The black hole rotates in an unexpected direction in relation to its surrounding galaxy.\n\nThe team was tipped off to the existence of this black hole when they discovered two plumes of plasma, one that extends above and below the plane of the galaxy and one that stretches through the galaxy, crossing each other and making an \"X\" shape. This galactic structure is something astronomers have never seen before.\n\n\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" team member and Ames Research Center astrophysicist Pamela Marcum said in a statement . \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"\n\nThe scientists behind the discovery think that a dramatic event in the history of NGC 5084 may be responsible for knocking this black hole over on its side like a \"cosmic hit and run.\"\n\nX marks the WHAT?\n\nThe team made the discovery in archival data from Chandra thanks to a new image analysis they developed. This technique, \"Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal\" or \"SAUNAS,\" teases out low-brightness X-ray emissions from NASA's powerful X-ray space telescope, revealing the strange X-shaped twin plasma plumes.\n\nThis was odd because when astronomers see X-rays emitted from massive galaxies, they expect to find them evenly spread out. This homogeneity would result in a sphere of high-energy light. The sight of a concentrated shape of X-rays indicates a dramatic event in the history of a galaxy.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They did this by scouring the archives of other telescopes and with new observations from two powerful ground-based observatories.\n\nAn illustration shows a supermassive black tilted on its side (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nObservations from Hubble backed by data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) , 66 radio antennas based in northern Chile, showed a dusty ring of material at the heart of NGC 5084, turning on its side. This indicated not only a black hole lurking at the center of this galaxy but that object was bizarrely rotated at a 90-degree angle to NGC 5084.\n\nThe follow-up examinations of NGC 5084 helped the team see this galaxy and its sideways black hole across a wide range of light wavelengths.\n\n\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" team leader and Ames Research Center scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff said in a statement. \u201cPutting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"\n\nSo what \"crime\" does the team suspect has taken place in NGC 5084 and knocked over this black hole?\n\n\n\nCurrently, the \"prime suspect\" in this cosmic whodunnit is a collision with another galaxy that generated a \"chimney\" of plasma that erupted from the top and bottom of NGC 5084's plane.\n\nThough more investigations of NGC 5084 will be needed to properly determine the violent event that sculpted its strange structure, this research demonstrates the power of archival data, even dating back as far as three decades, to help scientists make new and unique discoveries.\n\nThis data is especially powerful when coupled with an innovative processing technique, such as that developed by Borlaff and colleagues.\n\nThe team's research was published Dec. 18 in the Astrophysical Journal ."

We wanted to support local restaurants, reduce the dish load, and live a little. It became clear early on that app-based delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats were not the best way to support local businesses. If a restaurant had its own ordering site or a preferred service, we wanted to use that\u2014or even, heaven forfend, call the place.\n\nThe secondary issue was that we kept ordering from the same places, and we wanted to mix it up. Sometimes we'd want to pick something up nearby. Sometimes we wanted to avoid an entire category (\"Too many carbs this week, no pasta\") or try the newest places we knew about, or maybe a forgotten classic. Or just give me three places randomly, creative constraints, please\u2014it's Friday.\n\nAt its core, this is a shared list, i.e. spreadsheet. But my spreadsheet maintenance enthusiasm greatly outweighs that of my spouse. More than that, have you ever pulled up a Google Sheet or online Excel file on your normal-sized phone to make changes? I do so only in moments of true desperation.\n\nFor things that are bigger than a note or dry-erase board but smaller than paying for some single-use, subscription-based app, I build little private webapps with Glide. You might use something else, but Glide is a really nice entry into the spreadsheet-to-app milieu. The apps it creates are the kind that can easily be shared and installed (i.e., \"Add to Home Screen\") on phones, tablets, or desktops, from a browser. Here's how it worked for me."

            "article_content": "Whether you\u2019re a professional event planner, putting together an important conference for work, or just throwing a big party, event planning templates can help you stay organized. From tracking costs to vendor contact information and guest RSVPs, the right system can ensure everything goes according to plan while saving your sanity along the way.\n\nmonday.com: An event planning dashboard for managing multiple events, projects, and employees\n\nPlanning an event is a lot like managing a project, especially if you\u2019re juggling multiple events alongside other projects and a team at the same time. Since monday.com is one of the best project management solutions on the market today, it\u2019s perfect for managing all three within the same platform.\n\nIt comes with everything you need (and then some) to stay organized, plus there\u2019s a free plan for up to two users if you want to try it before upgrading to a paid plan.\n\nMore on monday.com: monday.com Review | monday.com vs Wrike | monday.com vs. Pipedrive.\n\nAside from being able to handle just about any type of project or item you need to keep track of, my favorite part of this event planning template is the built-in budget tracking features.\n\nIt allows you to set a budget for an entire quarter or year and allocate that money across all of your events. Alternatively, you can set a unique budget for each event, and track spending by category.\n\nRegardless of how you approach this, you can keep an eye on your numbers and ensure you stay within your budget constraints.\n\nI also like that monday.com helps you streamline the RSVP process. You can easily send out an RSVP form to automatically track attendees without having to deal with manual inputs that are time-consuming and prone to human error.\n\nEach RSVP will show up in your system with all the details the user provided.\n\nClickUp: Event planning templates for collaborative teams\n\nClickUp\u2019s project management system is built for collaboration out of the box, including team chat, document building, nested comment threads, and more. This makes it a great option for teams planning events together. ClickUp also makes it easy to track progress and understand everyone\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nYou can get started with ClickUp for free and work with an unlimited number of users at no cost. However, most teams will get the most out of it by upgrading to a paid plan.\n\nMore on ClickUp: ClickUp Review | ClickUp vs Asana | ClickUp vs Notion.\n\nTemplate 1: Best for delegating responsibilities and tracking priorities\n\nThis first ClickUp event planning template works well for small-to-mid-sized events. I think it safely supports events with up to 250 participants, and it works equally well for smaller events with 50 to 100-person guest lists.\n\nYour entire team can use this to align event resources, visualize what needs to happen, and ensure everything gets done on time and under budget.\n\nThe default template comes with six views, including lists, calendars, and more. My favorite part is that you can set priority levels once and use color coded flags to visually understand priority in any view at a glance.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s a separate prioritization board that groups everything by priority.\n\nYou can easily drag and drop tasks to different sections to ensure your team\u2019s always working on what\u2019s most important.\n\nClickUp\u2019s built in commenting and mentions feature lets you alert the assignee of priority changes so everyone\u2019s always in the loop. Users can look at all of their assigned work, sort it by priority, and work down their list.\n\nThis alone can help you avoid repetitive meetings since everything\u2019s easily visible.\n\nI also like that project or event managers can look at each person\u2019s workload and rebalance everything as needed by dragging tasks to someone else.\n\nTemplate 2: Best for large corporate events and conferences\n\nIf you need to plan and host larger events, like conferences or corporate offsites, you\u2019ll need something with a bit more power. This second ClickUp template offers just that \u2014 it\u2019s more advanced than the first and takes a bit more time to set up, but it\u2019s worth it for complex vents that have a lot of moving parts.\n\nIt works particularly well if you have sponsors, exhibitors, guests, and a lot of different elements you need to stay on top of.\n\nThe best part is that it comes with a pre-built expense intake form, allowing your team to track their expenses towards your budget. Each expense can be categorized, so it works just as well for reimbursements too.\n\nYou could even set up a separate form for sponsors, guests, or vendors if you need to gather additional information from them.\n\nThe sponsor area lets you group them by tier (if you\u2019d like). For example, you could have different statuses based on donation amounts. You can also keep track of payments and donations, their attendance at your event, and even various activities to fulfill sponsor promises.\n\nFor RSVPs, there\u2019s a robust registration tracker set up for managing different types of tickets. You can simplify if you don\u2019t need all that, but it\u2019s nice to have it already built out.\n\nAnother standout feature of this template is that it can help you gather feedback after the event is over.\n\nWrike: An event planning template for ongoing internal events\n\nWrike is a highly structured project management tool that accommodates teams of all sizes. Unlike other project management platforms that restrict the number of users on the free tier, Wrike\u2019s free plan lets you onboard as many users as you\u2019d like.\n\nIt also has a range of built in views that can help manage recurring events plus all the work required to make them happen.\n\nMore on Wrike: Wrike Review | Wrike vs Smartsheet | Wrike vs Asana.\n\nWhether you\u2019re managing regular conferences, product launches, or informal parties, this template makes it easy to visualize everything and stay on top of every task required to set up each event.\n\nEach event can have its own owner, due date, priority, and tasks. Drilling down one level further, each task can also have its own assignee, status, and more.\n\nYou can plan events across your entire company in one place or break them up into multiple projects or workspaces.\n\nEach workspace can be rolled up to a higher level view, making it great for managers that need to see all the work in one place. Plus, you can use the template\u2019s built in scheduling system and request forms to track attendance.\n\nMy favorite element is that you can map everyone on a Gantt chart with dependencies. However, you have to be on a paid plan to use Gantt charts in Wrike.\n\nTeamwork: An event planner for marketers\n\nTeamwork is a robust project management system for client-based businesses. It can also work well for other types of models, but it\u2019s purpose built for agencies and freelancers.\n\nIt has all the typical project and task management features you expect plus things like retainer management, resource scheduling, built in invoicing, time tracking, customizable client views, and proofing workflows.\n\nThere\u2019s a free plan for up to five people if you want to try it out, but most businesses will need to upgrade to a paid plan.\n\nMore on Teamwork: Teamwork Review | Teamwork vs monday.com | Teamwork Alternatives.\n\nMy favorite event planning template for Teamwork is specifically for marketers who need to organize and promote events. You\u2019ll be able to plan ahead, keep track of all the work involved, and manage all the moving parts in one place.\n\nWhether you need to build an email campaign, event landing page, finalize your vendor list, this template has everything you need to stay organized and reach more of the right people.\n\nAnother standout feature is the ability to create reusable workflows you can copy to a new project in a few clicks.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out the best way to promote your events, you can easily replicate it without having to add all the tasks and assignees from scratch. It can be a huge time saver, especially if you use it to plan recurring events or a lot of short events back to back.\n\nIf you like Teamwork but you\u2019re not a marketer, this template can easily be adapted to other departments as well.\n\nCheck out our curated list of the best free marketing plan templates if you\u2019re looking for something broader that will help you develop a general marketing plan.\n\nNotion: A personal party planning template\n\nNotion is an online productivity platform that brings tables, spreadsheets, documents, and collaborative elements together. It starts as a blank slate and lets you create a personalized workspace that matches your needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re using it by yourself, you can use the free plan without having to upgrade for a long time, making it perfect for planning personal parties.\n\nMore on Notion: Notion Review | Notion vs Asana | Notion vs OneNote.\n\nSolo planners don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles that come with all the project management tools we\u2019ve covered so far. This template, on the other hand, is simple and designed for personal use.\n\nIt\u2019s great if you\u2019re planning something and don\u2019t want any of the details to slip through the cracks.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to add all your action items, keep track of who\u2019s bringing what, and even assign tasks to other people. But the best part is that you can publish your workspace for free \u2014 this makes it visible to anyone who has the link, so you can use it as a digital invitation.\n\nAttendees will be able to RSVP, mention any extra guests, sign up to bring items, let you know about food allergies, or any other details you might need from them.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a simple way to make sure your next party goes off without a hitch.\n\nFree event planning templates for Excel\n\nIf you\u2019re an individual or a small team planning a one-off event, you probably don\u2019t need project management software. A spreadsheet will be more than enough, especially if you have a template to help you get started.\n\nWhether you\u2019re planning a baby shower, family reunion, or a holiday party at work, Excel or Google Sheets plus a group chat or email thread is often all you need.\n\nTemplate 1: A detailed event planning checklist for Excel\n\nTeamGantt is great for building Gantt charts, but it also offers a ton of free templates for Excel and Google Sheets. One of the best event planning templates is a pre-made checklist covering dozens of different elements you may need to keep track of.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to add your own tasks or edit the existing tasks to match your needs.\n\nRather than using a standard status drop down, you\u2019ll be able to set percentages that reflect each task\u2019s progress. It then calculates the overall percentage for each category.\n\nEach task can have its own start and end date, assignee, estimated hours, and actual hours so you can compare.\n\nAlthough this template is simple, a straightforward checklist is often all you need.\n\nIt\u2019s also available for use in TeamGantt if you want more robust visualization and tracking capabilities. With a paid plan, you\u2019ll be able to build out Gantt charts, set up notifications, and collaborate with a team using a similar setup.\n\nTemplate 2: A simple event calendar for small businesses\n\nKnack is a no-code application builder that also offers free small business templates for Excel and Google Sheets. One of their best templates is a simple event planner that\u2019s perfect for sharing a company wide calendar.\n\nRather than planning all the work that needs to happen before, during, and after an event, this template is a simple calendar that lets you and your team add events as needed.\n\nIt can work well for individuals or small teams who need an easy way to keep track of upcoming events. Whether you\u2019re organizing book signings and author readings, art classes for kids, live shows, or special discounts, it\u2019s incredibly easy to use.\n\nThere\u2019s a separate tab for each month and you can create additional copies to continue using it year after year.\n\nAny time someone needs to book an event, they can check the calendar to see when there\u2019s an open date. They\u2019ll also be able to add theirs so nobody else takes it.\n\nWhen to use an event planning template\n\nIf you\u2019re planning an event and you need something more organized than a simple to-do list in your phone, an event planning template can help ensure everything is done on time.\n\nHere are a few scenarios where a template can definitely help:\n\nAn event with more than 50 guests.\n\nRecurring events or multiple events at the same time.\n\nComplex logistics (like vendors, exhibitors, and sponsors).\n\nAttendees will RSVP and potentially add extra guests.\n\nYour event is longer than a few hours.\n\nCollaboration with others is required.\n\nYou need to track expenses.\n\nNot sure if you should use one? Create a list of everything you need to get done. If you still feel overwhelmed, a template can help you get even more organized until you feel confident everything is accounted for.\n\nTemplates, project management tools, and productivity platforms also offer other benefits, like automations, notifications, and analytics.\n\nYou won\u2019t get these from a spreadsheet or note on your phone. If you need or want any of those things, upgrading to something more powerful and using one of the templates in this guide will give you access to more features.\n\nHow to choose the right event planning template\n\nJust like events come in all flavors, templates for planning them do too. Some let you plan all the work involved, others are a simple calendar to let others know when events are taking place, and most are somewhere in between.\n\nIn most cases, you can use any of the templates here. It really won\u2019t matter which one you use because you\u2019ll be able to customize it to match your needs.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a good idea to start with a template that\u2019s close if you don\u2019t want to do a lot of tweaking to make it work.\n\nThe following considerations can help you narrow it down:\n\nSolo vs collaborative events \u2014 Some templates are clearly meant for individuals, while others offer more functionality for working with a team.\n\n\u2014 Some templates are clearly meant for individuals, while others offer more functionality for working with a team. One-off vs ongoing needs \u2014 Planning one event is a lot easier than planning recurring events or multiple events at the same time. As such, templates for one-off events tend to be simple and straightforward while others are more complex.\n\n\u2014 Planning one event is a lot easier than planning recurring events or multiple events at the same time. As such, templates for one-off events tend to be simple and straightforward while others are more complex. Number of guests \u2014 Events with 25 guests, 250 guests, and 2,500 guests require very different levels of planning and coordination.\n\n\u2014 Events with 25 guests, 250 guests, and 2,500 guests require very different levels of planning and coordination. Budget planning \u2014 Do you need or want to track expenses against your budget? Not every event planning template offers this feature out of the box.\n\n\u2014 Do you need or want to track expenses against your budget? Not every event planning template offers this feature out of the box. Timeline \u2014 You can use something simple, like a spreadsheet if you\u2019re planning an event that\u2019s in the next couple of weeks, whereas you\u2019ll need something more advanced for planning an event that\u2019s 3-6+ months away. The same is true for planning an event that lasts a few hours vs planning one that spans multiple days or weeks.\n\n\u2014 You can use something simple, like a spreadsheet if you\u2019re planning an event that\u2019s in the next couple of weeks, whereas you\u2019ll need something more advanced for planning an event that\u2019s 3-6+ months away.

Meanwhile, the index has averaged an annual gain of 19% in a year following a year in which it clocked a 30% jump. It is worth noting that the Nasdaq Composite index is up just over 32% so far in 2024, as of this writing.\n\nOf course, past performance isn't a reliable indicator of what the future holds, but a closer look at the trends in the technology market indicates that the Nasdaq could indeed head higher in 2025. From strong economic growth in the U.S. to robust consumer spending to disruptive tech trends such as artificial intelligence (AI), there are multiple factors that could help tech stocks soar higher in the new year.\n\nThat's why now would be a good time to take a closer look at two Nasdaq Composite components that have delivered outstanding gains in 2024 and could head higher in 2025 as well.\n\n1. Nvidia: A new generation of AI chips can help it sustain its red-hot rally\n\nShare prices of semiconductor bellwether Nvidia (NVDA -0.06%) are up 185% in 2024 as of this writing. The market has handsomely rewarded the chipmaker's healthy top- and bottom-line growth, which has been driven by the sizzling demand for its AI hardware.\n\nThe impressive thing to note here is that Nvidia trades at an attractive 33 times forward earnings despite the stock's solid surge this year. That isn't very expensive when you consider that the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index has a forward earnings multiple of 27, especially considering the pace at which Nvidia's bottom line has been growing.\n\nConsensus estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance forecast a 128% increase in Nvidia's earnings per share in the current fiscal year to $2.95 per share. That's expected to be followed by a 50% jump in the next fiscal year (which will begin toward the end of January 2025 and will coincide with the majority of the calendar year) to $4.43 per share. However, as the following chart shows, analysts are more bullish about Nvidia's bottom-line growth and have significantly raised their earnings-per-share estimates for the next fiscal year over the past six months.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see this trend continue in 2025. That's because Nvidia's new Blackwell processors will see a sharp production ramp-up next year. Morgan Stanley estimates that Nvidia could manufacture 250,000 to 300,000 units of its Blackwell chips in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, generating between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue.\n\nThe production of the Blackwell chips is expected to jump to a range of 750,000 to 800,000 units in the first quarter of 2025, indicating that Nvidia's revenue from these chips could multiply. The production of the previous-generation Hopper processors is expected to drop from 1.5 million units in the current quarter to 1 million units in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAs Nvidia gears up the production of its Blackwell chips and winds down Hopper, it should ideally see a big jump in its top and bottom lines. That's because the company reportedly priced the Blackwell B200 processor at a premium of 60% to 70% when compared to the flagship Hopper chip, the H200. You might be wondering why Nvidia customers would be willing to pay such a premium for its latest chips, but the cost increment should be more than offset by the 4x performance gains that Blackwell is expected to deliver over Hopper.\n\nAs such, there is a solid chance that Nvidia could continue to outperform the broader market in 2025. Assuming it does achieve $4.43 per share in earnings next year and trades at 41 times forward earnings (in line with its five-year average), its stock price could go to $182. That would be a 35% jump from current levels. I wouldn't be surprised to see this AI stock delivering stronger gains in the event of a bigger jump in its earnings as the market would likely reward Nvidia with a higher valuation.\n\n2. Palantir: It's up over 389% in 2024, and it could be at the beginning of a terrific growth curve\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR -0.36%) has set the stock market on fire in 2024 with remarkable gains of nearly 390% as of this writing. This red-hot rally made Palantir stock quite expensive, which explains why only those investors with an appetite for risk and volatility should consider buying it right now.\n\nAfter all, Palantir stock is trading at an expensive 422 times trailing earnings. Of course, its forward earnings multiple of 222 points toward a big increase in its bottom line, but it is still extremely expensive. Despite this, growth investors might still want to consider buying this hot stock.\n\nPalantir is the leading player in the market for AI software platforms. Research and advisory company Forrester recently pointed out that Palantir is a leading provider of AI and machine learning (ML) software platforms, and it is \"quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market\" thanks to the rapidly growing adoption of the company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nSo, Palantir seems on its way to making the most of a lucrative growth opportunity in the AI software platforms market, a space that's expected to generate $153 billion in revenue by growing at a compound annual rate of nearly 41%. The company's growing influence in this market is also evident from the acceleration in its growth in recent quarters.\n\nPalantir's growth could continue accelerating as both commercial and government customers have been quick to deploy its software platforms to integrate generative AI within their operations. The U.S. Army, for instance, recently extended its partnership with Palantir worth $400.7 million for a period of four years, which can be extended to a value of $619 million.\n\nThis is just one instance of customers increasing their usage of Palantir's offerings. The company ended the third quarter of 2024 with a remaining deal value of $4.5 billion, which was a 22% increase over the year-ago quarter. This metric refers to the total value of contracts that Palantir has at the end of a quarter.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting a 25% increase in the company's top line to $2.79 billion in 2025, so its remaining deal value points toward a solid revenue pipeline that should help it sustain its impressive growth in the future as well. Palantir's earnings are expected to jump by 52% this year to $0.38 per share. The good part is that Palantir's margin profile has been improving as it has been able to gain more business from existing customers, leading to strong unit economics.\n\nThis combination of solid unit economics and the company's robust revenue pipeline are the reasons why Palantir's earnings-per-share estimates have been heading higher this year.\n\nThis trend could continue in 2025 and beyond as the company is currently scratching the surface of a massive growth opportunity in the AI software platform space. As such, Palantir stock could continue heading higher in the new year, which is why growth-oriented investors may still want to buy it even after the outstanding gains it has delivered in 2024."

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe generative AI landscape has morphed into a high-stakes battleground in 2024, with an army of upstarts storming the castle once ruled by OpenAI.\n\nEveryone and their tech-savvy grandma seems to be vying for a piece of the AI pie, cooking up language models, agentic AIs, image generators, and even an AI meme coin shiller or two.\n\nThe benchmarks are changing faster than our human ability to keep up. Barely a week goes by without some shiny new toy hitting the market\u2014an updated LLM here, a turbocharged image generator there, or a next-gen AI flexing some exotic training technique.\n\nBut here at Decrypt, we've rolled up our sleeves and tried them all.\n\nWe've kicked the tires, pushed the buttons, and gotten deep inside the inner workings and the outputs provided by the most popular AI models\u2014and some that are not so well-known.\n\nNow that it's clear that OpenAI isn't the only sheriff in town, we've compiled a list of the cream of the crop\u2014the generative AI models that have wowed us, befuddled us, and occasionally made us spit out our coffee.\n\nChatbots\n\nA chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users. It uses natural language processing and artificial intelligence to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. Usually, people confuse chatbots with LLMs, or large language models.\n\nToday, chatbots are a bit more complex, with capabilities that extend beyond text generation. They can now browse the web, generate and understand images, talk to the user, etc.\n\nHere is our list of the best chatbots you should try:\n\nGold medal: OpenAI's ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT offers a wide array of features at $20/month, including custom agent creation with natural language, a clean interface, web search, and multiple models (reasoning, writing, vision, voice, and image generation).\n\nSilver medal: Anthropic's Claude\n\nA superior LLM with an intuitive UI featuring split-screen artifacts for reasoning and code generation, Claude supports million-token context and custom agents. However, it lacks web search and image generation and often faces capacity issues, forcing users to switch to a weaker model or generate \u201cconcise\u201d shorter answers. Because of this, it cannot be the best just yet.\n\nBronze medal: Mistral AI\u2019s LeChat\n\nThis free platform is powered by Mistral Large, featuring top-tier Flux image generation and superior web search\u2014the best, in our opinion, even beating SearchGPT. It supports document/image understanding and open-source AI agents, though text quality trails competitors. However, the Mistral Large LLM isn\u2019t as strong as its competitors, making it ideal for power users willing to trade text quality for features.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Meta AI, Gemini (from Google\u2019s AI studio, not the main site), Hugging Chat, Reka, Grok-2\n\nLarge language models\n\nA large language model or LLM is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. You can see it as a glorified autocomplete. They are designed to predict what the most likely token (think about words, though it\u2019s an inaccurate comparison) is in a group.\n\nThe result is natural text that feels human because, well, it resembles what humans would do.\n\nHere is our list of the best LLMs to date:\n\nBest generalist: OpenAI's GPT-4o\n\nBalances creative writing, coding, and reasoning with a customizable \"Canvas\" feature, though its style can feel predictable. The latest version (from November 20) has also achieved the top spot in the LLM Arena with an ELO score of 1,366, beating an experimental version of Google Gemini released on November 21.\n\nBest for writing: Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\nMatches or exceeds GPT-4o in many areas with more creative, human-like output, though it's prone to hallucination.\n\nBest for storytelling: Longwriter\n\nGenerates 10,000+ word stories within minutes. Do we need to say more?\n\nMost versatile: Meta's Llama-3.1\n\nThe leading open-source model with extensive customization, LoRA creation, and fine-tuning options, available in sizes from 7 billion to 405 billion parameters so users can run it on their local machines or cloud servers depending on their needs. Nvidia developed a customized version named \"Nemotron,\" which made some waves in the community and is worth checking out.\n\nBiggest letdown: Reflection Llama-3.1 70B\n\nAnnounced with high expectations, the model claimed to beat GPT-4o thanks to its embedded Chain of Thought. It ended up being a major fiasco with fake benchmarks, hidden API calls to Claude AI, and a major controversy.\n\nImage generators\n\nAn image generator is essentially a model that gets a text input and provides an output associated with that text input. So, for example, you say, \u201cGreen horse with a dragon face,\u201d and the model will generate a photo of a green horse with a dragon face. You can also input something like \u201cbusty waifu,\u201d but that is not what they are for.\n\nThese are some of the best image generators currently available\n\nBest generalist: Flux\n\nFlux dominates the latest generation of AI models with substantial customization, LoRA/ControlNet support, and text generation capabilities. It requires powerful hardware, but shows a characteristic style with extreme bokeh and slack skin detail that users are still trying to tackle.\n\nIt comes in three flavors: Pro (closed-source, the most potent model), Dev (noncommercial license), and Schnell (an open-source, distilled version). All three offer excellent image generation capabilities, and the ceiling will go higher if fine-tunes are considered.\n\nBest for realism: Recraft v3\n\nDelivers unmatched realism, offering versatile presets and better value than proprietary alternatives like MidJourney.\n\nIt has a free tier that offers the same quality\u2014though Recraft owns generations.\n\nBest for anime: MidJourney Niji\n\nUnrivaled quality for anime-style images; a Stable Diffusion fine-tuning is a secondary option.\n\nMost versatile: Stable Diffusion 3.5\n\nStable Diffusion 3.5 is a major improvement over SD3 with better licensing, detailed output, and add-on support.\n\nIt is more resource-efficient than Flux for fine-tuning and is a full model\u2014unlike Flux Schnell, which is a distilled version\u2014making it the best pick for custom models.\n\nHowever, it came out a little bit late and has been overshadowed by Flux\u2019s popularity.\n\nBiggest Letdown: SD 3 Medium\n\nEveryone expected this new model to be the new King of Image Generators, beating SDXL and every other model. It ended up being a poor model, infamous for its horrible license and horrific aberrations when trying to generate people on grass.\n\nVideo generators\n\nVideo generators take image generation one step further. They generate each frame and use it as input to generate the following one with image consistency and high prompt adherence.\n\nThis is still a work in progress, and models can only generate a few seconds of video. Below is a list of some of the best ones you can try.\n\nBest generalist: Kling\n\nRapidly improving the Chinese model, outperforming Sora in some cases. Supports face model training, and consistently generates high-quality scenes showing a major versatility in terms of styles, realism, and camera movement.\n\nBest contender: Runway Gen 3\n\nPioneering generative video app with solid environmental understanding, but struggles with fast-paced scenes.\n\nBest for storytelling: ShowRunner\n\nWe cannot tell you a lot about this one. However, in confidential testing, it has shown immense potential.\n\nBest open-source: Genmo Mochi 1\n\nIt's a great release that beats competitors like Rhymes Allegro and Stable Video Diffusion with superior realism and frame consistency.\n\nBiggest letdown: OpenAI Sora\n\nAnnounced with high expectations as a revolutionary \u201cworld model\u201d beyond any video generation, it remains unavailable today with underwhelming leaked outputs.\n\nHonorable mention: Google Veo\n\nGoogle's Veo was released on December 3. We haven't tested it, but the generations shared by Google look pretty nice. Of course, we're on the waiting list to test the model, and you'll be the first to know our thoughts as soon as we get access.\n\nMusic generators\n\nJust like video generators, music generators create songs. It\u2019s different from audio generators, however, since the outputs are more specialized to melodic outputs that are not noise, plain voices, or audio effects.\n\nUsers can rely on a separate LLM to generate the lyrics of a song or input lyrics manually, and set a few parameters like the style of the song, and then the model will output relevant music from scratch.\n\nThese are the best two\u2014plus an open-source alternative.\n\nBest generalist: Suno v4\n\nExcels in vocals and lyrics, style diversity, and long-form consistency. Its predecessor, Suno v3.5, is not free but remains a strong alternative.\n\nBest contender: Udio\n\nSuno\u2019s biggest rival. It delivers impressive composition accuracy, nearly rivaling Suno v4 in vocals. Some generations surpass Suno v3 in subjective style.\n\nBest open-source: Stable Audio 2\n\nThe open-source scene is not doing a lot in this area. Stable Audio 2 seems to be the best model, but lags behind closed-source competitors in every field. Meta\u2019s AudioCraft and MusicGen are alternatives, but far from industry-leading. Fine-tuners have not paid attention, and usually, they are the people behind the cherry on top that makes open-source models so great.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

We have covered the top 5 news headlines from the week. Check it out.\n\nAbu Dhabi Plans to Launch the First Flying Taxi Service by 2025\n\nAbu Dhabi might become the first city to launch a flying taxi service by 2025. This project will be a collaboration between Abu Dhabi and Archer Aviation \u2013 a US-based company specializing in designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.\n\nThe flying taxi service will link various \u201cvertiports\u201d across the city. The starter model is called Midnight, which is a vertical takeoff and landing model. This means it will lift off the ground directly like a helicopter (unlike an airplane that requires a long runway). Each model will be able to carry up to 4 passengers.\n\nSpeaking of the benefits, the biggest perk is that flying taxis will cut down travel time by up to 80%. Even the starter models can go up to a speed of 240 km/hr which means a route that usually takes up to 1hr by car can be completed within 10-20 mins by these flying taxis.\n\nNot to mention, these taxis will be much more eco-friendly and significantly reduce traffic congestion on the streets.\n\nThe project is expected to go into a trial phase soon with commercial services fully launching by the end of 2025.\n\nWhy Abu Dhabi?\n\nThe reason why Abu Dhabi was chosen to be the first city to lay down the path for flying taxis is its unique geography. The city consists of over 200 islands, making air travel the perfect alternative to traditional road travel for citizens.\n\nThe city authorities have also been very helpful. A project of this level and scale requires a lot of support for developing the right infrastructure such as the \u201cvertiports\u201d and the traffic management system, which the Abu Dhabi authorities have provided throughout.\n\nYou Can Now Reach ChatGPT on WhatsApp\n\nOpenAI has rolled out a new feature that will allow users to reach out to ChatGPT over call or Whatsapp text.\n\nIn a livestream hosted by the OpenAI team, it revealed that the new features were created by the team within weeks. The chat option is available worldwide for all of the 2.7 billion Whatsapp users but the calling feature is only limited to US users for now.\n\nThey can reach out to the tool at 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478). Making calls doesn\u2019t require an Open AI account and the first 15 minutes of calling every month is completely free!\n\nThere are some limitations as of now. For example, you cannot add OpenAI to any group chats. Similarly, its knowledge base for Whatsapp users is limited to information dating back to September 2021. It cannot help you with anything that happened beyond that.\n\nHence, the company has warned that users seeking a more personalized experience and advanced assistance should stick to using ChatGPT directly through their accounts.\n\nIncreasing accessibility to the tool has been a primary goal of the company since day one. And what better way to do that than leveraging the most popular messaging app in the world?\n\nWe care a lot about continuing to reduce barriers so that more people can try out AI and see what it can do for them. \u2013 Antonia Woodford, product manager\n\nThere\u2019s also the obvious motive of enticing new users to try out the paid versions of ChatGPT. But the good news is the company has promised not to use the call conversations to train the chatbot.\n\nTrump Is Rethinking TikTok\u2019s Impending Ban\n\nThe popular social media platform has a few weeks left until it\u2019s banned in the US forever. This ban stems from a bill passed earlier this year that forced the company to cut ties with its parent company (a Chinese company called ByteDance) or risk getting banned in the US.\n\nThis is because US regulators are worried about China using its influence on TikTok to spy on US citizens. And given how sour the relationship between the two countries has turned right now, it\u2019s natural for the US to keep its guard up around China. Hence, the bill.\n\nTikTok naturally opposed the bill, even challenging it legally but to no avail. The ban was final and was expected to come into force in January.\n\nBut like a beacon of hope, Trump won the presidential elections and announced that he might keep TikTok around for a little while longer.\n\nTrump said that during his election campaign, he went on TikTok and the results were beyond imagination. He got billions of views which in turn delivered him a massive young user base.\n\n\u201cMaybe we have to keep this sucker around for a little while,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also argued that banning TikTok will primarily benefit Meta and its social media platforms \u2013 Facebook and Instagram. Both of these apps already have a lot of influence on the public, banning TikTok which is the only strong rival at the moment will further strengthen their monopoly.\n\nHowever, preventing the ban won\u2019t be as easy as it sounds. The ban enjoyed rare bipartisan support, so even with all the influence Trump has, repealing it through congressional vote seems difficult.\n\nThe best way forward for both TikTok and Trump would be to approach the Supreme Court and convince it to rule in their favor.\n\nMeta-Owned WhatsApp Wins the Pegasus Spyware Case Against NSO Group\n\nA US Judge ruled in favor of WhatsApp, stating that the Israeli commercial spyware vendor NSO Group indeed breached laws (both federal laws and WhatsApp\u2019s terms of services) by using WhatsApp to inflect devices with the Pegasus spyware.\n\nThe group infected a total of 1,400 users. Out of these 1,400, there were at least 100 human rights defenders, politicians, diplomats, journalists, and government officials.\n\nThe historic ruling was announced by a Northern California federal judge Phyllis Hamiltonon Friday, five years after the lawsuit was originally filed.\n\nWhatsapp claimed that the group exploited a vulnerability in its audio-calling feature. The group readily agreed to this claim, that it might have reverse-engineered/decompiled the Whatsapp software. However, its main argument in the case was whether it did so before agreeing to the terms of services of the app.\n\nThe judge responded that it is common sense for the group to accept the terms of services before accessing the app. There\u2019s no other way around.\n\nThe group also argued that Pegasus is actually a helpful software and has previously helped law enforcement authorities fight crime. But this time around, it failed to produce the documents the court asked for.\n\nThis includes internal communication and its source code. In short, the group couldn\u2019t prove that its actions were lawful. Hence it will be treated as an attack on the privacy of the affected users.\n\nThe group didn\u2019t make any further comments but Meta is rejoiced to hear this verdict. A spokesperson said that this ruling should act as a warning to other spyware makers that their illegal activities won\u2019t be spared.\n\nBiden Launched a New Probe Into Chinese Chips Trade, Will Hand It Off to Trump\n\nOn Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was launching a last-minute investigation into legacy Chinese semiconductors that might be breaking competition laws.\n\nThe investigation will be carried out under Section 301 of the US Trade Act and initially focus on the so-called \u201cfoundational\u201d semiconductors which power everything starting from household appliances to telecom equipment and defense systems.\n\nIf the investigation finds China guilty of breaking competition laws, there will be severe consequences including stricter restrictions and higher tariffs on all kinds of chips imported from China.\n\nSpeaking about the same, the US Trade Representative\u2019s office said that China has a habit of using non-market practices to target the chip industry and establish its dominance in it. Such behavior is extremely harmful to the competition and creates dangerous dependencies in the global supply chain.\n\nThis is the US\u2019s latest blow to China\u2019s technical industry. Up until now, most of its attention was on the supply of advanced chips from the US to China that might help the latter build powerful AI systems.\n\nThe government also imposed higher tariffs on electrical vehicles imported from China and there\u2019s also the impending ban on China\u2019s biggest social media platform TikTok.\n\nOverall, the Biden administration hasn\u2019t been very kind to China. But now that Trump will take over the White House, the responsibility of this probe will go into his hands so we are yet to see how he handles the US ties with China.\n\nAdd Techreport to Your Google News Feed Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

            "article_content": "New Delhi, Dec 26 (PTI) As technological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, Indian pharmaceutical industry is set for a 'profound transformation' in 2025 with innovation, wider global access and improvement in quality becoming key themes for the future.\n\nThe industry, which is expected to grow nearly two-fold to around USD 130 billion in size by 2030, is looking to take advantage of conducive policies, demographic and digital talent, in making India play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all.\n\nCurrently accounting for around 20 per cent of the overall generic drug sales globally, the Indian pharma industry is focussing on research excellence and innovation in order to position the country as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"The Indian pharma market is expected to move up to USD 120-130 billion by 2030 from the current size of USD 58 billion. Initiatives in terms of quality, innovation and wider global reach will help the Indian pharma sector to realise the potential,\" according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain.\n\nGiven the conducive policies and the advantage of demographic and digital talent, India will play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all in years to come, he added.\n\nIPA represents 23 leading research-based Indian pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, among others.\n\nJain said innovation will continue to be a major focus for the industry going forward.\n\nHe noted that the government is expected to soon announce the operational details of the Promotion of Research & Innovation Programme which would also spur innovation.\n\nElaborating on the initiatives lined up in the private sector, he said that leading companies are increasing their focus on specialty portfolios and diversifying into higher-value drugs.\n\n\"Additionally, the industry is set to make notable progress in areas such as CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA vaccines, and the development of complex molecules, which hold immense potential for driving future growth,\" Jain said.\n\nBesides, the patent expiries of blockbuster biologics by 2025 present a significant growth avenue in the global biosimilars market, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai said the industry is set for a profound transformation in 2025.\n\nTechnological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine are set to revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, he said.\n\nOPPI represents research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.\n\nBesides, strengthened regulatory frameworks will enable the swift adoption of innovative therapies while prioritising patient safety, Matai said.\n\n\"A focus on research excellence and innovation will position India as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals. Collaboration between policymakers, academia and industry stakeholders will address unmet medical needs, particularly in underserved regions,\" he stated.\n\nAlso, adherence to Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) will uphold ethical standards, fostering trust and transparency across the healthcare ecosystem, Matai stated.\n\nReflecting on the year gone by, Jain said 2024 has been a year of building on a robust foundation with sustainable growth and thrust on simplifying regulations and harmonisation with global standards.\n\nThe PLI (production linked incentive) schemes have started seeing dividends with the launch of greenfield projects for the production of Penicillin G and Clavulanic acid, among others.\n\nMatai noted that the notification of the Patent (Amendment) Rules 2024, waivers for Phase 3 clinical trials for certain categories of drugs already approved in well-regulated markets, and the much-awaited Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states reflect India's progressive strides toward creating a dynamic, globally competitive pharmaceutical sector that is driven by innovation.\n\nCommenting on the healthcare segment, Fortis Healthcare MD & CEO Ashutosh Raghuvanshi said that the hospital market is projected to grow from nearly USD 99 billion in 2023 to an estimated USD 194 billion by 2032.\n\n\"Our sector is not only expanding but evolving to meet the diverse needs of our population. This year has been particularly significant as hospitals have emerged as the leading recipients of foreign direct investment within the healthcare landscape,\" he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the industry must focus on several key trends that will shape the future of healthcare in India, Raghuvanshi said.\n\n\"The ageing population will drive demand for specialised geriatric care, while a growing emphasis on preventive care will shift our focus from merely treating illness to promoting wellness,\" he stated.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and telemedicine will enhance diagnostic precision and operational efficiency, ultimately improving patient outcomes, he added.\n\nCommenting on the medtech sector, Poly Medicure MD Himanshu Baid said it is imperative for companies to step up their investments in R&D and innovation to sustain growth momentum.\n\n\"The future belongs to those who can develop transformative technologies that address the healthcare needs of a dynamic and diverse world. With initiatives like the new medical devices scheme and a favourable regulatory environment providing the necessary foundation, India is well-positioned to expand its influence globally,\" he added.\n\nAs the market is expected to reach USD 50 billion by FY30, the med-tech industry's growth story reflects the power of collaboration and self-reliance, he added.\n\nMetropolis Healthcare Promoter and Executive Chairperson Ameera Shah said as the diagnostics industry progresses from USD 13 billion in FY23 towards an expected USD 25 billion by FY28, it is fuelled by increasing awareness of preventive healthcare, an aging population, and broader insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, the path forward demands a strategic focus on technology, accessibility, and collaboration, she added.\n\nThe future of diagnostics lies in embracing genomics, digitalisation and technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data analytics, Shah said."

            "article_content": "Geoffrey Seiler\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhen it came to artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in 2024, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reigned supreme. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) will be looking to challenge the chipmaker in 2025.\n\nBoth stocks have had strong runs in 2024, with Nvidia's stock up over 170% year to date as of this writing and Broadcom up around 107%. Let's consider which semiconductor stock looks like the better buy heading into 2025.\n\nAI infrastructure growth\n\nSince the start of the AI boom, Nvidia has been the biggest winner. As the maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) the company's chips became the backbone of AI infrastructure. Training large language models (LLMs) and running AI inference take a lot of computing power, and GPUs have proven to be the best chips for these tasks as they are able to perform many calculations at the same time in what is called parallel processing.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, became the market leader in GPUs due to its CUDA software platform. The company originally developed the free software to allow developers to program its chips for tasks beyond speeding up the graphics rendering in things like video games, the job for which they were initially created, in order to sell more chips. As a result, CUDA became the program on which developers learned to train GPUs, which is what has helped create the large moat the company sees today. It currently has about a 90% market share in GPUs as a result.\n\nThe combination of its powerful GPUs and wide moat due to CUDA led the company to see astronomical growth as large tech companies race to develop more powerful AI models. Through the first nine months of its fiscal 2025 ending in January 2025, Nvidia's revenue surged 135% to $91.2 billion, while last quarter its revenue soared 94% to $35.1 billion.\n\nWith AI models needing exponentially more computing power as they become more advanced, Nvidia's future growth prospects also look promising. In fact, recent iterations of Alphabet's Llama AI model and xAI's Grok model are being trained using up to 10 times as many GPUs as their predecessors. At the same time, Nvidia's hyperscale customers (those that own huge data centers) have indicated they plan to increase their spending on AI infrastructure next year as they see AI as a generational opportunity. For their part, analysts are projecting the company will grow its revenue by just over 50% next year.\n\nWhile Nvidia is dominating the AI chip space, Broadcom is making inroads by helping customers develop custom AI chips. Its application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, are designed specifically for a customer's precise needs and can help with improved performance and more efficient power consumption.\n\nAlphabet was the first company to use Broadcom's technology and expertise to develop its own custom AI chip. The result is a tensor-processing unit (TPU) called Trillium designed specifically to work within Google's TensorFlow (a software library for AI and machine learning). Alphabet said these TPUs have several features, such as a matrix multiply unit (MXU) and proprietary interconnect topology, that differentiate them from mass-merchant GPUs and make them ideal for accelerating AI training and inference.\n\nWhile there were some reports that Alphabet was looking to just go on its own without Broadcom's help, Broadcom won the design contract for the next generation of Alphabet's TPUs. Meanwhile, the company gained four more custom AI chip customers. Meta Platforms and TikTok owner ByteDance are widely believed to be the company's established customers, while OpenAI and more recently Apple are thought to be recent customer wins.\n\nOn its latest earnings call, Broadcom said its three largest custom AI chip customers had an addressable market of between $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone and that they were planning on deploying 1 million of its custom AI chips by 2027. Meanwhile, it said its two newer AI chip customers could add to that total. As a reference, it took Alphabet 15 months to have its custom TPUs designed and deployed within its data centers.\n\nWhile the AI opportunity for Broadcom is large, there is a big difference between an addressable market and expected revenue. The company is also involved in a lot of semiconductor and software businesses outside of AI, which aren't growing as quickly. The company grew organic revenue just 11% last quarter when excluding its acquisition of VMware, and analysts are currently looking for the company to increase its revenue by 18% this fiscal year, ending Oct. 31, 2025, and 14% the year after.\n\nValuation and verdict\n\nNvidia currently trades at a cheaper valuation than Broadcom with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30 compared to over 33 for Broadcom. Meanwhile, Nvidia is currently growing its revenue much faster, which is expected to continue in 2025. In addition, Nvidia holds about $30 billion in net cash, while Broadcom has $48.3 billion in net debt.\n\nBroadcom created a lot of hype with its comments on its AI addressable market, which have powered its stock price in December. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock struggled to close out the year. But while Broadcom grabbed the momentum, Nvidia is now the cheaper stock and it's still expected to grow its revenue much more quickly in the near term.\n\nBroadcom management has certainly put some doubt in investors' minds when it comes to who will be the big AI chip winner in the coming years. But Broadcom's gains won't necessarily come at Nvidia's expense. GPUs still have more versatility than custom chips and are still considered the standard. However, companies also want an option other than Nvidia to make sure it doesn't become too powerful.\n\nI think both stocks have the potential to be winners in 2025, but I prefer Nvidia at this point given its current superior growth and cheaper valuation.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

            "article_content": "The slopes haven\u2019t opened yet at Mt. Holiday, a small ski hill in Traverse City. They\u2019re still building up the base of snow.\n\nJim Pearson, the executive director, has been coming to the slope since he was a teenager in the mid-1980s. And he hopes they\u2019ll have a decent season thanks to some cold nights that have made up for slightly warmer days, a big difference from last season \u2014 northern Michigan\u2019s hottest winter on record.\n\n\u201cAll of it would melt, because it was getting into the 60s, it was 40s at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can compete with that kind of weather.\u201d\n\nWith businesses like Mt. Holiday battered by months of warm weather, the federal government declared a drought in more than 40 Michigan counties, including in Grand Traverse County, where the ski hill is located.\n\nThat allowed Pearson to apply for a federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan through the Small Business Administration, and Mt. Holiday received $480,000 interest-free for a year. It helped meet the payroll and catch up on bills.\n\n\u201cEven if we\u2019re not making snow that lasts, we still have to make snow,\u201d he said. That made for expensive electricity bills. \u201cYou have 10 (snow) guns running all night long for two or three days. That\u2019s a lot of power and a lot of expense.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture determines which areas fall under droughts and are available for assistance. But relying on the drought declarations for loans meant some counties that were harmed by the warmer winter, but didn\u2019t have that designation, didn\u2019t qualify for help.\n\nNow, a group of senators from Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota want to expand the program to include a new category of economic disaster: a lack of snow.\n\nHow it would work\n\nThe bill, introduced this September in the U.S. Senate, is called the Winter Recreation Small Business Recovery Act. It would make a small tweak to the language of the existing program.\n\nElected officials have pushed for such steps before; last spring, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on the federal government to provide more options, saying businesses struggling with warm winters didn\u2019t have a good way to access federal relief.\n\nThe idea is to ensure that businesses harmed by winters like the last one are able to get help. Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, was not made available for an interview with IPR. In a news release, he said Michigan had \u201clost millions of dollars in revenue,\u201d and that ski hills had lost about $41 million and laid off thousands of employees.\n\n\u201cNo one had really contemplated the fact that a lack of snow and ice was a different kind of drought,\u201d said Brad Garmon, the executive director of the state\u2019s Outdoor Recreation Industry Office within the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.\n\nThe existing drought declaration doesn\u2019t work for many businesses that rely on snow. And while organizations and governments need long-term strategies to deal with a changing climate, Garmon said expanding the loan program would help make distribution of these funds more equitable.\n\nThe program \u201cwas so unevenly accessible and we had businesses that could need it but couldn\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is a fix to one particular tool. It\u2019s not the fix, necessarily, for everything that we\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nClimate trends are pointing to warmer winters for places such as northern Michigan.\n\nSteven Dundas, an environmental economist and associate professor at Oregon State University who studies the intersection of economy and climate, agreed this kind of loan program helps in the short term but said that with \u201cmost climate models predicting reduced snowpack moving forward, this, to me, seems like a short-run fix for a long-run problem.\u201d\n\nEstimating how climate change could reshape the recreation economy is difficult, Dundas said; the range of factors and potential outcomes makes it hard to draw neat conclusions. For instance, warmer springs and falls could allow for certain outdoor activities to rise in some areas.\n\nStill, the effects of unpredictable winters and low snow can be devastating. Dundas pointed to a 2022 study published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management that gathered national data from short-term rentals like AirBnBs near ski resorts and correlated it to snowpack.\n\n\u201cThey suggest ski areas could see visitation drops around 60 percent with billions of dollars in annual damages,\u201d he said, with the authors predicting declines of 40 to 60% by the end of the century. Much of that is concentrated in Utah and California, but while the results varied widely by state, the study found places like Michigan could lose tens of millions of dollars in revenue from recreation each year.\n\nDundas said expanding the SBA loan program would help prepare for unusual weather rather than long-term shifts in the climate.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill is perfect for a weather shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we anticipate that that weather shock is going to become more common as climate changes, that requires kind of a little bit more out of the box thinking about policies that can help incentivize adaptation and resilience in these communities, rather than a boom-and-bust climate cycle with snowpack.\u201d\n\nSome left behind, this time\n\nFor many who depend on winter weather for their livelihood, even a small fix can make a big difference.\n\nThe Senate bill is trying to reach people like Dax Richer, one of the new owners of Ruth Lake Resort, in the Upper Peninsula\u2019s Baraga County. That county was not under a drought declaration, even though they didn\u2019t get enough snow to bring in many visitors, so his resort was not eligible for those federal loans.\n\n\u201cWe had absolutely no one stay at the resort during the winter months during our first year of owning it,\u201d he said. Richer and his husband were expecting to make about $125,000 this year. They made less than half that, around $47,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely confused why our county, in the middle of all these other counties that received support, was singled out to not receive it.\u201d\n\nAnd while summers are still busy, if tourism doesn\u2019t work out, he said, they might turn the resort into long-term housing.\n\nBack at Mt. Holiday, the fragrance of burning wood drifts from a sauna trailer whose owner rents space in the parking lot, just one of the changes they\u2019ve made in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be out here, hiking, biking. I want to do concerts, running events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in partnership with East Bay Township to expand those trails. Hopefully that\u2019ll start this summer.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re looking at a new norm, Pearson said, so they\u2019re hedging their bets.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInterlochen Public Radio\u2019s Claire Keenan-Kurgan contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Tony Velleca, CEO of CyberProof, a UST company, shared his insights on the challenges of implementing zero-trust security in multi-cloud environments. As organizations navigate the complexities of managing multiple cloud providers, Velleca emphasized the importance of achieving unified visibility, policy enforcement, and continuous monitoring to protect sensitive data and prevent cyber threats.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMulti-cloud environments present significant hurdles for organizations looking to implement a zero-trust security model. The complexity of managing diverse cloud platforms with varying security configurations, identity management systems, and access controls creates gaps in policy enforcement and visibility. For organizations adopting zero-trust in multi-cloud setups, achieving consistent security across these platforms demands automation, continuous monitoring, and real-time threat detection.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhat unique challenges do multi-cloud environments pose for companies adopting a zero-trust security model?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn multi-cloud environments, the complexity of managing identities, policies, and access controls across diverse platforms makes implementing a zero-trust security model a distinct challenge. Each cloud provider has unique security configurations, identity management systems, and data protection protocols, so enforcing policies consistently \u2014 not to mention achieving complete visibility is no mean feat. It can be tough to achieve continuous monitoring and validation of users, devices and network traffic across disparate clouds, or it can require significant overheads spent on integration.\n\nAdditionally, as data across multiple clouds can be fragmented, there is an increased risk of misconfigurations and inconsistent security practices, potentially leading to gaps in the zero-trust model. Inter-cloud communication is another hurdle, and managing secure connections and encrypted traffic between clouds demands additional controls and oversight.\n\nHow are you helping clients integrate zero-trust principles with their existing cloud security frameworks?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSuccessfully adopting zero-trust for multi-cloud requires unified visibility, automated policy enforcement, and a strong understanding of each provider\u2019s unique security ecosystem. At CyberProof, we start with in-depth assessment of each client\u2019s cloud architecture and existing policies, identifying gaps and vulnerabilities. We are partnered with Wiz for cloud detection and response, and integrate CTEM like Interpres Security to map threats to defence gaps.\n\nThe identity of users and their posture is a key component of this. We then map out a zero-trust model that aligns with the infrastructure, so access controls, identity management and threat detection are applied consistently and without gaps across multi-cloud.\n\nReactive security keeps you two steps behind, so regular threat hunting and vulnerability assessments are also essential. Proactively seeking out threats helps to uncover any potential risks, and reinforces the strategies in place for incident response.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMoving forward, we leverage automation, orchestration and continuous monitoring to enforce zero-trust policies, using real-time identity verification and behavioural analysis to detect potential threats. Threat intelligence and advanced analytics provide visibility over network traffic and access \u2014 even across a multi-cloud reality. We\u2019ve found this approach allows clients to adopt zero-trust principles without the need to overhaul existing security investments.\n\nWhat role do AI and machine learning play in enabling zero-trust architectures within multi-cloud frameworks?\n\nForrester and many other analysts are already touting the benefits of AI and machine learning in enhancing cloud security use cases such as real-time threat detection, user behaviour analysis, and automated response. In a zero-trust model, continuous monitoring and verification of all users and devices are critical, and AI-driven analytics enable this by detecting deviations from normal behaviour patterns that could indicate insider threats or account takeovers.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMachine learning algorithms can analyse vast amounts of data from multiple cloud environments to identify patterns and detect anomalies faster and more accurately than traditional methods. This capability is especially valuable in multi-cloud settings, where data is distributed, and access requests occur across diverse platforms. Additionally, AI-powered automation can enforce zero-trust policies by instantly verifying identity and access permissions and triggering response actions in real time to minimize potential risks.\n\nCould you discuss any specific zero-trust solutions or services your company offers that address the challenges of multi-cloud data protection?\n\nOur end-to-end Zero Trust Security solution is designed to meet a critical need in any organization\u2019s cybersecurity perimeter. We use the \u2018never trust, always verify\u2019 principle to enforce rigorous security controls for all users, anywhere. Features include continuous authentication, least-privilege access controls, and micro-segmentation to protect crown jewel assets, including sensitive data, network access, and cloud environments.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAccording to Tony Velleca, CEO of CyberProof, a UST company, \u2018A well-planned zero-trust strategy is essential for mitigating the risks associated with multi-cloud environments and improving overall security posture.\u2019\n\nAcross a multi-cloud environment, the risks to data are manifold, including unauthorized access, data leakage, corruption, and cyberthreats. We offer a wide range of data protection services depending on the business context, including data risk assessment and consulting, data discovery and classification, data loss prevention and access control, data integrity and usage monitoring, a range of security audits, and data archiving and destruction.\n\nWhat strategies or tools do you recommend for organizations struggling with secure identity and access management across different cloud providers?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWe would always recommend adopting a unified identity and access management (IAM) strategy that includes centralized policy enforcement, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and advanced behavioural analytics.\n\nTools like Azure AD, Okta, or AWS IAM simplify secure access control across multi-cloud environments. Mapping threat actors as well as how organizations are mapping threat actor campaigns to gaps in their defence infrastructure is also fundamental. With this in place, Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services then integrate with IAM and CTEM tools to monitor and respond to access anomalies in real-time. By centralizing IAM policies and leveraging AI-driven insights, you can streamline secure access, even across diverse cloud providers.\n\nHow can companies measure the success of zero-trust implementation in a multi-cloud setup?\n\nCreating and assessing KPIs at a regular cadence is crucial to measuring the success of a zero-trust implementation and refining and iterating it over time. Three examples of metrics which can be used are:\n\n\u2022 Failed or blocked access attempts: Tracking the reduction in unauthorized access, including unauthorized login attempts across cloud environments can uncover how strong IAM control mechanisms are.\n\n\u2022 Mean-time-to-Detect (MTTD): How quickly are potential threats being identified and mitigated? The shorter the response time, the more effective the monitoring and automated response processes are likely to be.\n\n\u2022 Policy compliance rate: Across all cloud environments, how consistently are access policies being followed? If you note compliance violations or deviations from your baseline access policies, zero trust integration is not yet fully effective.\n\nWhat are the best practices for incident detection and response under a zero-trust framework?\n\nIn a zero-trust environment, effective incident detection and response relies on the ability to continuously monitor, receive real-time analytics, and enforce automated containment of threats. There can be no gaps \u2014 zero-trust requires all traffic, user behaviours, and device activities to be continuously monitored. Behavioural analytics are powerful here; identifying threats before they can add business risk.\n\nWhen a threat is identified, automated containment like blocking malicious IP addresses or isolating compromised accounts should be part of response workflows, which means negligible time between detection and mitigation. In a complex multi-cloud set-up, a unified security platform that ensures consistent policies are applied is crucial and allows for rapid detection even in a heterogeneous context.\n\nReactive security keeps you two steps behind, so regular threat-hunting and vulnerability assessments are also essential. Proactively seeking out threats helps to uncover any potential risks, and reinforces the strategies in place for incident response.\n\nIn your experience, what are the most common pitfalls organizations face with zero trust in multi-cloud deployments?\n\nAccording to Microsoft, 85% of organizations already have a multi-cloud approach, and zero trust is one of their recommended best practices for threat protection and hardening overall security posture. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy! Each cloud provider has its own unique configuration, which means uniform security policies can be a struggle.\n\nThe challenge of managing identities across multi-cloud means there is an added risk of misconfigured permissions or unauthorized access. I\u2019ve seen organizations suffer from inconsistent policy enforcement across clouds, grapple with identity management challenges, and even after heavy architecture changes \u2014 contend with limited visibility across platforms.\n\nImplementing zero trust in a multi-cloud environment starts with visibility, centralizing your view of all activities across all cloud assets \u2014 without gaps. This can strengthen zero-trust efforts, alongside policy alignment, intelligent integrations, and continuous monitoring."

            "article_content": "NASA astronauts Don Pettit (left) and Suni Williams, flight engineer and mission commander, respectively, for the space agency\u2019s Expedition 72, are two of seven International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers celebrating the holidays from orbit this year. [Courtesy: NASA]\n\nInternational Space Station (ISS) astronauts spend the winter holiday season orbiting hundreds of miles above family and friends. But that\u2019s not enough to kill the holiday spirit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great time of year up here. We get to spend it with all of our \u2018family\u2019 up on the International Space Station,\u201d said Suni Williams, commander of NASA\u2019s Expedition 72, in a video message beamed from the ISS on December 23.\n\nWilliams and NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore comprise the crew of the space agency\u2019s Boeing Starliner crew flight test (CFT)\u2014an intended eight-day mission that ballooned to eight months following complications with the Starliner spacecraft. During their extended stay, the astronauts have feasted on irradiated turkey and freeze-dried potatoes for Thanksgiving and even cast ballots in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThis week, Williams, Wilmore, and five other ISS occupants celebrated Christmas from orbit as American astronauts have done every year since 1999. According to a NASA blog post, each astronaut gets time in private to speak with family and friends before rejoining their crewmembers to continue experiments and station maintenance. And, of course, they come together for a holiday feast.\n\nThe first crew to spend Christmas in space comprised Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders in 1968. As they circled the moon on Christmas Eve, they beamed some of the earliest images of the rocky lunar surface back to Earth during a reading from the Bible\u2019s Book of Genesis. An estimated 1 billion listeners, or about one-quarter of the planet\u2019s population at the time, tuned in to the broadcast.\n\nThe crew of 1968\u2019s Apollo 8 mission built a homemade Christmas tree using leftover food containers and decals. [Courtesy: NASA]\n\nIn December 1973, the crew of Skylab 4, on a mission to the first American space station, used empty food containers and decals to build and ornament a makeshift Christmas tree, complete with a cardboard comet topper. After stepping out into the vacuum of space for a few hours to watch a passing comet, the astronauts returned to Skylab to eat fruitcake, open gifts, and call their families.\n\nThe first Hanukkah in space came a few decades later in 1993 when NASA\u2019s Jeffrey Hoffman, on a mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope, celebrated with a menorah and dreidel he brought from home. Unfortunately, a dreidel spinning in zero gravity cannot land on any of its faces, making for an uneventful dreidel game.\n\nAstronauts also cannot light candles in space, but in 2023, ISS astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli improvised by pinning felt lights to a menorah made by her family.\n\nJasmin Moghbeli, flight engineer for NASA\u2019s Expedition 70, brought a felt menorah and dreidel to space to celebrate Hanukkah. [Courtesy: NASA]\n\nSince 1999\u2014when the space shuttle Discovery\u2019s STS-130 crew dined on duck foie gras, cassoulet, and salted pork\u2014at least one American has rung in the holidays from space. Since 2000, ISS crews have beamed a holiday \u201cgoodwill message\u201d back to Earth.\n\nThis year, the station\u2019s seven occupants showed off their prepackaged feast and festive cabin decor\u2014including floating candy canes and a fun-sized Christmas tree\u2014as they addressed family, friends, and the hundreds of personnel at NASA mission control who will also spend the holidays away from loved ones.\n\n\u201cDuring Christmas time, the holiday season, it\u2019s about spending time with friends and family and loved ones,\u201d said Nick Hague, commander of NASA\u2019s SpaceX Crew-9 mission and flight engineer for Expedition 72. \u201cThis year, we\u2019re going to be in orbit away from them. So we want to send our heartfelt Merry Christmas, and we hope you have a wonderful holiday.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The end of the year typically brings with it an emotional look back at the days gone by. For archaeologists, looking back into the past is pretty much an every day thing. That said, here are 10 of the most interesting archeological findings that Popular Science covered this year.\n\nNeanderthals and early humans intermingled Europe earlier\n\nStone tools from the Lincombian\u2013Ranisian\u2013Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture uncovered at Ranis. Item 1 is a partial bifacial blade point characteristic of the LRJ. Item 2 also contains finely made bifacial leaf points. CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area. CREDIT: NASA / ISSAP\n\nThe icy cold reaches of space is not exactly the first place to come to mind for archaeological discoveries. That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens. While it is only an initial survey into this subject matter, it\u2019s the first of its kind to document how humans adapt to a novel environment completely removed from what we as a species evolved to handle.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Scientists have long known that light can sometimes appear to exit a material before entering it -- an effect dismissed as an illusion caused by how waves are distorted by matter.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Toronto, through innovative quantum experiments, say they have demonstrated that \"negative time\" is not just a theoretical idea -- it exists in a tangible, physical sense, deserving closer scrutiny.\n\nThe findings, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, have attracted both global attention and skepticism.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these perplexing results highlight a peculiar quirk of quantum mechanics rather than a radical shift in our understanding of time.\n\n\"This is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor specializing in experimental quantum physics.\n\nWhile the term \"negative time\" might sound like a concept lifted from science fiction, Steinberg defends its use, hoping it will spark deeper discussions about the mysteries of quantum physics.\n\nYears ago, the team began exploring interactions between light and matter.\n\nWhen light particles, or photons, pass through atoms, some are absorbed by the atoms and later re-emitted. This interaction changes the atoms, temporarily putting them in a higher-energy or \"excited\" state before they return to normal.\n\nIn research led by Daniela Angulo, the team set out to measure how long these atoms stayed in their excited state. \"That time turned out to be negative,\" Steinberg explained -- meaning a duration less than zero.\n\nTo visualize this concept, imagine cars entering a tunnel: before the experiment, physicists recognized that while the average entry time for a thousand cars might be, for example, noon, the first cars could exit a little sooner, say 11:59 am. This result was previously dismissed as meaningless.\n\nWhat Angulo and colleagues demonstrated was akin to measuring carbon monoxide levels in the tunnel after the first few cars emerged and finding that the readings had a minus sign in front of them.\n\nThe experiments, conducted in a cluttered basement laboratory bristling with wires and aluminum-wrapped devices, took over two years to optimize. The lasers used had to be carefully calibrated to avoid distorting the results.\n\nStill, Steinberg and Angulo are quick to clarify: no one is claiming time travel is a possibility. \"We don't want to say anything traveled backward in time,\" Steinberg said. \"That's a misinterpretation.\"\n\nThe explanation lies in quantum mechanics, where particles like photons behave in fuzzy, probabilistic ways rather than following strict rules.\n\nInstead of adhering to a fixed timeline for absorption and re-emission, these interactions occur across a spectrum of possible durations -- some of which defy everyday intuition.\n\nCritically, the researchers say, this does not violate Einstein's theory of special relativity, which dictates that nothing can travel faster than light. These photons carried no information, sidestepping any cosmic speed limits.\n\nThe concept of \"negative time\" has drawn both fascination and skepticism, particularly from prominent voices in the scientific community.\n\nGerman theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, for one, criticized the work in a YouTube video viewed by over 250,000 people, noting, \"The negative time in this experiment has nothing to do with the passage of time -- it's just a way to describe how photons travel through a medium and how their phases shift.\"\n\nAngulo and Steinberg pushed back, arguing that their research addresses crucial gaps in understanding why light does not always travel at a constant speed.\n\nSteinberg acknowledged the controversy surrounding their paper's provocative headline but pointed out that no serious scientist has challenged the experimental results.\n\n\"We've made our choice about what we think is a fruitful way to describe the results,\" he said, adding that while practical applications remain elusive, the findings open new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena.\n\n\"I'll be honest, I don\u2019t currently have a path from what we've been looking at toward applications,\" he admitted. \"We're going to keep thinking about it, but I don't want to get people's hopes up.\""

            "article_content": "Home Opinion 2024: The year tide turned on radical gender ideology\n\nWhat is a woman? This is the question that was posed by U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn to then-nominee for the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings. By not providing a simple answer based on basic biology and instead deflecting to the role of an impartial judge, Jackson revealed something that contributed to the turning point regarding transgender ideology that we have witnessed in 2024.\n\nAs a woman herself, no one reasonably thinks Justice Jackson is unable to offer a definition of what constitutes a woman. But feeling the need to avoid responding in a direct fashion was a signal that Jackson, personally in that moment, had prioritized bowing to the bizarre and ever-changing cultural definitions of gender instead of a straightforward acknowledgement of what we all know to be true about the two sexes.\n\nFor many Americans, that a judge who is supposed to make decisions based on reality and facts would shy away from that in an answer, was the latest example of just how far down the path of insanity our culture had strayed\u2014and they wanted no more of it. This is especially the case as it relates to children.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post.

And for a large portion of voters, President Trump represented the change they were seeking. An astounding 70% of Concerned Women of America exit poll participants said \u201cTrump\u2019s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls and women\u2019s sports and of trans boys and men using girls and women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d was an important issue for them when voting.\n\nBut to simply read this dynamic shift in the last two years through a political lens is to miss the ways the tide has turned for parents, within families, and in communities\u2014both here in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nA quick glance at the state of today\u2019s youth reveals a troubling picture: a mental health crisis exacerbated by social media overuse; rising rates of depression, particularly among teenage girls; and a deepening sense of alienation among young men, sometimes culminating in violent outbursts. These challenges are compounded by cultural shifts catalyzed by the sexual revolution\u2014shifts that push the fictional narrative that a boy can become a girl and vice versa.\n\nFor decades, this progressive ideological push seemed unstoppable, especially for children. Yet, this year has brought a surprising and significant pushback, suggesting a return to biological reality is in order.\n\nIn April, the Cass Review, a study commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service, delivered a damning critique of puberty blockers and gender transition surgeries for children. The report highlighted the lack of scientific evidence supporting these practices, and its findings were affirmed across the political spectrum in the U.K. The fallout was swift, with U.K. policymakers reassessing the medical and ethical implications of such interventions.\n\nLater this year, the controversy surrounding trans-identifying biological males competing in women\u2019s sports came to the forefront in the United States. San Jose State\u2019s volleyball team was credited with multiple forfeit victories after teams in the Mountain West Conference boycotted games against them for including a biological male who identifies as female. This incident underscored the tensions and practical challenges of enforcing fairness in sports under the banner of gender inclusivity.\n\nIn December, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Skrmetti, a case centered on a Tennessee law banning gender transition \u201ctreatments\u201d for minors. Tennessee is one of 26 states to enact such legislation, citing insufficient scientific support for these interventions and evidence of significant harm. While predicting a result based on oral arguments is often a fool\u2019s errand, a majority of justices appeared reluctant to overturn Tennessee\u2019s ban and instead may recognize the importance of the state\u2019s role in protecting children from harm.\n\nFinally, just a week ago, the U.K. extended its prohibition on the sale of puberty blockers for minors, with a legislative review set for 2027. This marks yet another step in the growing global resistance to radical gender ideology.\n\nWithout a doubt, our society remains largely libertine, adhering to the belief that \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t harm anyone, anything goes.\u201d However, the question of harm \u2014particularly when it comes to children \u2014is now being scrutinized more closely. Though I would articulate my objections about transgender ideology for any age or for any context, it\u2019s one thing for adults to subject themselves to radical \u201ctreatments;\u201d it\u2019s another thing entirely when that is forced upon innocent children \u2014and asking society at large to just acquiesce to this.\n\n\n\nWhen children undergo these radical \u201ctreatments,\u201d the harmful effects spread to how we interact and live with one another. When a teenage girl loses her spot on the podium because she\u2019s competing against a biological male in a swimming meet; or when a child comes home and describes his interaction with a child of a different gender in the locker room; or when a mom feels unsafe in a restroom facility at the mall, what might feel abstract or distant becomes deeply personal when it impacts one\u2019s own family.\n\nThe key, however, is not merely to critique what is wrong but to present a positive and hopeful vision. Christians can point to the beauty of the family and a perspective that respects the God-created natural distinctions between male and female, that values the body as an integral part of personhood, and that sees human sexuality as a reflection of divine intent rather than personal whim. And we can do this even while acknowledging some individuals may feel a disconnect about how they perceive themselves. They are in need of support and care, not extreme experimentations that so often lead to destructive results\u2014for them personally and people around them.\n\nIf 2024 has taught us anything, it is that cultural change is possible. The backlash against radical gender ideology suggests that people are hungry for a better story\u2014one that affirms their worth, their bodies, and their God-given identity."
