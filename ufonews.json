If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nWith its first to in over a decade, the company is adding some features to its apps, including Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. Copilot AI can summarize text or rewrite it in a different tone, suggest Excel formulas based on your data, create presentations around a prompt, and more. Those features incur a $3 monthly increase, bringing the prices of Personal and Family plans up to $99.99 and $129.99 per year, respectively.\n\nBut if you're an existing Microsoft 365 subscriber who doesn't want anything to do with AI, you can keep your current pricing...for now. These cheaper plans are called Microsoft 365 Personal Classic ($69.99 per year) and Family Classic ($99.99 per year). With these subscriptions, you still get access to all of Microsoft's top-notch desktop productivity apps, 1TB of OneDrive storage per user, the Microsoft Defender security suite (which includes VPN, identity theft protection, and dark web monitoring features), and an ad-free email account.\n\nHow to Switch to a Microsoft 365 Classic Plan\n\nMicrosoft doesn't make the process of switching to a Classic version as straightforward as it could be, so we detail all the steps below, followed by answers to some questions you might have:\n\n1. Start to Cancel Your Existing Subscription\n\nThis might sound ominous, especially if you store important documents on OneDrive. But stay with us; your documents aren\u2019t going anywhere (unless you completely cancel the account). Start by going to your Microsoft account\u2019s Subscriptions page. Find your Microsoft 365 subscription, choose Manage subscription, and click on Cancel subscription. (The Switch plan option lets you change only between annual and monthly payments.)\n\n2. Choose a Classic Plan\n\nA scary warning appears at the top of the Cancel page, explaining how you\u2019ll lose everything in your OneDrive storage if you cancel. Again, you don't need to worry. Scroll down past the option to switch to monthly payments to find the Classic options\u2014they appear next to your current subscription. Note that since I have an existing Family plan, I can also downgrade to a Personal plan. But I can't downgrade to a Personal Classic plan; only existing Personal plan subscribers get that option. If you\u2019re not a current subscriber, you won\u2019t be able to get either Classic plan. Click the Switch Plan option in the Classic box to continue.\n\n3. Confirm Your Purchase\n\nChoose a payment method and then hit Buy. Microsoft won't charge you until your account is due for renewal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to Turn Off Copilot Without Switching Plans\n\nIf you just don't like AI, you can turn off Copilot even when you have a plan that includes it. Microsoft intends to add a clear Enable Copilot checkbox to the Office applications, but you can go to File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Privacy Options > Privacy Settings and uncheck the Connected Experiences checkboxes in the meantime. It\u2019s that arcane, and a simple Enable Copilot checkbox will make this much easier. Be aware that turning off all connected experiences means you lose things like text prediction. You can find a complete list of what this setting controls .\n\nMore Questions About Copilot and Microsoft 365 Classic\n\nCan You Switch Back to a Subscription That Includes Copilot?\n\nYes, you can at any time. Just go back to the subscription page and choose one of the non-Classic options.\n\nDo You Still Get Any Copilot Features for Free If You Switch to Classic?\n\nYes, but not inside the Office applications. To use them, go to copilot.microsoft.com or click on the fancy Copilot icon in the Windows toolbar.\n\nDoes Everyone in a Family Plan Get Copilot Features in the Office Apps?\n\nNo. Only the main account holder in the plan gets the Copilot Pro features.\n\nDoes a Microsoft 365 Subscription Provide the Same Copilot Features as a Copilot Pro Subscription?\n\nNo. With a Microsoft 365 subscription (non-Classic), you get 60 AI credits versus \u201cextensive\u201d credits with Copilot Pro. Microsoft smartly avoids the fraught term unlimited here. What\u2019s a credit? It\u2019s basically any AI text or image generation you request (). With Pro, you also get priority access to the latest AI models (including ChatGPT-4o and more), the ability to craft custom GPTs, and early access to new capabilities like .\n\nGet Lifetime Access to Microsoft Office Apps Instead\n\nIf you're sick of subscriptions, Microsoft offers a of its office suite for both personal ($149.99) and business ($249.99) users. The one-time pricing gets you a single license and continual security patches, but that's it. You won\u2019t get any OneDrive cloud storage beyond the free 5GB, collaborative document editing and sharing, or other features."

            "article_content": "A s a health journalist, I know how difficult it can be to find accurate health information online. In the age of AI-powered search engines, you never quite know if the answers served up to you at the top of the page are from legitimate medical sources or some woo-woo wellness site that hasn't been touched in years. Even in my personal life, it can be tricky to find resources about the conditions I may face as a woman\u2014and I know I'm not alone in that experience.\n\nFrom menstruation to fertility, and yes, even to menopause, there's still so much mystery surrounding women's health. Case in point: More than 1 million Americans go through menopause each year, but studies find that 80 percent of those people have limited knowledge about menopause, never learned about it in school, or have a negative attitude toward the life phase altogether. No wonder so many of us are too embarrassed to bring up our concerns at the OB/GYN, which can lead to gaps in quality care.\n\nThis is where AI\u2014and personalized health advice in the form of an app\u2014can be useful. Meet Roon, an app that partners world-class healthcare providers with artificial intelligence to bridge the divide between people and reliable health information. Recently, Roon launched Roon Menopause\u2014a platform that serves as a digital library for all the menopause questions you may have, from how to tame a hot flash to navigating hormone therapy, with answers from real-life medical experts.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Roon CEO and co-founder Vikram Bhaskaran to learn more about the launch. Here's what to expect once you hit download on iOS.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFirst, what is Roon?\n\nRoon is an app that puts free, expert-driven resources on several health conditions at your fingertips. Conditions featured on the app include ALS, dementia, endometriosis, fertility, glioblastoma, PCOS, and now, menopause. The app was born when Bhaskaran, a former tech developer with Pinterest, became a caregiver for his father with ALS and noticed a disturbing lack of information about the illness online.\n\n\"Like most caregivers on the planet, I spent thousands of hours on Dr. Google, Facebook groups, Instagram, and TikTok to try to find medically vetted information,\" Bhaskaran says. \"When it comes to health, it sometimes feels like we are still in the dark ages.\" But between how long it takes to see a specialist, plus providers only spending about 18 minutes on average with patients per appointment, Bhaskaran says it only makes sense that we turn to the Internet for help.\n\nUsing his tech-savvy and appreciation for beautiful, algorithm-driven apps like Pinterest, Bhaskaran teamed up with his co-founder Rohan Ramakrishna, MD, a neurosurgeon at Weill Cornell, engineers, and designers to develop Roon, which houses hundreds of pre-recorded videos of healthcare providers answering the top questions they get asked every day.\n\nOn top of that, users can also take advantage of the \"ask a question\" search tool to find answers, all with the help of AI technology. (More on this below.)\n\nHow Roon uses AI to provide health information\n\nInstead of gathering answers from all over the Internet like other AI-powered search engines, Roon's \"ask a question\" AI tool only pulls quotes from the pre-recorded content that exists within the app. This ensures you're getting accurate and reliable answers straight from a professional each time you search, and not some unknown source.\n\nOnce your question has been answered, the AI tool auto-populates related questions, which is how the personalization takes shape. \"The more you use it, the more we learn about you so we can ultimately become your personalized guide for health,\" says Bhaskaran. Plus, if you add your age and gender identity, \"we can also personalize content based on where you are in your journey,\" he adds. So, for example, if you're a 40-year-old female who's trying to get pregnant, it might suggest you watch perimenopause or fertility content.\n\nWhile this service doesn't replace the need for real visits with your healthcare provider, it could help those with a lack of access to quality care or insufficient health insurance feel more empowered\u2014and less confused\u2014about their well-being. \"In the age of AI-generated content, we're going the opposite way, which is there's nothing more human than a doctor looking into a camera answering your question when you're going through a hard journey,\" Bhaskaran adds.\n\nOther Roon Menopause features\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about Roon Menopause is its user-friendliness. No matter your level of tech skill, the simple design makes it fairly easy to sift through each tab and section. You can start searching for information based on the type of expert you want to hear from (like a reproductive endocrinologist, OB/GYN, or holistic practitioner), the symptoms you're experiencing (like vaginal dryness, fatigue, or insomnia), co-occurring conditions you may have (like osteoporosis or depression), or other topics, like treatments, diagnosis, causes, and more.\n\nOnce you find a topic you're interested in, you can watch short videos or read written responses from a variety of providers, who Bhaskaran says are not only heavily vetted before joining the app, but are also great communicators with good bedside manner IRL. Some notable names include Mindy Goldman, MD, the chief clinical officer at MIDI Health, Corrine Menn, MD, with Alloy Women's Health, and Rajita Patil, MD, a menopause specialist at UCLA Health, among others.\n\nFrom there, the AI feature will suggest other topics or questions you might ask. Consider it a personal search engine and doctor-filled social feed all in one.\n\nAnd we're not just talking about physical health here: Roon Menopause also spans the mental, emotional, and sexual wellness aspects of menopause. So you may explore topics like \"how to comfortably have sex with vaginal dryness,\" \"how to talk to your partner about menopause,\" or \"how to start your fertility treatment if you're also in perimenopause.\" It also offers tips for optimal nutrition, exercise, holistic vs. traditional medicine practices, and specific treatment options for each menopause symptom you're facing.\n\nHere's more of a breakdown of the features:\n\nExpert network of over 60 licensed healthcare providers\n\nThousands of pre-recorded Q&A videos and written content\n\nApproximately 1,300 answered questions\n\nOver 100 related subtopics\n\nInstant answers through an AI-powered search tool\n\nAdvice from people with lived experience\n\nMultiple expert perspectives on highly debated treatment options (such as hormone therapy)\n\nCulturally sensitive and trauma-informed content\n\nNext-step advice for receiving care\n\nUltimately, Bhaskaran says this service is a safe place to ask the hard questions or ones you may be too uncomfortable to ask your provider about. \"This is just the beginning of how we'll support women across their lifetime health journeys through expert guidance,\" he adds.\n\nYes, it's personal, but is your data safe?\n\nWithin the last few years, some people have shied away from using period tracking apps for fear that their reproductive health information will be shared and sold to third parties or that it would be used against them at healthcare facilities or in legal proceedings. This is because period trackers can not only log menstruation, but also missed periods, miscarriages, and infertility.\n\nBut rest assured that with Roon, the private details you share about your reproductive health stay within the app, and are only used to further optimize your experience, says Bhaskaran. Data is stored locally and never shared with third parties.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere's nothing more comforting than having a trusted healthcare provider's advice by your side\u2014especially during a time like menopause. Whether you're already in it, about to start, or know a loved one currently going through the life phase, apps like Roon Menopause\u2014which combines AI with medically sound information\u2014can cut through the noise, misinformation, or even medical gaslighting you may face, both online and in person.\n\nAdditional Sources + Well+Good articles reference scientific, reliable, recent, robust studies to back up the information we share.

            "article_content": "Scream queens are actresses who have carved a unique niche for themselves as the stars of multiple scary movies. For horror movie fans, scream queens are the genre's iconic heroines who face their fears and scream their lungs out in the process.\n\nFay Wray, who played Ann Darrow in 1933's King Kong, is considered one of cinema's first scream queens. Since then, every decade has beget more horror-movie goddesses, including Psycho\u2018s Janet Leigh, Halloween\u2018s Jamie Lee Curtis, A Nightmare on Elm Street\u2018s Heather Langenkamp, The Ring\u2018s Naomi Watts, and today's Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega.\n\nAll of the following scream queens have made memorable horror films that many of you will probably binge-watch during the Halloween season. Who is the one scream queen to rule them all?\n\nJanet Leigh\n\nImage Credit: Jeweler \u2013 Hitchcock Magazine \u2013 Public Domain/Wiki Commons.\n\nJanet Leigh will forever be remembered as Marion Crane \u2014 the guest stabbed to death in the shower of the Bates Motel \u2014 in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Had Leigh never appeared in another horror movie after Psycho, she would still be scream queen royalty because of that iconic performance.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYears after Psycho, Leigh battled giant rabbits in the 1972 sci-fi horror film Night of the Lepus, which admittedly elicits more giggles than screams. She also starred opposite her daughter and fellow scream queen, Jamie Lee Curtis, in John Carpenter's spooky ghost story The Fog and 1998's Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later. In the latter sequel, Leigh's character drives away in the same car her character drove in Psycho.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis\n\nImage Credit: Compass International Pictures.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of scream queen Janet Leigh, became arguably the most iconic scream of all time by playing Laurie Strode in John Carpenter's 1978 seminal slasher film Halloween. She reprised the role in several sequels, including 2022's Halloween Ends, in which she finishes off boogeyman Michael Myers once and for all.\n\nCurtis followed up Halloween with a string of horror films \u2014 The Fog, Prom Night, and Terror Train \u2014 that cemented her status as a scream queen. Although she stepped away from the horror genre for years to explore comedy and other roles, Curtis never forgot what made her a star. Even when she won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for her role in Everything Everywhere All at Once, she thanked the \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of horror fans who have supported her over the years.\n\nHeather Langenkamp\n\nImage Credit: New Line Cinema.\n\nHorror fans know Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson, the first character to ever defeat dream demon Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Langenkamp reprised her role in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, in which Nancy dies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an ingenious way to resurrect Nancy for the big screen, Langenkamp plays a fictionalized version of herself in 1994's Wes Craven's New Nightmare in which Freddy tries to enter the real world. On-screen, Craven asks Langenkamp if she has \u201cthe courage to play Nancy one last time.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Langenkamp co-owns AFX Studio with her husband and has worked as a special effects makeup coordinator on horror movies such as 2004's Dawn of the Dead and 2012's The Cabin in the Woods.\n\nNeve Campbell\n\nImage Credit: Dimension Films.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeve Campbell has played \u201cfinal girl\u201d Sidney Prescott in five of the six Scream movies, beginning with Wes Craven's 1996 meta classic Scream. Each movie has one or more different people committing murders while dressed as Ghostface, and Sidney grows stronger and more resilient as the sequels continue. Although she sat out Scream VI due to a salary dispute, Campbell is front and center again as the lead in the upcoming Scream VII, directed by original Scream scribe Kevin Williamson.\n\nAside from the Scream movies and her role as a teen witch in the cult favorite The Craft, Campbell has explored other genres in movies such as Wild Things, Skyscraper, and Drowning Mona.\n\nMia Goth\n\nImage Credit: A24.\n\nBritish actress Mia Goth already has a surname that calls forth images of horror movies, dark castles, and Universal monsters, so this is an actress born to make scary films.\n\nGoth made an impression in the 2018 remake of Suspiria, but she cemented her scream queen status by playing the '70s adult-film actress Maxine Minx in Ti West's X. She played the titular character in the prequel Pearl, which is filmed like the Gone With the Wind of horror. In Maxine, the third film in the trilogy, Goth reprises her role as Maxine Minx in 1985 Los Angeles, where Maxine tries to become a Hollywood scream queen as the Night Stalker terrorizes the city.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the X trilogy, Goth also played an off-the-hook character in Brandon Cronenberg's sci-fi horror movie Infinity Pool. Next, Goth lives up to her last name by playing the Bride in Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein.\n\nNaomi Watts\n\nImage Credit: DreamWorks Pictures.\n\nOscar nominee Naomi Watts elevates any movie she's in, making her the best part of dubious horror films such as Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering and Down. Things went up for Watts' career after the latter elevator-horror tale.\n\nAfter proving her range as an actress in David Lynch's nightmarish Mulholland Drive, Watts achieved scream queen status by battling a little black-haired ghost girl who crawls out of TVs in The Ring and The Ring Two. She went on to play Ann Darrow in Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong.\n\nAlthough Watts doesn't limit herself to only the horror genre, she returned to play the titular mother in the 2022 psychological horror film Goodnight Mommy.\n\nBarbara Crampton\n\nImage Credit: Empire International Pictures.\n\nAfter starting out as a soap opera actress, Barbara Crampton committed to full-time scream queen work and never looked back. Crampton played Megan Halsey in Re-Animator, battled malfunctioning security robots in Chopping Mall, earned a Saturn Award nomination for playing Dr. Katherine McMichaels in From Beyond, and made a cameo in the first Puppet Master \u2014 and that was just the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn this century, Crampton continued her reign as one of the most enduring scream queens in history with roles in horror movies such as You're Next, The Lords of Salem, and Beyond the Gates. In 2022's Suitable Flesh, Crampton produced and stars opposite Heather Graham in the body-swapping horror flick.\n\nYou know an actress embraces her status as a scream queen when she attends horror conventions like L.A.'s Monsterpalooza, which Crampton does regularly to meet fans, pose for pictures, and sign autographs.\n\nDanielle Harris\n\nImage Credit: Galaxy Releasing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDanielle Harris started her career as a scream queen early in life by playing Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of Laurie Strode, in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers. Those roles prepped her to play a goth college student in Urban Legend before she returned to play a different character, Annie Brackett, in Rob Zombie's Halloween and Halloween II.\n\nIn the previous decade, Harris carved out a name for herself as an adult scream queen by playing Marybeth Dunston in the Hatchet horror series. In 2024, she joined other scream queens and horror icons in the partially crowdfunded horror movie Stream.\n\nDee Wallace\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros.\n\nMost people remember Dee Wallace as the mom in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, but horror fans revere her as one of the most enduring scream queens in movie history.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Wallace stretched her lungs in horror classics such as The Hills Have Eyes, Cujo, The Howling, and Critters, to name a few. In the 1990s and 2000s, Wallace held on to her scream queen crown with roles in The Frighteners, Popcorn, The House of the Devil, and Rob Zombie's Halloween, in which she plays Cynthia Strode \u2014 the adoptive mother of Laurie Strode.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFrom the 2010s until today, Wallace continued her work in the horror genre in movies such as The Lords of Salem, Red Christmas, Critters Attack!, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, and 13 Fanboy. In the latter meta slasher, Wallace plays herself as she hangs with other scream queens after a horror convention and is targeted by an obsessed fan who wants to re-create their death scenes in real life.\n\nLinda Blair\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros.\n\nLinda Blair will forever be remembered as the possessed Regan MacNeil \u2014 a girl who went from apple-cheeked youth to projectile-vomiting demon \u2014 in The Exorcist, a film many consider the scariest movie of all time. Blair reprised the role for Exorcist II: The Heretic and 2023's The Exorcist: Believer.\n\nAside from The Exorcist, Blair starred in horror movies such as the made-for-TV Summer of Fear, directed by Wes Craven. Craven later gave Blair a cameo role as a pushy reporter in Scream.\n\nVera Farmiga\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nVera Farmiga cemented her status as a scream queen by playing paranormal investigator and self-professed demonologist Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring films, including the spin-off Annabelle Comes Home.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn addition to her numerous appearances as Warren, Farmiga also had lead roles in the horror films Joshua and Orphan. On TV, she played the iconic role of Norma Bates, the mother of Psycho\u2018s Norman Bates, for five seasons on Bates Motel.\n\nMarilyn Burns\n\nImage Credit: Bryanston Distributing Company.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSome of the women horror fans revere as scream queens don't actually scream that much on-screen. This is not the case for Marilyn Burns, who played Sally Hardesty \u2014 the only survivor of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Burns spends the majority of that movie emitting bloodcurdling screams as she is pursued by a chainsaw-wielding maniac named Leatherface and his family of cannibals.\n\nBurns appeared in Hooper's 1977 horror film Eaten Alive and a few other genre pictures, such as 1985's Future-Kill. She reprised her role as Sally with a cameo in 1995's The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and played a different character entirely in 2013's Texas Chainsaw 3D. Burns passed away in Texas in 2014 at age 65.\n\nJenna Ortega\n\nImage Credit: Paramount Pictures.\n\nJenna Ortega is off to a solid start as one of the next generation of scream queens. People probably don't remember that she played a girl named Annie in Insidious: Chapter 2. Nine years later, she played Tara Carpenter in 2022's Scream and barely survived her run-in with Ghostface. She reprised the role in 2023's Scream VI, which moved the action to New York City. The same year as Scream, Ortega also starred opposite fellow scream queen Mia Goth in X.\n\nAfter her dance moves on the Netflix series Wednesday went viral, Ortega became Tim Burton's latest muse. In the director's long-awaited sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Ortega plays Astrid Deetz, the daughter of elder goth Lydia Deetz (Winona Ryder)."

            "article_content": "As a child, Brandon Morris was always afraid of the things he couldn\u2019t understand: the paranormal, UFOs, ghosts. That is until his father told him he should be more fearful of the things he can see. \u201cReal people are scarier than the things that can\u2019t hurt you,\u201d the 24-year-old sculptor recounted as we walked through Europa gallery, swirling with weekend visitors.\n\n\u201cActress,\u201d Morris\u2019s solo debut with the gallery, is an exhibition of haunting sculptural works. The show is now on view at the Lower East Side gallery through February 9. Here, Morris appears to resolve this tension between the immaterial and the real. The show features a series of Ghost Dresses, bespoke phantom gowns sewn from fiberglass fabric and lathered in resin. The garments meander through the space with discomforting grace\u2014one hunched and forlorn, another twisted at the hip, a third more timid, lifting the skirt hem with a gathered sleeve in a half-hearted curtsy. Each of the six dresses amble in an aimless haunt. Their translucent ruffles gleam on absent bodies more lucid than alive, sleepwalkers bound for collision with one another.\n\nThe best of Artnet News in your inbox. Sign up for our daily newsletter.

You have successfully subscribed to Artnet News.\n\nBorn in San Diego to an artist and a mechanical engineer, Morris found himself rapt by the interplay between artistic form and technical finesse. He graduated from Parsons School of Design in 2023 with the understanding that the intricacies of his solitary craft interested him more than a future in the fashion industry. Since then, Morris has set out to resolve the primary concern that has driven his practice thus far, asking himself how garments can take on a life without a human body.\n\nMorris mimics his sculptures\u2019 comportments when describing the work to me. \u201cI wanted them to have character, to show that there\u2019s a person in there you just can\u2019t see. I\u2019ve been interested in creating what you aren\u2019t supposed to see, or something that isn\u2019t supposed to exist,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe silhouettes of Morris\u2019s dresses convey a certain unease: narrow shoulders at an adolescent height, a distortion of proportions that belie recognizable markers of any human developmental stage. Instead, the uncanny shapes draw out ghost stories of the viewer\u2019s own making, or perhaps the warped suspicions of a child. Morris mediates the body at an eerie scale, but beneath the spectral mystique of this menagerie resides an unexpected sense of whimsy.\n\nFor the exhibition, Morris wrote a text available at the gallery, an Introduction to Ghostwear that parodies the pattern-making textbooks he encountered in school. His writing pokes at this pedagogy while giving the viewer a deeper glimpse into his world\u2014a world less frightening than it may at first appear: \u201cOne of the most stimulating aspects of ghostwear is the distinctive green hue that remains the favorite of ghosts every season.\u201d Through their gestures, Morris imbues his ghosts with a quiet impishness, personalities that emphasize the garments\u2019 true utility: providing ghosts with \u201can identity of their own.\u201d\n\nFor Morris, the question of utility\u2014whether hypothetical or pragmatic\u2014seems to inform these objects more deeply than any potential formal concerns. He remains deeply inspired by the words of the late sculptor Eva Hesse, who described the purely decorative as \u201cthe only art of sin\u201d in a 1970 interview. Morris attempts to maintain a focus on function. He is an artist who is driven by ideas first, prioritizing shapes that make his concepts recognizable. \u201cI just want the work to be accessible,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the past, the artist\u2019s work has explored the relationship between function and style through uncanny deconstructions of antique teapots soldered into coagulate mutations of themselves. Throughout these works, Morris appears to be thinking about upholstery through a sartorial lens (or vice versa). He dresses these reconfigured antiques in garments made from wet-formed leather, hand-stitched, nailed, and weathered yet always perfectly tailored to peculiar, bulbous forms. The teapots are charged with animism, like a Venus of Cronenberg. Corsetry and garters are speculative armatures. The edge of a zipper is an open maw, bearing teeth. Here is my handle; here is my spout.\n\nThe works in \u201cActress\u201d appear, then, as an apex to Morris\u2019s conceptual frame brought to the human scale. The Ghost Dresses omit the subject of adornment altogether, figuring what the sculptor calls \u201cthe object of the clothing\u201d itself, autonomous. The figures speak for themselves rather than aid our own self-identifications. Negative space is highlighted in both his ornate teapots and these empty garments. His works are as much defined by their vacuums as they are their enclosures.\n\nAbsence has defined Morris\u2019s practice up to this point: the dearth of information on the artist himself, his aversion to being photographed, the paltry context framing his work. These absences encourage an eerie sentimentality, one that creates space for the viewer to craft their own stories in relation to these objects and their maker.\n\n\u201cActress\u201d is Morris\u2019s second solo exhibition to date. His first, at Gern en Regalia in 2022, featured hand-sewn, patchworked wall works that resemble stretched skin. The meticulously sutured surfaces are at once sinewed and frilly, pulled like preternatural rawhide to hooked points at the edges of metal frames upholstered in leather. The frames stretch to the limit of static decay, bumpy with scars grafted in argyle.\n\nOne of these wall works hangs in the back of Europa, marginalia for the formal conceit that has driven Morris\u2019s explorations thus far. At the other end of the gallery, two new wallworks hang opposite one another.\n\nOn the left, Mara 30 hangs by its own hollow. The five-foot-tall surface is constructed completely out of strips of untreated leather sewn along horizontal seams that break and fray to reveal the absence of a stretcher inside. The piece, named after the type of thread used to construct it, appears as potentially the simplest articulation of Morris\u2019s use of negative space. The thread itself is the formal infrastructure. The rigidity of the leather holds the shape of a canvas, a husk shorn, and restitched for display.\n\nPortrait of Isabella acquiesces on the right. The ornate votive features a woman\u2019s profile in relief on an ornate, corniced frame. The entire structure, a reference to the Victorian cameo, is shrouded in black leather, stitched at seams to highlight the immense detail carved into the wood just below the skin. In this portrait of his girlfriend, Morris reverses the myth of Pygmalion, bringing the romance of his real life into the expansive visual world of his work. He spares few words: \u201cIt\u2019s an altar, a devotion of love.\u201d It seems he\u2019s sacrificed some of his artistic edicts around the \u2018decorative\u2019 in the interest of romance.\n\nThroughout his growing body of work, Morris balances the constraints of the real world with his interest in materiality and mystique. His visual world speaks to surrealist traditions that twist the form and function of the everyday, mobilizing technical skill toward the yet-unrealized functions of our material landscape. In \u201cActress\u201d, Morris offers a reality parallel to ours, one in which ghosts have taste, too."

            "article_content": "Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV \u2014 the infection that can damage the immune system and lead to the deadly disease AIDS \u2014 hasn\u2019t been in the news as much as it was during the beginning of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Still, an estimated 1.3 million new HIV infections were reported around the world in 2023, with 630,000 related deaths, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nRelated Articles Science | Childhood vaccination rates, a rare health bright spot in struggling states, are slipping\n\nChildhood vaccination rates, a rare health bright spot in struggling states, are slipping Science | Biden health officials say they built up US pandemic defenses.

What to know after the first H5N1 death in the US Science | 5 things we know and still don\u2019t know about COVID, 5 years after it appeared Anti-viral treatments for HIV have helped reduce the number of AIDS-associated deaths, and the new HIV infections in 2023 were down from 2.1 million in 2010. But there is no cure for HIV or AIDS or a vaccine for human use to prevent infection.\n\nOne of the labs involved in current research to design such a vaccine is at La Jolla-based Scripps Research, which recently made a discovery that could drive development of the vaccine.\n\nMany vaccines work by introducing a protein to the body that resembles part of a virus. Ideally, the immune system will produce long-lasting antibodies recognizing that virus, thereby providing protection.\n\nBut Scripps Research scientists said they have found that for some HIV vaccines, something else happens. After a few applications, the immune system begins to produce antibodies against immune complexes already bound to the viral protein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique reaction in which antibodies bind to other antibodies, which is rare,\u201d said Scripps researcher Sharidan Brown, first author of a study published Jan. 17 in Science Immunology. \u201cOver the course of multiple immunizations [in animals], we have found four classes of antibodies that cling to other antibodies. They are unique responses, so by understanding the structure for the first time, we are put on the right foot to understand these better and can harness them for not only HIV vaccine design but other therapeutics.\u201d\n\nThe observation came about when researchers in the lab of Andrew Ward, a professor of integrative structural and computational biology at Scripps Research, was using advanced imaging tools to study how antibodies evolve after multiple HIV vaccine doses. A technique the lab invented, known as Electron Microscopy-Based Polyclonal Epitope Mapping, or EMPEM, let the researchers see exactly where on the virus antibodies bind.\n\nWhen they carried out the experiments on blood from animals that had received multiple doses of an experimental HIV vaccine, they discovered that some of the antibodies were not binding directly to the HIV viral antigen but to immune molecules on its surface.\n\nIt isn\u2019t yet known whether this binding is a good thing in designing an effective vaccine, but Brown said future studies should answer that question.\n\n\u201cIt adds to our understanding of what these vaccines are capable of eliciting,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully know what these antibodies do yet, but by understanding and future experiments looking into why they get elicited and what they do, we can adjust vaccine studies to make them more effective by either harnessing or getting rid of it.\n\n\u201cIt could be a good thing [that the antibodies bind together] because it could give the immune system a bigger set of antibodies. Or it could be detrimental in that it is not making antibodies the body needs.\u201d\n\nShe and others in the lab \u201care excited to see where these antibodies fit into the immune response and the body\u2019s ability to fight off HIV,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could lead to redesigning vaccines to target or eliminate these responses and could lead to better vaccines.\u201d\n\nImplementation of any vaccine stemming from this discovery is years away from human trials, but Brown said an effective vaccine would have a great impact.\n\n\u201cThere are still millions of people diagnosed with HIV, so having a vaccine would impact the lives of people around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a vaccine that prevents infection would be instrumental in reducing the spread. Right now, there are no vaccines in use in humans. There are clinical trials in humans, which is exciting, and we have made a lot of progress toward eliciting the types of antibodies with these vaccines in the past five years or so. This [discovery] is an extra data point to think about when we design these vaccines and could help us better design boosting immunizations.\u201d\n\nBrown, a native of Montana, \u201cwhere I fell in love with science,\u201d said she came to Scripps Research for her Ph.D. studies and was placed in her current lab to research immunology and structural biology.\n\n\u201cI feel super lucky to work in the lab I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have such a diverse, large lab of people full of amazing ideas.\u201d\n\nThe next step for the lab is to look at the antibody responses in other models.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand how they are generated and what they do, and any consequences to these antibodies being around,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThen we can modify these types of responses in vaccine design.\u201d \u2666"

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated with space since I was little. I used to watch all these documentaries on National Geographic about planets and the solar system. This is like a dream come true,\u201d Malik told ThePrint over phone.\n\nDaksh Malik of Shiv Nadar School, Noida, has been recognised by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for a provisional asteroid discovery. As is the norm, the asteroid is currently named \u20182023 OG40\u2019 after the year it was discovered, but very soon, Malik, 14, will have the honour of picking out a permanent name for it.\n\nNew Delhi: An asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter will carry a name given by a Class 9 student from Noida. After all, he\u2019s the one who discovered it.\n\nAs part of the International Asteroid Discovery Project (IADP), Malik and a couple of his school mates had been hunting for asteroids in space for the better part of a year and a half. They got the opportunity when the school\u2019s astronomy club sent an email in 2022 about the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC).\n\nSupport Unhyphenated Journalism Quality journalism you can trust, with exceptional ground reporting that gives you access to the story behind the story. Contribute Now\n\nThe IASC, a NASA-affiliated citizen science programme, invites people, including students, from around the world to use their datasets and software to help NASA discover new asteroids. The IADP\u2014conducted by the organisation STEM and Space, and the IASC\u2014has over 6,000 participants every year from around the world, and a few each year are able to discover new asteroids. According to the IASC website, there have been 5 other students from India prior to Daksh that have managed to discover a named asteroid.\n\nThe process of finding asteroids was intriguing to Malik. The participants had to download datasets provided by IASC, calibrate them on the Astronomica software and then observe for any celestial objects that could potentially be asteroids. They had to look out for any kind of movement in an object, but also had to check whether the light being emitted from it falls within the limit for asteroids.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun to just do this exercise. When I was looking for asteroids it I felt like I was working at NASA myself,\u201d said the 14-year-old.\n\nHe added that it will take up to 4-5 years for NASA to run initial tests and complete their verification for the asteroid, only after which he will get to name. But there are a few ideas running through his mind.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe I could call it \u2018Destroyer of the World\u2019,\u201d said Malik, laughing. \u201cOr since it\u2019s an asteroid maybe \u2018Countdown\u2019 would be a catchy yet ominous sounding name.\u201d\n\nDiscovery and future plans\n\nMalik, whose primary interests are divided between law and astronomy, participated in the IADP thrice and submitted 6 preliminary asteroid detections to NASA. These preliminary detections are submissions by participants where they provide the data and coordinates of their observations and NASA then confirms whether it is an actual asteroid or not. If confirmed, the asteroid is then called a provisional asteroid.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, Daksh isn\u2019t as keen about the results as he is about the process of something. Once he got interested in astronomy, I knew he would want to see it through no matter the results,\u201d said Sappna Kapur, Malik\u2019s mother.\n\nDespite being the first student in his school to achieve this feat, and spending a year and half on the project, Malik\u2019s dreams are bigger. Astronomy is an interesting subject, he says, but his real passion lies in law and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cHis teachers and I have always supported his choices, and the school has made it possible for him to have so many,\u201d said Kapur. \u201cI remember him spending days at the school\u2019s observatory looking at the night sky through the telescope. If not for this environment, he would have never become the curious child he is.\u201d\n\nIt is this curiosity that Vinita Sarahat, Malik\u2019s mentor and the STEM head of the school wants to foster in all her students.\n\n\u201cAny kid could get great marks in maths and physics if that\u2019s what we want them to do. But to go beyond the classroom and apply these lessons to practical experiences is where real learning comes from,\u201d said Sarahat.\n\n(Edited by Gitanjali Das)\n\nAlso Read: Delhi is missing out on planetary parade due to pollution.

            "article_content": "Andrew Pavlo\u2019s annual retrospective on the database world has recently been released, covering trends and innovations from the past year. The opinionated report, \"Databases in 2024: A Year in Review,\" highlights that while we may indeed be in the \"golden era of databases,\" last year brought significant license changes, the rapid growth of DuckDB, and some surprising new releases.\n\nDiscussing the \"turbulent\" year for open source databases, including major license changes for Redis and Elasticsearch, Pavlo writes:\n\nNotice that Redis and Elasticsearch are receiving more backlash compared to other systems that made similar moves. (...) It cannot be because the Redis and Elasticsearch install base is so much larger than these other systems (...) since the number of MongoDB and Kafka installations was equally as large when they switched their licenses. In the case of Redis, I can only think that people perceive Redis Ltd. as unfairly profiting off others' work since the company's founders were not the system's original creators.\n\nSimilar to how Postgres has emerged as the default choice for operational databases in recent years, DuckDB has, according to the 2024 article, \"entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for running analytical queries on data.\" This trend justifies the recent release of four different extensions integrating the OLAP database with Postgres, as Pavlo explains:\n\nMost OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries.\n\nAn associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-founder of OtterTune, Pavlo began publishing an annual analysis in 2021, focusing on the dominance of PostgreSQL. In 2022, the main topic was \"Blockchain databases are still a stupid idea,\" while in 2023, he shifted focus to the rise of vector databases.\n\nThe 2024 retrospective by the database management systems expert garnered significant attention, sparking popular threads on Reddit and Hacker News. An opinionated statement (\"I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow.\") ignited a heated exchange on Hacker News with Redis creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, better known as \"antirez,\" about the importance and design of the once open-source key-value store.\n\nFocusing on major releases, the retrospective highlights Microsoft Garnet and Valkey as notable key-value stores. Pavlo, however, expresses disappointment with the feature list in MySQL v9 and views the retirement of Amazon QLDB as significant:\n\nIf Amazon can't figure out how to make money on a blockchain database, then nobody can.\n\nDiscussing the recent Aurora DSQL preview, he adds:\n\nThis announcement shows you how much brand recognition the name \"Aurora\" carries in the database world because AWS used it for this new DBMS that seemingly shares no code with their flagship Aurora Postgres RDS offering.\n\nFollowing Pavlo's lead, the team at ByteBase recently released \"Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review\". Many of Pavlo\u2019s university lessons, along with his recent talk \"What Goes Around Comes Around... And Around\u2026,\" are available on YouTube."

With the recent recovery and derivatives traders holding their positions firm, ETH could complete a 20% rally if it overcomes a symmetrical triangle resistance.\n\nEthereum on-chain metrics reveal impact of ETH's bearish sentiment\n\nEthereum faced one of its highest negative sentiment volumes in the past few days.\n\nCommunity members blasted the Ethereum Foundation's leadership and criticized its priorities following Solana's rally upon hosting the TRUMP meme coin. The criticism potentially saw investors jumping ship into other assets, as evidenced by key trends in ETH's on-chain metrics:\n\nEthereum exchange reserve, which measures the total amount of ETH on exchanges, increased by over 434,000 ETH in the past nine days, following the high negative sentiment surrounding the top altcoin. An increase in the amount of coins held in exchanges indicates higher selling pressure.\n\nETH Exchange Reserve. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nA similar trend is evident in ETH's total value staked, which declined to a six-month low of 34.15 million ETH. A decline in total value staked signifies investors are not opting to hold ETH over the long term and could quickly sell off their assets during periods of high volatility.\n\nETH Total Value Staked. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nNotably, the bearish pressure that saw ETH briefly decline below $3,200 came from both short-term and long-term holders considering the Dormant Circulation across both cohorts saw a slight uptick. Dormant Circulation measures the amount of coins within specific age cohorts that switched addresses.\n\nETH Dormant Circulation. Source: Santiment\n\nHowever, periods of high negative sentiment for top crypto assets have often coincided with a price bottom. This could partly explain why ETH has quickly recovered and risen above the $3,300 level in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum's futures open interest saw a slight increase in the past two days, reaching an all-time high of 9.50 million ETH on Friday.\n\nEthereum Open Interest. Source: Coinglass\n\nOpen interest is the total amount of unsettled contracts in a derivatives market.\n\nDespite the negativity surrounding ETH, its open interest was fairly stable, indicating derivatives traders maintained their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ended their six-day inflow streak after recording net outflows of $14.90 million on Thursday, per Coinglass data.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: ETH eyes move above symmetrical triangle and $3,550 resistance\n\nEthereum experienced $35.24 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of liquidated long and short positions accounted for $13.95 and $21.29 million, respectively.\n\nOn the 8-hour chart, Ethereum bounced off a symmetrical triangle's lower boundary support line. Notably, ETH has struggled near the 200-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) in the past nine days before seeing a 4% rise on Friday.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nOn the upside, ETH faces the upper boundary resistance of a symmetrical triangle \u2014 strengthened by the 100-day SMA. If ETH clears this hurdle and flips the $3,550 resistance to a support level, it could rally nearly 20% to tackle the $4,100 critical resistance.\n\nOn the downside, ETH could find support near the $3,000 psychological level if it declines below the triangle's lower boundary support line. A sustained move below $3,000 will validate a Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) pattern that could spark a mega-bearish trend for ETH.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are above their neutral levels, indicating rising bullish pressure."

            "article_content": "Melting ice high up in the Rocky Mountains has revealed an impeccably preserved forest, frozen in time for thousands of years.\n\nBeartooth Plateau , which sits at an altitude of over 10,000 feet (3,000 meters), is a barren, tundra-like landscape. But it hasn't always been that way; an ancient forest lies beneath layers of ice.\n\nCooling temperatures about 5,500 years ago quickly encased this whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forest in ice, preserving the trees in nearly perfect condition. Now, as ice patches frozen for millennia melt due to climate change , researchers are finding clues about what this ancient landscape was once like, and how it was preserved. They detailed their findings Dec. 30, 2024, in the journal PNAS .\n\n\"No one had any idea that these patches of ice had been around for thousands of years,\" David McWethy , an assistant research professor of Earth sciences at Montana State University and co-author of the study, told Live Science. \"Things looked dramatically different than they do today.\"\n\nThis ancient forest of whitebark pines thrived for centuries at much higher elevations than the same tree species that can be found in the region today. This is because the global climate went through a warm period between the end of the last ice age , about 10,000 years ago, and the time when these whitebark pines died over 5,000 years ago.\n\nAt the margins of an ice patch on the Beartooth Plateau, a forest is frozen in time. (Image credit: Joe McConnell, Desert Research Institute)\n\nThis high-elevation forest was once an active ecosystem, likely sustaining animals and the humans who hunted them. From the same ice patch, Craig Lee , an assistant professor at Montana State University and co-author of the study, has recovered a wooden shaft dating back 10,000 years. This wooden shaft was likely part of a spear used by humans to hunt.\n\n\"We don't think about how dynamic that alpine ecosystem has been through time: people were using it, animals were using it,\" Cathy Whitlock , director of the Paleoecology Lab at MSU and senior author of the study, told Live Science. \"You go there now and it's beautiful \u2014 it's a very dramatic landscape \u2014 but it's a little stark.\"\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe trees likely died because of the gradual cooling of the climate at the end of the warm period described above, McWethy said. Very soon after the trees perished, a series of volcanic eruptions released ash and other materials into the atmosphere, which led to further cooling. This volcanic cooling was abrupt enough that ice quickly surrounded the trees and preserved them until the present day.\n\nThe trees revealed by the melting Rocky Mountain ice patch look \"like trees that you would see up in a windswept area,\" McWethy said \u2014 missing their bark but otherwise pristine. Until now, the ice patch has never melted, so the ice has protected the trees from deteriorating.\n\nA frozen forest emerging \"is not something I've heard of before,\" Philip Mote , an Oregon State University professor who was not involved in this study, but has studied snow conditions in the western United States for almost 25 years, said in an interview. \"I'm sure all sorts of things got buried under the ice.\"\n\nClimate change driven by human activity has accelerated the warming of high-elevation areas like Beartooth Plateau. As more ice patches melt, there is the potential to learn more about the past, but Whitlock said these discoveries are bittersweet.\n\n\"These kinds of discoveries are scientifically really interesting, but they're also a sad reminder of how fragile these alpine ecosystems are to climate change,\" Whitlock said."

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated with space since I was little. I used to watch all these documentaries on National Geographic about planets and the solar system. This is like a dream come true,\u201d Malik told ThePrint over phone.\n\nDaksh Malik of Shiv Nadar School, Noida, has been recognised by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for a provisional asteroid discovery. As is the norm, the asteroid is currently named \u20182023 OG40\u2019 after the year it was discovered, but very soon, Malik, 14, will have the honour of picking out a permanent name for it.\n\nNew Delhi: An asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter will carry a name given by a Class 9 student from Noida. After all, he\u2019s the one who discovered it.\n\nAs part of the International Asteroid Discovery Project (IADP), Malik and a couple of his school mates had been hunting for asteroids in space for the better part of a year and a half. They got the opportunity when the school\u2019s astronomy club sent an email in 2022 about the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC).\n\nSupport Unhyphenated Journalism Quality journalism you can trust, with exceptional ground reporting that gives you access to the story behind the story. Contribute Now\n\nThe IASC, a NASA-affiliated citizen science programme, invites people, including students, from around the world to use their datasets and software to help NASA discover new asteroids. The IADP\u2014conducted by the organisation STEM and Space, and the IASC\u2014has over 6,000 participants every year from around the world, and a few each year are able to discover new asteroids. According to the IASC website, there have been 5 other students from India prior to Daksh that have managed to discover a named asteroid.\n\nThe process of finding asteroids was intriguing to Malik. The participants had to download datasets provided by IASC, calibrate them on the Astronomica software and then observe for any celestial objects that could potentially be asteroids. They had to look out for any kind of movement in an object, but also had to check whether the light being emitted from it falls within the limit for asteroids.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun to just do this exercise. When I was looking for asteroids it I felt like I was working at NASA myself,\u201d said the 14-year-old.\n\nHe added that it will take up to 4-5 years for NASA to run initial tests and complete their verification for the asteroid, only after which he will get to name. But there are a few ideas running through his mind.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe I could call it \u2018Destroyer of the World\u2019,\u201d said Malik, laughing. \u201cOr since it\u2019s an asteroid maybe \u2018Countdown\u2019 would be a catchy yet ominous sounding name.\u201d\n\nDiscovery and future plans\n\nMalik, whose primary interests are divided between law and astronomy, participated in the IADP thrice and submitted 6 preliminary asteroid detections to NASA. These preliminary detections are submissions by participants where they provide the data and coordinates of their observations and NASA then confirms whether it is an actual asteroid or not. If confirmed, the asteroid is then called a provisional asteroid.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, Daksh isn\u2019t as keen about the results as he is about the process of something. Once he got interested in astronomy, I knew he would want to see it through no matter the results,\u201d said Sappna Kapur, Malik\u2019s mother.\n\nDespite being the first student in his school to achieve this feat, and spending a year and half on the project, Malik\u2019s dreams are bigger. Astronomy is an interesting subject, he says, but his real passion lies in law and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cHis teachers and I have always supported his choices, and the school has made it possible for him to have so many,\u201d said Kapur. \u201cI remember him spending days at the school\u2019s observatory looking at the night sky through the telescope. If not for this environment, he would have never become the curious child he is.\u201d\n\nIt is this curiosity that Vinita Sarahat, Malik\u2019s mentor and the STEM head of the school wants to foster in all her students.\n\n\u201cAny kid could get great marks in maths and physics if that\u2019s what we want them to do. But to go beyond the classroom and apply these lessons to practical experiences is where real learning comes from,\u201d said Sarahat.\n\n(Edited by Gitanjali Das)\n\nAlso Read: Delhi is missing out on planetary parade due to pollution.

            "article_content": "Andrew Pavlo\u2019s annual retrospective on the database world has recently been released, covering trends and innovations from the past year. The opinionated report, \"Databases in 2024: A Year in Review,\" highlights that while we may indeed be in the \"golden era of databases,\" last year brought significant license changes, the rapid growth of DuckDB, and some surprising new releases.\n\nDiscussing the \"turbulent\" year for open source databases, including major license changes for Redis and Elasticsearch, Pavlo writes:\n\nNotice that Redis and Elasticsearch are receiving more backlash compared to other systems that made similar moves. (...) It cannot be because the Redis and Elasticsearch install base is so much larger than these other systems (...) since the number of MongoDB and Kafka installations was equally as large when they switched their licenses. In the case of Redis, I can only think that people perceive Redis Ltd. as unfairly profiting off others' work since the company's founders were not the system's original creators.\n\nSimilar to how Postgres has emerged as the default choice for operational databases in recent years, DuckDB has, according to the 2024 article, \"entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for running analytical queries on data.\" This trend justifies the recent release of four different extensions integrating the OLAP database with Postgres, as Pavlo explains:\n\nMost OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries.\n\nAn associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-founder of OtterTune, Pavlo began publishing an annual analysis in 2021, focusing on the dominance of PostgreSQL. In 2022, the main topic was \"Blockchain databases are still a stupid idea,\" while in 2023, he shifted focus to the rise of vector databases.\n\nThe 2024 retrospective by the database management systems expert garnered significant attention, sparking popular threads on Reddit and Hacker News. An opinionated statement (\"I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow.\") ignited a heated exchange on Hacker News with Redis creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, better known as \"antirez,\" about the importance and design of the once open-source key-value store.\n\nFocusing on major releases, the retrospective highlights Microsoft Garnet and Valkey as notable key-value stores. Pavlo, however, expresses disappointment with the feature list in MySQL v9 and views the retirement of Amazon QLDB as significant:\n\nIf Amazon can't figure out how to make money on a blockchain database, then nobody can.\n\nDiscussing the recent Aurora DSQL preview, he adds:\n\nThis announcement shows you how much brand recognition the name \"Aurora\" carries in the database world because AWS used it for this new DBMS that seemingly shares no code with their flagship Aurora Postgres RDS offering.\n\nFollowing Pavlo's lead, the team at ByteBase recently released \"Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review\". Many of Pavlo\u2019s university lessons, along with his recent talk \"What Goes Around Comes Around... And Around\u2026,\" are available on YouTube."

            "article_content": "OpenAI announced a preview of Operator, an artificial intelligence agent, that will collaborate with a wide range of commerce-driven companies. While still early, analysts believe these agents could drive engagement shifts across the Internet, while adding that details of the product and its partners remove a key overhang for online travel agencies. Analysts also expect advancements in agentic capabilities to continue, as well as further product expansion from Google (GOOGL), Meta (META) and others.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.\n\nJoin thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights.\n\nOPERATOR: OpenAI announced on Thursday that it is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose artificial intelligence agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions and tasks. Using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling, OpenAI said in a blog post. Operator is coming to U.S. users on ChatGPT\u2019s $200 Pro subscription plan first, the company said. It plans to expand Operator to Plus, Team and Enterprise users and integrate its capabilities directly into ChatGPT in the future once it is \u201cconfidence in its safety and usability at scale.\u201d\n\nOpenAI explained that \u201cOperator can be asked to handle a wide variety of repetitive browser tasks such as filling out forms, ordering groceries, and even creating memes. The ability to use the same interfaces and tools that humans interact with on a daily basis broadens the utility of AI, helping people save time on everyday tasks while opening up new engagement opportunities for businesses.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOTABLE: Operator directly competes with an earlier release from Anthropic, the Amazon (AMZN)-backed artificial intelligence startup behind the Claude chatbot.\n\nThe generative AI market includes OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as Amazon, Google, Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta. Google is investing a further $1B into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, The Financial Times\u2019 George Hammond, Madhumitda Murgia, and Arash Massoudi reported this week. Google had already committed about $2B to Anthropic and is now increasing its stake in the group, according to four people with knowledge of the situation. Under outgoing commissioner Lina Khan, the FTC had targeted investments from Google and Amazon into Anthropic and Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI, reviewing the impact of the deals on competition, but Khan is stepping down in the coming weeks, the FT noted.\n\nANALYST COMMENTARY: In its 2025 outlook, Morgan Stanley discussed how it expects to see key developments in agentic offerings in 2025 and one month into the year \u201cwe have already seen releases from OpenAI and Perplexity.\u201d Google has also previewed agentic/reasoning capabilities with Deep Research, Project Astra, Project Mariner and in travel both in its Gemini 2.0 release and at Google I/O 2024, and Meta has spoken to significant opportunities for the creation of agentic AI systems with advanced reasoning. While still early days, with continued technological and cost improvements in reinforcement learning, chain of thought, and test time compute, the firm expects advancements in agentic capabilities to continue. It also expects further product expansion from Google, Meta and others.\n\nSaying that the new OpenAI agent is a best-case outcome for online travel agencies, Jefferies said that while rumors of the announcement contributed to high single digit downside for Booking and Expedia (EXPE) in recent days on fears of disintermediation, the details provided on Friday helped soothe those fears given that OpenAI\u2019s list of partners included Booking. The partnerships support the firm\u2019s view that AI agents will eventually be another performance channel that could help consolidate share around scaled Internet names. Jefferies said the announcement from OpenAI removes a key OTA overhang and suggests a path for OTA market share gains.\n\nAlso commenting on OpenAI\u2019s Operator, JPMorgan noted that the company is collaborating with a wide range of commerce-driven companies, including DoorDash (DASH), Instacart (CART), Booking (BKNG), Uber (UBER), eBay (EBAY), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and others. The firm believes that, for now, it is also blocked by a number of services, including Google\u2019s YouTube and Reddit (RDDT). While it is still \u201cvery early\u201d and much depends on how Operator and others improve over time, JPMorgan believes these agents could drive engagement shifts across the Internet, with a mix of positive and negative implications across its coverage universe.\n\nThough currently only in previews, BofA expects OpenAI\u2019s Operator could become available more broadly potentially later this year for those paying $20/month. During testing, users still need to input passwords, confirm significant actions, and approve high-stakes transactions, so the firm doesn\u2019t expect an immediate impact. OpenAI will also publish its model so that developers build their own Computer Using Agents. BofA believes OpenAI\u2019s collaborations with DoorDash, Uber, and Instacart are in the early stages, but could possibly deepen in the long-term and allow for more streamlined ordering or additional services."

Thousands have been displaced, exacerbating an existing humanitarian crisis and prompting fears of an all-out regional war.\n\nHere is what to know about the fighting:\n\nExplosions from Goma's outskirts have been reverberating across the city of 2 million people this week. Schools and stores are closed and police are out in full force. Military checkpoints, erected overnight, stop and check all vehicles.\n\nOn Friday, the governor of eastern Congo\u2019s North Kivu province, where Goma is the provincial capital, died of wounds sustained on the front line. The circumstances of Maj. Gen Peter Cirimwami's death were not immediately known \u2014 he was visiting troops fighting the rebels when he was wounded.\n\nOn Thursday, the rebels seized Sake, a town only 27 kilometers (16 miles) from Goma, sending panic surging as concerns mounted that the city could soon fall. Earlier in the week, they captured Minova, a strategically important port on the shores of Lake Kivu, and also the towns of Katale and Masisi, west of Goma.\n\nMost of the fighting between the Congolese army and the rebels on Friday was focused on Kibumba, a town about 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Goma, and also around Sake.\n\nThe M23 rebels \u2014 or The March 23 Movement \u2014 is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in a decades-long conflict in eastern Congo. In recent weeks, the rebels have made significant territorial gains, seizing towns and villages and encircling Goma.\n\nThe group was created in 2012 after the failed integration of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army. It claims to defend Tutsi from discrimination but critics say it's a pretext for Rwanda to obtain economic and political influence over eastern Congo.\n\n\u201cStudies have long highlighted the smuggling of resources\" from Congo into Rwanda, said Ladd Serwat, senior Africa analyst with U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. \u201cCongolese officials increasingly accuse Rwanda of pursuing control over the region\u2019s resources and aiming to annex parts\u201d of Congo.\n\nIn territories under its control, M23 implements its own tax system, runs a local government and controls natural resources.\n\nCongo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, which had only hundreds of members in 2021. Now, according to the United Nations, the group has around 6,500 fighters.\n\nWhile Rwanda denies that claim, it acknowledged last year that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo, allegedly to safeguard its security. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.\n\nSerwat, the Africa analyst, says that Rwanda's engagement has brought it into direct conflict with Congolese forces, \u201cescalating political tensions\u201d between the neighbors.\n\nA \u201cdeclaration of war\" by Congo against Rwanda would risk turning \"into a regional conflict in East Africa,\u201d said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency says more than 400,000 people have been displaced in eastern Congo since the beginning of the year, exacerbating \u201cdesperate conditions\u201d in severely overcrowded displacement centers in and around Goma and triggering an increase in cholera cases.\n\nJean Claude Bauma, 35, fled Masisi when M23 overran the town and was staying with his family at the Nzulo camp for the displaced on the outskirts of Goma. But relentless shelling near the camp forced the father of five to flee into the city center this week.\n\n\u201cWe fear for our lives, since the birth of my children, we have been fleeing the war,\u201d Bauma told the AP. \u201cThis time ... if it\u2019s to die, I will die here.\u201d\n\nThe city is a regional hub for trade, security and humanitarian efforts, and its airport is key for transporting supplies.\n\nBack in 2012, the rebels seized Goma and controlled it for about a week but after mounting international pressure on Rwanda \u2014 including suspension of aid from the United States and Britain \u2014 the M23 surrendered the city.\n\nSince 2021, Congo\u2019s government and allied forces, including Burundian troops and U.N. troops, have been keeping the rebels away from Goma.\n\n\u201cThe capture of such a large city\u201d will certainly be a huge boost for the rebels and a major defeat of the government forces, said Davids, the economist.\n\nIts fall would also have a \u201ccatastrophic impact on hundreds of thousands of civilians, putting them at risk of heightened exposure to human rights violations and abuses,\u201d said Ravina Shamdasani of the U.N. human rights office.\n\nFrancois Moreillon, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross for Congo, said he's worried also that ICRC staff running the main hospital in Goma would have to evacuate. If the hospital and the staff were no longer safe, who would treat the patients, he asked.\n\n\"This situation is simply unacceptable,\u201d Moreillon said."

That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It\u2019s also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.\n\nInsured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\u201d said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \u201cWhen those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\u201d\n\nAt least two other hurricanes, several severe \u201cconvective\u201d storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.\n\nIn addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That\u2019s a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.\n\nIn a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.\n\nDownload the FREE WPXI News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Channel 11 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch WPXI NOW"

There are a lot of reasons to want to reduce this number, both ecological and economical. Intel has an idea to help, and interestingly, it aligns with right-to-repair advocates' goals.Three Intel personnel\u2014Gurpreet Sandhu and Reshma PP from Intel's Platform Engineering Group, as well as Sustainability Product Strategy Manager Roberta Zouain\u2014crafted a big post titled \"Modular PC Design: A Sustainable Approach for Enhanced Repairability and Reduced E-Waste.\" The title pretty much gives it away, but the gist is that Intel is advocating for a new approach to building devices to reduce the need for premature disposal.Intel notes that modularity can be addressed at three different levels: factory, field, and user. Basically, the idea is that devices can be made so that users can easily swap components for convenience, so that technicians can easily replace parts for repairs, and such that the manufacturer can re-use components and designs. Intel's goal is for all three to be more commonplace.To that end, the company has crafted three \"Modular PC\" proposals for different market segments: premium laptops , entry or mainstream laptops, and then desktops. Intel makes specific recommendations for each category, but to be honest, many of them are either a bit vague (\"standardized core boards\") or things that system builders are already doing (\"standardized M.2 SSD modules\".)For premium laptops, Intel wants to see scalable designs with reduced engineering efforts put toward proprietary parts. The company emphasizes ease of upgrades and simplified repairs in this class, and advocates the use of universal I/O boards similar to what Framework is already doing . Lenovo, too, has gotten into this, by putting its USB Type-C connectors on daughterboards in some systems, which will greatly ease replacement of those parts.For mainstream laptops, Intel emphasizes \"multi-generation silicon to achieve cost neutrality.\" Essentially what the company seems to be saying is that it wants to see machines that are capable of accepting different processors in the same fundamental design\u2014amusing to hear coming from Intel, specifically given the company's history of cycling through motherboard platforms relatively rapidly. Still, we approve of what Intel's saying here.Finally, in desktop systems, Intel is advising the proliferation of more modular industrial designs. The company presents a render of a \"125W CPU + 23W dGPU Mini Desktop formfactor with <5L volume\" and that's pretty cool, but the standardized nature of the ATX form factor certainly has its advantages. Of course, Intel is hoping to create a whole new standard here, and it wants to see easy upgrades and simplified repairs\u2014a far cry from SFF machines today Even if you actively hate the environment, making devices last longer through upgradeability and repairability is a great goal. Computers have long since reached the point where even a cheap PC is \"fast enough\" for most use cases, and it's a shame to toss out a laptop because it's a few years old and a proprietary component in it failed.While Intel's post seems more like a \"wouldn't this be great\" type of blog entry than a formal proposal for new form factors, it's still fascinating to see a company like Intel coming out in support of right to repair in such an affirmative way. Kudos to the company for its efforts, and hopefully system manufacturers take these goals to heart."

            "article_content": "In 2016, Herschel Hepler was browsing Google Images to practice his paleography \u2014 the study of historical writing systems \u2014 when he stumbled upon an eerily familiar photo that would lead to a groundbreaking discovery.\n\n\u201cI recognized it immediately and said, 'That\u2019s a manuscript in our collection,'\u201d Hepler, a curator at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, recalls.\n\nThe museum had recently acquired the manuscript \u2014 a rare Jewish prayer book \u2014 believing it to be part of the famous Cairo Geniza, a trove of ancient Jewish documents uncovered in a Cairo synagogue in the late 19th century.\n\nBut the black and white picture in Tablet magazine described the manuscript as a \u201c16th to 17th century Hebrew book of Psalms, said to be from the Bamiyan area\u201d of central Afghanistan.\n\nStunned by the revelation, Hepler set out to verify it. Tracking down the author of the Tablet article, British historian and archaeologist Jonathan Lee, Hepler confirmed that Lee had in fact found the book in an Afghan warlord\u2019s possession in 1998 and photographed the cover and two inside pages.\n\n\u201cWithout Jonathan\u2019s documentation from his trip to Bamiyan in 1998, we would still be assuming this is probably from the Cairo Geniza,\u201d Hepler said.\n\nBut if Hepler was surprised to learn about the book's origin in the remote mountains of Afghanistan, Lee was equally stunned when Hepler revealed that the manuscript had been carbon-dated to at least the 9th century.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I realized that the discovery was of major importance,\u201d Lee said via email.\n\nRecognizing their combined expertise \u2014 Hepler in Hebrew manuscripts and Lee in Afghan history \u2014 the duo joined forces and invited in other experts.\n\nTheir yearslong research not only established the manuscript as the oldest-known Hebrew book but also unearthed evidence that Jews had lived in Afghanistan \u2014 and along the ancient Silk Roads \u2014 for longer than historians previously believed.\n\nBut the thrill of discovery was dampened by the realization that the manuscript had probably been smuggled out of war-torn Afghanistan and bought on the antiquities market.\n\nAt the time, the museum, founded by the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby arts and craft company, was still reeling from its acquisition of artifacts smuggled from Iraq and Egypt.\n\nThe museum faced a significant challenge: Before it could showcase it to the world, it needed to legitimize its ownership of the manuscript. This required years of delicate negotiations with New York\u2019s small Afghan Jewish community and an Afghan government teetering on the brink of collapse. The stakes were high, and the path to secure the manuscript\u2019s rightful place in the museum would prove be too complex and demanding.\n\nLee\u2019s discovery\n\nLee, who has spent the better part of the last five decades researching and writing about Afghan history and archaeology, discovered the book by chance.\n\nIn April 1998, he was guiding a Japanese TV crew in Bamiyan and was on the lookout for a Bactrian language inscription and gold coins looted from an ancient Buddhist shrine.\n\nAt the time, the Bamiyan Valley, with its famed Buddha statues still standing, was controlled by a local Shiite insurgent group, while the Taliban ruled most of the rest of the country.\n\nThe anti-Taliban group\u2019s leader, Karim Khalili, kept a collection of antiquities, among them the cache of gold coins Lee had been looking for. Lee photographed them.\n\n\"Then, his [Khalili\u2019s] advisers brought in a miscellaneous collection of other antiquities that included the ALQ,\u201d Lee said, using the acronym for the \u201cAfghan Liturgical Quire,\u201d the Hebrew book in the Bible Museum\u2019s collection.\n\nA local man affiliated with the Shiite insurgent group had found the book under a collapsed roof in a cave the prior year and given it to Khalili.\n\nUnversed in Hebrew, Khalili apparently showed the book to other foreigners visiting Bamiyan, trying to figure out what it was.\n\n\u201cI was told it had been found in Bamiyan, but then everything is found in Bamiyan,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAs Lee recalls, the pocket-size book looked remarkably well-preserved for its age.\n\n\u201cThe cover was somewhat bent, damaged and watermarked, but the folios were relatively well-preserved, and most of the texts readable,\u201d he said.\n\nTo Lee, that suggested the manuscript was \"not that old.\u201d He left Afghanistan and for years didn\u2019t give it much thought.\n\nHow and when the manuscript left Afghanistan remains unknown.\n\nThe 1990s were a dark period for Afghanistan\u2019s rich cultural heritage. As armed groups fought over territory, their men \u2014 often directed by their commanders and guided by traffickers \u2014 plundered the country\u2019s vast archaeological sites and ransacked its museums. Seventy percent of the national museum\u2019s treasures vanished, according to one estimate, many ending up in private collections and some reputable institutions.\n\n\u201cThere is a long history of illicit export of antiquities from the country that goes back for decades but ultimately back to colonial times,\u201d said Cecilia Palombo, a University of Chicago professor who has researched the plunder of Afghan antiquities.\n\nA leading researcher with extensive experience in Afghanistan said the manuscript was likely taken out of the country after the Taliban overran Bamiyan in late 1998. The researcher spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nResearch by the Bible museum found that an unnamed Khalili deputy made multiple sales attempts in the United States and Europe between 1998 and 2001 before \u201capparently\u201d offloading it to a private collector in London in fall 2001. The collector kept it for a decade or more before Hobby Lobby bought it in 2013 and donated it to the museum.\n\nThe office of Khalili, who later served as a vice president, declined a VOA interview request.\n\nThe Tablet article\n\nAlthough Lee had found the book in Afghanistan, he didn\u2019t know how significant it was. On returning to England, he showed his photographs to a Hebrew specialist, who thought it was from the 16th or 17th century.\n\nThen, after a cache of ancient documents dubbed the \u201cAfghan Geniza\u201d surfaced on the international art market, Lee decided to publish his photograph, along with an article about Afghan Jewish history. Citing the book as an example of \u201cJewish material [turning up] occasionally\u201d in Afghanistan, he wrote that the \u201cwhereabouts of this manuscript is now unknown.\u201d\n\nHe would find out four years later. That's when, \u201cout of the blue,\u201d Hepler contacted him via LinkedIn and told him the manuscript was not the Book of Psalms but a prayer book, comprising Sabbath prayers, poetry and a partial Haggadah, the Jewish text recited at the Passover seder.\n\nThe Green family bought the book from an Israeli antiquities dealer in 2013 during a buying spree of ancient artifacts. Some of these items were later returned after it was discovered they had been illegally taken out of Iraq and Egypt.\n\nThe Afghan Liturgical Quire came with a forged provenance of its own, tracing the manuscript to collectors in London in the 1950s, masking any ties to Afghanistan. With Lee\u2019s documentation, the museum was able to correct its provenance.\n\nThe museum had initially thought the book was from the 9th century, but a second carbon-dating test performed in 2019 showed it dates to the 8th century, making it two centuries older than the previous oldest-known Hebrew book in the world.\n\nThe discovery electrified experts.\n\nFor Hebrew scholars, the discovery offered the earliest evidence of a bound Hebrew book.\n\nFor Afghanistan specialists, it highlighted \"how significant this region was in respect of the history of the Middle East, Inner Asia and Northern India, and Afghanistan's ancient connectivity with cultures and religious traditions,\" Lee said.\n\nYet the realization that it had been smuggled out of Afghanistan cast a cloud over its legitimacy.\n\nAfghan laws and the 1970 UNESCO Convention make it illegal to export cultural artifacts and heritage items without government approval.\n\nTo legitimize its custody of the manuscript, the museum adopted what it calls a \u201chuman rights-based approach\u201d to cultural heritage.\n\nInvoking the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the museum argued that the Afghan people and Afghan Jews living in New York have a right to access the manuscript.\n\n\u201cOne of the things this project is focused on is on access \u2014 so, access to the Afghan Jewish community, access to the people of Afghanistan,\u201d Hepler said.\n\nTo get the backing of both stakeholders, the museum initiated discussions with officials of the former Afghan government and members of the Jewish community in New York.\n\nThese efforts culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2021 with the Afghan embassy in Washington before the Taliban takeover, ensuring the document would be held in custodianship.\n\nThe Afghan ambassador at the time, Roya Rahmani, did not respond to a request for an interview. Another former Afghan ambassador wrote a letter of support for the project.\n\nJack Abraham, head of the Afghan Jewish Federation who was born in Afghanistan, said his group offered its full support for keeping the manuscript in the United States.\n\n\u201cI told [Hepler], \u2018What you have in your hands is our heritage. It belongs to us. It could be any of our forefathers,\u2019\u201d Abraham said.\n\nBut some Afghans see it as equally part of their heritage.\n\n\u201cThis is the property of Afghanistan and must be returned to Afghanistan,\u201d a senior former government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nBarnett Rubin, a leading Afghanistan scholar and an advisor on the ALQ project, said both communities can legitimately lay claim to the book.\n\n\u201cThe museum wanted to have the approval of any one of the two main entities that might have a claim on it to their custody of it,\u201d Rubin said.\n\nWith a custodianship agreement secured, the museum launched an exhibit in September, celebrating the project as an interfaith collaboration among Jews, Christians and Muslims.\n\nA second exhibit is planned for New York starting this month.\n\nWhile the Bible Museum technically owns the manuscript, Hepler said Afghanistan and the Afghan Jewish community \"have a lot of agency in this custodianship.\" To that end, the museum plans to provide one high-quality replica to the Jewish community and three to major cultural institutions in Afghanistan."

Discovery, the IOC has stated that the Olympics - which are due to take place in July 2028 - will go ahead as planned as things stand.\n\nHe said: \"There is no noise or discussion right now that it [the -wildfires and rebuild cost] will have any impact on LA 2028.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"The tragedy of these fires in Los Angeles is the focus right now and nobody is looking too far down the road.\n\n\"No infrastructure was significantly impacted, so they are not looking to rebuild anything that was required for the Olympic Games.\"\n\nYoung added: \"The priority now is around the people, rebuilding homes and the infrastructure that has been damaged.\""

A stunning display is anticipated in the night sky as Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune align. Referred to as a planetary parade or alignment, this celestial event occurs when multiple planets in our solar system appear to create a straight line as viewed from Earth.\n\nTaking to social media platform X, the India Meteorological Department said it would be one of the rarest events when in January to February 2025, we can see the planets Jupiter and Mars on eastern sky, Saturn and Venus in Western sky through naked eyes, and Uranus and Neptune through telescope.\n\n\"As per the configuration of the planetary system and different revolution periods of planets, it is rare to have all planets in a single frame of the sky. In January to February 2025 we can see the planets Jupiter and Mars on eastern sky, Saturn and Venus in Western sky through naked eyes, and Uranus and Neptune through telescope. Today the configuration will be such that all the planets will appear to align in line on the sky. This is one of the rarest astronomical events,\" IMD said in its post.\n\n25th January 2025\n\n\n\nAs per the configuration of the planetary system and different revolution periods of planets, it is rare to have all planets in a single frame of the sky.

For instance, Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, completes one orbit in 88 days, constituting a year for the planet. Conversely, Neptune takes an astonishing 60,190 days to complete one revolution around the Sun.\n\nPeriodically, the differing velocities of the planets result in them aligning on the same side of the Sun, a phenomenon visible from Earth. In the upcoming event in February, it is worth noting that while the seven planets may not align precisely, they will be observable in an arc across the sky due to their shared orbital plane in the Solar System."
