Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new study published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, unveils a novel approach to measuring public attention using reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The research bridges the gap between unconventional indicators and macroeconomic analysis, revealing surprising links between UAP sightings and economic conditions at multiple geographical levels in the United States.\n\nThe study highlights that UAP reports, often dismissed as a niche phenomenon, serve as a robust proxy for public attention. By analyzing daily-level data from NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center), the researchers show that UAP sightings are more frequent in wealthier regions but exhibit counter-cyclical patterns within those regions over time. These findings suggest that shifts in attention to extraordinary phenomena may reflect broader fluctuations in public focus.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nMacroeconomic correlation: UAP sightings are positively correlated with economic conditions across regions but display counter-cyclical patterns within regions over time.\n\nCausal evidence: A quasi-experimental design leveraging variations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions demonstrates a causal link between restricted mobility and increased UAP reports, further establishing the measure as an indicator of public attention.\n\nPolicy implications: Regions with higher UAP sighting levels show muted responses to monetary policy shocks, suggesting that attention variations can significantly influence economic outcomes.\n\nThe researchers compared UAP sightings to conventional attention metrics, finding strong correlations. This innovative measure offers unique advantages, including the ability to analyze attention at different geographical and temporal scales.\n\nImplications for policy and research\n\nGoldstein and Raveh's findings underscore the central role of public attention in economic dynamics. Their work not only enhances the toolkit for macroeconomic analysis but also provides policymakers with insights into managing public attention to mitigate economic shocks.\n\nThe study invites further exploration into how unconventional forms of attention, like UAP sightings, intersect with economic behaviors. \"We hope this work inspires future research to deepen our understanding of the connection between public attention and macroeconomic outcomes,\" the authors state.\n\nThe research uses comprehensive UAP sighting data from NUFORC, spanning over two decades, to construct a daily-level panel of reports across U.S. counties. The analysis integrates economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure robust conclusions.\n\nThis pioneering work highlights the value of thinking beyond traditional metrics, shedding light on the role of seemingly unrelated phenomena in understanding economic patterns.\n\nMore information: Nathan Goldstein et al, Looking up the sky: unidentified aerial phenomena and macroeconomic attention, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (2024).

            "article_content": "The FAA has placed temporary flight restrictions on the operation of drones over parts of New Jersey, according to a notice published on the agency\u2019s website. The ban on drone activity is likely related to the recent bout of mass hysteria over supposed \u201cdrone\u201d sightings, though the agency hasn\u2019t said so explicitly. The FAA told the New York Times the ban was enacted at the request of \u201cfederal security partners,\u201d without elaborating further.\n\nThe drone ban covers 22 different New Jersey communities and is set to expire on Jan. 17, 2025. It\u2019s not immediately clear why that end date was chosen. The FAA didn\u2019t address Gizmodo\u2019s questions about the specific timing of the flight restrictions and their relation to drone sightings in an email Thursday morning and directed us to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cWe continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,\u201d a spokesperson from DHS told Gizmodo over email. The spokesperson did not address our specific questions on the record.\n\n\u201cIn coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nPeople in New Jersey started reporting odd \u201cdrones\u201d in the sky to police around Nov. 18, according to NBC News, and there have reportedly been sightings every day since, aside from a conspicuous pause on Thanksgiving. The so-called drones have caused more and more people to post videos taken of what they believe to be unmanned aerial vehicles. And while some of the videos are difficult to explain, the vast majority appear to be regular commercial aircraft.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for internet cranks to get worked up about nothing, this drone panic has spread to areas that are unexpected. Several elected leaders have called for action by the federal government, including president-elect Donald Trump who\u2019s both claimed the government is trying to hide something and said they should be shot down.\n\nBut the concern has been bipartisan. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, has called for more action and played up the hype.\n\n\u201cSome of the drones are small. Some of the drones\u2019 flight patterns are erratic,\u201d Schumer said on Sunday, according to NBC News. \u201cMultiple drones flying together can confuse a traditional radar system and that\u2019s why, again, this new technology can really get us the answers that we need.\u201d\n\nPeople are also pointing lasers at commercial flights, an incredibly dangerous activity that can light up the inside of a cockpit and blind pilots. Laser strikes were already a serious problem, but have become so common during the current drone hysteria that the FAA was forced to issue a statement warning the public not to do it. Shining a laser at planes is a federal crime that can bring jail time and hefty fines.\n\nSome of the most difficult-to-believe theories about the drones are coming from elected leaders, including claims by a Republican congressman that they\u2019re actually being deployed by an Iranian mothership off the east coast of the U.S.\n\n\u201cKnow that Iran made a deal with China to purchase drones, motherships, and technology in order to go forward,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey on Fox News Dec. 11. \u201cThe sources I have are good. They can\u2019t reveal who they are because they are speaking to me in confidentiality. These drones should be shot down.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Iran has deployed a drone mothership, despite the fact that Van Drew has access to real power and should know things. Van Drew is a member of the U.S. House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. But nothing would surprise us at this point when it comes to weird sightings. With Trump taking power again in a month, things are shaping up to get so much weirder in the months and years ahead, drones or no drones."

For more awards, check out our Game of the Year 2024 hub.\n\nEvan Lahti, Strategic Director: Imagine the jackpot feeling of stumbling upon, perhaps while excavating some beige office tomb that has laid untouched since the '90s, a sealed box of 50 never-released retro games. This is the sensation UFO 50 delivers, rediscovering the pleasant imperfections of games from another era at whatever pace you'd like.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUFO 50 is passion project created in Gamemaker by Derek Yu (Spelunky, Spelunky 2), Paul Hubans (World of Goo), Eirik Suhrke, Ojiro Fumoto, Jon Perry, and Tyriq Plummer\u2014an indie dream team\u2014and a piece of its joy comes from discovering the varied tastes and sensibilities of these creators.\n\nWhat makes the collection a singular creative achievement is the way it lovingly reproduces the charming flaws (under-explained mechanics, unforgiving fail states) and timeless merits (two-button control schemes, few barriers between players and play) of games from the '80s and early '90s. When I had trouble beating Devilition, a tough puzzle game where you blow up demons on a grid to protect helpless pilgrims, I popped into the cowboy JRPG. After dying to a boss there, I tried the Pac-Man-and-Splatoon-with-cars game, and then Golfaria, which must be the world's first adventure game where you are a golf ball. There's an underworld caterpillar race betting simulator (you can pay to have opponents drugged, banana peeled, or crippled, just don't get caught), a tough speed-platformer from the creator of Downwell, and to come down from it, a serene, floaty platformer that takes place in a walrus' daydream.\n\nThese goofy premises belie how cohesive, complementary, and deep some of these games are. Some of them could've gone for $7 each on Steam, disproportionate value given UFO 50's modest $25 price. One of the centerpieces is Pilot Quest, which crams an idle game's passive resource-earning inside the north-south-east-west wandering of Zelda, a game concept that feels indulgently like it exists in two eras simultaneously.\n\nUFO 50\n\nMy favorite is Overbold, basically Smash TV distilled to its essence: a confining arena that monsters spill into, and only eight discrete directions at which to point your gun. I love the try-your-luck mechanic of it, which allows you to take on more enemies in any given round with a proportional reward, which provided so many moments of \"Surely this is the run, I'm nailing it!\" hubris because I rolled one two many mobs of exploding pumpkin robot in my monster menagerie.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny released videogame is a miracle. Several dozen of them, from the same small team, is a constellation of them, an eight-year game jam that transcends time.\n\nShaun Prescott, Australian Editor: UFO 50's most unlikely success is its storytelling. Played consecutively, these 50 (?) games provide a fictionalised account of one of the most critical periods in the medium's history, taking in the emergence of franchises, sequels, threequels and mascots, all with the charming tentativeness of pioneering efforts. That's not even to mention the story of UFO Soft itself, told in dribs and drabs through game descriptions and the distinct design sensibilities of its fictional crew. For those invested in this surprisingly strange tale, there's a literal hidden layer to UFO 50 that will amply reward curiosity.\n\nWes Fenlon, Senior Editor: I too am infatuated with the light narrative UFO 50 weaves between its imaginary cartridges, with the descriptions giving you little bits of imagined history about the developers behind each game. Despite the brevity of text, the history of UFO 50's fake console is deeply thought out\u2014you can see real parallels to gaming history with the increased ambitions of what 8-bit graphics were capable of in the jump from Mortol to Mortol 2, for example.\n\nMore importantly, the sequels and spiritual successors within the collection are beautifully focused examples of how game designers can take the kernel of an idea and build on it. Mortol 2 keeps the first game's almost Lemmings-like puzzle platformer concept, which relies on sacrificing the brave but faceless citizens of Mortol by the dozens, but refashions it to include specific character archetypes with their own moves. A gunner, a ninja, and a warrior all in the same world? You don't get more videogames than that.\n\nAs Evan says, some of the best of UFO 50 could easily stand alone, but they really are enriched by being placed right next to each other. I spent a whole sick day in bed 100%ing the surprise first metroidvania in the collection, Porgy, because the submarine was just too cute. That ate up five hours, and after such a deep time investment it turned out that UFO 50's Party House was exactly what I needed as a palate cleanser: a bite-sized puzzle riff on a deckbuilding card game, but about inviting a bunch of freaks 'round the house. It seems throwaway yet is instantly compulsive. I could keep blabbing about how cool this whole collection is as a whole, but if you want the real takeaway, let's just go with: Party House GOTY."

Here's how experts say you can and should, report UFO or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in Canada.\n\nTransport Canada collects aviation occurrence information and enters it into the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, known as CADORS.\n\nIn CADORS reports, Transport Canada said the term \u201cUFO\u201d can include sightings of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs or drones), balloons, meteors, weather phenomena and birds.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u201cIt should not be interpreted to mean something of extraterrestrial origin. The information in CADORS should be treated as preliminary, unsubstantiated and subject to change,\u201d said Flavio Nienow, Transport Canada spokesperson, in a statement.\n\nTransport Canada said they don't have any additional information to provide beyond what can be found in CADORS.\n\nHow does Transport Canada followup on reports?\n\nWhen reports like these are generated, Nienow explained the next steps depend on the type of the incident reported.\n\n\u201cFurther follow up may be undertaken by various organizations including Transport Canada, Nav Canada, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u201d he said. \u201cTransport Canada will use every tool at its disposal in an attempt to find an aircraft found to be operating in an unsafe and unlawful manner.\u201d\n\nNienow said anyone who witnesses unsafe aviation activity should contact Transport Canada or local law enforcement. Witnesses are encouraged to record and provide as much information as possible to help Transport Canada review incidents more effectively. For example, send clear photos or videos, record the date, time and any other identifying marks.\n\nOther aviation incidents may be reported at Incident reporting: Report an aviation incident. Drone-related incidents can also be reported.\n\nHow else can you report?\n\nThe U.S.-based National UFO Reporting Center collects all sorts of reports \u2014 including UFO and UAP reports from Canada, the U.S., and around the world. They encourage people to use their website to report occurrences.\n\nThroughout its history, the organization has processed more than 180,000 reports.\n\n\u201cWe look at every single report. We make an assessment,\u201d said Christian Stepien, the organization's chief technology officer, and follow up on reports that require a more in-depth look.\n\nReports are placed in the organization's databank, where you can review past reports categorized by date and location.\n\nThis publication reached out to the Ontario Provincial Police about UFO or UAP reports and asked how they advise citizens both generally and specifically to report them. We have not yet received a response."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

            "article_content": "While we wait for OpenAI\u2019s next big thing \u2014 presumably ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 model (or whatever it\u2019s called) \u2014 we might get to see and use another big upgrade for genAI products. AI agents are programs that let you manage and control Mac or Windows apps using written ChatGPT prompts and voice.\n\nThat\u2019s the future of AI computing I want from ChatGPT and similar AI products. I want to tell AI to look at my screen and do whatever I ask it to. I also want it to perform internet searches on my behalf, whether in the ChatGPT app or a browser. More importantly, I want to do most of it by voice, with the help of Advanced Voice Mode and future versions of it.\n\nOpenAI isn\u2019t quite there, but the demos the company showed during its penultimate \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement tell me we\u2019re heading in that direction.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for Mac now works with even more coding apps. OpenAI also added support for note-taking apps, including the Apple Notes app that comes on all Apple devices. The best part about it is that Advanced Voice Mode can be used to talk to ChatGPT about the contents on your screen.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nWe\u2019re still not getting full agentic functionality from ChatGPT. It\u2019s an iterative upgrade over what OpenAI announced about a month ago for the Mac app. At the time, the company gave ChatGPT the ability to look at the contents on the screen in certain coding apps on the Mac. The feature wasn\u2019t as much an agentic control of the computer as OpenAI leveraged a built-in accessibility API in macOS to read text.\n\nBut OpenAI has built on that, adding support for more coding apps, including Warp, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others. As you can see in the short clips below, you can use the Mac app to instruct ChatGPT to look at the screen in a specific app. You\u2019ll be able to choose which app you\u2019re giving the AI access to, and that\u2019s the only thing it\u2019ll see.\n\nIn addition to expanding support to more apps, OpenAI is also bringing o1 and o1 pro mode to the mix of models that can be used to code for you. Advanced Voice Mode wasn\u2019t a part of these demos, as the OpenAI engineers still used text-based prompts to demo the new functionality.\n\nNow you can code with the power of o1 and o1 pro mode. pic.twitter.com/qdj9RuLRKQ \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThese updates aren\u2019t exciting if you don\u2019t code for a living. But you can already write all sorts of text. That\u2019s where ChatGPT might come in handy if you use a Mac. Here\u2019s where the Advanced Voice Mode feature shines.\n\nOpenAI showed a demo of ChatGPT\u2019s agentic behavior for note-taking apps. The list of supported apps includes Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. The demo below shows ChatGPT looking at a Notion note to understand the context and answer a prompt. The AI then performs a search for factual information about a historic event and generates text trying to mimic the voice of the note\u2019s author.\n\nInstead of typing the prompts, you might want to talk to ChatGPT with Advanced Voice Mode rather than type your prompts. This might boost your productivity, assuming everything works as intended. As you\u2019ll see in the second demo, the AI quickly understands your needs, but it might fail here and there.\n\nAnd you can use Advanced Voice when you work with these apps. pic.twitter.com/drZoRc7xvC \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThen again, we\u2019re still in the early days here. What OpenAI has shown only scratches the surface of what ChatGPT might do one day on Mac and PC.\n\nUntil then, you can try these new ChatGPT capabilities in the Mac app as long as you have access to a premium tier (Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu). OpenAI will bring these features to the Windows app in the future. ChatGPT Free users will also get them next year."

            "article_content": "Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Android 16 is introducing a new WritingTools API.\n\nThe WritingTools API lets apps opt out of writing tools that enable keyboards to replace the user\u2019s text with text generated by AI.\n\nApps might want to disable AI writing tools when the user is inputting text in certain text fields like for emails.\n\nGoogle rolled out the second developer preview of Android 16 the other day, bringing the platform a whole host of new developer features like better app control over haptics, search support for cloud media items in the photo picker, an adaptive refresh rate API, and more. As usual, it also includes changes that Google didn\u2019t highlight in its announcement, some of which we\u2019ve already covered. The latest change we\u2019ve spotted is a new Writing Tools API that seemingly lets apps opt out of having AI rewrite text for you.\n\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\n\nWhile digging through the documentation for Android 16 DP2, we notice that Google documented two new methods in the EditorInfo class: isWritingToolsEnabled() and setWritingToolsEnabled() . The EditorInfo class basically lets apps communicate information about an editable text field (like the type of text content it contains) to the current input method (i.e. an Android keyboard app).\n\nThe new isWritingToolsEnabled() method returns true when an Editor has AI writing tools enabled, which are enabled by default on all text fields. The documentation notes that \u201ctoolkits can optionally disable [AI writing tools] where not relevant e.g. passwords, number input, etc.\u201d\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nThe documentation under the new setWritingToolsEnabled() method explains how it can be used by apps to opt out of having writing tools rewrite text using generative AI.\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nSome keyboard apps like Gboard have AI writing tools that help you proofread or rewrite text using on-device or cloud-based generative AI models. Gboard has a proofread option on some Pixel devices, for example, that helps correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in any text that you\u2019ve typed, pasted, or dictated.\n\nMost apps should have no reason to opt out of AI writing tools in most text fields, but some apps may want to instruct the current keyboard app to not allow them in some situations. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allow AI writing tools to be used to replace text in fields where you have to input an email address, password, or phone number, for example.\n\nWhile Gboard already hides most irrelevant options when it\u2019s focused on a number or password field, some other keyboard apps might not, which seems to be the logic behind this new Writing Tools API. Regardless, it\u2019s going to be up to keyboard apps to respect this new API. Even if they do, though, it seems like it\u2019d be very easy to work around, as you could always just generate text in another app and then insert it into the text field where it\u2019s supposed to be blocked.\n\nWe\u2019re still digging through Android 16 Developer Preview 2 to find out what\u2019s new, so keep an eye out for more coverage on Android Authority.\n\nGot a tip?

Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe app had \"10+\" downloads on Google Play and one rating on the Apple App Store as of Wednesday. It is billed as a \"unique place where people from every background, race, and walk of life come together in a place of community and purpose\" and offers users prayer and spiritual guidance from an AI version of the 54-year-old Carpenter.\n\nA video demonstration shared online by Protestia features Carpenter using the app to request \"Pastor Ron\" to pray for recovery from an illness.\n\n\"I love to have my own personal pastor,\" Carpenter tells the camera as he demonstrates how the app responds with an automated message in Carpenter's voice. The pastor ended the short video by urging his followers to \"stay tuned\" to find out more information.\n\nPowered by Innovatix AI, the app also requires users to sign up for a $49 monthly plan to access \"unlimited\" calls and messages with the AI pastor.\n\nCarpenter's personal website also features an apparent link to the Advanced Archive app, which appeared broken as of Wednesday afternoon. The site does not reference the Advanced Archive app anywhere else.\n\nCP reached out to Carpenter for comment. This story will be updated if a response is received.\n\nThe mainstreaming of AI has already changed how some pastors approach their sermons, with some churches opting to try ChatGPT and other large language models to generate their messages for Sunday mornings.\n\nPastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills has warned against the rise of AI among churches, saying that the level of deception in the Church is set to rise exponentially in the coming years as technology rapidly advances.\n\n\"I don't say this to scare you; I say this to prepare you,\" Hibbs said in October 2023. \"There is a level of deception coming both in and out of the Church that is going to rock the world. It has to. God promised it would come. It would be an indicator of the last days.\"\n\nHibbs warned when it comes to AI, \"we are now starting to see things come to pass where you don't know if what you're looking at is true or not.\"\n\n\"You can't even tell anymore if that person's voice is assigned to the actual individual. Is that really Billy Graham's voice, or is that really this actor's voice or that singer's voice? Or is it artificial intelligence?\n\n\"How are you going to know truth from error?\" Hibbs asked.\n\nStressing the need for discernment among believers, Hibbs implored his congregation to \"more than ever, read the Bible.\"\n\n\"Pray to God. Stop listening to what people are saying. Judge everything you hear against the Bible.\""

The latter lets you stay on track with productivity tasks, while an AI-powered Smart Drawer automatically categorises apps into folders for better organisation.\n\nElsewhere, the NOS 3.0 update has an enhanced pop-up view, better Quick Settings, updated typography and visual and performance enhancements.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe update is rolling out to Nothing Phone (2) and Nothing Phone (2a) first from now until the end of the year. It will then come to the Nothing Phone (1), Nothing Phone (2a) Plus and CMF Phone 1 at the start of 2025.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Shared Widgets is currently only supported between Nothing devices and only Photo Widgets in square can be shared, though Nothing is developing support for other widgets so we suspect this feature will expand soon.\n\nThe Countdown Widget meanwhile, will be available on Google Play through the Nothing Widgets app later in December."

Almost two decades ago I visited the pioneering scientists\u2019 labs in Germany and Italy seeking answers. What I learned overturned accepted history and exposed a chilling tale involving Nazis, brainwaves, war between Russia and Ukraine, and suicide. This history resonates with current events\u2014Russia and Ukraine recently passed a grim 1,000-day milestone of a conflict waged on a pretext of battling Nazis\u2014revealing how history, science and society are intricately entwined.\n\nHuman brainwaves, oscillating waves of electricity that constantly sweep through brain tissue, change with our thoughts and perceptions. Their value in medicine is incalculable. They reveal all manner of neurological and psychological disorders to doctors and guide neurosurgeons\u2019 hands when extracting diseased brain tissue that triggers seizures. Only newly appreciated, their role in the healthy brain is transforming our fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information. Like waves of all types, the electrical waves sweeping through the brain generate synchrony (think of water waves bobbing boats); in the case of brainwaves, what\u2019s synchronized is activity among populations of neurons.\n\nWho discovered brainwaves? What did they think they\u2019d found? Why was there no Nobel Prize?\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

He told no one what he was doing, and he kept his momentous findings secret for five years. As the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s, mental hospitals became the epicenter of forced sterilization and \u201ceuthanasia\u201d to promote \u201cracial hygiene.\u201d Some of the methods developed in these facilities served as a prelude to the industrialized killing in concentration camps. As head of the mental hospital in Jena, Berger would have been in the thick of it. Biographies at the time of my visit stated that Berger committed suicide in 1941 from Nazi persecution\n\n\u2018\u2018Berger was no adherent of Hitler and so he had to relinquish the service of his University; not having expected this, he was gravely hurt\u2026. [This] bestowed upon him a depression which finally killed him,\u2019\u2019 wrote psychiatrist Rudolf Lemke, in a 1956 memorial. Lemke had worked under Berger.\n\nTo me this seemed odd. Wouldn\u2019t the Nazis have dismissed Berger just as they purged 20 percent of German academics in 1933, and ruthlessly expelled or \u201cliquidated\u201d disloyal politicians, administrators and others?\n\nIn Jena I learned that Lemke was in fact a member of the NSDP (Nazi party). He worked at the Erbgesundheits\u00adgericht (Hereditary Health Court) to carry out forced sterilization of the mentally and physically unfit, broadly defined as the physically disabled, psychiatric patients, alcoholics, among others. Like many others in power, Lemke stayed on in Jena after the war, and his antisemitic and antihomosexual views were covered up by authorities. He became director of the Psychiatric Clinic in Jena from 1945 until 1948.\n\nAfter World War II Jena came under control of the Soviet Union, and documents revealing the widespread cover-up were lost or destroyed. When I visited Berger\u2019s hospital I met with neuroscientist Christoph Redies and medical historian Susanne Zimmermann, who had recently obtained Soviet records after the fall of the Berlin wall. They revealed that Berger was, in fact, a Nazi sympathizer. He committed suicide in the hospital, not in protest but because he suffered from depression, she says. In taking his own life, Berger\u2019s death mirrored the suicides of many others at the time who were involved in Nazi atrocities.\n\nLeafing through his dusty laboratory notebooks containing the earliest recordings of human brainwaves, Zimmermann pointed out marginal antisemitic comments he had written alongside them. She then pulled out a stack of records of proceedings in the forced sterilization court where Berger served in an era when \u201ceugenics\u201d sought to cull the \u201cunfit\u201d from parenthood. Hearing them read aloud brought to life the horrors that had taken place there, as people pleaded with the court not to sterilize them or their loved ones. Berger denied every appeal, condemning them all to forced sterilization.\n\nThe hospital in Jena, Germany, where Berger discovered brainwaves. R. Douglas Fields\n\nBerger\u2019s EEG research was not well received. A believer in mental telepathy, Berger thought brainwaves could be the basis for mental telepathy, but he ultimately rejected that idea. Instead, he believed that brainwaves were a type of psychic energy. Like other forms of energy, waves of psychic energy could not be created or destroyed, but they could interact with physical phenomena. Based on this, he surmised that the work of mental cognition would cause temperature changes in the brain. He explored this idea by stabbing rectal thermometers into his mental patients' brains while they did cognitive tasks during surgery.\n\nBerger\u2019s research remained little known outside Germany until 1934 when Nobel Prize\u2013winning neuroscientist Edgar Adrian published his experiments in the prestigious journal Brain. Adrian confirmed that the so-called \u201cBerger waves\u201d do exist, but he implicitly mocked them by showing that they changed in a water beetle when it opened and closed its eyes, in the same way they did in the Nobel Prize\u2013winner\u2019s brain when he did the same. Adrian never did further research on brainwaves.\n\nBerger is credited with the discovery of brainwaves in humans, but studies in animals predated his work. Nor did Berger invent the methods he used to monitor brain activity. He applied techniques used previously in animal experiments by Adolf Beck in Lw\u00f3w, Poland, in 1895, and Angelo Mosel in Turin, Italy.\n\nIn contrast to Berger, Adolf Beck\u2019s animal studies were intended to understand how the brain functions when neurons communicate by electrical impulses. At the peak of his research a Russian invasion halted his scientific work. In 1914 Lw\u00f3w was taken by invading Russians and renamed Lviv. Beck was captured and imprisoned in Kiev, then part of Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\n\nWhile in prison he wrote to the famous Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov appealing for his help, and Pavlov eventually won Beck\u2019s release.\n\nBeck returned to his research in Lviv, and the next logical step was to search for brainwaves in humans, but in World War II Germans invaded. They established a concentration camp in Lviv where the Jewish population was exterminated. As an intellectual and a Jew, Beck was a target. When they came to take Beck to the concentration camp in 1942, he swallowed cyanide, ending his own life rather than having it taken by the Nazis.\n\nRemarkably, both pioneering brainwave scientists committed suicide from Nazism\u2014one as Nazi perpetrator, the other as Nazi victim.\n\nBerger\u2019s grave in Jena. R. Douglas Fields\n\nUnknown to both Berger and Beck, they were not the first to record brainwaves. That discovery was made by a London physician 50 years earlier than Berger! That stunning finding was lost to science because the ideas were so far ahead of their time, dating back to when the brain was an enigma and the world was lit by gas lamps and powered by steam. Imagine how much further ahead brain science and medicine would be now if this scientific discovery made in 1875 had not been lost to history for half a century.\n\nThe first person to discover brainwaves was the London physician Richard Caton. Caton announced his discovery of brainwaves recorded in rabbits and monkey at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1875. He achieved this using a primitive device, a string galvanometer, in which a small mirror is suspended on a thread between magnets. When an electric current (picked up from the brain in this case) passes through the device, the string twists slightly like a compass needle near a magnet. The oscillating electrical currents detected in the brains were not measured in volts, but rather in millimeters of deflection of the light beam bounced off the mirror. The published abstract of his presentation \u201cThe Electric Currents of the Brain\u201d shows that with this primitive instrument the physician correctly deduced the most important aspects of brainwaves. \u201cIn every brain hitherto examined, the galvanometer has indicated the existence of electric currents\u2026. The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function\u2026.\u201d\n\nIronically, I traveled the world to research the discovery of brainwaves, only to find that the first person to do so, Richard Caton, presented his findings in the U.S. in 1887 at Georgetown University while on a visit to his family in Catonsville, Md. The town, which was settled by his relatives 1787, is 30 miles from my home, next to the Baltimore-Washington Airport, from which I often embarked on my global search. But that fact, like his unappreciated brainwave research, was lost to history. \u201cRead my paper on the electrical currents of the brain,\u201d he wrote in his diary. \u201cIt was well received but not understood by most of the audience.\u201d\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

Industries such as e-commerce, healthcare, and education are leveraging AI to provide faster, customized services. By incorporating AI into user interfaces, businesses can improve customer engagement and drive digital transformation.\n\nMicro Frontends\n\nMicro frontends is an architectural approach that breaks down large applications into smaller, independent components. This modular development approach allows developers to work on different parts of the application simultaneously, improving scalability and reducing development time. Micro frontends offer flexibility, enabling teams to manage complex projects more efficiently and deliver faster, more scalable applications.\n\nEdge Computing Integration\n\nEdge computing processes data closer to its source, reducing reliance on centralized servers. This trend enhances application speed and reduces latency, benefiting industries like manufacturing, IoT, and automotive. By integrating edge computing, businesses can create faster and more responsive applications. For front-end developers, incorporating edge computing will be essential to improving user experience and application performance.\n\nSustainability in Design\n\nWith environmental responsibility becoming increasingly important, front-end developers are focusing on creating energy-efficient, sustainable solutions. Optimizing code to reduce energy consumption, minimize data usage, and design lightweight applications are key aspects of sustainable front-end development. These practices not only enhance performance but also help businesses align with sustainability goals, demonstrating their commitment to a greener future.\n\nAugmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR)\n\nAR and VR technologies are transforming user experiences by offering immersive, interactive environments. In sectors like retail, education, and healthcare, businesses are using AR/VR to engage users in new ways. Front-end developers play a crucial role in integrating these technologies into interfaces, ensuring they are functional, visually appealing, and accessible. This trend is reshaping how businesses interact with customers, creating more engaging and memorable experiences.\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Development\n\nLow-code and no-code platforms are revolutionizing application development by enabling non-technical users to build and customize front-end interfaces. These platforms reduce bottlenecks, accelerate development, and allow businesses to bring products to market faster. Front-end developers optimize these platforms, ensuring flexibility, security, and scalability, particularly for small businesses and startups looking to innovate quickly and cost-effectively.\n\nThese trends are shaping the future of front-end development, making it an exciting field that drives digital transformation across industries.\n\nShaping the Future of Digital Transformation\n\nFront-end development now goes beyond design, focusing on creating impactful digital solutions that drive business growth. As industries embrace emerging technologies, the need for skilled professionals increases. Experts like Sarath Krishna Mandava showcase how innovation and expertise can redefine industry standards, ensuring front-end development remains essential in digital transformation for years ahead."

            "article_content": "Early this year, we made some predictions on legal trends for 2024. Now it is time to look back and see where we have been right (+) and where we have been wrong (-), as well as making some new predictions for 2025.\n\nWe've dropped some topics this year, such as Metaverse and NFTs. We did not predict any major developments, there were no major developments, and we don't see these topics booming next year.\n\nBut there's still a Top Ten to cover, so let's go\u2026\n\nImage credit: Adobe\n\n1. Artificial intelligence and copyright\n\nWhat we predicted (+)\n\n\"While the discussion has mainly focused on AI-created audio-visual content so far, it may shift to AI-created game code and databases. At the same time, game companies will continue to explore other use cases for AI.\n\n\"Furthermore, it looks likely, considering the litigation landslide which has already begun in the US and the UK, that continental Europe will see the first Generative AI copyright infringement cases hitting the courts\u2026 Rightsholders who don't want their works to be scraped for AI training should in any event mark their websites accordingly.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nAI is seemingly everywhere. On the legal side, all that we predicted has happened, but maybe a tad slower than what we had thought.\n\nIn the US, there are plenty of legal disputes going on, but Europe is still lagging behind in terms of AI-related disputes.\n\nTwo might be worth noting:\n\nThe Hamburg Regional Court was the first German court to rule on the question of whether the training of AI infringes copyright. It dismissed a photographer's claim, as it held that the use of his photo was covered by the so-called text and data mining exception.\n\nA couple of months earlier, the Prague Municipal Court ruled that an image created by an AI system cannot be protected by copyright. This is in line with the current legal approach in the EU, where only a human creator can claim copyright in their work.\n\nThe AI Act imposes some quite big obligations. For games companies, the need to disclose when users are interacting with AI and to mark AI creations will arguably be the most important\n\nOn the other hand, Europe wants to be in the lead for regulation. The EU is very proud to have passed the EU AI Act as the world's first holistic law on AI, although most of the provisions will only be applicable in 2026. The AI Act imposes some quite big obligations. For games companies, the need to disclose when users are interacting with AI and to mark AI creations will arguably be the most important.\n\nRegulation does not prevent business from using AI. Everyone is really busy exploring the possibilities it brings. So it did not come as a surprise that X is heading in that direction as well. Still, it was maybe not noticed by everybody that as part of the November 15 TOS update, X asks its users for a license to train AI models with user posts. In fact, clause 3 of the new TOS is so wide that the user pretty much consents to X using their posts to create fake news or deepfakes.\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nFor games companies, the discussion on how IP and AI play together is a double-bladed sword. Game developers tend to embrace how AI can be used e.g. to create assets, credible game worlds, for play testing, moderation \u2013 or just to get inspiration. At the same time, leading AI systems readily produce images plainly reproducing game IP.\n\nRiot's Dan D. Nabel told us: \"I expect more developments in copyright/AI litigation (hopefully, we will finally get some useful U.S. decisions on the fair use question).\"\n\nAnd useful guidance is desperately needed!\n\nIn Europe, there is no such thing as \"fair use\", but copyright law has its text and data mining exception (interestingly, design right does not have such an exception). We would expect some more guidance from courts on how exactly companies must reserve their rights, i.e. whether this must be in the form of a robot.txt or another internet protocol, or whether plain text is sufficient (currently, the recommendation would be not to rely on plain text only).\n\nSome more guidance should come from the EU's AI Office, which has put together working groups to develop a General-Purpose AI Code of Practise, which deals for example with copyright and transparency.\n\nWe would also hope to see more guidance on AI and data protection (there is a statement from the data protection authority of Hamburg which gives a glimpse of an AI-friendly attitude \u2013 more on that below in the data protection section of this article).\n\nUbisoft and others are working on a believable AI for NPCs. This might raise legal discussions about the transparency obligations towards natural persons under the AI Act, even if these do not come into force until 2026.\n\nFinally, games companies must expect that their freelancers and subcontractors are using AI. If the respective contracts don't already deal with this subject, it is high time to update them now. (Most bigger companies have done that already.)\n\n2. Online platform regulation\n\nWhat we predicted (+)\n\n\"Games companies will work against the February 17, 2024 deadline to become Digital Services Act compliant, trying to navigate among the multiple layers of obligations and duties that the never-so-complex EU framework is now providing for. Still, in 2024, we expect the EU Commission to first concentrate on the high-risk category of very large online platforms, not necessarily on games. Games companies will not get away unnoticed, but may not be the first being targeted in early 2024.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nThe European Commission targeted very large online platforms at least as fiercely as expected. Among other things, the European Commission opened formal proceedings against TikTok because of its algorithmic systems that may stimulate behavioral addictions. No game or games service has been designated as a very large online platform so far (to be considered as such, it must have on average at least 45 million monthly users in the EU.) And no major enforcement action against games companies have become publicly known.\n\nStill game companies did ask themselves whether their games are online platforms or not under the DSA. Surprise: It depends, mainly on what kind of user information is stored on the servers, and whether that's disseminated to the public.\n\nAt the same time, Digital Services Coordinators (the public authorities in charge of enforcing the Digital Services Act in the EU Member States) have been set up, and \u2013 at least in countries such as Germany, Ireland and France \u2013 formally or informally reached out to some games companies.\n\nRegulation does not prevent business from using AI. Everyone is really busy exploring the possibilities it brings\n\nGermany has taken bureaucracy madness to the next level and not only appointed one digital services coordinator but three. Germany's implementation act designates the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) as competent Digital Services Coordinator for general matters in Germany. It also designates the Federal Agency for the Protection of Children and Young Persons in the Media (BzKJ) as the competent authority for the protection of minors on online platforms, and finally the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragter) for advertising based on online profiling.\n\nThe BzKJ, by the way, is the institution which can put games on the \"index\" if they are too violent (you may remember that the German versions of games sometimes had green blood in the past). Still, now they have extended competences and they have set up an independent office (KidD) to monitor youth protection measures of online platforms. KidD has started its work right away and published a guideline for youth protection compliance for online platforms under the DSA (an English summary can be found here)\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nThe DSA will likely become more relevant for the protection of minors and for games companies, at least those which qualify as online platforms. This might have the potential to spill over to other jurisdictions. Accordingly, Riot's Dan D. Nabel told us: \"For 2025, among other things, I expect to see more legislative attempts to 'protect the children' through platform regulation.\"\n\nIt seems pretty sure to us that the DSA and its compliance will become increasingly important. While we do not expect any early rulings on the role of any particular online game under the DSA, the authorities will start to take a closer look at popular games and ask game companies for more information.\n\nFor online platforms, the EU Commission intends to publish guidelines in 2025 which deal with the protection of minors.\n\nImage credit: Adobe\n\n3. Terms of Use / EULAs and Consumer Protection\n\nWhat we predicted (+)\n\n\"If teeth have not been shown in 2023, it might have been only because the new legislation was too fresh and maybe also too complex to digest easily. We should expect teeth to come out more, as soon as both consumers and the competent agencies in the EU member countries will become more familiar and experienced with the new rules in the daily practice.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nMajor games companies have been accused of misleading consumers into spending money by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC). BEUC's main point is premium in-game currency \u2013 for example, it says that prices should be displayed not only in virtual currency, but also in real-world currency.\n\nHowever, while the focus of this complaint is premium in-game currencies, BEUC also examined Terms of Service of these games and, hardly surprising, was unhappy (the lack of surprise does not mean that games companies were so bad, but consumer protection organization are rarely ever happy if they pick up a topic publicly). BEUC held that EU consumers waive too many of their statutory rights and that some of the terms are not comprehensible. In particular, terms that allow game companies to modify or withdraw game features often go beyond what is legally acceptable, BEUC argues.\n\nBEUC argues Terms of Use that allow game companies to modify or withdraw game features often go beyond what is legally acceptable\n\nSame topic, different remedies in California. While BEUC essentially argues that consumers \"purchase\" virtual currency, but are deprived of the rights they should have in \"purchased\" goods, California recognizes the nature of virtual goods, but expects that companies make it clear they are not \"purchased\".\n\nBut the EU is determined to make this big topic even bigger! In its Digital Fairness Fitness Check (who came up with that name?), the European Commission expressed its concern that the use of intermediate in-app virtual currencies distorts the real value of the in-app transaction for consumers and encourages them to spend more than they intended. Moreover, the Digital Fairness Fitness Check consultations pointed to concerns about the marketing practices related to virtual items, including the presentation of prices, time-based offers, pay-to-win models and more.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised about the sunset of a game's live services which may lead to the loss of purchased virtual items. In this context, the server shutdown of The Crew, which was no longer playable as an always-on game, caused a stir and even led to an EU petition to 'stop killing video games'.\n\nGames are now also firmly on the radar of consumer protection authorities in the EU member states, who have started enforcement actions against games companies. For example, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has imposed sanctions against Epic Games for alleged unfair commercial practices aimed at children in Fortnite.\n\nThe German consumer protection organization Vzbv is also looking at the games industry.\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nThe renaissance of consumer law enforcement against games companies will continue. Many of these cases will be settled behind closed doors, but consumer organizations are prepared to go to court if necessary.\n\nWhile this may sound like bad news, arguably it might still be preferable to more and more legislation from EU lawmakers or, even worse, on a national level. The European Commission, however, seems to be determined to propose a new Digital Fairness Act.\n\n4. Loot Boxes (+/-)\n\nWhat we predicted\n\n\"Riot's Dan D. Nabel told us: \"'Dark patterns' investigations will increase, as will scrutiny of monetization methods, including loot boxes.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the Austrian rulings will be upheld. In this case, claimants \u2013 again, backed by litigation financiers \u2013 will try the same in other jurisdictions. However, we expect more outright loot box bans (like in Belgium and as announced in the Netherlands) and more sanctions for game operators (as happened lately in Austria).\n\nWhat happened\n\nDan got it right, we didn't.\n\nThe BEUC complaint mentioned above essentially is about monetization methods, even though the overly used term \"dark patterns\" is not used (and loot boxes are not discussed in this complaint either).\n\nIn Germany, there were ongoing discussions on tightening the regime for loot boxes, i.e. applying gambling laws to them, which would come close to a ban. However, contrary to what we had predicted, there was no outright ban.\n\nGames companies must expect that their freelancers and subcontractors are using AI. If the respective contracts don't already deal with this subject, it is high time to update them now\n\nIn fact, there was another decision in Austria about EA Sports' soccer simulation game (in this case: FIFA 23), but this time in favor of EA Sports. The court held that the plaintiff did not purchase the Ultimate Team packs with the intention of selling the included footballers and thereby making a profit. Consequently, no \"economic risk\" was taken, as is required to fall under the definition of gambling.\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nWe don't think the discussion on loot boxes will stop, but it might be overshadowed by the wider digital fairness discussion we mentioned in the consumer protection section above.\n\n5. Unfinished products, product description, onscreen texts, and right of withdrawal (+/-)\n\nWhat we predicted\n\n\"We still think these are relevant issues, but the attention for them seems to have gone away quicker than what we had thought. Maybe they'll stay under the radar for a while.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nTick, but a small one. Some game companies had included a waiver on the right of withdrawal in their T&Cs which was criticized by BEUC (cf. above) but that's all.\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nThe right of withdrawal in particular will be one aspect of the wider consumer protection topic discussed above.\n\n6. Clones and other IP disputes (+/-)\n\nWhat we predicted\n\n\"Clones and IP disputes will continue to be a major issue. They might actually be booming due to the use of AI.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon vs Palworld case made the headlines \u2013 largely because it is a patent case, while cloned game cases are typically about copyright and competition law.\n\nAlso beyond this Pok\u00e9mon vs Palworld dispute, clones are a major issue (as we had predicted) but AI did not seem to play a decisive role. As far as we are aware, AI is not yet used to detect cloned games in the same way it is used in other areas to detect infringements online (e.g. hate speech), and it seems that AI did not have a central role in the creating of clones either.\n\nMany clones are always found in the Google Play Store and in the Apple App Store. Despite the Digital Services Act, it can still be a pain (or a game of luck) getting even the most blatant copies taken down. It can even be hard to get the names and addresses of the clone publishers from Apple or Google, even though the Digital Services Act imposes \"know your business customer\" obligations on online marketplace providers.\n\nIn October, The European Court of Justice ruled that a cheat software which only changes the content of the variables temporarily transferred in the RAM which is used during the running of the game does not fall within the protection of the Directive on the legal protection of computer programs (Directive 2009/24/EC). However, this does not mean that cheat software is generally legal (Why the European Court of Justice's decision on cheats is not a milestone | Opinion | GamesIndustry.biz).\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nIP has been a core topic for games companies since \u2026 forever, and so have IP disputes. They will continue to be very relevant, even though in public perception, these issues might be overshadowed by consumer protection, and trust and safety.\n\nAs for clones, we hope that Google and Apple will at least come closer to DSA compliance \u2013 having valid contact data from clone publishers could be a game changer in the app space. On the other hand, for high value productions, there still is a lack of reliable case law, and we don't expect a landmark case being decided by the courts next year either.\n\nBut IP disputes go well beyond clones. We expect litigation against cheat bots to remain important. Also, as Nintendo reached a favorable agreement against another Switch emulator, other emulators will be under scrutiny as well \u2013 the case also showcases that IP can help games companies in many respects.\n\nFinally, we expect that not all games companies will tolerate their IP showing up in AI output, and someone will test the waters unless AI system providers are helpful.\n\nImage credit: Epic Games\n\n7. Market dominance and platforms (+)\n\nWhat we predicted\n\n\"One general counsel told us that he expects 'fights over DMA implementation in Europe with far reaching consequences to the industry and revisiting regulation over advertising in interactive entertainment' to be the hot topics for 2024.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nEpic Games launched its own app store for iPhones and Android in Europe. The launch was possible thanks to the provisions of the Digital Markets Act which obliges gatekeepers to open their core platform services to third parties. Alphabet and Apple were designated as gatekeepers by the European Commission in September 2023.\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nFurther app stores might follow, but that is hard to predict.\n\nImage credit: Roblox\n\n8. Youth protection beyond blood and violence (+/-)\n\nWhat we predicted\n\n\"The regime will get ever tighter. Notably the EU Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse, which is coming up on the horizon, is set to bring new obligations for communication features.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nWe do not have a framework Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse yet. It was controversially discussed and there is still no statement by the Council of the European Union on it. However, the youth protection regime became tighter due to other regulation such as the Digital Services Act.\n\nIt can be a pain (or a game of luck) getting the most blatant copies taken down, or even getting the names and addresses of the clone publishers from Apple or Google\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nA European General Counsel told us: \"Calls on video game companies to employ age verification methods will likely continue in 2025. However, age verification is not a universal remedy and needs to work on an international level as well as without interfering with users' privacy. Instead of setting up new requirements that may be disproportionate, voluntary approaches that have proven to be effective and that respect both the parental autonomy and the children's right to participate should be strengthened. The majority of video games are suitable for minors and parental controls are widely available free of charge.\"\n\nAddictive design will also become a major topic for digital games and apps in 2025, if it is not already. The European Commission has expressed its legal opinion that digital interfaces which can cause mental harm can also fall under the General Product Safety Regulation, which has been applicable for a few weeks now. In general, there are more and more legal frameworks that have become applicable to games.\n\n9. Data protection (-)\n\nWhat we predicted\n\n\"Mr Schrems, the Austrian gentlemen who made the European Court of Justice cancel the existing instruments for data transfer to the US (i.e. Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield) will certainly not give up his fight and tackle the EU-US Privacy Framework. Groundhog day!\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nSurprisingly. there are no public sources that confirm that Mr Schrems actually did take action. Instead, there were quite some discussions on using personal data for the training of AI.\n\nThe Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information has published a discussion paper on \"Large Language Models and personal data\", in which the authority holds that the mere storage of a large language model (LLM) does not constitute processing according to the GDPR. This is because the so-called tokenization of the input splits all texts into small fragments, so that in most cases it is no longer possible to establish a personal reference, also because the LLM does not contain any whole words.\n\nThe authority also states that if personal data is processed during training and/or output, these processing operations must comply with the requirements of the GDPR. However, training the LLM in violation of data protection regulations should not affect the legality of the use of an LLM in an AI system. The input splits all texts into small fragments, so that in most cases it is no longer possible to establish a personal reference, and the LLM does not contain any whole words.\n\nThe authority also states that if personal data is processed during training and/or output, these processing operations must comply with the requirements of the GDPR. However, training the LLM in violation of data protection regulations should not affect the legality of the use of an LLM in an AI system. Due to the lack of storage of personal data in the LLM, the rights of data subjects under the GDPR could not apply to the model itself. Claims for information, erasure or rectification should rather be addressed to the entity responsible for input and output.\n\nAlso, the need to implement trust and safety mechanisms posed challenges from a privacy law perspective. To give a few examples: age verification / age assurance is desirable or in some cases/countries even required under youth protection law might be challenging under privacy laws. Monitoring in-game communication is good against hate speech, stalking and cyber-bullying, for example, but privacy laws and potentially even the telecommunication secret must be kept in mind.\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nWe still think that Mr Schrems will be back, but as no decisions are to be expected in the short-term, the trust and safety aspect might be more pressing.\n\n10. Esports (+/-)\n\nWhat we predicted\n\n\"Match-fixing and cheating will remain one of the most important matters when it comes to the integrity of esports. Alongside that, we predict that there will be discussions on the principal legal admissibility of esports betting and, as every year, on the non-profit status of esports organizations in Germany. At this point, we would like to bet that little will happen in this regard either.\"\n\nWhat happened\n\nThere were not as many discussions on esports betting as we had expected. However, Riot Games has officially allowed its partnered esports teams to have betting sponsors as of 2025 (which is why we would argue to get a little tick).\n\nRockstar has a good track record in being sued by wannabe celebrities. It would really be disappointing if no B-celebrity recognizes themselves in GTA 6\n\nMoreover, Riot Games launched a new Dispute Resolution Mechanism for legal disputes between players, coaches and teams in Riot Games' Tier1 and Tier2 esports leagues.\n\nNothing happened with regard to the non-profit status of esports organizations in Germany, but we'll be happy to report whether some promises can be found in the plans of Germany's next government.\n\nFinally, Valve took action against a professional CS:GO player and banned him for life \u2013 the Paris Appelation Court approved this sanction. The player had betted on his own match and deliberately lost it.\n\nWhat will happen in 2025\n\nThe International Olympics Committee announced that there will be Olympic Esports Games in 2025, which will take place in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, betting on \"something about integrity\" would be a no-brainer. Perhaps, there is some legislation on doping in esports.\n\nMatch-fixing and cheating will be relevant \u2013 again. In addition, cybersecurity might play a more important role. With the new Cyber Resilience Act, which entered into force in December, new cyber security requirements apply basically to all kinds of hardware and software that can be connected to other devices or networks. However, the Regulation will be fully applicable not before December 11, 2027.\n\nNew trends\n\nPolitical and social discussions invaded games in 2024. There were heated discussions on Dragon Age Veilguard, and whether Russian games should be boycotted. Heated political discussions can have an impact on game design, but also on content moderation, unless the game developers ban all political content.\n\nAs already mentioned last year, the clash of regulations will cause headaches. Compliance won't become easier with all the new regulations on the horizon, e.g. there is seriously a lot on its way in terms of cyber security, and accessibility.\n\nBut frankly, the hot topic for 2025 will not be new regulation \u2013 everyone is looking for what comes from Nintendo after Switch, and for GTA 6. So far, Rockstar has a good track record in being sued by wannabe celebrities. It would really be disappointing if no B-celebrity recognizes themselves in GTA 6."

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nAs the world races towards 2025, Developer examines what lies ahead for software development in the new year.\n\nAmong the most pressing trends for 2025 are AI development simplification, the integration of cross-functional engineering teams, and the evolution of DevSecOps practices. These shifts promise to redefine how companies approach innovation, security, and efficiency in their development pipelines.\n\nAI-powered development simplification\n\nAvthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale, predicts a significant transformation in the tech stack landscape by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe traditional tech stack will continue to collapse,\u201d Sewrathan notes, highlighting advancements driven by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development. This shift is anticipated to empower engineers of all skill levels to create impactful AI applications with ease.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, the traditional tech stack will continue to collapse, fueled by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development,\u201d Sewrathan explains. \u201cCompanies that deliver frictionless, accessible solutions with low barriers to entry will empower engineers to create impactful AI apps, no matter their level of expertise.\u201d\n\nThis democratisation of AI app creation is expected to increase competition within the industry as more developers gain access to advanced capabilities. Consistency and reliability in AI applications are also set to become paramount.\n\n\u201cAs AI apps become central to everyday interactions in 2025, consistency and reliability will take precedence,\u201d Sewrathan observes.\n\nDeveloper role evolution\n\nIndu Keri, General Manager and Head of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud at Nutanix, envisions a new era of software development starting in 2025.\n\n\u201cSoftware development and engineering is already being democratised with tools like Copilot,\u201d Keri says.\n\nBy combining GenAI with low-code solutions, code will be abstracted to the point of irrelevance. AI will generate applications rather than code, enabling developers to step into strategic roles.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day for developers will change drastically,\u201d Keri notes. \u201cNo longer hamstrung by grunt work, developers will step into an up-leveled, strategic role\u2014communicating with decision-makers about how tech can solve business problems.\u201d\n\nThis evolution, Keri argues, complements developers\u2019 best qualities \u2013 creativity and innovation \u2013 and challenges them to grow into leadership roles within their organisations.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, engineers at any level will be able to create an AI app through the widespread availability of APIs and models,\u201d Sewrathan adds. \u201cBut the differentiators will be consistency, usability, and customer impact.\u201d\n\nAgentic AI and DevOps automation\n\nThe hype around agentic AI will reach boiling point in 2025 as organisations bundle specialised agents for different stages of software delivery, including code generation, testing, and quality assurance. This orchestrator-driven approach will drive a more intelligent approach to DevOps automation.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, says: \u201cInstead of having one, basic GenAI assistant, organisations will bundle together specialised agents for the different stages of software delivery\u2014such as code generation, testing, and quality assurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne agent will act as the orchestrator, directing the others and producing more accurate insights into the end-to-end process.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Coutinho of OutSystems highlights that agentic AI will answer many, but not all, business problems: \u201cFor the last few years, businesses have tried to throw GenAI at all of their problems. The result: GenAI is a remarkable solution for many use cases, but not everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn AI tool is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. Just because tech titans are pushing agentic AI right now doesn\u2019t mean you should scrap simpler solutions. Align your AI strategy with your organisation\u2019s needs, rather than the latest shiny object.\u201d\n\nIntegration of cross-functional engineering teams\n\nMoving beyond AI development, the prediction for cross-functional engineering teams is another area of significant change. Reynolds outlines a future where standalone DevOps teams are phased out in favour of more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, organisations will move away from standalone DevOps teams towards more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines,\u201d Reynolds explains.\n\nThis shift towards unified cross-functional teams is expected to eliminate the remaining silos between software delivery teams and accelerate innovation at a whole new level. To support these integrated teams, organisations will increasingly adopt unified platforms providing capabilities across the entire software delivery lifecycle\u2014from CI/CD to chaos engineering and cloud cost management.\n\nIn line with these platform shifts, Reynolds emphasises the importance of Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) that enable engineers to self-serve the solutions and data they need.\n\n\u201cTo maximise the value of these platforms,\u201d Reynolds advises,\u201c[organisations] will expose these capabilities through IDPs.\u201d\n\nEvolution of DevSecOps practices\n\nThe software development landscape is also witnessing a significant evolution in DevSecOps practices.\n\nDylan Thomas, Senior Director of Product Engineering at OpenText Cybersecurity, predicts that, by 2025, DevSecOps will evolve beyond the \u201cshift-left\u201d paradigm to embrace a more mature \u201cshift everywhere\u201d approach.\n\nThis shift will require organisations to apply the right tools at the right stages of the DevSecOps cycle, improving efficiency and effectiveness in security practices.\n\n\u201cLightweight analysis in IDEs will help developers catch issues early,\u201d Thomas elaborates. \u201cAutomation integrated into pull requests and CI/CD pipelines will ensure a cohesive \u2018integrate once\u2019 approach for core functions such as SAST, SCA, and increasingly DAST, particularly for API security testing.\u201d\n\nThis integration is expected to streamline the development process while enhancing overall security.\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) maturity\n\nOne of the critical components in this evolving landscape is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).\n\nGovernment mandates are driving organisations to adopt SBOMs at scale, requiring them not only to generate these documents but also to make them actionable.\n\nWhile producing SBOMs in standard formats is now routine, the real challenge lies in translating raw data into meaningful risk-based insights.\n\nDevSecOps practices will mature, leveraging tools like VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) to add critical context to SBOMs\u2014reducing inefficiencies in vendor-consumer relationships and enhancing overall security posture.\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s role in managing complex data types\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s extension capabilities are also anticipated to play a significant role in managing complex data types in one place.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, PostgreSQL will solidify its position as the go-to \u2018everything database\u2019\u2014the first to fully integrate AI functionality like embeddings directly within its core ecosystem,\u201d says Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale.\n\n\u201cThis will streamline data workflows, eliminate the need for external processing tools, and enable businesses to manage complex data types in one place.\u201d\n\nAs companies move towards integrated solutions that can handle diverse datasets without relying on standalone or specialised databases, PostgreSQL is leading the charge towards this future state.\n\nDiverse app stores will reshape mobile distribution\n\nThe app store ecosystem is poised for a significant shift as mobile carriers are expected to regain their influence over app distribution.\n\nMatt Tubergen, EVP of Global Strategy & Partnerships at Digital Turbine, said: \u201cThe app store ecosystem is set to shift away from an Apple and Google duopoly to an open landscape as mobile carriers regain the power to connect consumers with apps.\u201d\n\nEmerging regulatory changes are also playing a critical role in leveling the playing field. These include bans that prevent tech giants like Google from incentivising app store preloads, which allow carriers and device manufacturers to preload their own apps on new devices.\n\nThis newfound autonomy positions carriers as pivotal players in alternative app distribution.\n\n\u201cThis renewed autonomy positions carriers as critical players in alternative app distribution, enabling organic growth for alternative app stores,\u201d Tubergen notes.\n\nCarriers are expected to offer developers better revenue opportunities than those provided by Apple and Google, while consumers will benefit from a more diverse selection of apps.\n\nTubergen points out that \u201cthe new, open app store economy will prioritise the needs of developers and users, shifting away from the current model that only serves Apple and Google.\u201d This shift promises a competitive and decentralised landscape where developers gain more control over their revenue streams.\n\nConsumers are expected to enjoy access to a wider variety of apps curated and tailored to their preferences. With third-party app stores gaining influence and major players like Epic Games and Microsoft advocating for inclusivity, the global app distribution model is likely to expand and mirror the thriving alternative stores seen in Asia.\n\nThis evolution promises an inclusive, innovative, and consumer-focused mobile distribution ecosystem.\n\nEmergence of xOps\n\nThe convergence of DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps into a new \u201cxOps\u201d paradigm is expected as more traditional applications adopt AI capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u2018AI-aware\u2019 Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities,\u201d explains Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai.\n\nIncreasing security challenges\n\nWhile AI-generated code can significantly increase developer efficiency, it also introduces security risks due to increased volume of code that must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors.\n\n\u201cWhile research has shown that generative AI can halve the time it takes developers to complete coding tasks, the increased volume of code being produced must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors,\u201d warns Holt.\n\n\u201cThis will increase security risk and lead to additional toil in the later stages of delivery, wiping out any efficiency gains from AI-generated code.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable increase in supply-chain attacks. This is likely to continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nAaron Costello, Chief of SaaS Security Research at AppOmni, observes: \u201cThe past few years, we\u2019ve seen a steady uptick in supply-chain attacks on SaaS through compromised third-party applications. As a result, organisations are placing these integrations and their requested access levels under far more scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy research into data exposures has shown that often no initial foothold is needed for threat actors to gain access to the sensitive data they want. The combination of undocumented legacy API endpoints, over-privileged public access, and gaps in vendor logging capabilities will continue to provide a dangerously effective option for threat actors to execute hit-and-run style attacks.\u201d\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny\n\nDespite the increasing security challenges, a failure to secure software could have ever more serious repercussions. In light of increasing awareness and demand for reliable software systems, developers must prepare for heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, comments: \u201cIn the wake of the CrowdStrike outage, there will be an increase in regulatory pressure around poor-quality software.\u201d\n\nGlobal regulators are expected to introduce more stringent standards that extend beyond existing frameworks like the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). This response is driven by a growing sentiment among consumers; a recent survey conducted by Harness found that ~74% of consumers believe there should be regulations holding companies accountable for poor-quality software updates leading to IT outages.\n\nTo navigate these impending regulatory changes, organisations supporting critical infrastructure \u2013 such as banking, healthcare, and energy services \u2013 must proactively enhance their software testing protocols.\n\n\u201cThey will need well-defined response plans to ensure they can recover quickly when the unexpected happens,\u201d Reynolds notes. Implementing modern software delivery practices is crucial, including feature flags and canary deployments, which enable continuous improvement in code quality and more stable release cycles.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, organisations not only bolster software resilience but also enhance trust and brand loyalty among consumers. As regulations evolve to emphasise software reliability akin to cybersecurity standards, being proactive will be key to supporting business growth and staying ahead of regulatory measures. This approach not only mitigates risks but positions companies favorably in a landscape where quality is increasingly synonymous with competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the predictions for 2025 paint a picture of an industry bracing for radical transformation\u2014driven by advancements in AI development, cross-functional engineering teams, and mature DevSecOps practices. These changes promise to accelerate innovation while enhancing security and user experience across industries.\n\nSee also: PostgreSQL becomes developers\u2019 choice for AI and real-time apps\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?

            "article_content": "Cybersecurity experts talk to Code Red Communications\u2019 Robin Campbell-Burt about the challenges and opportunities of AI in the sector for the coming year.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that artificial intelligence (AI) has made its mark this year. From AI-powered protein-folding models managing medical mysteries, to autonomous vehicles now in use in multiple cities, the pace of AI and machine learning (ML) innovation around the world has been staggering.\n\nBut some would say the hype, or as Mike Britton, CIO of Abnormal Security puts it, \u201cgold rush\u201d, for AI is well and truly over. And with great advancement, often comes great risk, with AI-powered cyberattacks and deepfake scams reaching unprecedented levels of sophistication.\n\n\u201cAI-enhanced threats will take many forms, from phishing emails generated with flawless grammar and personal details to highly adaptive malware that can learn and evade detection systems,\u201d says Merium Khalid, director SOC Offensive Security at Barracuda.\n\nKhalid is not alone in her thinking, as Pedram Amini, chief scientist at OPSWAT believes that next year, \u201cML-assisted scams will increase significantly in their volume, quality and believability\u201d.\n\nBut what kind of AI issues should we be most worried about as we head into the new year, and what impact will this have on organisations and the industry alike? We asked a range of industry experts this very question, to help you feel more prepared for the year ahead.\n\nA new wave of AI risks and threats\n\n\u201cIn 2025, we expect to see more AI-driven cyberthreats designed to evade detection, including more advanced evasion techniques bypassing endpoint detection and response (EDR), known as EDR killers, and traditional defences,\u201d Khalid argues.\n\n\u201cAttackers may use legitimate applications like PowerShell and remote access tools to deploy ransomware, making detection harder for standard security solutions.\u201d\n\nOn a more frightening note, Michael Adjei, director of systems engineering at Illumio, believes that AI will offer somewhat of a field day for social engineers, who will trick people into actually creating breaches themselves: \u201cOrdinary users will, in effect, become unwitting participants in mass attacks in 2025.\n\n\u2018Too much noise drowns out the real threats\u2019\n\n\u201cSocial engineers will exploit popular applications, social media features and even AI tools to deceive people into inadvertently running exploits for web-based or script-based vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nAdjei expects that \u201cattackers will employ a dual-use strategy, where a legitimate tool or application operates as expected but harbours malicious intent in the background\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis approach will make victims appear culpable in potential mass exploitation incidents, enabling the true attacker to remain concealed in the shadows.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom however, with experts still hopeful of the potential AI can offer us.\n\nAI and the future of education\n\nSuraj Mohandas, VP of strategy at Jamf, feels that AI is a double-edged sword when it comes to educating tomorrow\u2019s professionals, as they\u2019re \u201cseeing a fundamental shift in how technology and mobile devices are being utilised in the classroom\u201d.\n\nThe levels of improved teaching that AI can provide is truly exciting. \u201cAdministrators and teachers have moved beyond teaching technology skills (and having to be taught technology skills themselves) to using technology to enhance learning across all subjects,\u201d Mohandas said.\n\nHowever, these benefits don\u2019t come without risks, argues Mohandas. \u201cA major downside of AI is that attackers are leveraging the technology to step up the speed and specificity of their attacks.\n\n\u201cThe attacks are getting more and more targeted, and the more student-specific data attackers can get their hands on to fuel the specificity of their attacks, the more attacks they\u2019ll launch \u2026 and the more successful those attacks will be.\u201d\n\nIn order to keep students safe, Mohandas believes there\u2019ll need to be \u201ca strong push for more safety mechanisms to be installed on student devices, specifically when it comes to data protection, threat prevention and privacy controls\u201d.\n\n\u201cEducational institutions will be encouraged (or perhaps required) to improve encryption protocols and access controls, use AI-powered threat detection to fight AI-powered attacks, use systems that provide real-time alerts, and step up their game when it comes to student data privacy.\u201d\n\nThe education sector will be empowered by AI, and simultaneously need to ramp up their defences against AI-driven attacks to stay safe, but what about businesses?\n\n\u2018Orgs need to be ready\u2019\n\nMax Vetter, VP of cyber at Immersive Labs, says that \u201corganisations need to be ready\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith greater adoption of AI will come increased cyberthreats, and security teams need to remain nimble, confident and knowledgeable.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Britton argues that teams \u201cwill need to undergo a dedicated effort around understanding how [AI] can deliver results\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo do this, businesses should start by identifying which parts of their workflows are highly manual, which can help them determine how AI can be overlaid to improve efficiency. Key to this will be determining what success looks like. Is it better efficiency? Reduced cost?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ori Bendet, VP of product management at Checkmarx, believes it\u2019s important to fix what matters most. \u201cToo much noise drowns out the real threats,\u201d Bendet says.\n\n\u201cNext year will see more organisations focusing on consolidating their stack to reduce complexity and the noise. If you can\u2019t fix everything \u2013 which in terms of cybersecurity is the reality that most organisations are faced with \u2013 then you need to focus on fixing what most matters to your business.\u201d\n\nCyberattacks are expensive, and their increasing frequency, partly fuelled by AI, means that organisations will also need to consider future costs and regulatory requirements imposed by governments.\n\nPierre Samson, co-founder and CRO of Hackuity, believes it will be vital to find a balance. \u201cHitting the big cybersecurity compliance deadlines \u2013 NIS2 and DORA \u2013 was top of the agenda for many organisations in 2024 (and still will be in 2025). This meant devoting significant budgets where it was most needed to meet the requirements,\u201d Samson says.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges for next year will be balancing cybersecurity spend: ticking the boxes on compliance while addressing the security gaps that matter most for each individual organisation. Compliance demands, whilst absolutely necessary, shouldn\u2019t distract security leaders from focussing on these more strategic issues.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear then that the rapid advancements in AI present both golden opportunities and formidable challenges. While AI continues to revolutionise industries, enhance efficiency and transform education, it also exposes new vulnerabilities that cyber criminals will be quick to exploit.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025, we must all prepare for a landscape where AI-driven threats become more sophisticated, targeted and pervasive than ever before. Proactive cybersecurity measures, prioritisation and leveraging AI to counteract its own risks will be key to navigating this winding path with resilience. The future of AI is undoubtedly exciting, but vigilance and adaptability will be key to ensuring it remains a force for good.\n\nBy Robin Campbell-Burt\n\nRobin Campbell-Burt is CEO of Code Red Communications.

            "article_content": "The centennial of the discovery of brain waves in humans exposes a chilling tale involving Nazis, war between Russia and Ukraine, suicide and the vicissitudes of history\n\nThis year is the centennial of the discovery of human brain waves. Few people know the story of that startling finding, because the true story was suppressed and lost to history. Almost two decades ago I visited the pioneering scientists\u2019 labs in Germany and Italy seeking answers. What I learned overturned accepted history and exposed a chilling tale involving Nazis, brainwaves, war between Russia and Ukraine, and suicide. This history resonates with current events\u2014Russia and Ukraine recently passed a grim 1,000-day milestone of a conflict waged on a pretext of battling Nazis\u2014revealing how history, science and society are intricately entwined.\n\nHuman brainwaves, oscillating waves of electricity that constantly sweep through brain tissue, change with our thoughts and perceptions. Their value in medicine is incalculable. They reveal all manner of neurological and psychological disorders to doctors and guide neurosurgeons\u2019 hands when extracting diseased brain tissue that triggers seizures. Only newly appreciated, their role in the healthy brain is transforming our fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information. Like waves of all types, the electrical waves sweeping through the brain generate synchrony (think of water waves bobbing boats); in the case of brainwaves, what\u2019s synchronized is activity among populations of neurons.\n\nWho discovered brainwaves? What did they think they\u2019d found? Why was there no Nobel Prize?\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nIn the most common accounts, a reclusive physician, Hans Berger, recorded the first human brainwaves from his patients in a mental hospital in the German city of Jena in 1924 (later part of East Germany). He told no one what he was doing, and he kept his momentous findings secret for five years. As the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s, mental hospitals became the epicenter of forced sterilization and \u201ceuthanasia\u201d to promote \u201cracial hygiene.\u201d Some of the methods developed in these facilities served as a prelude to the industrialized killing in concentration camps. As head of the mental hospital in Jena, Berger would have been in the thick of it. Biographies at the time of my visit stated that Berger committed suicide in 1941 from Nazi persecution\n\n\u2018\u2018Berger was no adherent of Hitler and so he had to relinquish the service of his University; not having expected this, he was gravely hurt\u2026. [This] bestowed upon him a depression which finally killed him,\u2019\u2019 wrote psychiatrist Rudolf Lemke, in a 1956 memorial. Lemke had worked under Berger.\n\nTo me this seemed odd. Wouldn\u2019t the Nazis have dismissed Berger just as they purged 20 percent of German academics in 1933, and ruthlessly expelled or \u201cliquidated\u201d disloyal politicians, administrators and others?\n\nIn Jena I learned that Lemke was in fact a member of the NSDP (Nazi party). He worked at the Erbgesundheits\u00adgericht (Hereditary Health Court) to carry out forced sterilization of the mentally and physically unfit, broadly defined as the physically disabled, psychiatric patients, alcoholics, among others. Like many others in power, Lemke stayed on in Jena after the war, and his antisemitic and antihomosexual views were covered up by authorities. He became director of the Psychiatric Clinic in Jena from 1945 until 1948.\n\nAfter World War II Jena came under control of the Soviet Union, and documents revealing the widespread cover-up were lost or destroyed. When I visited Berger\u2019s hospital I met with neuroscientist Christoph Redies and medical historian Susanne Zimmermann, who had recently obtained Soviet records after the fall of the Berlin wall. They revealed that Berger was, in fact, a Nazi sympathizer. He committed suicide in the hospital, not in protest but because he suffered from depression, she says. In taking his own life, Berger\u2019s death mirrored the suicides of many others at the time who were involved in Nazi atrocities.\n\nLeafing through his dusty laboratory notebooks containing the earliest recordings of human brainwaves, Zimmermann pointed out marginal antisemitic comments he had written alongside them. She then pulled out a stack of records of proceedings in the forced sterilization court where Berger served in an era when \u201ceugenics\u201d sought to cull the \u201cunfit\u201d from parenthood. Hearing them read aloud brought to life the horrors that had taken place there, as people pleaded with the court not to sterilize them or their loved ones. Berger denied every appeal, condemning them all to forced sterilization.\n\nThe hospital in Jena, Germany, where Berger discovered brainwaves. R. Douglas Fields\n\nBerger\u2019s EEG research was not well received. A believer in mental telepathy, Berger thought brainwaves could be the basis for mental telepathy, but he ultimately rejected that idea. Instead, he believed that brainwaves were a type of psychic energy. Like other forms of energy, waves of psychic energy could not be created or destroyed, but they could interact with physical phenomena. Based on this, he surmised that the work of mental cognition would cause temperature changes in the brain. He explored this idea by stabbing rectal thermometers into his mental patients' brains while they did cognitive tasks during surgery.\n\nBerger\u2019s research remained little known outside Germany until 1934 when Nobel Prize\u2013winning neuroscientist Edgar Adrian published his experiments in the prestigious journal Brain. Adrian confirmed that the so-called \u201cBerger waves\u201d do exist, but he implicitly mocked them by showing that they changed in a water beetle when it opened and closed its eyes, in the same way they did in the Nobel Prize\u2013winner\u2019s brain when he did the same. Adrian never did further research on brainwaves.\n\nBerger is credited with the discovery of brainwaves in humans, but studies in animals predated his work. Nor did Berger invent the methods he used to monitor brain activity. He applied techniques used previously in animal experiments by Adolf Beck in Lw\u00f3w, Poland, in 1895, and Angelo Mosel in Turin, Italy.\n\nIn contrast to Berger, Adolf Beck\u2019s animal studies were intended to understand how the brain functions when neurons communicate by electrical impulses. At the peak of his research a Russian invasion halted his scientific work. In 1914 Lw\u00f3w was taken by invading Russians and renamed Lviv. Beck was captured and imprisoned in Kiev, then part of Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\n\nWhile in prison he wrote to the famous Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov appealing for his help, and Pavlov eventually won Beck\u2019s release.\n\nBeck returned to his research in Lviv, and the next logical step was to search for brainwaves in humans, but in World War II Germans invaded. They established a concentration camp in Lviv where the Jewish population was exterminated. As an intellectual and a Jew, Beck was a target. When they came to take Beck to the concentration camp in 1942, he swallowed cyanide, ending his own life rather than having it taken by the Nazis.\n\nRemarkably, both pioneering brainwave scientists committed suicide from Nazism\u2014one as Nazi perpetrator, the other as Nazi victim.\n\nBerger\u2019s grave in Jena. R. Douglas Fields\n\nUnknown to both Berger and Beck, they were not the first to record brainwaves. That discovery was made by a London physician 50 years earlier than Berger! That stunning finding was lost to science because the ideas were so far ahead of their time, dating back to when the brain was an enigma and the world was lit by gas lamps and powered by steam. Imagine how much further ahead brain science and medicine would be now if this scientific discovery made in 1875 had not been lost to history for half a century.\n\nThe first person to discover brainwaves was the London physician Richard Caton. Caton announced his discovery of brainwaves recorded in rabbits and monkey at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1875. He achieved this using a primitive device, a string galvanometer, in which a small mirror is suspended on a thread between magnets. When an electric current (picked up from the brain in this case) passes through the device, the string twists slightly like a compass needle near a magnet. The oscillating electrical currents detected in the brains were not measured in volts, but rather in millimeters of deflection of the light beam bounced off the mirror. The published abstract of his presentation \u201cThe Electric Currents of the Brain\u201d shows that with this primitive instrument the physician correctly deduced the most important aspects of brainwaves. \u201cIn every brain hitherto examined, the galvanometer has indicated the existence of electric currents\u2026. The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function\u2026.\u201d\n\nIronically, I traveled the world to research the discovery of brainwaves, only to find that the first person to do so, Richard Caton, presented his findings in the U.S. in 1887 at Georgetown University while on a visit to his family in Catonsville, Md. The town, which was settled by his relatives 1787, is 30 miles from my home, next to the Baltimore-Washington Airport, from which I often embarked on my global search. But that fact, like his unappreciated brainwave research, was lost to history. \u201cRead my paper on the electrical currents of the brain,\u201d he wrote in his diary. \u201cIt was well received but not understood by most of the audience.\u201d\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "This year, Rockefeller scientists illuminated the mysteries of memory and immune evasion. They unraveled how cancer infiltrates the body, how vitamin A influences wound healing, and how the impulse to eat is driven by three neurons. Groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, CRISPR technology, and stem cell biology reflect an impressive year for advancement in biomedicine. Here are some of the intriguing discoveries that came out of Rockefeller in 2024.\n\nVitamin A's healing role\n\nIt turns out Vitamin A is playing an unexpected role in wound repair: hair follicle stem cells are involved in the healing process in a way mediated by retinoic acid, the active form of Vitamin A. A study from the laboratory of Elaine Fuchs found that, during this process, stem cells enter a temporary state of plasticity in which they adopt traits of multiple cell types. Given that an unchecked version of this kind of plasticity is present in some cancer stem cells, the findings raise the possibility that retinoids could also play a role in cancer suppression.\n\n\"This hasn't been on the radar until now,\" Fuchs says. \"It's an exciting front to now investigate.\"\n\nMemory's hidden architect\n\nRobert B. Darnell's lab unveiled a tool edging neuroscience much closer to understanding a phenomenon known as dendritic translation-a \"holy grail for understanding memory formation,\" he says. Dendritic translation is a coordinated burst of neuronal activity, which involves an uptick in localized protein production within the spiny branches that project off the neuron cell body and receive signals from other neurons at synapses. It's a process key to memory-and its dysfunction is linked to intellectual disorders.\n\nUsing a new platform they developed, Darnell's team identified several previously unknown regulatory mechanisms that drive dendritic translation. The work \"defines a whole new biochemical pathway which fits with, complements, and vastly expands what we already knew about memory and learning,\" Darnell says.\n\nAutism's missing link\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is tied to more than 70 genes, and the laboratory of Mary E. Hatten has long focused on the link between the ASTN2 gene and cerebellar changes in children with autism, as well as other neurodevelopmental conditions. This year, however, Hatten's lab took that work to the next level with research demonstrating that knocking out ASTN2 in mice induces hallmark autism-like behaviors, including reduced vocalization, diminished social interaction, increased hyperactivity, and repetitive actions.\n\n\"It's a big finding in the field of neuroscience,\" Hatten says, and one that is inspiring her team to delve deeper into the hereditary components of autism. \"We're very excited that we've been able to show in detail what ASTN2 does, but there are a lot more genes to investigate.\"\n\nMetastasis's surprising origins\n\nA pair of compelling studies from the Tavazoie lab challenged conventional wisdom around cancer metastasis. Earlier this year, the lab demonstrated that sensory neurons play a direct role in promoting the growth and spread of breast cancer, providing the first ever evidence of peripheral nerves releasing a signal to enhance metastasis.\n\nMost recently, Tavazoie's team demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer metastasis may be, in part, a hereditary disorder driven by mutations in an inherited gene variant common to about 70 percent of white women. The scientists note their finding isn't cause for alarm-the variant does not make people more likely to develop cancer, though it may up the risk for metastasis outcomes by between 2 to 22 percent-but it could open up a new pathway to treatment.\n\n\"We've been so focused on the cancer cells, the 'seeds,' that we've ignored the germline-the 'soil',\" Tavazoie explains. \"It's now clear that focusing on the soil is critical.\"\n\nCRISPR's new tricks\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has long been likened to a kind of genetic scissors, thanks to its ability to snip out any desired section of DNA with elegant precision. Now, thanks to work done in the lab of Luciano Marraffini, we know that certain CRISPR systems operate something like a molecular fumigator as well: In a collaboration with MSKCC, the team found a CRISPR system that also produces a flood of toxic molecules in response invading phages or plasmids, effectively shutting down the infected cell in order to prevent the contagion from spreading through the rest of the bacterial population.\n\n\"It's a completely brand-new type of CRISPR chemistry,\" says Christian Baca, a graduate student in the Marraffini lab. The group envisions one possible application of their discovery may be a diagnostic tool for infection-but it hints at much more. \"It's more evidence that CRISPR systems have an array of immune strategies at their disposal.\"\n\nTelomere's balancing act\n\nTelomeres, the protective caps found at chromosome ends, must be kept at just the right length: too short, and dangerously accelerated aging ensues; too long, and they predispose their owners to cancer. Precise regulation is paramount, and Titia de Lange's laboratory recently published work that fundamentally changes our understanding of telomere biology.\n\nAmong their findings, de Lange's team discovered that two enzymes work in concert to ensure proper telomere maintenance. Scientists knew the telomerase enzyme helps prevent telomeres from growing shorter with each round of replication. But every DNA double helix has two strands to copy, and telomerase is capable of handling only one. Her team demonstrated how a second enzyme-the CST-Pol\u03b1-primase complex-manages the other strand."

            "article_content": "Ryan Daws is a senior editor at TechForge Media with over a decade of experience in crafting compelling narratives and making complex topics accessible. His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nAs the world races towards 2025, Developer examines what lies ahead for software development in the new year.\n\nAmong the most pressing trends for 2025 are AI development simplification, the integration of cross-functional engineering teams, and the evolution of DevSecOps practices. These shifts promise to redefine how companies approach innovation, security, and efficiency in their development pipelines.\n\nAI-powered development simplification\n\nAvthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale, predicts a significant transformation in the tech stack landscape by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe traditional tech stack will continue to collapse,\u201d Sewrathan notes, highlighting advancements driven by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development. This shift is anticipated to empower engineers of all skill levels to create impactful AI applications with ease.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, the traditional tech stack will continue to collapse, fueled by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development,\u201d Sewrathan explains. \u201cCompanies that deliver frictionless, accessible solutions with low barriers to entry will empower engineers to create impactful AI apps, no matter their level of expertise.\u201d\n\nThis democratisation of AI app creation is expected to increase competition within the industry as more developers gain access to advanced capabilities. Consistency and reliability in AI applications are also set to become paramount.\n\n\u201cAs AI apps become central to everyday interactions in 2025, consistency and reliability will take precedence,\u201d Sewrathan observes.\n\nDeveloper role evolution\n\nIndu Keri, General Manager and Head of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud at Nutanix, envisions a new era of software development starting in 2025.\n\n\u201cSoftware development and engineering is already being democratised with tools like Copilot,\u201d Keri says.\n\nBy combining GenAI with low-code solutions, code will be abstracted to the point of irrelevance. AI will generate applications rather than code, enabling developers to step into strategic roles.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day for developers will change drastically,\u201d Keri notes. \u201cNo longer hamstrung by grunt work, developers will step into an up-leveled, strategic role\u2014communicating with decision-makers about how tech can solve business problems.\u201d\n\nThis evolution, Keri argues, complements developers\u2019 best qualities \u2013 creativity and innovation \u2013 and challenges them to grow into leadership roles within their organisations.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, engineers at any level will be able to create an AI app through the widespread availability of APIs and models,\u201d Sewrathan adds. \u201cBut the differentiators will be consistency, usability, and customer impact.\u201d\n\nAgentic AI and DevOps automation\n\nThe hype around agentic AI will reach boiling point in 2025 as organisations bundle specialised agents for different stages of software delivery, including code generation, testing, and quality assurance. This orchestrator-driven approach will drive a more intelligent approach to DevOps automation.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, says: \u201cInstead of having one, basic GenAI assistant, organisations will bundle together specialised agents for the different stages of software delivery\u2014such as code generation, testing, and quality assurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne agent will act as the orchestrator, directing the others and producing more accurate insights into the end-to-end process.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Coutinho of OutSystems highlights that agentic AI will answer many, but not all, business problems: \u201cFor the last few years, businesses have tried to throw GenAI at all of their problems. The result: GenAI is a remarkable solution for many use cases, but not everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn AI tool is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. Just because tech titans are pushing agentic AI right now doesn\u2019t mean you should scrap simpler solutions. Align your AI strategy with your organisation\u2019s needs, rather than the latest shiny object.\u201d\n\nIntegration of cross-functional engineering teams\n\nMoving beyond AI development, the prediction for cross-functional engineering teams is another area of significant change. Reynolds outlines a future where standalone DevOps teams are phased out in favour of more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, organisations will move away from standalone DevOps teams towards more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines,\u201d Reynolds explains.\n\nThis shift towards unified cross-functional teams is expected to eliminate the remaining silos between software delivery teams and accelerate innovation at a whole new level. To support these integrated teams, organisations will increasingly adopt unified platforms providing capabilities across the entire software delivery lifecycle\u2014from CI/CD to chaos engineering and cloud cost management.\n\nIn line with these platform shifts, Reynolds emphasises the importance of Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) that enable engineers to self-serve the solutions and data they need.\n\n\u201cTo maximise the value of these platforms,\u201d Reynolds advises,\u201c[organisations] will expose these capabilities through IDPs.\u201d\n\nEvolution of DevSecOps practices\n\nThe software development landscape is also witnessing a significant evolution in DevSecOps practices.\n\nDylan Thomas, Senior Director of Product Engineering at OpenText Cybersecurity, predicts that, by 2025, DevSecOps will evolve beyond the \u201cshift-left\u201d paradigm to embrace a more mature \u201cshift everywhere\u201d approach.\n\nThis shift will require organisations to apply the right tools at the right stages of the DevSecOps cycle, improving efficiency and effectiveness in security practices.\n\n\u201cLightweight analysis in IDEs will help developers catch issues early,\u201d Thomas elaborates. \u201cAutomation integrated into pull requests and CI/CD pipelines will ensure a cohesive \u2018integrate once\u2019 approach for core functions such as SAST, SCA, and increasingly DAST, particularly for API security testing.\u201d\n\nThis integration is expected to streamline the development process while enhancing overall security.\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) maturity\n\nOne of the critical components in this evolving landscape is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).\n\nGovernment mandates are driving organisations to adopt SBOMs at scale, requiring them not only to generate these documents but also to make them actionable.\n\nWhile producing SBOMs in standard formats is now routine, the real challenge lies in translating raw data into meaningful risk-based insights.\n\nDevSecOps practices will mature, leveraging tools like VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) to add critical context to SBOMs\u2014reducing inefficiencies in vendor-consumer relationships and enhancing overall security posture.\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s role in managing complex data types\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s extension capabilities are also anticipated to play a significant role in managing complex data types in one place.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, PostgreSQL will solidify its position as the go-to \u2018everything database\u2019\u2014the first to fully integrate AI functionality like embeddings directly within its core ecosystem,\u201d says Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale.\n\n\u201cThis will streamline data workflows, eliminate the need for external processing tools, and enable businesses to manage complex data types in one place.\u201d\n\nAs companies move towards integrated solutions that can handle diverse datasets without relying on standalone or specialised databases, PostgreSQL is leading the charge towards this future state.\n\nDiverse app stores will reshape mobile distribution\n\nThe app store ecosystem is poised for a significant shift as mobile carriers are expected to regain their influence over app distribution.\n\nMatt Tubergen, EVP of Global Strategy & Partnerships at Digital Turbine, said: \u201cThe app store ecosystem is set to shift away from an Apple and Google duopoly to an open landscape as mobile carriers regain the power to connect consumers with apps.\u201d\n\nEmerging regulatory changes are also playing a critical role in leveling the playing field. These include bans that prevent tech giants like Google from incentivising app store preloads, which allow carriers and device manufacturers to preload their own apps on new devices.\n\nThis newfound autonomy positions carriers as pivotal players in alternative app distribution.\n\n\u201cThis renewed autonomy positions carriers as critical players in alternative app distribution, enabling organic growth for alternative app stores,\u201d Tubergen notes.\n\nCarriers are expected to offer developers better revenue opportunities than those provided by Apple and Google, while consumers will benefit from a more diverse selection of apps.\n\nTubergen points out that \u201cthe new, open app store economy will prioritise the needs of developers and users, shifting away from the current model that only serves Apple and Google.\u201d This shift promises a competitive and decentralised landscape where developers gain more control over their revenue streams.\n\nConsumers are expected to enjoy access to a wider variety of apps curated and tailored to their preferences. With third-party app stores gaining influence and major players like Epic Games and Microsoft advocating for inclusivity, the global app distribution model is likely to expand and mirror the thriving alternative stores seen in Asia.\n\nThis evolution promises an inclusive, innovative, and consumer-focused mobile distribution ecosystem.\n\nEmergence of xOps\n\nThe convergence of DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps into a new \u201cxOps\u201d paradigm is expected as more traditional applications adopt AI capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u2018AI-aware\u2019 Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities,\u201d explains Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai.\n\nIncreasing security challenges\n\nWhile AI-generated code can significantly increase developer efficiency, it also introduces security risks due to increased volume of code that must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors.\n\n\u201cWhile research has shown that generative AI can halve the time it takes developers to complete coding tasks, the increased volume of code being produced must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors,\u201d warns Holt.\n\n\u201cThis will increase security risk and lead to additional toil in the later stages of delivery, wiping out any efficiency gains from AI-generated code.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable increase in supply-chain attacks. This is likely to continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nAaron Costello, Chief of SaaS Security Research at AppOmni, observes: \u201cThe past few years, we\u2019ve seen a steady uptick in supply-chain attacks on SaaS through compromised third-party applications. As a result, organisations are placing these integrations and their requested access levels under far more scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy research into data exposures has shown that often no initial foothold is needed for threat actors to gain access to the sensitive data they want. The combination of undocumented legacy API endpoints, over-privileged public access, and gaps in vendor logging capabilities will continue to provide a dangerously effective option for threat actors to execute hit-and-run style attacks.\u201d\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny\n\nDespite the increasing security challenges, a failure to secure software could have ever more serious repercussions. In light of increasing awareness and demand for reliable software systems, developers must prepare for heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, comments: \u201cIn the wake of the CrowdStrike outage, there will be an increase in regulatory pressure around poor-quality software.\u201d\n\nGlobal regulators are expected to introduce more stringent standards that extend beyond existing frameworks like the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). This response is driven by a growing sentiment among consumers; a recent survey conducted by Harness found that ~74% of consumers believe there should be regulations holding companies accountable for poor-quality software updates leading to IT outages.\n\nTo navigate these impending regulatory changes, organisations supporting critical infrastructure \u2013 such as banking, healthcare, and energy services \u2013 must proactively enhance their software testing protocols.\n\n\u201cThey will need well-defined response plans to ensure they can recover quickly when the unexpected happens,\u201d Reynolds notes. Implementing modern software delivery practices is crucial, including feature flags and canary deployments, which enable continuous improvement in code quality and more stable release cycles.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, organisations not only bolster software resilience but also enhance trust and brand loyalty among consumers. As regulations evolve to emphasise software reliability akin to cybersecurity standards, being proactive will be key to supporting business growth and staying ahead of regulatory measures. This approach not only mitigates risks but positions companies favorably in a landscape where quality is increasingly synonymous with competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the predictions for 2025 paint a picture of an industry bracing for radical transformation\u2014driven by advancements in AI development, cross-functional engineering teams, and mature DevSecOps practices. These changes promise to accelerate innovation while enhancing security and user experience across industries.\n\nSee also: PostgreSQL becomes developers\u2019 choice for AI and real-time apps\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?

            "article_content": "A researcher from Sweden\u2019s J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University has proposed a machine learning-based health monitoring approach for PV systems using infrared thermography.\n\nThe method is based on a hybrid local features-based approach to monitor panels, designed to resist scaling, noise, rotation, and haze. It achieved 98% training accuracy and 96.8% testing accuracy.\n\n\u201cExisting image processing-based machine learning approaches for health and fault diagnosis are often limited to specific datasets and suffer from issues such as sensitivity to rotation, scaling, noise, blurring, and haze,\u201d said Dr. Waqas Ahmed in his paper. \u201cThese approaches also face trade-offs between memory usage and accuracy. Deep learning-based approaches, while powerful, have high computational complexity, memory, and processing requirements, and are prone to underfitting and overfitting without strong datasets and careful hyperparameter tuning.\u201d\n\nThe novel method begins by capturing infrared thermographs with an infrared camera. In the preprocessing step, it assesses the quality of the thermographs, improving them with a dehazing algorithm and contrast adjustment in the grayscale channel if too much noise is present. Each thermograph is then divided into 5\u00d75 pixel sub-thermographs.\n\nLocal features are extracted from each sub-thermograph using Gaussian and nonlinear methods. The most significant 80% of these features are retained, while irrelevant and redundant values are removed. A k-means unsupervised clustering algorithm then reduces the feature vector to 300 elements per thermograph for optimal memory use.\n\n\u201cShallow classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), train the model on the feature vectors. A 5-fold cross-validation approach ensures proper model training,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA test vector from unseen thermographs is utilized to test the model\u2019s accuracy in classifying the PV panels into three health-based classes: healthy, hotspot, and faulty.\u201d\n\nThe novel method tested on a 44.24 kW crystalline silicon (c-Si) rooftop PV system in Lahore, Pakistan, consists of eight strings, each with 22 PV modules in series, totaling 5.28 kW. The system installs 376 PV modules, each rated at 240 W. Infrared thermographs were captured under ambient temperatures ranging from 32 C to 40 C, wind speeds of 6.9 m/s, and an irradiance level of 700 W/m\u00b2. The thermographs were randomly divided, with 80% used for training and 20% for validation.\n\n\u201cThe results of this study are particularly striking, with the method achieving a remarkable 98% training accuracy and 96.8% testing accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cAdditionally, the model\u2019s precision values of 92%, 100%, and 100%; recall values of 100%, 100%, and 90%; and F1 scores of 0.958, 1.0, and 0.947 for the faulty, healthy, and hotspot classes, respectively, indicate a high level of performance across these metrics.\u201d\n\nCompared to other artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in the literature, only the RB scale-invariant feature transform outperformed the proposed method, with a score of 98.66%. The strongest SURF scored 97.6%, deep neural features (pre-trained network) and shallow classifier scored 97%, RGB, LBP, mean HOG, and texture scored 96.8%, isolated CNN scored 96%, and Texture, HOG, and PCA scored 94.1%.\n\nAhmed presented the results in \u201cEnhancing solar PV reliability with hybrid local features and infrared thermography,\u201d which was recently published in Energy Reports."

            "article_content": "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 A Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv early Friday killed at least one person and injured 12 others, officials said. Moscow claimed it was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Russian soil using American-made weapons. At least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine\u2019s air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said, and falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts.\n\n\u201cWe ask citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats, because there is very little time to find shelter,\u201d the air force said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the almost three years since the war began Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Meanwhile Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia\u2019s bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country\u2019s war effort.\n\nThe falling debris in Kyiv smashed into the city center, causing damage to around two dozen high-rise office buildings as well as the Catholic Church of St. Nicholas, which is a city landmark, and the Kyiv National Linguistic University.\n\nWhat may have been the blast wave from an intercepted low-flying missile also blew out windows or caused other damage at six embassies, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia\u2019s Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS , missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country\u2019s war effort.\n\nThe use of Western-supplied weapons to strike Russia has angered the Kremlin. Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time on Nov. 19 after Washington eased restrictions on their use.\n\nThat development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile , called Oreshnik, for the first time. President Vladimir Putin suggested the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used for a second time.\n\nAnswering the Ukrainian attack on Rostov on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it carried out a group strike with \u201chigh-precision, long-range weapons\u201d on the command center of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency and another location where it said Ukraine\u2019s Neptune missile systems are designed and produced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe attack also targeted Ukrainian ground-based cruise missile systems and U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, the Defense Ministry said.\n\n\u201cThe objectives of the strike have been achieved. All objects are hit,\u201d the defense ministry said in a Telegram post.\n\nIts claims could not immediately be verified.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Russia claimed Friday\u2019s attack was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Dec. 18, not earlier Friday.\n\n___"

            "article_content": "With a newly installed Windows PC, only a few system services and programs start. The resource requirements are correspondingly low and the operating system responds quickly.\n\nThis changes over time, which is mainly due to the additional software installed. Programs and services that start automatically after Windows logon lead to delays. The startup time of the system increases and it takes longer and longer for the desktop to respond to mouse clicks or for a program to start.\n\nHow noticeable the system slowdowns are depends on the overall performance of the computer and the performance of the hard drive or SSD.\n\nAs a general rule, a program that is only installed but does not start automatically cannot slow down Windows. However, this only applies if there is enough space available for temporary files or downloading updates, for example.\n\nTo avoid mistakes, you should therefore never fill drives close to their capacity limit. With both hard drives and SSDs, too little free space also affects speed for other reasons (see box \u201cMaking the most of hard drives and SSDs\u201d).\n\nAs in real life, tidying up is also a regular task in Windows. Removing superfluous files ensures that there is always enough free space on the drive. You should also remove unused programs, move particularly large files from the SSD to an existing hard drive and deactivate autostart if it is not required.\n\nget windows 11 pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro Price When Reviewed: 199.99 Best Prices Today:\n\nThe Windows on-board tools can provide valuable services here, while additional tools offer more and advanced functions.\n\nHowever, there is no simple one-click solution. Ultimately, the tools can only collect what you can possibly delete. After that, the responsibility lies with you. In this article, we provide decision-making aids and show you where you should be careful and what you should not delete.\n\nNote: The tips in this article apply to Windows 11, but some of the functions are also available in Windows 10.\n\n1. Check memory utilization\n\nCall up Settings \u2014 for example, with the key combination Win+I or a search in the Start menu. Go to System > Memory. You will see an informative overview with the total utilization of the system drive as well as the storage space used by temporary files and installed apps.\n\nUnder Other, Windows displays the space occupied by files that cannot be specified in more detail. Clicking on Show more categories takes you to a list of other areas, such as Documents, Pictures and Videos. You can see how much storage space is occupied in each case.\n\nClicking on one of the categories shows detailed information:\n\nOther shows some of the largest folders on the drive. You can open the folders by clicking on them in Windows Explorer and then decide whether something can be deleted.\n\nshows some of the largest folders on the drive. You can open the folders by clicking on them in Windows Explorer and then decide whether something can be deleted. Installed apps leads to Apps > Installed apps. The view can be sorted by size or installation date. You can use the three-dot menu to uninstall programs that you no longer need.\n\nleads to Apps > Installed apps. The view can be sorted by size or installation date. You can use the three-dot menu to uninstall programs that you no longer need. Temporary files shows a list of areas in which files that may no longer be required are stored. After a Windows upgrade, Previous Windows installation(s) appears in the list. This is the folder C:\\Windows.old. You can remove this if everything is running smoothly and you no longer want to return to the previous Windows installation. Windows automatically deletes the folder after about a month.\n\nUnder System > Storage > Temporary files there is a tick in front of all entries that you can delete without hesitation. To do this, click on Remove files. You can also tick the boxes in front of Downloads and Recycle bin.\n\nBut be careful: Downloads relates to your personal download folder. If you do not want to lose the downloaded files, do not tick this box. For Recycle Bin, you should make sure that there are no unintentionally deleted files in the recycle bin. Open the recycle bin by double-clicking on the desktop icon and check the contents.\n\nOnly delete if necessary: You can delete everything under Temporary files, but this is not useful in every case. The \u201cthumbnails,\u201d for example, are preview images that Windows saves in db files in the folder C:\\Users[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer.\n\nThis allows Windows Explorer to load the preview images more quickly. After some time, the db files also contain preview images whose originals have long since been deleted. Regular cleaning therefore seems advisable.\n\nOn the other hand, the files do not usually take up much memory space and if you delete everything, Windows Explorer has to rebuild the cache of the preview images. Although this does not take long, it is unnecessary.\n\nThe situation is similar with temporary internet files. Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser saves the elements of web pages in a cache, allowing it to display them more quickly. If the temporary internet files are deleted, it will take longer to load pages on regularly visited websites.\n\nAs a rule, the Edge cache does not occupy more than 1GB, which means that not much storage space can be freed up. Other web browsers use their own cache, which can be emptied in the respective programs (see point 7).\n\nStorage overview: In the Settings under System > Storage you can find out how the hard drive is used. Click on the categories for further details. Foundry\n\n2. Windows 11 cleanup functions\n\nIn Windows 11, go to System > Storage in Settings and click on Cleanup recommendations. You will see the storage space occupied by downloads and the recycle bin as well as Previous Windows installation(s), if still available.\n\nTick the areas in which you want to delete files and click on the [X] GB cleanup button. However, this will not only delete the selected files, but also other temporary files. Click on Advanced options to find out about the effects.\n\nThe settings correspond to those under System > Storage > Temporary files, but the current selection is added, for example Recycle bin. If you consider it necessary, you can remove the tick from some areas before cleaning.\n\nThe list you get after clicking on Large or unused files is more interesting. You will see particularly large files and files used a long time ago that you may be able to delete. The list under Unused apps can also be helpful. However, only programs that you have installed via the Microsoft Store are displayed.\n\nAn alternative for Windows 10 and 11 is Iobit Uninstaller.\n\nUnder Programs, go to Rarely used to display the applications that are rarely used. The list can serve as a guide, but is usually not complete and sometimes shows inaccurate dates. However, it is not possible to do better than this because Windows does not reliably log the start time of a program.\n\nWhat can be deleted? The \u201ccleanup recommendations\u201d point to obvious areas such as the recycle bin. However, you can also have large files and unused apps listed. Foundry\n\n3. Free up storage space\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do all the tidying up yourself, you can leave the task to Windows. In the Settings, go to System > Storage and set the switch behind Storage Sense to On.\n\nThe service can be configured by clicking on Storage Sense. A tick is already placed in front of Keep Windows running smoothly by automatically cleaning up temporary system and app files.\n\nAutomatic user content cleanup is also switched on, but is only activated when required due to the default setting During low free disk space (default). However, you can also set a schedule for the clean-up with Daily, Every week, or Every month.\n\nAn interval can be specified under Delete files from recycle bin if they have been there for over:. The default setting is 30 days. If you are worried that there may still be files in the recycle bin after 30 days that you would like to restore, it is better to set Never and empty the recycle bin manually.\n\nThe same applies to the setting for the download folder, where the default setting is Never. Only if you are sure that this folder will never contain files that you still need should you set it to 30 days or 60 days, for example.\n\nUsers of the Microsoft cloud storage Onedrive will find a useful setting under Locally available cloud content. With the default setting of 30 days, Onedrive automatically changes the status of the files in the synchronized folder to Available online if they have not been opened within this period.\n\nThis means that the files no longer take up any space on the drive. If you open one of these files afterwards, it will be available on the device again. Files that you have marked as Always keep on this device are not affected by this setting. If you do not want Onedrive to change the status of the files, set Never.\n\n\u201cStorage optimization\u201d automatically creates more space on the system drive. You can specify what is deleted and when. IDG\n\n4. Relocate standard storage locations\n\nIf your PC has an additional SSD or hard drive, you can use this as alternative storage. An external USB drive is also suitable, but must be permanently connected depending on how it is used.\n\nFurther reading: The best SSDs\n\nYou can simply move personal files to the other drive using Windows Explorer. However, Windows also offers options to change the storage location of default folders.\n\nIn the Settings, go to System > Storage, click on Advanced storage settings and then on Where new content is saved.\n\nAs the name suggests, the settings only apply to new files. To save space on the system drive, you can specify the second drive under New apps will save to:, for example E:\\. Click on Apply for the setting to take effect.\n\nYou can also select the second drive under New documents will save to:, whereby Windows creates the folder E:[user name]\\Documents. If you now save a document in a word processor or the Windows Notepad editor, the new storage location is preset.\n\nHowever, this procedure has a disadvantage: In Windows Explorer, Documents still leads to the previous folder on drive C:\\. An overview of files from both locations is provided by the libraries, which Windows Explorer does not display by default.\n\nTo change this, go to Options in the three-dot menu and switch to the View tab. Under Navigation pane, tick the box next to Show libraries. If you then go to Libraries > Documents, you will see the files from both folders.\n\nMoving personal folders completely: Because of the disadvantage mentioned above, it makes more sense to move folders such as Documents, Pictures, and Downloads completely to another drive.\n\nFirst create the destination folder, for example E:[username]\\Downloads. Right-click on the desired folder in Windows Explorer, go to Properties and then to the Path tab.\n\nClick on Move and select the previously created folder. After clicking on OK, confirm with Yes that Windows should move the existing files to the new location. In Windows Explorer, under Start or in the navigation area, open the folders with the previous content but with the new storage location.\n\n5. Change storage location for apps\n\nA conventionally installed desktop program is located by default in the folder C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files (x86), which Windows Explorer displays as C:\\Program.\n\nIf space becomes tight, programs cannot simply be moved to another drive, as the paths to components and settings in the Windows registry are then no longer correct. However, you can usually specify a user-defined destination on a different drive when reinstalling programs in the setup program.\n\nThis is particularly recommended for an SSD with little storage space and if a program requires a lot of storage space, for example a PC game. However, the loss of speed when starting from a slower hard drive must be accepted.\n\nApps from the Microsoft Store can also be moved to another drive without reinstalling them. In Settings, go to Apps > Installed apps and click on Move in the three-dot menu for the desired app.\n\nSelect the target drive and click on Move. If the menu item is not available, it is a desktop application. The pre-installed system apps cannot be moved, which is why the menu item is grayed out.\n\nApps from the Microsoft Store can be moved to another drive. This option is not available for pre-installed system apps. IDG\n\nMaking optimum use of hard drives and SSDs Due to its physical structure, a conventional magnetic hard drive delivers data at different speeds. The average transfer rate of a current hard disk can be 200MB per second, for example. In the outer area of the magnetic disk, the read/write heads can capture more sectors in the same amount of time than in the inner area due to rotation and circumference. With a freshly installed Windows, the system files are located in the fast outer area; what is added later is located in the increasingly slower inner areas. The hard disk can reduce this effect by using a cache. The data first ends up in the fast cache and only then on the hard drive. The transfer rate is gradually reduced by the limited size of the cache as you copy many small or a few large files to the hard drive. In the course of using a hard drive, files are deleted and new ones are created. The drive\u2019s controller uses the next free blocks to store the data. If a file does not fit into the area of a contiguous block, the next one is used, which may be a long way away. The read/write heads then require longer paths, which reduces the transfer rate and increases access times. The performance of the hard drive can be improved by defragmentation. The files are reorganized in blocks that are as contiguous as possible, which speeds up access. The \u201cOptimize drives\u201d defragmenter from the Windows accessories (Win R, dfrgui) does this automatically once a week by default. The Windows defragmenter seems to do its job perfectly, as it regularly certifies that the drives have a fragmentation level of \u201c0%.\u201d This may even be more or less true for PCs in average use. However, large files are often heavily fragmented, which increases as the hard drive fills up because the contiguous, free blocks become fewer and fewer. This particularly affects games and the usually very large virtual hard disks of virtualization software. If this applies to you, first make sure there is enough free space on the hard drive. Only then can a defragmenter work optimally. A suitable program for this is Defraggler. After starting, select the hard drive and click on \u201cCheck.\u201d If the program shows severe fragmentation, click on \u201cDefrag.\u201d As the process takes a long time for large hard drives, you can also selectively process individual files. Switch to the \u201cFile list\u201d tab. Click on the \u201cFragments\u201d column header to sort the list by heavily fragmented files. The selected file can be optimized via the context menu item \u201cSelected defragmentation.\u201d Special features for SSDs: SSDs do not need to be defragmented because the memory accesses are direct and the position of the memory cells is irrelevant. This results in short access times, which means that Windows and programs start faster. The transfer rate is approximately 2 to 4 times higher than with hard disks, which also has a positive effect on overall performance. However, you should also regularly free up storage space on SSDs. If the drive is filled to the brim, the controller on the device does not have enough free cells to organize the memory. The service life of an SSD increases if memory cells are not rewritten too often and there are enough spare lines. With an average-use PC, however, there is no need to worry about the internal functions of the SSD. The manufacturers reserve an area for over-provisioning as standard, to which the user has no access. Depending on the model and total capacity, this reduces the actual usable memory by 7 to 10 percent. This ensures that even with a well-filled SSD there are still free cells available. On SSDs for server use with many write accesses, a larger area is usually reserved for over-provisioning. Some manufacturers also offer tools with which the reserve memory can be increased, for example Samsung Magican. However, this is only useful for servers. Defraggler attempts to move files into areas that are as contiguous as possible. The function can also be used specifically for individual, particularly large files. IDG\n\n6. Clean up discs\n\nThe disk clean-up function has been included with Windows 98, but the tool\u2019s days are numbered. It is still included in Windows 11 24H2, but Microsoft already recommends using the functions in the Settings (see points 1 to 3).\n\nHowever, if you wish, you can still use Disk Cleanup. However, this does not offer any particular advantage because the functions are now fully available in the settings under System > Storage.\n\nIf you still want to use Disk Cleanup, start the tool by searching in the Start menu or by pressing Win+R, entering cleanmgr and clicking on OK. If there are several hard drives, select the drive that you want to clean up, usually the system drive, C:. Click on OK to confirm.\n\nAfter the analysis, tick the areas in which you want to delete something. For more information, click on a line and read the description. There is nothing you cannot delete without hesitation. However, the instructions for the recycle bin and temporary internet files from point 1 also apply here.\n\nBy default, Disk Cleanup only handles user files. If you click on the Clean up system files button and select the system drive, additional options are available to you. For example, Previous Windows installation(s) (if available), Log files for Windows upgrades, and Device driver packages.\n\nOn the More options tab, you can also click on Clean up under System restore and shadow copies. This deletes all restore points except for the last one, which can save several gigabytes.\n\nConfigure profile: If you want to use disk cleanup regularly for certain tasks, you can save the settings in a profile. If system files are also to be deleted, the configuration must be carried out with administrative rights, otherwise the rights of the standard user are sufficient.\n\nWith the saved settings, you can start Disk Cleanup without further configuration and delete everything at once.\n\nStep 1: Use the Start menu to search for cmd. Right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.\n\nStep 2: Type cleanmgr /sageset:1 and confirm with the Enter key. The number \u201c1\u201d is the serial number of the profile. You can enter any number up to four digits to save multiple profiles.\n\nStep 3: Tick all the desired options. Click on OK to save the settings.\n\nStep 4: Right-click on a free area on the desktop. Select New > Shortcut from the menu. In the input field, type\n\ncleanmgr /sagerun:1\n\nand click on Next. Enter a meaningful name and confirm with Finish.\n\nStep 5: Right-click on the shortcut, go to Properties and switch to the Shortcut tab. Click on Advanced and tick the box next to Run as administrator. Click OK and then click OK again.\n\nIf you now start Disk Cleanup by double-clicking on the shortcut, all configured tasks will be processed automatically.\n\nDisk Cleanup is considered outdated in Windows 11. However, it is still available in Windows 11 24H2 and can be used as usual. Foundry\n\n7. Delete browser data\n\nOne program that constantly generates data on the hard drive is the web browser. Browsers do not display websites, images, or videos directly, but first save the content, including images and JavaScript files, in the cache memory.\n\nDepending on how a website is configured, data is preferably loaded quickly from the cache or updated via the internet connection.\n\nAs the cache improves the performance of the browser, it is not recommended to delete it. Browsers usually use memory space moderately and do not use more than necessary. However, you should delete the cache if there are errors in the page display, for example.\n\nIn Microsoft Edge, click on the three-dot menu at the top right and select Settings. Continue in the navigation area on the left-hand side and Privacy, search, and services.\n\nUnder Delete browser data, click on Choose what to clear. Under Time range, you can select a time period for which you want to delete elements. Under Cached images and data you can see how much memory the browser is using.\n\nRemove the tick in front of the areas in which you do not want to delete anything. It is better to exclude Cookies and other site data. Cookies are required, for example, for navigation on websites and also for automatic login.\n\nYou should also be careful with Passwords and Autofill form data. If you have saved data via the browser, this will be lost if you tick the box here. After checking the settings, click on Clear now.\n\nOther browsers offer similar options. Firefox users, for example, go to Privacy & Security in the Settings menu. Under Cookies and website data, click on Remove data. Remove the tick in front of Cookies and website data (recommended) and click on Clear to delete only the cache memory.\n\nBrowsers store numerous files on the hard drive, which makes websites load faster. However, in the event of errors or for data protection reasons, the files should be deleted. Foundry\n\n8. Optimize autostart\n\nMany programs install services or nest themselves in the notification area next to the clock. This is practical for some applications \u2014 for example, if they regularly display important information or report available updates.\n\nHowever, programs that you rarely use should be removed from the autostart. You can do this using Windows\u2019 on-board tools via the Task Manager, which you can start most quickly by pressing the key combination Ctrl+Shift+Esc.\n\nOn the Autostart tab, programs can be removed from Autostart via the Deactivate context menu item. Nothing is deleted in the process. You can reactivate the programs at any time.\n\nIf you want to analyze all autostart ramps, use the Autoruns tool. You can deactivate services and autostart entries and reactivate them later.\n\nThe tool also offers an analysis via virustotal.com to determine whether malware is present.\n\nIf possible, you should uninstall programs that you do not use. This frees up space on your hard drive and improves security. However, the uninstall routines are often not thorough.\n\nIf you want to remove software with less residue, use tools such as Geek Uninstaller or Iobit Uninstaller.\n\nThe cleanup functions in Windows 11 already do a good job. However, additional tools allow a different view of the situation and work more thoroughly. Sometimes too thoroughly, however. Therefore, familiarize yourself sufficiently with the functions before you delete something irretrievably.\n\nBleachbit is one of the tools that can be used to delete a great deal. Close all applications, especially the web browser, before starting the tool. For each category, such as Firefox, Microsoft Office or System, there is a brief description of the options. Only tick the options if you are aware of the effects.\n\nIf in doubt, click on Preview first. Bleachbit will then show you which files are affected. Only after this check do you click on Final cleanup.\n\nAnother tool for the same purpose is Ccleaner. It is somewhat clearer than Bleachbit, but offers more settings and explanatory texts.\n\nYou can also use the Ccenhancer extension, whose rule sets you can set up via Download latest. This will significantly extend the scope of the main program\u2019s program recording.\n\nCcleaner is by far the most popular software for cleaning up the operating system and installed applications.\n\nAmong other things, it offers tools for clearing out the autostart, analyzing hard drive contents, searching for duplicates, managing browser plugins, and securely overwriting free hard drive space in order to delete any file fragments.\n\nTreesize Free and Windirstat help to analyze the drives. These tools detect large files that you may no longer need and want to delete. Everything is actually a particularly fast search tool, but can also be used to sort the file list by size and thus identify space wasters.\n\nTidying up the registry usually does nothing. Nevertheless, you can use a tool such as Wise Registry Cleaner to analyze the registry. If you change anything here, you should first create a backup copy, for example with the Registry Backup tool.\n\nFiles or folders cannot be deleted if the access rights are missing. Use PC-WELT MyRights to add a new context menu item to Windows Explorer, which appears after a right mouse click while holding down the Shift key. Click on Take ownership to obtain full access rights.\n\nWinsxs: The supposedly huge folder When examining your hard drive, you may come across the \u201cWinsxs\u201d folder in the Windows directory. In the properties, Windows Explorer often shows a size of several gigabytes. It contains important program libraries that are used by many applications, as well as system and exe files in different versions. Some of the supposedly numerous files are hard links, i.e. special file links that refer to the corresponding files under \u201cWindows System32,\u201d for example. The actual size is therefore sometimes several GB smaller. Never delete files from the \u201cWinsxs\u201d folder yourself. Doing so can permanently damage the function of the system or applications. Windows regularly cleans up the folder automatically via the task scheduler and removes files that are no longer required.\n\nFoldersizes\n\nFoldersizes\n\nAnalyze partitions and search for large folders\n\nWhen tidying up your hard drive, you often don\u2019t know where to start. Foldersizes helps you by organizing folders by size and displaying this list as a pie chart, bar chart, or map. You can search for space-wasters down to file level with a click of the mouse.\n\nIn contrast to Windirstat, for example, Foldersizes offers a wider range of functions. The disadvantages: The tool is only available in English and must be licensed for 30 US dollars after a trial period of 15 days.\n\nLargest File Finder\n\nLargest File Finder\n\nCompile a list of the largest files\n\nIf you are wondering where all the free space on your new SSD has gone, the freeware Largest File Finder will help you. You don\u2019t need to install the tool, instead you can start searching for the 100 largest files on the entire disc or in the specified folder immediately after double-clicking on its EXE file. At the end, it compiles a list organized by size, which you can use as a guide if you want to create space as easily and efficiently as possible.\n\nDuplicate Media Finder\n\nDuplicate Media Finder\n\nFind and delete all duplicate files\n\nDespite its name, Duplicate Media Finder Free not only searches for media files such as videos, audio files, and images, but also for duplicate files in general. It also finds duplicates that have a different name than the original, which is referred to here as the \u201cmaster file.\u201d The free program is only available in the Microsoft Store. It is a slimmed-down version of a much more comprehensive, paid-for software, which is available for a good $40.\n\nClonespy\n\nClonespy\n\nFind duplicate files and delete them individually\n\nAn alternative to Duplicate Media Finder is Clonespy. The English-language tool immediately indicates when it encounters a duplicate file and, if desired, marks the older versions or the versions with the longer file or folder name. Clonespy is also able to find files with the same name but different contents or to compare files in two folders \u2014 for example on a local and a shared network drive.\n\nRevo Uninstaller\n\nRevo Uninstaller\n\nRemove programs cleanly and without leaving any residue\n\nRevo Uninstaller is the reference in the category of free uninstall programs: The program works very reliably, first starts the uninstall routine of the respective software, and then scans the registry and file systems for any remnants.\n\nThe uninstaller also includes tools for cleaning up browsers, Microsoft Office, Windows, the registry, and Autostart. A special feature is the hunting mode, which allows you to remove programs without a functioning uninstaller.\n\nIobit Uninstaller\n\nIobit Uninstaller\n\nConvenient uninstaller with many extras\n\nIobit\u2019s uninstaller works in exactly the same way as Revo\u2019s uninstaller, but offers a deletion mode for selected programs in one go without prompting. It lists apps from the hardware manufacturer, recently installed programs as well as oversized and rarely used applications, and can also delete browser extensions and Windows apps. You can use an install monitor to log the installation of new software and remove the programs cleanly later.\n\nPrivazer\n\nRemove superfluous ballast\n\nThe free Privazer program carries out a deep scan for user traces on your drives, USB sticks, network drives, and much more. The first step is to select which storage medium is to be analyzed. Then specify which files you want to search for.\n\nAfter starting Privazer, a wizard will help you with the configuration with recommendations. Then start the search by clicking on OK. In the search results, you can click on categories such as Internet activities or Cookies to obtain information on the files concerned. To be on the safe side, you should tick the box next to Create a restore point.\n\nIf problems occur, the deleted files can then be restored. Finally, click on Clean. The deletion of cookies, residual traces of old files, or temporary files is intended to counteract the slowing down of your computer due to data ballast.\n\nThe Spybot \u2013 Search & Destroy freeware scans the system for various types of spyware, malware, dialers, keyloggers, Trojans and other threats. IDG\n\nSpybot\n\nRemove unwanted software\n\nSpybot \u2013 Search & Destroy is a long-established product for searching for browser tracking cookies and unwanted software. This does not necessarily have to be malware in the true sense of the word. Sometimes, however, programs install additional software that you do not want to use.\n\nAfter clicking on Scan system, the tool scans the drives and displays the findings. Check the results, uncheck the boxes next to entries that you do not want to delete, and click on Fix selected.\n\n7-Zip\n\n7-Zip\n\nArchive files and compress them to save space\n\nSpring cleaning is a good opportunity to go through your own file archive and move older or rarely used files to an archive. To save space, you should compress the files. If you want to protect confidential documents, the archive can also be encrypted and secured with a password.\n\nAll this is done for you by the 7-Zip compression program, which is free open source software. You can also use it to copy or move the archives to new folders.\n\nFaststone Image Viewer\n\nFaststone Image Viewer\n\nManage and edit photos\n\nMany users accumulate thousands or even more photos over time, which makes searching for a specific motif much more difficult. Faststone\u2019s Image Viewer shows you all the images in a folder in a preview and offers to convert them into a range of other commonly used formats. The software also has simple editing tools on board, can create a slideshow, and copy and move the image files collectively to other folders.\n\nDigikam\n\nDigikam\n\nManage and search for photos professionally\n\nSoftware for managing large photo collections is usually expensive and therefore only of interest to professional photographers. Digikam is an exception to this rule. The program is open source and free of charge. Digikam is based on a database engine that offers extensive search options according to the date and place the photo was taken as well as other Exif data. This additional information can also be edited. But beware: Digikam is a professional program, which is why it takes time to get to grips with its operation.\n\nPowerlame\n\nPowerlame\n\nSearch and convert MP3 files\n\nAs with photos, the problem with MP3 music is that hundreds or even thousands of files gradually accumulate. The desired song is then difficult to find, especially if you don\u2019t have the title or artist on hand. In these cases, Powerlame can help.\n\nThe tool also reads large MP3 collections and offers a search mask for ID3 tags. It can also rip CDs, adjust the volume of all MP3s, and convert them into WAV files or search for the corresponding CD covers.\n\nMedia Monkey\n\nMedia Monkey\n\nAdd missing data to song files\n\nFor the search in the ID3 tags to be successful, the fields must also be filled in. This is usually not the case with self-ripped MP3s in particular. Media Monkey helps you to enter information about a song such as artist, title, album or composer. Among other things, the program automatically searches for the album, downloads the cover, and enters the data in the tag fields. The tool is also an excellent player that creates playlists and offers an equalizer.\n\nSumo\n\nSumo\n\nCheck installed software for updates\n\nYou should not only regularly clear your Windows PC of junk data, but also make sure that the installed programs are always up to date. Updates not only eliminate software errors and close security gaps, they often also bring new functions. The freeware Sumo scans the existing applications, lists the outdated programs, and takes you to a download site for the update. The paid Pro version can also take care of the installation for you.\n\nDriver Easy\n\nDriver Easy\n\nUpdate drivers to the latest version\n\nAs a rule, Windows provides the appropriate drivers for all hardware components of the PC and also updates them. However, these are often slimmed-down versions without the extended functionality offered by the drivers from the manufacturer\u2019s website.\n\nDriver Easy makes it possible to check the existing driver equipment, point out newer versions, and install them. The free software version only allows manual installation and has a limited download speed.\n\nIobit Driver Booster Free\n\nIobit Driver Booster Free\n\nDetailed driver information\n\nThere is also a free version of Iobit\u2019s Driver Booster. This is limited in the display of outdated drivers and refers to other products from this manufacturer in several places. However, the installation of new driver versions works automatically and quickly enough after a mouse click. In comparison with Driver Easy, Driver Booster found more and more up-to-date driver versions for our test PC. The Pro version offers an automatic update and the automatic creation of restore points.\n\nCore Temp\n\nCore Temp\n\nMeasure and display CPU temperature\n\nIt\u2019s not just in spring that you should take a look at your computer\u2019s hardware. This also includes checking the processor temperature: If it\u2019s too high, this is often a sign that the cooler is dusty, the fan has become loose, or the heatsink is no longer firmly attached to the processor.\n\nAlthough a protective circuit prevents the CPU from burning out, this lowers the processor clock and slows down the computer. The freeware Core Temp shows you the current temperature of each individual CPU core.\n\nGPU-Z\n\nGPU-Z\n\nAll information about the graphics card at a glance\n\nA PC\u2019s graphics chip can also overheat and should therefore be checked regularly. The freeware GPU-Z is suitable for this purpose: It determines the model of the graphics card or chip during installation and retrieves the corresponding data from a database on the Internet. A click on Lookup takes you to the corresponding website. In the Sensors tab, you will find the current GPU measurement values, including the clock frequency, temperature, fan speed, memory utilization, and power consumption.\n\nHD Tune\n\nHD Tune\n\nCheck the temperature and status of the hard drive\n\nIf your computer\u2019s hard drive or SSD fails, important data is often lost. You should therefore keep an eye on its condition and check it regularly. With the HD Tune tool, you can perform a benchmark test, check the sectors for errors, and read out the current temperature.\n\nIf the values deteriorate, you can intervene at an early stage, back up your data or transfer it to a new SSD straight away. The paid version HD Tune Pro provides further benchmarks and information."

More and more repatriation projects are underway as enterprises continue to receive exorbitant cloud bills. Many enterprises now realize that the unexpectedly high costs of cloud services are unsustainable in the long term.\n\nGEICO has made headlines for its decision to repatriate numerous workloads back to on-premises solutions. In a recent interview, Rebecca Weekly, the vice president of platform and infrastructure engineering, said the initial goal of moving to the cloud was to reduce costs and complexity, but it ultimately had the opposite effect."

You\u2019re probably not going to be prepared for this, so hold onto your hats.\n\nWhile we all know that Gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) is a little different to other gens, namely because they seem to be swearing off what others would call as right of passages, such as getting drunk all of the time as a teenager.\n\nAdvert\n\nBut they are also taking things slower in the bedroom department too.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re not partying and hooking up with people?\n\nIt turns out that Gen Zers are taking things a bit slower in the bedroom (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAnyway, it has been reported that his generations have been engaging in less sex than other generations, with less partners and less commitments.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe report is based on information from over 3,310 people who use the Feeld dating app and it has been collected from those living in 71 different countries.\n\nThe age range it has looked into is pretty varied too, as you\u2019ll see data from anyone aged between 18 to 75.\n\nSo, you\u2019re about to know what people your grandparents your age is doing with each other.\n\nDrumroll please.\n\nAdvert\n\nGen Z typically had had sex three times in the last month, while Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen X (born between 1965 and 1980) had sex five times.\n\nMillenials and Gen X seemed to have the most sex (Getty Stock Image)\n\nBut Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) were right on parr with Gen Z when it came to sex, and also reported having sex three times in the last month.\n\nHowever, just because Gen Z is less likely to sh*g, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re vanilla.\n\nAdvert\n\nAccording to Dr Justin Lehmiller, the lead author in the study, 55 percent of Gen Z discovered a new kink since joining the dating app, and 49 percent of Millennials also reported the same thing.\n\nOn the lower scale, 33 percent of Gen X said they found new kinks, while 33 percent of Boomers agreed.\n\nThe study said: \u201cThere are at least two explanations for this. One is simply that older adults have had more time to learn and discover what they enjoy about sex, so they may have already uncovered their kinks.\n\nMany have found new kinks since joining dating apps (Getty Stock Image)\n\n\u201cHowever, the other is that it also appears to be the case that younger adults today have a greater overall interest in kink than older adults, which may create greater openness to exploring and learning about one's kinks.\u201d\n\nThe study also believes that Boomers and Gen Z are more alike than originally thought.\n\nDr Lehmiller shared: \u201cGen Z and Boomers exhibited nearly identical sexual frequencies, suggesting that both the youngest and oldest adults are having the least sex.\n\n\u201cAlso, nearly half of Gen Z reported that they were single, compared to only one-\ufb01fth of Millennials, Gen X, and Boomers.\u201d\n\nThe study went on to say that sexuality and relationships \u2018have always existed on a continuum\u2019 which \u2018will only evolve and expand further as Gen Z and future generations continue their pursuit of sexual and relational self-discovery\u2019."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new study published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, unveils a novel approach to measuring public attention using reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The research bridges the gap between unconventional indicators and macroeconomic analysis, revealing surprising links between UAP sightings and economic conditions at multiple geographical levels in the United States.\n\nThe study highlights that UAP reports, often dismissed as a niche phenomenon, serve as a robust proxy for public attention. By analyzing daily-level data from NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center), the researchers show that UAP sightings are more frequent in wealthier regions but exhibit counter-cyclical patterns within those regions over time. These findings suggest that shifts in attention to extraordinary phenomena may reflect broader fluctuations in public focus.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nMacroeconomic correlation: UAP sightings are positively correlated with economic conditions across regions but display counter-cyclical patterns within regions over time.\n\nCausal evidence: A quasi-experimental design leveraging variations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions demonstrates a causal link between restricted mobility and increased UAP reports, further establishing the measure as an indicator of public attention.\n\nPolicy implications: Regions with higher UAP sighting levels show muted responses to monetary policy shocks, suggesting that attention variations can significantly influence economic outcomes.\n\nThe researchers compared UAP sightings to conventional attention metrics, finding strong correlations. This innovative measure offers unique advantages, including the ability to analyze attention at different geographical and temporal scales.\n\nImplications for policy and research\n\nGoldstein and Raveh's findings underscore the central role of public attention in economic dynamics. Their work not only enhances the toolkit for macroeconomic analysis but also provides policymakers with insights into managing public attention to mitigate economic shocks.\n\nThe study invites further exploration into how unconventional forms of attention, like UAP sightings, intersect with economic behaviors. \"We hope this work inspires future research to deepen our understanding of the connection between public attention and macroeconomic outcomes,\" the authors state.\n\nThe research uses comprehensive UAP sighting data from NUFORC, spanning over two decades, to construct a daily-level panel of reports across U.S. counties. The analysis integrates economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure robust conclusions.\n\nThis pioneering work highlights the value of thinking beyond traditional metrics, shedding light on the role of seemingly unrelated phenomena in understanding economic patterns.\n\nMore information: Nathan Goldstein et al, Looking up the sky: unidentified aerial phenomena and macroeconomic attention, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (2024).

            "article_content": "The centennial of the discovery of brain waves in humans exposes a chilling tale involving Nazis, war between Russia and Ukraine, suicide and the vicissitudes of history\n\nThis year is the centennial of the discovery of human brain waves. Few people know the story of that startling finding, because the true story was suppressed and lost to history. Almost two decades ago I visited the pioneering scientists\u2019 labs in Germany and Italy seeking answers. What I learned overturned accepted history and exposed a chilling tale involving Nazis, brainwaves, war between Russia and Ukraine, and suicide. This history resonates with current events\u2014Russia and Ukraine recently passed a grim 1,000-day milestone of a conflict waged on a pretext of battling Nazis\u2014revealing how history, science and society are intricately entwined.\n\nHuman brainwaves, oscillating waves of electricity that constantly sweep through brain tissue, change with our thoughts and perceptions. Their value in medicine is incalculable. They reveal all manner of neurological and psychological disorders to doctors and guide neurosurgeons\u2019 hands when extracting diseased brain tissue that triggers seizures. Only newly appreciated, their role in the healthy brain is transforming our fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information. Like waves of all types, the electrical waves sweeping through the brain generate synchrony (think of water waves bobbing boats); in the case of brainwaves, what\u2019s synchronized is activity among populations of neurons.\n\nWho discovered brainwaves? What did they think they\u2019d found? Why was there no Nobel Prize?\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nIn the most common accounts, a reclusive physician, Hans Berger, recorded the first human brainwaves from his patients in a mental hospital in the German city of Jena in 1924 (later part of East Germany). He told no one what he was doing, and he kept his momentous findings secret for five years. As the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s, mental hospitals became the epicenter of forced sterilization and \u201ceuthanasia\u201d to promote \u201cracial hygiene.\u201d Some of the methods developed in these facilities served as a prelude to the industrialized killing in concentration camps. As head of the mental hospital in Jena, Berger would have been in the thick of it. Biographies at the time of my visit stated that Berger committed suicide in 1941 from Nazi persecution\n\n\u2018\u2018Berger was no adherent of Hitler and so he had to relinquish the service of his University; not having expected this, he was gravely hurt\u2026. [This] bestowed upon him a depression which finally killed him,\u2019\u2019 wrote psychiatrist Rudolf Lemke, in a 1956 memorial. Lemke had worked under Berger.\n\nTo me this seemed odd. Wouldn\u2019t the Nazis have dismissed Berger just as they purged 20 percent of German academics in 1933, and ruthlessly expelled or \u201cliquidated\u201d disloyal politicians, administrators and others?\n\nIn Jena I learned that Lemke was in fact a member of the NSDP (Nazi party). He worked at the Erbgesundheits\u00adgericht (Hereditary Health Court) to carry out forced sterilization of the mentally and physically unfit, broadly defined as the physically disabled, psychiatric patients, alcoholics, among others. Like many others in power, Lemke stayed on in Jena after the war, and his antisemitic and antihomosexual views were covered up by authorities. He became director of the Psychiatric Clinic in Jena from 1945 until 1948.\n\nAfter World War II Jena came under control of the Soviet Union, and documents revealing the widespread cover-up were lost or destroyed. When I visited Berger\u2019s hospital I met with neuroscientist Christoph Redies and medical historian Susanne Zimmermann, who had recently obtained Soviet records after the fall of the Berlin wall. They revealed that Berger was, in fact, a Nazi sympathizer. He committed suicide in the hospital, not in protest but because he suffered from depression, she says. In taking his own life, Berger\u2019s death mirrored the suicides of many others at the time who were involved in Nazi atrocities.\n\nLeafing through his dusty laboratory notebooks containing the earliest recordings of human brainwaves, Zimmermann pointed out marginal antisemitic comments he had written alongside them. She then pulled out a stack of records of proceedings in the forced sterilization court where Berger served in an era when \u201ceugenics\u201d sought to cull the \u201cunfit\u201d from parenthood. Hearing them read aloud brought to life the horrors that had taken place there, as people pleaded with the court not to sterilize them or their loved ones. Berger denied every appeal, condemning them all to forced sterilization.\n\nThe hospital in Jena, Germany, where Berger discovered brainwaves. R. Douglas Fields\n\nBerger\u2019s EEG research was not well received. A believer in mental telepathy, Berger thought brainwaves could be the basis for mental telepathy, but he ultimately rejected that idea. Instead, he believed that brainwaves were a type of psychic energy. Like other forms of energy, waves of psychic energy could not be created or destroyed, but they could interact with physical phenomena. Based on this, he surmised that the work of mental cognition would cause temperature changes in the brain. He explored this idea by stabbing rectal thermometers into his mental patients' brains while they did cognitive tasks during surgery.\n\nBerger\u2019s research remained little known outside Germany until 1934 when Nobel Prize\u2013winning neuroscientist Edgar Adrian published his experiments in the prestigious journal Brain. Adrian confirmed that the so-called \u201cBerger waves\u201d do exist, but he implicitly mocked them by showing that they changed in a water beetle when it opened and closed its eyes, in the same way they did in the Nobel Prize\u2013winner\u2019s brain when he did the same. Adrian never did further research on brainwaves.\n\nBerger is credited with the discovery of brainwaves in humans, but studies in animals predated his work. Nor did Berger invent the methods he used to monitor brain activity. He applied techniques used previously in animal experiments by Adolf Beck in Lw\u00f3w, Poland, in 1895, and Angelo Mosel in Turin, Italy.\n\nIn contrast to Berger, Adolf Beck\u2019s animal studies were intended to understand how the brain functions when neurons communicate by electrical impulses. At the peak of his research a Russian invasion halted his scientific work. In 1914 Lw\u00f3w was taken by invading Russians and renamed Lviv. Beck was captured and imprisoned in Kiev, then part of Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\n\nWhile in prison he wrote to the famous Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov appealing for his help, and Pavlov eventually won Beck\u2019s release.\n\nBeck returned to his research in Lviv, and the next logical step was to search for brainwaves in humans, but in World War II Germans invaded. They established a concentration camp in Lviv where the Jewish population was exterminated. As an intellectual and a Jew, Beck was a target. When they came to take Beck to the concentration camp in 1942, he swallowed cyanide, ending his own life rather than having it taken by the Nazis.\n\nRemarkably, both pioneering brainwave scientists committed suicide from Nazism\u2014one as Nazi perpetrator, the other as Nazi victim.\n\nBerger\u2019s grave in Jena. R. Douglas Fields\n\nUnknown to both Berger and Beck, they were not the first to record brainwaves. That discovery was made by a London physician 50 years earlier than Berger! That stunning finding was lost to science because the ideas were so far ahead of their time, dating back to when the brain was an enigma and the world was lit by gas lamps and powered by steam. Imagine how much further ahead brain science and medicine would be now if this scientific discovery made in 1875 had not been lost to history for half a century.\n\nThe first person to discover brainwaves was the London physician Richard Caton. Caton announced his discovery of brainwaves recorded in rabbits and monkey at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1875. He achieved this using a primitive device, a string galvanometer, in which a small mirror is suspended on a thread between magnets. When an electric current (picked up from the brain in this case) passes through the device, the string twists slightly like a compass needle near a magnet. The oscillating electrical currents detected in the brains were not measured in volts, but rather in millimeters of deflection of the light beam bounced off the mirror. The published abstract of his presentation \u201cThe Electric Currents of the Brain\u201d shows that with this primitive instrument the physician correctly deduced the most important aspects of brainwaves. \u201cIn every brain hitherto examined, the galvanometer has indicated the existence of electric currents\u2026. The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function\u2026.\u201d\n\nIronically, I traveled the world to research the discovery of brainwaves, only to find that the first person to do so, Richard Caton, presented his findings in the U.S. in 1887 at Georgetown University while on a visit to his family in Catonsville, Md. The town, which was settled by his relatives 1787, is 30 miles from my home, next to the Baltimore-Washington Airport, from which I often embarked on my global search. But that fact, like his unappreciated brainwave research, was lost to history. \u201cRead my paper on the electrical currents of the brain,\u201d he wrote in his diary. \u201cIt was well received but not understood by most of the audience.\u201d\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "A recent groundbreaking experiment in which anesthesia was administered to rats has convinced some scientists that tiny structures in the rodents\u2019 brains are responsible for the experience of consciousness. To pull it off, microscopic hollow tube structures called \u201cmicrotubules\u201d perform some advanced physics; the experts believe microtubules perform incredible operations in the quantum realm. Citing the work of earlier researchers, the study infers that the same kinds of quantum operations are likely happening in the human brain.\n\nDuring their rat brain experiments, scientists at Wellesley College in Massachusetts gave the rodents isoflurane, a type of inhaled general anesthetic used to induce and maintain unconsciousness for medical procedures. One group of drugged rats also received microtubule-stabilizing drugs, while the other did not. The researchers discovered that the microtubule-stabilizing molecules kept the rats conscious for longer than the nonstabilized rats, which more quickly lost their \u201crighting reflex,\u201d or the ability to restore normal posture, according to the group\u2019s findings, which were published in the peer-reviewed journal eNeuro in August 2024.\n\nThe Wellesley study is significant because the physical source of consciousness has been a mystery for decades. It\u2019s a major step toward verifying a theory that our brains perform quantum operations, and that this ability generates our consciousness\u2014an idea that\u2019s been gaining traction over the past three decades.\n\nThe notion that quantum physics must be the underlying mechanism for consciousness first emerged in the 1990s, when Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Roger Penrose, PhD, and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, popularized the idea that neural microtubules enable quantum processes in our brain, giving rise to consciousness. Specifically, they postulated in a 1996 paper that consciousness may operate as a quantum wave passing through the brain\u2019s microtubules. This is known as Orch OR theory, referring to the ability of microtubules to perform quantum computations through a mathematical process Penrose calls \u201cobjective reduction.\u201d\n\nIn quantum physics, a particle does not exist in the way classical physics observes it, with a definite physical location. Instead, it exists as a cloud of probabilities. If it comes into contact with its environment, as when a measuring apparatus observes it, then the particle loses its \u201csuperposition\u201d of multiple states. It collapses into a definite, measurable state, the state in which it was observed. Penrose hypothesized that \u201ceach time a quantum-wave function collapses in this way in the brain, it gives rise to a moment of conscious experience.\u201d\n\nIf this quantum theory of consciousness tied to microtubules turns out to be correct, it could revolutionize our understanding of consciousness and even strengthen the trailblazing theory that consciousness, on a quantum level, is capable of being in all places at the same time. In other words, it can exist everywhere simultaneously, suggesting that your own consciousness can hypothetically connect with quantum particles beyond your brain, maybe entangling with consciousness all across the universe.\n\nMany scientists disregard the Orch OR theory because quantum effects have only been produced in the lab under extremely cold conditions. For example, our technology now includes quantum computers, but their operations rely on temperatures near absolute zero (around minus 273 degrees Celsius) to maintain their quantum states. The warm brain falls well outside those limits, at about 32 to 40 degrees Celsius (about 90 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the deepest regions of the brain, according to a 2022 study. Yet scientists have collected a promising set of data over the years indicating that certain quantum-level operations in animals and plants may actually be responsible for life\u2019s functions.\n\nFor example, scientists theorize that plants, which live at temperatures far warmer than absolute zero, probably use quantum processes to efficiently convert light into energy. First, plants transform photons, or light particles, into a form of matter called excitons, transporting them to the plant\u2019s chloroplasts to start photosynthesis. During this journey, the excitons must navigate around other internal plant structures\u2014fast enough to preserve their energy all the way to their destination. Scientists suggest that plants must use the quantum property of superposition in order to try all possible paths simultaneously. That way, excitons can arrive at their destination in the most efficient way possible.\n\nSimilarly, it may make sense for the billions of neurons firing simultaneously in the human brain to work under the \u201caction over a distance\u201d property of quantum entanglement\u2014the potential for two particles that are very far away from each other to be connected. Scientists have observed this phenomenon in atomic particles before. When they studied one particle, another very distant particle changed its properties as well, even though the two were not apparently connected in any way. An August 2024 study in the journal Physics Review E proposes that a fatty material called myelin, which sheathes the brain cell\u2019s axon, provides the ideal environment for this entanglement. Since the brain appears to be capable of performing quantum operations to facilitate our thoughts, some scientists surmise that this process gives rise to our consciousness.\n\nTwo earlier landmark studies also support a quantum perspective on consciousness. Both involved experiments shining light particles into microtubules and observing that the signal did not degrade. In fact, according to these studies, the experiments demonstrated that quantum states in microtubule signaling can and probably do exist.\n\nOne of the studies, an experiment by physicist and oncology professor Jack Tuszy\u0144ski, PhD, used ultraviolet photons to create quantum reactions for up to five nanoseconds. This quantum coherence lasted thousands of times longer than researchers had expected in a microtubule. Similarly, at the University of Central Florida, researchers shined visible light into one end of microtubules and measured how long the microtubules took to emit that light. They observed re-emission of this light over hundreds of milliseconds to seconds\u2014more than enough time for the brain to perform all of its functions.\n\nThis observation provides concrete evidence that neurons are able to work at speeds that allow quantum operations. It brings us another step closer to understanding exactly how our brain\u2014and perhaps our very consciousness\u2014is linked to a quantum universe.\n\nThe mind \u201cas a quantum phenomenon\u201d would \u201cshape our thinking about a wide variety of related questions, such as whether coma patients or nonhuman animals are conscious,\u201d neuroscientist and Wellesley College professor Mike Wiest, PhD, says in a press release about his team\u2019s recent anesthesia study. In addition to the new work helping us understand more about how to treat brain-related health issues, he says \u201cwe will have entered a new era in our understanding of what we are.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The story so far: On December 13, Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of the Mission Governing Board of the nascent National Quantum Mission, said India plans to launch a quantum satellite in \u201c2-3 years for quantum communications\u201d.\n\nWhat is the National Quantum Mission?\n\nThe National Quantum Mission (NQM) is a Department of Science & Technology programme to accelerate the use of quantum physics in the development of next-generation communications and sensing systems.\n\nThe development of computers changed the course of human history from the mid-20th century onwards. Thanks to advances in this sector, which continue to this day, humankind has access to telecommunications, weather forecasts, drug-discovery programmes, search-and-rescue plans, artificial intelligence, etc.\n\nBut many of these advances are nearing a saturation point because the physics phenomena on which they are based, called classical physics, are hitting a performance upper-limit. Today scientists around the world are building new devices to perform the same functions but using quantum physics. Because the rules of quantum physics allow for the outcomes of classical physics as well as \u2018bonus\u2019 ones not found in the classical paradigm, the new devices are expected to have new abilities.\n\nThe Union Cabinet approved the NQM in April 2023 at a total cost of Rs 6,000 crore, to be implemented from 2023 to 2031. The planned quantum satellite is an experiment in this package.\n\nWhat is a quantum satellite?\n\nA quantum satellite is a term for a communications satellite that uses quantum physics to secure its signals.\n\nCommunications is a broad term that refers to technologies that send and receive signals. An important part of these technologies is security: preventing bad actors from intercepting a message being transmitted across large distances, through multiple networks.\n\nThe advent of quantum computers threatens the technologies currently being used to secure messages. Fortunately, quantum physics has also paved the way for new forms of protection, and quantum satellites are expected to facilitate them.\n\nHow are messages secured?\n\nSay two people, Anil and Selvi, are standing at two ends of a playground and wish to speak to each other. The simplest way is to shout or wave their hands. There is also a third person, Kaushik, standing in the middle of the ground trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. If Anil and Selvi are shouting or using hand signals, Kaushik will have little difficulty intercepting their messages \u2014 but not if they are communicating via WhatsApp.\n\nMessages in WhatsApp are encrypted. Encryption means a message is written in a secret code before it is transmitted. When the recipient receives it, they will use their knowledge of the code to decrypt the message and read it. If a bad actor like Kaushik somehow intercepts the message, he can\u2019t read it without knowing the code.\n\nFor example, in a Caesar cipher, the letters of the alphabet are offset by a fixed number. If the number is 5, the words BIRDS FLY AWAY become GNWIX KQD FBFD.\n\nThis paradigm is called cryptographic security. It gets its strength by hiding the key to cracking the code behind an extremely difficult mathematical problem. Anil\u2019s and Selvi\u2019s devices already have the solution to this problem. If Kaushik wants it, however, he has to first solve the problem with a computer \u2014 and the harder the problem, the more time (or more computing resources) he will need.\n\nA modern computer can crack a Caesar cipher quickly by repeatedly trying all possible keys (1-26) until the text becomes legible. But even the most powerful supercomputers can\u2019t crack the best Advanced Encryption Standard ciphers today in a single lifetime. Quantum computers may be able to do better, however.\n\nHow can quantum physics protect messages?\n\nQuantum cryptography uses the tenets of quantum physics to secure messages. Its most famous type is quantum key distribution (QKD).\n\nIn the example before, Anil used a secret code to encrypt or \u2018lock\u2019 his message and Selvi had the key to decrypt and read the message. QKD is concerned with sharing the key with Anil and Selvi such that if Kaushik is eavesdropping on the transmission, everyone will find out and the sharing is aborted.\n\nQuantum physics can reveal eavesdropping in different ways. One is quantum measurement \u2014 the act of measuring the properties of a quantum system, like a photon (the subatomic particle of light). According to the rules of quantum physics, a quantum measurement changes the state of the system. If information about the key is encoded in a stream of photons (in two states, one representing 0 and the other 1) and Kaushik traps and measures them to look for it, the state of the photons will change and Anil and Selvi will know the key has been compromised.\n\nAnother way is to use quantum entanglement: when two photons are entangled, any change to one particle will instantaneously change the other. (This is a necessarily simplistic description.)\n\nSince the key will be lost irrespective of what technological capabilities Kaushik possesses, QKD is said to provide unconditional security.\n\nHas QKD been implemented?\n\nRavindra Pratap Singh, of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, wrote in 2023 that the standards for different QKD protocols and the technologies they will require to implement as designed are still a decade away. This said, China currently operates the world\u2019s largest QKD network with three quantum satellites and four ground stations.\n\nExperts are also trying to implement QKD across longer distances. In the two decades since its experimental proof in 1992, the distance of reliable transmissions has increased to several hundred kilometres either through fibre-optic cables or free space.\n\nIn 2013, researchers from China reported that they had implemented QKD between a ground station and a moving hot-air balloon (carrying a payload of instruments) 20 km up. This demonstration bolstered the case for quantum satellites.\n\nIn an October 2024 study, researchers at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, reported that the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, Ladakh, offered the best atmospheric conditions through which to transmit data for a satellite-based QKD system. It had an estimated signal loss of 44 dB, compared to 50 dB in the Chinese experiment.\n\n\u201cOur main signal would be at 810 nm while the uplink and downlink would use 532 nm and 1550 nm of wavelength, respectively,\u201d the paper\u2019s lead author Satya Ranjan Behera told the Department of Science & Technology. The planned beam distance is 500 km.\n\nDoes QKD have drawbacks?\n\nBecause QKD on paper can be very different from that in the real-world, the U.S. National Security Agency has recommended the use of post-quantum cryptography rather than quantum cryptography. Its criticism is focused on five limitations:\n\n(i) \u201cQKD does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source\u201d;\n\n(ii) \u201csince QKD is hardware-based\u201d, QKD networks can\u2019t be upgraded or patched easily;\n\n(iii) \u201cQKD increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks\u201d that \u201celiminate many use cases from consideration\u201d;\n\n(iv) \u201cthe actual security provided by a QKD system is not the theoretical unconditional security from the laws of physics \u2026 but rather the more limited security that can be achieved by hardware and engineering designs\u201d; and\n\n(v) since eavesdroppers can cause a transmission to stop, they can deny the use of a transmission by its intended users (a.k.a. a denial-of-service attack).\n\nPost-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic techniques that resist attacks from both quantum and classical devices using more advanced classical encryption.\n\nQuantum physics also imposes some restrictions. For example, non-quantum information can be amplified before being transmitted across large distances whereas the no-cloning theorem prohibits the amplification of quantum information."
