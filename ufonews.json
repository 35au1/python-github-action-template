            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Tributes paid after death of the 'last mud-horse fisherman'\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump carries a pair of his new signature shoes before taking the stage at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCampaign catchphrases aside, we can probably all agree that this was a very weird year in politics, particularly in Pennsylvania, the swingiest of swing states. Before we look ahead to 2025 let\u2019s review the ways Pennsylvania\u2019s politics and politicians got a little (or a lot) weird in 2024.\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, President-elect Donald Trump did, in fact, take the stage at Sneaker Con in Philly back in February to unveil an official sneaker: gold high-tops with American flag logos, available for pre-order at $399 (limit three pairs per customer). Reporter John Cole had to convince his editor it wasn\u2019t a social media joke, and ended up with a front row seat despite little advance notice from the campaign about where and how to catch Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump admitted the sneakerhead crowd was \u201ca slightly different audience than I\u2019m used to,\u201d but also said launching the shoe line was something he had wanted to do for \u201ca long time.\u201d He did not wear the shoes on stage. And further proving that politics make strange bedfellows, we discovered that according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the president of Sneaker Con made donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and a Trump-affiliated PAC, although in relatively small amounts.\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, the head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) talked about the agency tracking UFO sightings, to the surprise of committee chairperson Jordan Harris. It took a while to receive them, but senior reporter Peter Hall sought records on the sightings, which showed PEMA investigated more than a dozen incidents over the past decade.\n\nThe sightings included mysterious lights following a motorist on a dark country road, a saucer-shaped craft hovering over a suburban subdivision, and a flaming orb falling into the woods, the records show. Many of the incidents are reported to Stan Gordon, a Westmoreland County resident who operates a 24-hour UFO, bigfoot and cryptid reporting hotline, who said the line has \u201cnever stopped ringing\u201d since the Kecksburg UFO incident of 1965.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken these cases very open mindedly,\u201d Gordon told the Capital-Star \u201cWe approach them scientifically.\u201d\n\nMold in a government office does not seem like the kind of situation that would require a whistleblower, but here we are. A staffer at Rep. Eric Davanzo\u2019s (R-Westmoreland) district office in West Newton complained of foul odors, and bought tests to check for the presence of mold. That didn\u2019t go over too well when the tests came back positive, and she was later fired. She sued for wrongful termination and the Commonwealth Court ruled she could move forward with a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nFirst things first: If you want to try to modify the weather in Pennsylvania, you need a license \u2014 but since the law took effect in 1967 no one has applied for one (we asked).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), former GOP nominee for governor, claims that new technology and a proliferation of weather modification patents \u201cowned by a combination of Federal Government Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and large multinational corporations\u201d have brought forward the need to update Pennsylvania\u2019s law. He wrote a memo seeking co-sponsor for legislation he intends to introduce.\n\nThe legislation would ban the release of substances within the borders of Pennsylvania to affect the temperature, weather or intensity of sunlight, and appears to be rooted in the false belief that condensation trails left by high flying aircraft are actually trails of chemicals \u2014 aka chemtrails \u2014 released by the government for nefarious reasons, that has become conflated with techniques being explored to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to write a story with so much potential to use the phrase \u201cred wave.\u201d Alas, it only occurred to our headline writer much later (which, truly, is probably for the best). In June, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) objected to a bill to create a grant program that would make pads and tampons free for public school students. She didn\u2019t like that the bill\u2019s cosponsorship memo referred to menstruating women as \u201cpeople,\u201d and claimed the bill was \u201cjust another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s prime sponsors, Rep. Darisha Parker (D-Philadelphia), said the bill would serve to \u201crestore the dignity to these women and girls who have gone unsupported far too long.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 117 to 85. It did not advance in the Senate."

            "article_content": "2024 was another fabulous year for video game releases, and indie games truly shined all year long. This is normally the time when we\u2019d list our top 10 indies, and we do just that below. However, we also don\u2019t believe this year could be confined to a measly 10 games, even in indies. That\u2019s why we included 14 more.\n\nShacknews Top 24 Indies, 24 - 11\n\n24. Little Kitty, Big City\n\n23. Felvidek\n\n22. Card-en-Ciel\n\n19. Kamikaze Lassplanes\n\n19. Fields of Mistria\n\n19. Luma Island\n\n18. Isles of Sea and Sky\n\n17. Slitterhead\n\n16. Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore\n\n15. Thank Goodness You're Here!\n\n14. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes\n\n13. 1000xRESIST\n\n12. Tales of Kenzara: ZAU\n\n11. Penny's Big Breakaway\n\nCongrats to those that made our list, even if they couldn\u2019t be in the Top 10. Voting was tight this year and many of these games are that splendid and were hotly contested! Each of them is well worth a check if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t played them yet, so we wish them all congrats for launching this year. Without further ado. It\u2019s time to move on to Shacknews Top 10 Indie Games of 2024. Here they are:\n\n10. Crow Country\n\nThere's a lot of nostalgia wrapped up in 90s horror games, and it's quite special how the team behind Crow Country managed to perfectly capture not only the look, but the vibe and feel of those games with this year's indie horror hit.\n\nCrow Country dials up scares without an excessive use of jump scares or other cheap tactics. Instead, SFB Games uses atmosphere to unsettle its players. From the music and sound design to bizarre creature models, Crow Country nestles itself deep under your skin.\n\nThe mystery of Crow Country was fodder for countless YouTubers this year as the community collaborated to piece together the clues laid out by SFB Games. It takes a special kind of game to foster that sort of community, and Crow Country is an excellent ambassador for the indie horror space.\n\nCrow Country is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.\n\n9. The Axis Unseen\n\nThere was little doubt that Nate Purkeypile was going to give us a game to remember from the moment he revealed The Axis Unseen because regardless of where you stand on indies, first-person games, or survival games, this one is an incredible concept: A heavy metal-inspired survival game where you wander the wilderness with a bow, arrows, and supernatural powers as you hunt cryptids and they often hunt you in turn.\n\nPurkeypile came out of the gate looking all sorts of ambitious with this one. He was an early adopter of Unreal Engine 5 in the indie game dev community, and it was clear from early on how much UE5's streamlined asset creation and specialized tools were a boon to the experienced environmental designer. The Axis Unseen's wilderness is rich and wicked, featuring a vast forest full of hills, mountains, and creatures to discover.\n\nThe Axis Unseen's creature design is also on point. It starts with small, mostly benign critters that will really only attack you if you attack them. However, it's not long before you running into tree giants that can impale you with thorny branches and intense Bigfoot creatures that can beat your brains in a jiffy if they catch you. The smart use of your arrows and the powers you can imbue into them is the only way you stand a chance.\n\nWhen it came to 2024's gaming year, The Axis Unseen was maybe one of the most interesting indie stoies. Nate Purkeypile clearly had a distinct vision and the experience to know how he wanted to apply it, but his early work in UE5 feels like a story other indie devs should appreciate and study. Even then, how many other games let you try to outmaneuver and hunt Bigfoot amid outcroppings of giant radical horned skulls and creature skeletons?\n\nThe Axis Unseen is available on Steam and Epic Games Store platforms.\n\n8. Mouthwashing\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of games that unnerve us here at Shacknews. Mouthwashing more than unnerved us, it wormed its way into our brain, made is feel uncomfortable, unpleasant, and disgusted at what people are capable of doing. It\u2019s also hands-down one of the indie games this year.\n\nMouthwashing is a psychological horror game set aboard a cargo vessel that\u2019s transporting goods between planets. The crew is small, consisting of just five people, and as you might assume, tensions fray. The game kicks off with the ship colliding with a celestial body after someone sabotaged the flight controls.\n\nFrom this point onward, the narrative plays out along two timelines: the lead up to the crash and following the crash. You\u2019ll be walking around the ship, helping solve the issues that crop up, from general maintenance to smoothing over everyone\u2019s emotional state. But things go sideways quickly.\n\nMouthwashing instils a sense of impending dread as the crew fights to survive not just dwindling supplies, but their withering emotional and mental stability. It\u2019s a harrowing game that left us staring at our screens, mouth agape, as the credits rolled. Want to feel gut-punched? Play Mouthwashing.\n\nMouthwashing is available on the Steam platform.\n\n7. Another Crab's Treasure\n\nSince Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring have solidified what the souls-like genre is, there have been no lack of studios derivating on it. But few have made their version of this genre stand out from the regular Soulsborne vibe like Another Crab\u2019s Treasure. Instead of being a forsaken ethereal being wandering through a fallen kingdom or the remains of a ferocious war, you\u2019re a hermit crab named Kril who just wants his shell back after a literal loan shark takes it from him. With that, you wander the floor of an ocean where all the local life has taken a shine to human garbage that has littered the seabed. And so, it\u2019s an undersea souls-like in which your \u201csoul\u201d resources are trash and your various weapons are \u201cshells\u201d Kril can equip that give him unique powers.\n\nThe environment itself in Another Crab\u2019s Treasure is equal parts funny, pretty, and upsetting. Every area you go to has some level of natural undersea beauty to it, but it\u2019s tainted with the cheap veneer of repurposed garbage from the human world that sea creatures have become enamored with. What most of them don\u2019t know is that prolonged contact with that trash makes them crazy and violent.\n\nThat means Kril has to fight through insane creatures, many of which are much larger than him. What\u2019s a hermit crab to do? Well, that\u2019s where the shells come in. At any time, Kril can jump into a nearby soda can, banana peel, yogurt cup, or any other prop to defend himself as he fights back with his trusty crab fork and fishing hook. The shell also matters because each of them has a different power you can use to even the odds and stay alive. For instance, the soda can lets you dodge backwards and release a spray of bubbles that home in on a target. Using the right shell in the right situation is key if you\u2019re going to survive. It\u2019s challenging to play, but Aggro Crab was also brave enough to allow you to soften the difficulty, up to and including the ridiculous option to give Kril a gun.\n\nUltimately, Aggro Crab blends a solid display of comedy and charm with a stark undertone. Its funny crab and crazy fish are cute as heck, but they can also be scary and upsetting in near equal capacity. The environments have a similar energy. Put that together with responsive action and platforming under the sea and you just might see the value of Another Crab\u2019s Treasure.\n\nAnother Crab's Treasure is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.\n\n6. The Plucky Squire\n\nThe Plucky Squire immediately climbed our most anticipated games of the year list when got our first glimpse at its reality-bending art style. With the combination of 2D and 3D art styles, developer All Possible Futures is able to have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nNot only is The Plucky Squire satisfying to look at, it's fun to play, too. It's levels and puzzles are packed with homages to the classics of the genre, with enough originality to keep gameplay feeling fresh.\n\nPlaying through The Plucky Squire is like reading a storybook rich with humor and fun characters. We hope this isn't the last we see of this neat little universe.\n\nThe Plucky Squire is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n5. UFO 50\n\nWhen we learned the developers of Spelunky and its sequel were going to be developing a new game, we expected it would be something cool. What we could have never guessed was that it would be 50 somethings that were each, in fact, cool. UFO 50 is a collection like nothing else. It\u2019s an homage to a vast array of classic video game titles and might be the most ridiculously efficient bang for your gaming buck, especially since many of its included games turned out to be full-length titles.\n\nRight from the get-go Mossmouth allows players access to every single one of the 50 games in UFO 50. The idea is that a mysterious company released all these games in obscurity. They all hearken back to the days of 80s arcades and home platforms, with some being very short and easy to beat while others are like full-length RPGs of the time that could take hours to complete.\n\nThey\u2019re a pretty awesome spread of titles too. Action, horror, sports, adventure, puzzle, and even narrative journeys are among those included here. Heck, there are even homages to metroidvanias, first-person dungeon crawlers, and narrative horror like NES\u2019s Uninvited, Deja Vu, and Shadowgate. Yet somehow, Mossmouth was able to also pack in its signature charm and humor in most cases, making this an altogether incredible collection.\n\nUFO 50 is a very easy game to recommend to anyone at any age because of the way it\u2019s set up. There\u2019s something for just about everyone here, and pretty much all of these games are worth trying at least once. We don\u2019t know what compelled Mossmouth to pack 50 different games into a single title, but we can\u2019t help but applaud the absolute madness and the quality that each title contains.\n\nUFO 50 is available on the Steam platform.\n\n4. Neva\n\nNeva delivered one of the year's most beautiful narratives with the tale of woman's bond with a wolf. It explores the relationship between a person and their animal companion, poignantly examining the highs and lows that entail.\n\nVisually, Neva is one of the year's most stunning games. Every location is picturesque, beautiful vistas juxtaposed against a decaying world.\n\nNeva is also a competent platformer, providing a decent challenge throughout its 5-6 hours of gameplay. That said, those in it for the narrative can opt to play in Story Mode.\n\nNeva is a reminder of the impact that video games can have, and that some of the best stories in games reside in the indie space.\n\nNeva is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n3. Pacific Drive\n\nPacific Drive saw an early release in 2024, but Ironwood Studios\u2019 sci-fi driving survival game got its hooks in and stayed with us well throughout the year. In all of 2024 gaming (and really beyond it for that matter), there was nothing quite like what Pacific Drive brought to the table. Moreover, its environments, music, and narrative were great enough to make sure that when this year\u2019s Shacknews Awards deliberations came around, it was still solidified in our minds as one of this year\u2019s most unique titles.\n\nIn Pacific Drive, you are a mysterious investigator that ventures into the mountainous forest region of the Pacific Northwest to a place known as the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Serious environmental experiments and oddities occurred in this place which led to the government building a barrier around it to keep what was inside, inside, and what was outside, outside. Obviously your intrusion means it didn\u2019t quite work, but it also isn\u2019t long before you discover a seemingly innocuous station wagon that acts as your getaway from a rough situation. And shortly after that, you discover folks that were both studying the Zone and got trapped by it. You also find a garage, which plays a big role in the rest of your journey.\n\nTo escape the Zone (theoretically) you\u2019ll need to venture deeper into it and collect energy from anomalous sites to power various experimental machinery. The Zone is a pretty fragile place, so every journey into a new area finds you traversing randomized stretches of dense forests and hills in the Station Wagon as you loot the supplies you need, build the tools that make things easier, and generally try to keep your station wagon maintained. After all, there\u2019s also freakish anomalies that can be a danger to you and the car such as autonomous piles of electrified scrap. Also, when you take the energy you need from a place in the Zone, that area\u2019s stability will collapse and it\u2019s a race to get out alive.\n\nGetting back to the garage and being able to recuperate with your pillaged resources was brief recompense, and it also feels therapeutic to repair and upgrade your car for the next adventure. You can even paint and put decals on it to make it truly your own. All of these things together made Pacific Drive a game unlike really anything else this year, and Ironwood Studios deserves to be celebrated for such an interesting journey, not to mention assembling such a perfect sci-fi roadtrip soundtrack with all of the good vibes of a personal mixtape.\n\nPacific Drive is available on PlayStation, and Steam platforms.\n\n2. Animal Well\n\nEveryone knew Animal Well was special the moment they laid eyes on it. The cute and unassuming pixel art style of a dark and lonely world was just dripping with mysteries to solve. Then it released and everyone realized the genius at work in Billy Basso\u2019s head.\n\nAnimal Well is a Metroidvania unlike anything that has come before it. There\u2019s no combat to be found, and as a tiny little critter, your only course of action against any threat is to run \u2013 or use the cleverly designed tools to your advantage.\n\nYou see, you\u2019re not going to get something as straightforward as unlocking double-jump or a grapple hook. You\u2019re going to get a Frisbee, a yo-yo, and other childhood toys. It\u2019s not even going to be clear how these things work and how you might use them to solve the game\u2019s myriad puzzles and navigate its dense, secret-packed world.\n\nBut when you do figure out how to use these items, you\u2019ll see the world differently. These little light bulb moments happen constantly throughout Animal Well as you engage in one of the best puzzle-platforming games this year.\n\nThough it hasn\u2019t secured our Indie Game of the Year 2024 award, it has come remarkably close and remains a favorite among the staff here at Shacknews. If you\u2019re a fan of unassuming indie games that have a tendency to blow your mind, you need to do yourself a favor and check out Animal Well.\n\nAnimal Well is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n1. Balatro\n\nThinking back over the past few decades at Shacknews, the staff is hard-pressed to think of any indie game that has garnered such universal acclaim or been as accomplished as Balatro. There have been memorable indie titles over the years. Games like Journey, Gone Home, and Hades come to mind as true standout efforts. Yet Balatro feels like it stands above them all. It certainly stands out over an incredibly stacked field of outstanding indie titles in 2024.\n\nFor solo developer LocalThunk to build on a relatively simple idea and captivate the entire gaming world has been nothing short of impressive. A poker roguelike sounds like a simple idea in theory, but the execution and the way it all came together has been special. Thousands of players across multiple platforms continue to try and chase high scores, just like in gaming days of old, all while utilizing well thought-out strategies and rolling with whatever luck befalls them. There are few sensations better in gaming right now than when a Balatro run comes together with the right combinations of rare Jokers, enhanced cards, and Boss Blinds that somehow manage not to upend the entire outing.\n\nThe Balatro formula is so easy to get into and drives its hooks in deep. It's part of why the Shacknews staff feared the day that it came to mobile devices, because it's the kind of game that's perfect to play on-the-go. It ranks up with historic handheld greats like Tetris and Dr. Mario in terms of easy accessibility and \"one more game\" loops that never seem to end.\n\nLocalThunk's efforts have been remarkable. It's amazing to see a single artist put the bulk of the work into such an expertly crafted game. It's the kind of phenomenon that gaming may never see for a long time. Shacknews was privileged to see the tale of Balatro play out over the course of 2024 and we're happy to name it the Shacknews Best Indie Game of 2024.\n\nBalatro is available on Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\nCheck out our Shacknews Indie Game of the Year 2024 - Balatro article to read more.\n\nWe salute everyone who released a game in this very difficult year for so many game developers. We couldn\u2019t do our jobs without these amazing creators. Thank you for another year of amazing indie games and congratulations to everyone who made our Shacknews Top 24 Indie Games of the Year 2024 list.\n\nBe sure to read over the rest of the Shacknews Awards in our Year of the Games: 2024 feature."

            "article_content": "AI is now everywhere, even if it is not natively integrated. It has given everyone the power to get things done, understand complex things, and create images using their imagination. Meta AI, the AI-powered chatbot, has been rolled out to almost everyone, and here is how to use the Meta AI in WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of all these apps before you try. Also, it is possible that Meta may not have rolled it out for all users and countries. So, if you press @ and Meta AI doesn\u2019t show up, that would be why.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in WhatsApp\n\nMeta AI was the first to roll on WhatsApp and has been incredibly useful for many. If you are a small business or struggle with creative writing, Meta AI can help you rather quickly. You can access Meta AI using the @ button in single or group chat and interact with it directly as a contact.\n\nSince the group chats are visible to everyone, use the one-to-one chat to get things done and then forward it to other groups or chats.\n\nYou can also access Meta AI using the individual chat option. The interesting part is that Meta AI now offers an AI studio with many ChatBots of different styles. That includes advice and connections, pop culture, Anime, and more.\n\nRead: Stop Meta from using your data for AI training\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Instagram\n\nInstagram is all about Reels and Images. That\u2019s where the Meta AI imagine feature comes into the picture. While it is not natively integrated yet, you can use it in Group or Individual conversations by asking it to generate images using the /imagine switch.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Facebook Messenger\n\nLike above, you can quickly access Meta AI using the @ button from the text box. You can then ask a question; for example, you can ask for restaurant recommendations, information on a topic, or even a request. Or you can go ahead and tag a conversation and ask Meta to explain it.\n\nIf images are your thing, then directly type /imagine or @metaAI /imagine followed by your description, and it will generate AI images you can send. However, do remember that Meta AI will provide answers or content directly within your chat, visible to all participants.\n\nRead: Is it Real or AI Picture? How to identify using tools?\n\nMeta AI in WhatsApp is not working\n\nIf Meta AI isn\u2019t working correctly in WhatsApp, make sure your app is up to date, as older versions might not support the feature. If issues persist, clear the app\u2019s cache through your phone\u2019s settings to resolve minor glitches. Restart the app by closing and reopening it to refresh the connection.\n\nMeta AI is not able to read chat in the Group\n\nEven though Meta Ai is part of WhatsApp groups or Messenger, it can read or analyze a message even if tagged. If you want it to read, you must type it, and it will be visible to everyone."

            "category": "ai+app",
            "date": "22h",
            "source": "The Motley Fool",
            "article_content": "Ark Investment Management operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on innovative technology stocks. Its founder, Cathie Wood, believes software companies are the next big opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, predicting they could generate up to $8 in revenue for every $1 they spend on chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nWood has invested in AI start-ups like xAI, OpenAI, and Anthropic through the Ark Venture Fund since making that prediction last year, so she's backing up her words with decisive action. Moreover, Ark's various ETFs own several leading AI software stocks like Amazon and Tesla.\n\nIf Wood proves to be right about AI software companies, here's why C3.ai (AI -4.26%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.73%) might be two of the biggest winners in the coming years.\n\n1. The case for C3.ai\n\nC3.ai was the world's first enterprise AI company when it was founded in 2009. Now, it offers over 100 ready-made AI applications for businesses, which can help them accelerate their adoption of this revolutionary technology. C3.ai's software is especially popular in industries that aren't normally known for developing cutting-edge technology, like energy, manufacturing, and financial services.\n\nDow, which is one of the world's largest manufacturers of chemicals, uses the C3.ai Reliability application to monitor equipment and conduct predictive maintenance. It has reduced downtime by 20% so far, which translates to fewer costs and more revenue. Similarly, one multinational bank deployed the C3.ai Anti-Money Laundering application to detect fraud, and it resulted in a 200% increase in the number of correctly identified suspicious transactions.\n\nC3.ai sells its applications directly to customers, but it also has joint sales agreements with the three major cloud giants, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. C3.ai integrates with those platforms and leverages their computing power to give customers the performance they need. Since most businesses already use one of those three cloud providers, it's extremely easy for them to adopt C3.ai's applications.\n\nDuring C3.ai's fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), 62% of its deals were closed through its partnership network, so it's a critical sales channel for the company.\n\nC3.ai generated a record $94.3 million in revenue during the quarter. That was a 29% increase from the year-ago period, and it marked the seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The company is reaping the benefits of a change to its business model from two years ago, when it switched from subscription-based revenue to consumption-based revenue. It streamlined the onboarding process by eliminating lengthy negotiating processes, so customers can sign up faster than ever.\n\nDeveloping AI is expensive, and it requires specialized expertise that many companies don't have. Therefore, as AI adoption spreads, more enterprises will turn to providers of ready-made solutions like C3.ai. That's why this could be a great AI stock for investors to own for the long term.\n\n2. The case for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has a rich history of innovation that led to the creation of a broad portfolio of software products like the Windows operating system, Azure cloud platform, and 365 productivity applications (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). The company is also a leader in AI software, thanks to its near-$14 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nThe partnership -- which dates back to 2019 -- paved the way for Microsoft to launch the Copilot AI assistant, which is now embedded into most of its flagship software apps. Copilot for 365, for example, can help users rapidly create text and image content in Word and PowerPoint, which can significantly boost their productivity. It can also answer complex questions, which is very useful when conducting research.\n\nOrganizations around the world pay for more than 400 million 365 licenses for their employees, and each of them is a candidate to add Copilot for an additional monthly subscription fee. Microsoft says 70% of the Fortune 500 companies are using Copilot for 365 already, and the number of people who use it daily more than doubled in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30).\n\nMicrosoft also created Azure AI for its cloud customers. It allows businesses to access state-of-the-art computing infrastructure to develop AI software, and it also provides them with access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's latest o1 series. Microsoft says demand is outstripping supply for its AI data center infrastructure, but the company spent around $20 billion to build more capacity during Q1. That spending is likely to ramp up in the coming quarters.\n\nValuation might be one drawback to buying Microsoft stock right now. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.2, which is a 10% premium to its 10-year average of 32.8. However, as represented by the orange line in the below chart, its forward P/E ratio (based on the consensus earnings estimate from Wall Street for the next year) is 29.2:\n\nIn other words, even though Microsoft stock is technically expensive today, it might actually be cheap for investors who are willing to hold it for at least the next year.\n\nIf Cathie Wood is right and AI software generates $8 in revenue for every $1 companies spend on chips, the potential payoff from Microsoft's data center infrastructure investments could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars in the future. As a result, it's hard to look past Microsoft stock as one of the top AI software plays."

He also claimed that World War 3 would break out.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nHe then emphasized that future battles may involve not only military troops but also machines.\n\nOn the other hand, he is referred to as the Living Nostradamus as Nostradamus gave the world and its future generations predictions about wars, plagues, natural disasters, civil unrest, political assassinations, and other similar stuff when his renowned book Les Proph\u00e9ties was published in 1555.\n\n'Living Nostradamus' Athos Salome made other predictions as well\n\nAthos Salome allegedly made predictions in the past as well (Image via Instagram / athos_salome)\n\nAthos Salome also pointed to the growing risks of international security, including cyberwarfare and sophisticated weapons. Salome further highlighted the growing concerns about cyber espionage and the tense standoff between the US and China that is reminiscent of the Cold War.\n\nAthos Salome believed that a catastrophic cyberattack could result from the accusations of hacking and espionage that have been exchanged between the two nations.\n\nSuch an event might render critical defense systems and infrastructure inoperable, leading to a global collapse of military and communication infrastructure. He then argued that this could serve as the impetus for a wider war.\n\nHe further drew attention to the current tensions about a crucial South China Sea event. Salome believed it would host a \"critical event.\"\n\nHe then claimed that an unknown party may launch a concerted attack on space and maritime communications systems, disrupting the military operations of major world powers.\n\nSuch a move might worsen global instability by causing confusion among superpowers.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nConsidered a serious problem, he warned that cyberwarfare has escalated to become one of the \"greatest dangers to international safety.\" Athos Salome also voiced concerns in the interview over the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, pointing out the substantial use of cutting-edge weapons like drones and supersonic missiles.\n\nHe further alleged that genetically engineered humans will be invented around 2025. He then asserted that government and corporate scientists have been \"quietly\" employing cutting-edge technologies to produce \"perfected\" people who are stronger, smarter, and more disease-resistant than typical people.\n\nHe alleged that the first case would come from Asian nations.\n\nAthos Salome then alleged that his predictions were based on his belief that the biggest threats to international security are currently being faced. He went on to assert that authorities would finally acknowledge the presence of extraterrestrial life in the new year.\n\nIt is said that providing evidence of microbial life on Mars will be part of that phase.\n\nHe also discussed the devastating effects of the global energy crisis, the revelation of covert military operations, the use of implantable chips by governments for mass surveillance under the pretense of security and health improvements, and the unprecedented climate disasters brought on by geoengineering.\n\nMeanwhile, Nostradamus was a bearded seer, a plague doctor, an accused heretic, and an astrologer from the 16th century. He is credited with predicting a number of events, including the Great Fire of London, Hitler's ascent to power, the September 11 attacks, the COVID-19 epidemic, and the earthquake that struck on New Year's Day last year.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "article_content": "An artist's impression of a hot exoplanet.\n\nAstronomers have unveiled the discovery of two Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting a star more than 40 light-years from our planet, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing quest to identify potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. A team of researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the pre-print server arXiv and shared by phys.org. The star, HD 101581, also catalogued as GJ 435, is a K5V-type orange dwarf star located about 42 light years away. The two confirmed exoplanets, designated HD 101581 b and HD 101581 c, were identified through meticulous observations using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during its 63rd and 64th observation sectors. These planets exhibit radii comparable to Earth's, with HD 101581 b measuring approximately 0.956 times Earth's radius and HD 101581 c about 0.990 times. Their orbital periods are notably brief, with HD 101581 b completing a revolution around its host star every 4.47 days and HD 101581 c every 6.21 days.\n\nArtist's impression of the James Webb Telescope.\n\nAdditionally, a third candidate planet, HD 101581 d, has been detected, though its existence awaits further confirmation. If validated, this planet would also be Earth-sized, with an orbital period of approximately 7.9 days. The discovery of these Earth-sized exoplanets is especially compelling due to their relative proximity to our solar system, which facilitates more detailed study. Nevertheless, their close orbits to HD 101581 suggest that they are subjected to intense stellar radiation, resulting in higher surface temperatures than Earth's. This likely renders them inhospitable to life as we know it. Despite the remote possibility that they could harbour life, the planets offer invaluable opportunities for scientific investigation.\n\nRecent images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Such research contributes to the broader objective of identifying Earth-like planets within habitable zones, where conditions may be conducive to life. This discovery arrives at a pivotal moment. The astronomical community anticipates a surge in exoplanet research in 2025, propelled by data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Launched in December 2021, the JWST has already demonstrated its capacity to observe distant cosmic phenomena with unprecedented clarity.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope captures Ring Nebula in \u2018unprecedented detail\u2019\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "A representational picture showing the OpenAI logo displayed on a phone screen on May 20, 2024. \u2014 Reuters\n\nAnnouncing restructuring plans, OpenAI said on Friday it would establish a public benefit company to make it simpler to \"raise more capital than it had imagined,\" and lift the restrictions placed on the firm by its present nonprofit parent.\n\nThe recognition and thorough justification for its high-profile restructuring confirmed a September Reuters story that provoked discussion among tech titans like Elon Musk and corporate watchdogs.\n\nAt issue were the implications such a move might have on whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and how the company would strike a balance between making a profit and generating social and public good as it develops AI.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the ChatGPT maker's existing for-profit arm would become a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC) \u2014 a structure designed to consider the interests of society in addition to shareholder value.\n\nOpenAI has been looking to make changes to attract further investment, as the expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses human intelligence, heats up.\n\nIts latest $6.6 billion funding round at a valuation of $157 billion was contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker could upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors within two years, Reuters reported in October.\n\nThe nonprofit, meanwhile, will have a \"significant interest\" in the PBC in the form of shares as determined by independent financial advisers, OpenAI said in a blog post, adding that it would be one of the \"best resourced nonprofits in history.\"\n\nOpenAI started in 2015 as a research-focused nonprofit but created a for-profit unit four years later to secure funding for the high costs of AI development. Its unusual structure gave control of the for-profit unit to the nonprofit and was in focus last year when Sam Altman was fired as CEO only to return days later after employees rebelled.\n\n'Critical step'\n\n\"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness,\" the Microsoft-backed startup said on Friday.\n\n\"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\"\n\nIts plans to create a PBC would align the startup with rivals such as Anthropic and the Musk-owned xAI, which use a similar structure and recently raised billions in funding.\n\nAnthropic garnered another $4 billion investment from existing investor Amazon.com last month, while xAI raised around $6 billion in equity financing earlier in December.\n\n\"The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business,'\" DA Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.\n\n\"This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,\" Luria said, although he added that the move did \"not necessitate OpenAI going public.\"\n\nThe startup could, however, face some hurdles in the plan.\n\nMusk, an OpenAI co-founder who later left and is now one of the startup's most vocal critics, is trying to stop the plan and in August sued OpenAI and Altman. Musk alleges that OpenAI violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI.\n\nOpenAI earlier this month asked a federal judge to reject Musk's request and published a trove of messages with Musk to argue that he initially backed for-profit status for OpenAI before walking away from the company after failing to gain a majority equity stake and full control.\n\nMeta Platforms is also urging California's attorney general to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nBecoming a benefit corporation does not guarantee in and of itself that a company will put its stated mission above profit, as that status legally requires only that the company's board \"balance\" its mission and profit-making concerns, said Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane Law School.\n\n\"The only reason to choose benefit form over any other corporate form is the declaration to the public,\" she said. \"It doesn't actually have any real enforcement power behind it,\" she said.\n\nIn practice, it is the shareholders who own a controlling stake in the company who dictate how closely a public benefit company sticks to its mission, Lipton said."

            "article_content": "This holiday season, OpenAI's employees and former staff could experience an extraordinary financial windfall. A private stock sale orchestrated by the San Francisco-based leading AI company will allow approximately 400 eligible participants to cash in up to $10 million each, marking one of the most lucrative employee payouts in the tech industry.\n\nA Special Stock Sale\n\nThe opportunity comes via a tender offer from Japan's SoftBank Group, which has agreed to purchase up to $1.6 billion of OpenAI stock at $210 per share. This price reflects OpenAI's valuation of $157 billion, which has doubled in just a year, according to Fortune. Eligible shareholders include current and former OpenAI employees who were issued restricted stock units more than two years ago.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWho Benefits?\n\nCurrent OpenAI employees will receive priority in this stock sale. Fortune reports they can cash out the maximum allowable amount of $10 million each. Former employees, while also eligible, may face limits depending on the level of participation. However, all participants are guaranteed to sell at least $2 million worth of stock, ensuring that everyone benefits from the opportunity.\n\nThe participation deadline was set for Dec. 24, so the resulting payout offers a timely holiday bonus for those involved. The eligible stock is reportedly valued at $2 billion, but some shares may remain unsold, with SoftBank purchasing $1.6 billion.\n\nA Growing Valuation\n\nOpenAI's stock sale aligns with its dramatic growth. According to CNBC, since the launch of ChatGPT, the company has raised $13 billion, including $6.6 billion in its most recent fundraising round in October. SoftBank initially invested $500 million during this round and its latest tender offer represents an even greater stake in the AI leader. Other notable investors include Microsoft and chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nTender offers like this have become increasingly important in the tech industry, especially given a subdued IPO market. By allowing employees to sell shares, companies like OpenAI provide liquidity to their teams while avoiding the pressures of going public.\n\nPolicy Revisions\n\nThis tender offer also reflects OpenAI's evolving policies toward secondary share sales. Past restrictions limited participation and raised employee concerns, but the company has since introduced changes to create a more inclusive process. Now, current and former employees have equal access to annual tender offers, ensuring a fairer system.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the policy shift has quelled shareholder tensions while positioning OpenAI to maintain its capital-intensive operations. With plans to facilitate more secondary sales in the future, the company is addressing the growing demand for liquidity among tech workers.\n\nTrending: It\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here\u2019s how everyday investors are getting started.\n\nCompetition and Market Dynamics\n\nOpenAI faces stiff competition from rivals such as Anthropic and tech giants like Google. Yet, the company's valuation and continued fundraising highlight its dominance in the rapidly expanding generative AI market. Bloomberg states it will generate $1 trillion in revenue within the next decade.\n\nSoftBank's commitment to AI investments extends beyond OpenAI. The conglomerate has backed other startups, including Glean and Perplexity and recently announced plans with President-elect Donald Trump to allocate $100 billion toward projects in the U.S., according to The Associated Press.\n\nHoliday Cheer for OpenAI Employees\n\nThis tender offer represents a rare opportunity for OpenAI's employees to turn their equity into tangible wealth. Whether they cash out partially or take full advantage of the $10 million cap, the payout is a testament to the company's success and commitment to rewarding its team.\n\nOpenAI's stock sale reminds us of the financial opportunities available in the tech industry, especially for those working at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.\n\nRead Next:"

            "article_content": "OpenAI says this move will make it easier to attract investors who need a simpler setup to invest large amounts of money. Illustration: Tech & Startup Desk\n\nOpenAI, the company behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, announced on Friday that it plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation (PBC) - shifting to a for-profit company from its previous non-profit structure.\n\nAccording to the company, this change is aimed at helping the company raise more money to fund its efforts in developing advanced AI systems, including artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014AI that could potentially surpass human intelligence.\n\nHow will this new structure work?\n\nThe new structure will turn OpenAI's for-profit branch into a PBC based in Delaware. This type of company is required to balance making money with benefiting society. OpenAI says this move will make it easier to attract investors who need a simpler setup to invest large amounts of money, as per a recent report by Reuters on the matter.\n\nCompetition in the AI field is growing quickly, with companies spending billions of dollars to advance technology, suggests the Reuters report. OpenAI's last funding round in October raised $6.6 billion, valuing the company at $157 billion. However, the funding came with conditions\u2014OpenAI had to promise to remove profit limits for investors within two years.\n\nWhy this change?\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI explained the need for the change, saying: \"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\"\n\nEven with the restructuring, OpenAI's nonprofit branch will still play an important role. It will own a large share of the new PBC, based on evaluations by financial experts, making it one of the best-funded nonprofits ever, says the company.\n\nConcerns regarding this change\n\nOpenAI's decision for a for-profit shift has sparked criticism and legal challenges. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who left the company, has filed a lawsuit, claiming the move prioritises profits over public benefit and breaks earlier agreements. OpenAI has asked a federal court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Musk originally supported the idea of for-profit changes.\n\nMeta Platforms has also raised concerns, reportedly asking California's attorney general to block the restructuring. Critics argue that while PBCs are meant to balance public good and profits, there's no strong enforcement to ensure companies stick to their missions, adds the Reuters report.\n\nOpenAI's decision reflects the growing pressure to keep up in the fast-moving and costly world of AI development. Whether the new structure can truly balance profits and public good remains to be seen."

            "article_content": "The meme coin market has been buzzing, hasn\u2019t it? Every few months, a new quirky token emerges, setting the internet on fire and sending crypto enthusiasts into a frenzy. With the overall crypto market adapting to economic turbulence, meme coins have shown surprising resilience and creativity. Their blend of community spirit and innovative utility is a massive draw. If you thought 2023 was meme coin madness, wait till you see what 2024 has in store. Among this vibrant chaos, one coin that\u2019s stealing the show is BTFD Coin (BTFD). Let\u2019s just say, if you\u2019re chasing returns, you might want to keep reading.\n\nBTFD Coin isn\u2019t just riding the meme coin wave \u2013 it\u2019s redefining it. With a thriving presale already crossing $4.44 million and groundbreaking features like its Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, referral programme, and staking with a juicy 90% APY, it\u2019s attracting investors like flies to a barbecue. If you\u2019re looking for the best meme coins for massive income, you\u2019ll want to stick around as we explore this coin and its competitors.\n\n1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin to Watch\n\nWhat sets BTFD Coin apart? A whole lot, actually. From its quirky name (a cheeky nod to the phrase \u201cbuy the dip\u201d) to its feature-packed ecosystem, this token is the new superstar in town. Its presale launched at an eyebrow-raising $0.000004 per coin and has now reached Stage 12, priced at $0.000064. Analysts are predicting fireworks, with a listing price of $0.0006 post-presale. BTFD\u2019s referral programme and 90% staking APY are also luring savvy investors.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Play 2 Earn game is a major talking point. Although it\u2019s still in beta (launched in Stage 10), the full version promises rewards that could rival established P2E platforms. For those who love to hustle, BTFD\u2019s referral programme is pure gold. With every new investor brought on board, you earn additional rewards. And did we mention the Bulls Squad? This elite community is rallying hard to push the token\u2019s value to new heights.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because it\u2019s a juggernaut in the making. A presale performance surpassing $4.6 million, game-changing utility, and a vibrant community make BTFD Coin a no-brainer for those hunting the best meme coins for massive income.\n\nHead to the presale page and be part of the meme coin revolution. Unlock 50% more coins by using the BIG50 bonus code when you buy in.\n\n2. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Meme Coin\n\nDogecoin hardly needs an introduction, does it? As the pioneer of the meme coin world, it\u2019s been a darling of the internet and a plaything for whales. DOGE owes much of its stardom to endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk, whose tweets alone can send it soaring. Its simplicity and absurdity\u2014a Shiba Inu dog on a coin\u2014made it a pop culture phenomenon.\n\nUnlike many meme coins, Dogecoin has stayed relevant by being surprisingly practical. It\u2019s fast, has low transaction fees, and boasts one of the largest communities in the crypto world. The coin\u2019s use in tipping and small-scale payments has helped it secure a spot in everyday crypto usage. Plus, with ongoing discussions about integrating DOGE into platforms like X (formerly Twitter), it\u2019s clear this meme coin isn\u2019t just a fad.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, it\u2019s a legend. Dogecoin remains a cornerstone of the meme coin ecosystem and is one of the best meme coins for massive income for investors who value stability alongside fun.\n\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Dogecoin Killer\n\nShiba Inu entered the crypto stage as the self-proclaimed \u201cDogecoin Killer.\u201d While that may have sounded ambitious at the time, SHIB\u2019s rise was nothing short of spectacular. This Ethereum-based token launched with a decentralised vibe, and its ShibaSwap platform added a level of utility most meme coins can only dream about.\n\n2024 has been a transformative year for SHIB. Its developers are working on Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain solution to lower transaction costs and increase speed. Combine this with the ShibaSwap ecosystem and its NFT ventures, and you\u2019ve got a meme coin with serious utility backing its meme appeal. Its massive, devoted community (nicknamed the SHIB Army) and innovative features make it a top contender in the meme coin race.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because Shiba Inu has moved beyond being a meme coin. Its utility and ambitious plans for the future cement its position as one of the best meme coins for massive income.\n\n4. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Dark Horse\n\nAh, Pepe Coin. What started as an internet joke became a decentralised sensation in the meme coin market. Inspired by the infamous frog meme, PEPE has a devoted, albeit niche, following. The coin thrives on its community\u2019s creativity and humour, often launching viral campaigns that boost its visibility and trading volume.\n\nIn 2024, PEPE has proven it\u2019s not just a flash in the pan. The token\u2019s development team has hinted at potential collaborations and upcoming utilities that could elevate its status. For now, its charm lies in its meme culture and its ability to surprise investors with sudden price surges.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Pepe Coin\u2019s unpredictable nature, strong community, and potential for explosive gains make it a wildcard in the hunt for the best meme coins for massive income.\n\n5. Bonk (BONK): Solana\u2019s Meme Marvel\n\nBonk made waves as the first major meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its launch was all about giving back to the community. In fact, 50% of its initial supply was airdropped to Solana users, making it an instant hit. Unlike most meme coins, BONK\u2019s appeal lies in its unique association with Solana\u2019s fast, low-cost transactions.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about BONK is its community-driven approach. The coin has spurred a wave of activity on Solana, from NFT projects to decentralised applications. It\u2019s a meme coin that\u2019s breathing new life into its blockchain, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because Bonk\u2019s alignment with Solana\u2019s robust infrastructure and its strong community engagement make it a standout contender among the best meme coins for massive income.\n\nThe Economic Crash of 1973: Lessons for Today\u2019s Investors\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to 1973, a year marked by a global economic crash that sent shockwaves through markets. Those who seized the chaos as an opportunity to buy undervalued assets reaped massive rewards in the years that followed. The lesson? Economic downturns are goldmines for the bold.\n\nFast forward to today, and the crypto market\u2019s bearish trends mirror those turbulent times. Meme coins, particularly BTFD Coin, offer a unique chance to capitalise on these dips. With its thriving presale and robust ecosystem, BTFD isn\u2019t just a meme; it\u2019s a strategy for navigating these chaotic times.\n\nHow to Join the BTFD Coin Presale\n\nGetting your hands on BTFD Coin is a cinch. Just go to the presale page.

Boom, you\u2019re in.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on our research and market trends, meme coins are redefining investment opportunities for the modern era.

            "article_content": "An artist's impression of a hot exoplanet.\n\nAstronomers have unveiled the discovery of two Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting a star more than 40 light-years from our planet, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing quest to identify potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. A team of researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the pre-print server arXiv and shared by phys.org. The star, HD 101581, also catalogued as GJ 435, is a K5V-type orange dwarf star located about 42 light years away. The two confirmed exoplanets, designated HD 101581 b and HD 101581 c, were identified through meticulous observations using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during its 63rd and 64th observation sectors. These planets exhibit radii comparable to Earth's, with HD 101581 b measuring approximately 0.956 times Earth's radius and HD 101581 c about 0.990 times. Their orbital periods are notably brief, with HD 101581 b completing a revolution around its host star every 4.47 days and HD 101581 c every 6.21 days.\n\nArtist's impression of the James Webb Telescope.\n\nAdditionally, a third candidate planet, HD 101581 d, has been detected, though its existence awaits further confirmation. If validated, this planet would also be Earth-sized, with an orbital period of approximately 7.9 days. The discovery of these Earth-sized exoplanets is especially compelling due to their relative proximity to our solar system, which facilitates more detailed study. Nevertheless, their close orbits to HD 101581 suggest that they are subjected to intense stellar radiation, resulting in higher surface temperatures than Earth's. This likely renders them inhospitable to life as we know it. Despite the remote possibility that they could harbour life, the planets offer invaluable opportunities for scientific investigation.\n\nRecent images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nStudying their atmospheres and compositions can enhance understanding of planetary formation and the diversity of planetary systems. Such research contributes to the broader objective of identifying Earth-like planets within habitable zones, where conditions may be conducive to life. This discovery arrives at a pivotal moment. The astronomical community anticipates a surge in exoplanet research in 2025, propelled by data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Launched in December 2021, the JWST has already demonstrated its capacity to observe distant cosmic phenomena with unprecedented clarity.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope captures Ring Nebula in \u2018unprecedented detail\u2019\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "2025 holds promising opportunities with crypto presales remaining a golden opportunity for those seeking significant returns. By participating early, traders can purchase coins at a fraction of their potential market price, setting the stage for substantial profits. As NYE draws near, certain presales are standing out due to their unique approaches and profitable structures.\n\nBlockDAG (BDAG), Aureal One (DLUME), DexBoss (DEBO), and Flockerz (FLOCKEZ) are identified as the top crypto platforms for massive ROI in 2025, each presenting a distinct value proposition.\n\nThese projects meet various needs from gaming metaverses and DeFi tools to decentralized governance models, all while offering returns that could significantly enhance portfolios.\n\n1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Ultimate Scalability Solution\n\nBlockDAG (BDAG) is transforming crypto presales with a platform that excels in scalability and creativity, priced at just $0.0234 per coin. BlockDAG has already raised $173 million, selling 17.5 billion coins. Its current batch 26 is nearly sold out.\n\nEarly buyers of BDAG have witnessed a 2,240% ROI, and the ongoing BDAG400 tiered bonus is drawing even more interest. This incentive offers bonuses up to 250% for the first five BDAG purchases.\n\nOne of BlockDAG\u2019s key features is its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, allowing for simultaneous transactions, which boosts speed and efficiency. This technology is perfect for developers creating decentralized applications, from gaming to DeFi. By focusing on scalability, BlockDAG ensures its ecosystem can handle growing user demands.\n\nWith the 2025 mainnet launch confirmed, trader confidence in BlockDAG is rising. The network also supports developers through low-code/no-code tools and community incentives, making it a compelling choice for those looking at the best new altcoin to buy for potential growth and stability.\n\n2. Aureal One (DLUME): Gaming Revolution Through Blockchain\n\nAureal One merges gaming with blockchain technology to develop a metaverse-centric ecosystem characterized by fast transactions and minimal transaction costs. Leveraging Zero-Knowledge Rollups for scalability and efficiency, it has become popular among developers in the gaming sector.\n\nEarly participants in DLUME can anticipate notable returns. Its key attractions include immersive games such as \u201cClash of Tiles\u201d and governance roles for coin holders. While its gaming emphasis adds allure, Aureal One\u2019s success largely depends on its acceptance within this specialized market. Yet, it stands out as one of the best new altcoins to buy for significant ROI in 2025, particularly for those interested in the convergence of blockchain and entertainment.\n\n3. DexBoss (DEBO): Enhancing DeFi Accessibility\n\nDexBoss revolutionizes the DeFi landscape with a broad array of tools suited for both experts and novices. Its features, such as liquidity farming, high-leverage trading, and staking options, support a diverse range of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, offering users extensive variety.\n\nThe presale is appealing due to the platform\u2019s strategy of buybacks and token burning, which gradually decreases the coin supply\u2014potentially enhancing DEBO\u2019s value over time. However, the high-leverage options may pose risks for those without prior experience. Nevertheless, DexBoss is a top crypto platform for those in search of an effective and pioneering DeFi system with significant growth potential.\n\n4. Flockerz (FLOCKEZ): Empowering Community Governance\n\nFlockerz rounds out our list of best new altcoins to buy with a unique vote-to-earn system that involves its community in governance while rewarding them. This approach ensures that decentralization is at the heart of its operations.\n\nThe FLOCKEZ coin offers staking benefits, encouraging longer-term engagement. Although it is marketed as a meme coin, Flockerz incorporates practical applications, especially in promoting enduring, community-driven blockchain initiatives. This presale is particularly appealing to those looking for a blend of entertainment and real value in the crypto space.\n\nSelecting the Right Crypto Presale for You\n\nEach crypto presale presented here brings distinct benefits. Aureal One integrates gaming with blockchain for enthusiasts of digital entertainment, DexBoss simplifies DeFi for various traders, and Flockerz champions decentralization with its community-centric model.\n\nBlockDAG, however, is known for its proven strategy encompassing scalability, an upcoming mainnet launch, and exceptional presale success. Its adaptable ecosystem and features favorable to both developers and traders position it as the best new altcoin to buy for robust growth and stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the right crypto choice should match each person\u2019s specific requirements, but BlockDAG\u2019s solid ROI track record and promising future prospects mark it as a leading option for substantial returns in 2025."

            "article_content": "More children than ever have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to conflict, according to the UN agency.\n\nAbout 473 million, or more than one in six children, are estimated to live in conflict areas worldwide, according to the United Nations children\u2019s agency.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s statement came on Saturday as conflicts continue to rage around the world, including in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, among other places.\n\nIn Israel\u2019s devastating war on Gaza in particular, at least 17,492 children have reportedly been killed in nearly 15 months of conflict that has reduced much of the enclave to rubble.\n\n\u201cBy almost every measure, 2024 has been one of the worst years on record for children in conflict in UNICEF\u2019s history \u2013 both in terms of the number of children affected and the level of impact on their lives,\u201d said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.\n\nAccording to Russell, a child growing up in a conflict zone is far more likely to be out of school, malnourished, or forced from their home compared with a child living in places with no conflict.\n\n\u201cThis must not be the new normal. We cannot allow a generation of children to become collateral damage to the world\u2019s unchecked wars,\u201d the director said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proportion of children living in areas of conflict has doubled \u2013 from about 10 percent in the 1990s to almost 19 percent today, UNICEF said.\n\nAccording to the report, 47.2 million children were displaced due to conflict and violence by the end of 2023.\n\nThe trends for 2024 indicate a further increase in displacement because various conflicts have intensified, including in Haiti, Lebanon, Myanmar, the Palestinian territories and Sudan.\n\nAdditionally, in the latest available data, from 2023, the UN verified a record 32,990 grave violations against 22,557 children \u2013 the highest number since UN Security Council-mandated monitoring began, UNICEF said.\n\nThere is an overall upward trend in the number of grave violations, with this year likely to see another increase, as \u201cthousands of children have been killed and injured in Gaza, and in Ukraine\u201d, the agency said.\n\nSexual violence against children has surged, their education has been affected, children\u2019s malnutrition rates have risen and armed conflicts have taken a larger toll on children\u2019s mental health, UNICEF also reported.\n\n\u201cThe world is failing these children. As we look towards 2025, we must do more to turn the tide and save and improve the lives of children,\u201d Russell said.\n\nGaza\u2019s children \u2018cold, sick, traumatised\u2019\n\nIn Gaza \u2013 where the Israeli military has killed more women and children in the past year than in any recent conflict over a single year, Oxfam reported in September \u2013 the ongoing war is a \u201cnightmare\u201d for children, UNICEF Communication Specialist Rosalia Bollen said last week at a media briefing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cChildren in Gaza are cold, sick and traumatised,\u201d Bollen said last Friday.\n\nAbout 96 percent of women and children in Gaza cannot meet their basic nutritional needs, she said, lamenting the lack of aid able to reach children in the Strip.\n\n\u201cGaza must be one of the most heartbreaking places on Earth for humanitarians. Every small effort to save a child\u2019s life is undone by fierce devastation,\u201d said Bollen.\n\n\u201cFor over 14 months, children have been at the sharp edge of this nightmare.\u201d\n\nBollen said that many children in the besieged enclave don\u2019t have winter clothes, have to resort to searching through rubbish for provisions and are plagued with diseases.\n\nShe urged the use of political capital and diplomatic leverage to push for the evacuation of injured children and their parents to leave Gaza and seek medical care in East Jerusalem or elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis war should haunt every one of us. Gaza\u2019s children cannot wait,\u201d she pressed."

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Tributes paid after death of the 'last mud-horse fisherman'\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."
