            "article_content": "Content provided by British Council\n\nRead the following text, and answer questions 1-9 below\n\n[1] Do you believe in ghosts or paranormal activity? Professor Chris French is keen to know why. His research focus is \u201canomalistic psychology\u201d: bizarre experiences that many people have and why they believe in events that do not have a scientific base.\n\n[2] French, a professor emeritus at Goldsmiths College at the University of London in the United Kingdom, explores examples of \u201csupernatural activity\u201d in his research, and in his book The Science of Weird S**t: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal. He investigates ghost sightings, fortune-tellers, clairvoyants and psychics. Alien abductions are also in his scope. If it is a strange thing, French is interested.\n\n[3] Ghost sightings take up most of his time. There are many reasons people think they have seen one. One is a well-proven phenomenon called sleep paralysis, little known outside scientific circles. It can convince even cynics that they are in the presence of a \u2013 usually malicious \u2013 ghost.\n\n[4] \u201cSleep paralysis is a temporary period of paralysis between sleep and wakefulness,\u201d French said. \u201cIt can come with a range of additional symptoms that can make it absolutely terrifying. These include a strong sense of an evil presence and hallucinations like hearing voices or footsteps and seeing demons. Other symptoms include experiencing difficulty in breathing, feeling pressure on the chest and intense fear.\u201d\n\n[5] People go through several different stages during a regular night\u2019s sleep. One is REM, or rapid eye movement, sleep \u2013 the stage associated with vivid dreams. \u201cThe muscles of the body are actually paralysed during this phase, presumably to stop us from acting out the actions of the dream,\u201d French said.\n\n[6] Sometimes, REM sleep dream imagery gets mixed up with feelings of being awake, and we mistakenly believe we are having a supernatural experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a glitch in the normal sleep cycle. It\u2019s as though the brain wakes up, but the body doesn\u2019t \u2013 and all of that imagery spills over into waking consciousness,\u201d said French. Many artistic representations of ghosts and demons from the past probably stem from sleep paralysis, he added.\n\n[7] How about Ouija boards? This apparent way to communicate with the dead involves asking questions and having a form of marker seemingly move across a board of letters and numbers to spell out answers on its own. \u201cWhen people experience the planchette or an upturned wine glass moving around during a Ouija board session, the illusion that some external force is causing the movement is powerful,\u201d French explained. \u201cIn fact, those taking part are making unconscious muscular movements, known as the ideomotor effect.\u201d\n\n[8] Sometimes, ghost stories are cons to make a dollar. But while scammers do exist, our desire to believe is the bigger culprit. \u201cThe single most powerful cognitive bias that we all suffer from is confirmation bias,\u201d said French. \u201cWe pay more attention to evidence that is consistent with what we already believe or would like to be true. And we either ignore evidence [that does not match what we believe] or make up reasons it can be dismissed.\u201d If you believe in ghosts, it is more likely you will think you see one, he said.\n\nSource: South China Moring Post, December 29\n\nQuestions\n\n1.

            "article_content": "Quick, what do you think of when you hear the word \u201cThunderbird?\u201d\n\nThe (very snazzy) car? The plane? Or perhaps even the email software?\n\nBut how many of you would conjure up images of a gigantic creature that flaps its wings and unleashes tempests? And how many more of you are privy to rumors of sightings of such a creature coming out of Pennsylvania?\n\nA Kiowa shield cover decorated with a turtle, a Thunderbird, stars and the milky way. Sightings of the Thunderbird have been reported in Pennsylvania as recently as 2021. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)Universal Images Group via Getty\n\nAccording to \u201cEncyclopedia of Beasts and Monsters in Myth, Legend and Folklore (2016),\u201d Thunderbirds are gigantic spirits from Native American lore that take the form of birds. They\u2019re particularly known for controlling the weather.\n\n\u201cBy [the Thunderbird\u2019s] work, the earth was watered and vegetation grew,\u201d reads Encyclopedia Britannica. \u201cLightning was believed to flash from its beak, and the beating of its wings was thought to represent the rolling of thunder.\u201d\n\nTales vary depending on which tribe tells the story, adds \u201cNative American Myths: Stories & Folklore from the Apache to the Zuni (2018)\u201d: Some believe it\u2019s a god. Others describe it as being more human in shape. The Lakota Sioux even had more than one type of Thunderbird.\n\nNow, it could be argued the Thunderbird myth is among those that can be easily explained: North America is full of incredibly large birds that \u2014 back in the day \u2014 could have been mistaken for some godlike creature. California condors \u2014 North America\u2019s largest wild bird \u2014 has a wingspan of 109 inches, or a little over 9 feet, far exceeding the height of your average Joe.\n\nThat would make it unlikely for anyone to believe they saw a Thunderbird in this day and age, right?\n\nWell.\n\nPeople do, in fact, still claim to see Thunderbirds, vast zoological knowledge out there and all. According to a 2018 Juneau Empire report, a woman proclaimed on Facebook how she spotted a \u201cHUGE\u201d bird \u201calmost the size of a small airplane\u201d in Mendenhall Valley, Alaska. Reddit threads detailing accounts from all over the country \u2014 mainly in the West \u2014 eagerly discuss the potential existence of the being.\n\nAnd, of course, there have been plenty of purported sightings in the Keystone State.\n\nKwakiutl dancers in masks and costumes representing (left to right) Wasp, Thunderbird, and Grizzly-bear, arrive in canoes during the winter ceremony. The myth of the Thunderbird differs from tribe to tribe. (Photo by Buyenlarge/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Wilds website, sightings of the Thunderbird have popped up in places such as Pine Creek Valley and the I-80 Frontier over the last 100 years or so: A man in Cameron County claimed to have seen a flock of them in 1892. An early pioneer of Potter County swore he saw the same.\n\nThere\u2019s even a legend known as the \u201cLost Thunderbird Photo,\u201d which is said to be evidence of the creature, although it was supposedly lost in a house fire. Researcher Ivan Sanderson \u2014 who states he was the one to have left the photo with the owner of the house that burnt down \u2014 has dedicated a whole website to this lost photo, as well as other paranormal encounters from Bigfoot to the Jersey Devil.\n\n\u201cThis was like a mammoth hawk, or a mammoth eagle or a mammoth raptor of some kind,\u201d describes one witness to an alleged sighting in 1970. \u201cIt was not a condor. It had no resemblance to any prehistoric animal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was an aberration. There are creatures that, for whatever reason, they grow bigger than the average bear.\u201d\n\nThunderbirds have continued to be spotted in Pennsylvania in recent years: Head over to cryptid and alien tracking sites like the one run by Pennsylvania-based researcher Stan Gordon and you\u2019ll find accounts of run-ins with Thunderbirds that have occurred way passed the 1970s.\n\nA Thunderbird as drawn by a Dakota near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, around 1883. (Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons)Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u201cIn early April of 2021, [a] woman was just pulling into a parking lot for a scheduled appointment at a location in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\u201d one such account reads. \u201cShe was a few minutes early, so she was talking with a friend on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, something flew over her vehicle that shadowed the entire car. Even though she was in her car she ducked her head, thinking it was a small plane about to crash. She commented to her friend about what had just happened. Seconds later, she saw the biggest bird she had ever seen flying in front of her car.\u201d\n\nNow, the biggest question is, if these birds are so big, why aren\u2019t more people seeing them?\n\nWell, if you adopt the same line of thinking that some other paranormal researchers apply to other cryptids such as Bigfoot\u2014 as highlighted in \u201cThe Sasquatch People and Their Interdimensional Connection (2011)\u201d \u2014 the Thunderbird can be viewed as a creature that moves among dimensions. In other words, one minute it\u2019s in our dimension where we can spot it, and then, boom, it zips into the unseeable unknown.\n\nSo, are all these sightings just really, really big birds, or creatures from beyond our realm of understanding? You decide.\n\nAnd next time you\u2019re caught in a storm, be sure to take a closer look at the sky."

            "article_content": "Opening a movie is never easy, especially when it comes to horror, as it's tempting to start things off with creative violence or over-the-top gore to leave a big impression from the get-go.\n\nOf course, this practice can come across as forced or gimmicky, and for this reason, slashers, paranormal thrillers, and gothic folk tales may focus more on character development in the beginning, saving the best scares for later. Unfortunately, taking the slow approach can cause interest to wane before things really get going. As such, filmmakers must find a perfect balance with how to kick things off.\n\nAlthough a picture shouldn't be judged based entirely on its prologue, the entries on this list let us know we were in for a good (and terrifying) time straight away. Whether opening with a fascinating premise, a tantalising jump scare, or an intriguing villain, these films immediately made you aware you were in safe hands.\n\nEven though we've already done 10 Horror Movies You Knew Would Be Good After The First 10 Minutes and 10 MORE Horror Movies You Knew Would Be Good After The First 10 Minutes, we've now found even more horror movies that are sure to leave anyone enraptured within the first ten minutes."

The films will also highlight more details on key IAEA programmes to battle plastic pollution, drought and hunger.\n\nThe films are made in conjunction with the IAEA's twelve nuclear sciences and applications laboratories, a unique feature in the United Nations. The laboratories develop and share nuclear techniques with countries around the world. Watch a three-minute film about the labs here.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \u201cPeople may know us as the nuclear watchdog, helping enhance safety, security and safeguards in places like Fukushima, Iran, Ukraine. But not enough people know of the amazing potential nuclear science has to make tangible differences in people\u2019s lives \u2013 helping farmers grow better crops, cancer patients get better treatment, governments understand and protect key natural areas. As the terrible effects of climate change become more obvious to people around the world, it is important for the public to also know there is hope. Science, as always, offers solutions to many of our main challenges.\u201d\n\nNajat Mokhtar, Head of IAEA Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, agreed: \u201cI am delighted to see ours labs' the vital research being shared on the respected Discovery Channel. Science is a vital force for good in the world, and nuclear science offers so many incredible innovations to help countries meet their development goals.\u201d\n\nJamie Cooke, Executive Vice President and Managing Director Central Europe, Middle East and Turkey said: \u201cWe are thrilled that our viewers will now get the opportunity to learn more about how nuclear science is being used in innovative ways to improve our lives and advance the environmental sustainability agenda. We consider it our duty to leverage the voice, storytelling strength and expertise we have, to cast light and tell the right stories that will positively impact our communities and viewers.

            "article_content": "'Good To Know', a new educational videos series explaining how nuclear science can help solve global issues, is being launched today on Discovery Channel, as part of a new partnership with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThe films will air in over 30 countries, reaching 44 million households across the entire Europe, Middle East and Africa region.\n\nThis first tranche of five short films, made by the IAEA video team in conjunction with the Warner Bros. Discovery editorial team, will explain in simple terms how radiation can safely be used to solve some of the world's most pressing global challenges. These include:\n\nMicroplastics in the ocean (filmed in Monaco/Global)\n\nThe growing cancer burden (filmed in India)\n\nFood insecurity (filmed in Austria/Global)\n\nWater scarcity in the face of climate change (filmed in Austria/Costa Rica)\n\nIndustrial contamination (filmed in Czech Republic)\n\nEach of these films is around one minute long and will play as part of Discovery's 'Good To Know', a new educational videos series about the benefits of nuclear science and technology, both on television and online.\n\nFuture films to be included in the series will continue to investigate how nuclear science can help development, particularly in the light of climate change, such as by measuring how coastal regions sequester carbon, or how the oceans are becoming more acidic, or how pest insects can be controlled without chemicals. The films will also highlight more details on key IAEA programmes to battle plastic pollution, drought and hunger.\n\nThe films are made in conjunction with the IAEA's twelve nuclear sciences and applications laboratories, a unique feature in the United Nations. The laboratories develop and share nuclear techniques with countries around the world. Watch a three-minute film about the labs here.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \"People may know us as the nuclear watchdog, helping enhance safety, security and safeguards in places like Fukushima, Iran, Ukraine. But not enough people know of the amazing potential nuclear science has to make tangible differences in people's lives - helping farmers grow better crops, cancer patients get better treatment, governments understand and protect key natural areas. As the terrible effects of climate change become more obvious to people around the world, it is important for the public to also know there is hope. Science, as always, offers solutions to many of our main challenges.\"\n\nNajat Mokhtar, Head of IAEA Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, agreed: \"I am delighted to see ours labs' the vital research being shared on the respected Discovery Channel. Science is a vital force for good in the world, and nuclear science offers so many incredible innovations to help countries meet their development goals.\"\n\nJamie Cooke, Executive Vice President and Managing Director Central Europe, Middle East and Turkey said: \"We are thrilled that our viewers will now get the opportunity to learn more about how nuclear science is being used in innovative ways to improve our lives and advance the environmental sustainability agenda. We consider it our duty to leverage the voice, storytelling strength and expertise we have, to cast light and tell the right stories that will positively impact our communities and viewers. It's part of our Social Good Strategy, and we want to use our media for good.\"\n\nAbout the International Atomic Energy Agency"

            "article_content": "OpenAI launched the A.I. boom in late 2022 with the release of the online chatbot ChatGPT. The company continues to lead the field but faces countless competitors. One of its biggest rivals, xAI, is led by Elon Musk, who has developed a close relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nMany A.I. companies and independent experts believe that technologies like ChatGPT can increase economic growth by accelerating work and research in areas as far-flung as computer programming, medicine, education and finance. But continued development of these technologies requires enormous amounts of raw computing power and electricity.\n\nOpenAI and its rivals are racing to expand the pool of giant computer data centers needed to build and operate their A.I. systems, which will require hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment. With its new economic blueprint, OpenAI hopes to encourage government policies that can facilitate that additional infrastructure.\n\nMost notably, the company has called on policymakers to allow significant investment in American A.I. projects by investors in the Middle East, though the Biden administration has been wary of such investment. OpenAI argues that if countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia do not invest in U.S. infrastructure, their money will flow to China instead.\n\n\u201cAre those countries going to be building on U.S. rails or are they going to be building on C.C.P. rails?\u201d Mr. Lehane said in an interview, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. He described nations like the Emirates and Saudi Arabia not as allies but more as \u201cswing states\u201d that will choose the United States or China for A.I. investments."

            "article_content": "The News\n\nOpenAI published a list of policy proposals on Monday, outlining how US federal and state governments can catalyze the artificial intelligence industry and keep China from taking the lead.\n\nThe 15-page document argues that the US should invest heavily in energy and other infrastructure to spur investment in American AI technology, calling for a closer relationship between leading AI companies and the US national security community, among other proposals.\n\nOpenAI also announced a big push to engage officials at the state level to galvanize support for AI initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Lehane, OpenAI\u2019s head of global policy, said the proposals aimed to shift views around AI policy to one of excitement and national ambition. \u201cThis stuff is electricity,\u201d Lehane said in an interview with Semafor. \u201cDo we want to have a mindset that we really want to use this to advance our country on national security and economic issues?\u201d\n\nThe blueprint comes amid a coupling of the tech industry and politics, with Elon Musk serving as head of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency. Trump has also appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as \u201cAI Czar\u201d and may be pursuing a \u201cManhattan Project for AI.\u201d\n\nThe current boom in AI models requires a massive amount of compute power, both to train the most cutting-edge models and to run those models once they are trained. That has created an insatiable appetite for energy from the largest tech companies and is on a trajectory to strain the country\u2019s aging power grid.\n\n\u201cSince private markets alone may not be enough to pay for the massive amount of needed AI infrastructure, the US government can provide offtake purchase commitments and credit enhancements to encourage infrastructure investment,\u201d the report reads.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, the US is leading the AI lead, but that could change, the report warns, if it does not boost its infrastructure\n\n\u201cIf the US doesn\u2019t move fast to channel these resources into projects that support democratic AI ecosystems around the world, the funds will flow to projects backed and shaped by the CCP [Communist Party of China],\u201d the document says.\n\nOpenAI is also targeting state governments around the country in a new initiative called Innovating for America, which will kick off with a planned event in Washington, DC, later this month hosted by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nReed\u2019s view\n\nOpenAI\u2019s policy proposals make sense on a practical level. There\u2019s very little potential downside to modernizing the country\u2019s energy grid and production capacity, for instance. Even if we don\u2019t achieve \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d the economic benefits are black and white.\n\nBut OpenAI and other AI companies have a tough fight ahead of them. A non-trivial percentage of the population believes the development of AI is a bad idea, and it will be a challenge to convince the majority of the country that this is the new space race and American taxpayers need to get behind it."

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s fintech industry is flourishing, driven by soaring adoption of digital payments, alternative lending, and wealthtech.\n\nThe region\u2019s strong fundamentals, coupled with a growing digital economy, promise continued growth and innovation in the coming years, a new report by Royal Park Partners (RPP), a fintech-focused corporate finance advisory firm, says.\n\nFinancial inclusion opportunities for Southeast Asia\u2019s fintechs\n\nThe report, released in December, explores the driving factors and key trends in Southeast Asia\u2019s fintech market, highlighting Southeast Asia\u2019s robust fundamentals which have been propelled the fintech sector\u2019s rapid growth.\n\nFirst, the report emphasizes Southeast Asia\u2019s relatively underdeveloped traditional financial infrastructure and its large pool of financially underserved populations, which present significant opportunities for digital financial services.\n\nIt notes that while COVID-19 accelerated the digital shift, Asia-Pacific (APAC) still face significant financial inclusion challenges with 820 million unbanked and 1.8 billion underbanked adults.\n\nIn Southeast Asia alone, 85% of adults are underbanked, translating to approximately 300 million individuals lacking adequate access to financial services.\n\nMicro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which account for over 97% of all businesses in Southeast Asia, represent another major opportunity for digital financial services providers.\n\nThese businesses face a significant credit gap of US$300 billion with over half of MSMEs struggling to access formal credit, hindering their potential and economic progress.\n\nA growing young and middle-class\n\nThe second driver Southeast Asia\u2019s fintech boom is the region\u2019s growing tech-driven youth and middle class, two demographics that are fueling demand for digital-first financial services.\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s youth, aged 15 to 34, account for over a third of the population. Meanwhile, the region\u2019s burgeoning middle class has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% since 2015, and is projected to expand further, increasing by 5% annually through 2030.\n\nThe rise of economically empowered households in Southeast Asia is poised to fuel demand for tailored savings, insurance and wealth management solutions. Simultaneously, increasing purchasing power and discretionary spending have driven a need for seamless, real-time, and secure payment systems.\n\nPayments: a rapidly growing market in Southeast Asia\u2019s fintech scene\n\nThe report highlights payments as a booming market in Southeast Asia, spurred by a shift toward cashless transactions and a growing cross-border economy.\n\nQR code payments are driving this trend, with volumes surpassing US$13 billion in 2023 and over 85% of retailers in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia now accepting the payment method.\n\nMoreover, ongoing ASEAN integration initiatives to connect real-time payment systems are boosting cross-border digital payments and fueling regional commerce.\n\nThe rise of \u201csuper-apps\u201d is another prominent trend in Southeast Asia\u2019s payment landscape. Super-apps like Grab, Gojek, and Shopee have evolved from single-service platforms into comprehensive ecosystems offering diverse services, including food delivery, digital payments, financial services, and more, all within a single app. These platforms have become central to everyday life, amassing a combined user base of approximately 310 million across the region.\n\nDigital payment transaction value in Southeast Asia is projected to grow at a 19.8% CAGR between 2024 and 2029, reaching nearly US$1.7 trillion.\n\nSoutheast Asia remains heavily reliant on cash, a dependency which is attributed to cultural preferences but also infrastructure gaps and legacy issues with digital platforms.\n\nHowever, this reliance is projected to decline, driven by the growth of digital payments, as well as the several governments-led initiatives towards financial inclusion, the report says.\n\nAlternative lending: addressing credit gaps\n\nAlternative lending, including buy now, pay later (BNPL), is another booming fintech vertical in Southeast Asia. These platforms are bridging credit gaps, playing a crucial role in the supporting local economies. According to the report, alternative lending platforms have facilitated a 20% annual growth in SME financing and are set to expand further.\n\nCountries leading the charge, like the Philippines, have seen the fastest growth in fintech lending to SMEs, with disbursements increasing by 35% year-over-year (YoY) in 2023. The country\u2019s US$221 billion SME credit gap underscores the immense opportunity for alternative lending solutions.\n\nConsumer adoption of BNPL has also surged, with now 40% of Filipino users relying on BNPL for budgeting and immediate expenses.\n\nThe Philippines has emerged as a key alternative lending market in Southeast Asia, accounting for 59% of deal volume in 2024.\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s alternative lending market, including BNPL, is projected to grow at a 45% CAGR, rising from US$26 billion in 2021 to US$116 billion by 2025.\n\nWealth management undergoes profound transformation\n\nAnother growing fintech vertical in Southeast Asia is wealthtech. This sector is thriving, driven by Southeast Asia\u2019s tech-savvy population and rising middle class seeking better and more accessible wealth management solutions.\n\nIn particular, robo-advisory players are gaining traction among younger investors through data-driven super-apps. Robo-advisors leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms to provide tailored digital financial planning and investment services at low cost\n\nAccording to the report, 40% of individuals under 35 years old in Singapore are now using robo-advisory services. Popular platforms include StashAway, a Singapore-based platform which reached US$1 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 3.5 years, and Endowus, an award-winning wealth and fund platform, which surpassed US$7 billion in AUM within five years of operations.\n\nMicro-investing and digital brokerage platforms are also gaining ground in Southeast Asia. These platforms enable low-income users to participate in the financial markets, enhancing the accessibility of wealth management and fostering greater financial inclusion across the region.\n\nNotable players include Tiger Brokers, an online broker headquartered in Singapore, which has experienced a staggering 539% CAGR in account openings in the city state; and Finhay, the largest online investment platform in Vietnam with more than 2.7 million registered users.\n\nFeatured image credit: edited from freepik"

Discovery editorial team, will explain in simple terms how radiation can safely be used to solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing global challenges. These include:\n\nMicroplastics in the ocean (filmed in Monaco/Global)\n\nThe growing cancer burden (filmed in India)\n\nFood insecurity (filmed in Austria/Global)\n\nWater scarcity in the face of climate change (filmed in Austria/Costa Rica)\n\nIndustrial contamination (filmed in Czech Republic)\n\nEach of these films is around one minute long and will play as part of Discovery\u2019s \u2018Good To Know\u2019, a new educational videos series about the benefits of nuclear science and technology, both on television and online.\n\nFuture films to be included in the series will continue to investigate how nuclear science can help development, particularly in the light of climate change, such as by measuring how coastal regions sequester carbon, or how the oceans are becoming more acidic, or how pest insects can be controlled without chemicals. The films will also highlight more details on key IAEA programmes to battle plastic pollution, drought and hunger.\n\nThe films are made in conjunction with the IAEA's twelve nuclear sciences and applications laboratories, a unique feature in the United Nations. The laboratories develop and share nuclear techniques with countries around the world. Watch a three-minute film about the labs here.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \u201cPeople may know us as the nuclear watchdog, helping enhance safety, security and safeguards in places like Fukushima, Iran, Ukraine. But not enough people know of the amazing potential nuclear science has to make tangible differences in people\u2019s lives \u2013 helping farmers grow better crops, cancer patients get better treatment, governments understand and protect key natural areas. As the terrible effects of climate change become more obvious to people around the world, it is important for the public to also know there is hope. Science, as always, offers solutions to many of our main challenges.\u201d\n\nNajat Mokhtar, Head of IAEA Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, agreed: \u201cI am delighted to see ours labs' the vital research being shared on the respected Discovery Channel. Science is a vital force for good in the world, and nuclear science offers so many incredible innovations to help countries meet their development goals.\u201d\n\nJamie Cooke, Executive Vice President and Managing Director Central Europe, Middle East and Turkey said: \u201cWe are thrilled that our viewers will now get the opportunity to learn more about how nuclear science is being used in innovative ways to improve our lives and advance the environmental sustainability agenda. We consider it our duty to leverage the voice, storytelling strength and expertise we have, to cast light and tell the right stories that will positively impact our communities and viewers. It\u2019s part of our Social Good Strategy, and we want to use our media for good.\u201d\n\nAbout the International Atomic Energy Agency\n\nWidely known as the world\u2019s \u201cAtoms for Peace and Development\u201d organization within the United Nations family, the IAEA is the international centre for cooperation in the nuclear field.

If you are overwhelmed or stuck, go to a lower gear.\u201d That\u2019s the secret. It\u2019s always personal to the developer in question and requires a level of self-awareness, but that\u2019s the key. As Shubham says, \u201cAI-assisted coding is all about grokking when you need to gain more granular control and when you need to let go of control to move faster,\u201d recognizing that \u201chigher-level gears leave more room for errors and trust issues.\u201d\n\nMore senior engineers seem to understand this, entrusting AI tools cautiously (i.e., using them to get more done while in \u201clower gears\u201d like auto-complete). The problem is that junior engineers and non-engineers trust AI tools way more than they should. To some extent, we can blame years of marketing by low-code/no-code platforms that promise to turn everyone into a developer without any (or much) software knowledge. This has always been a false hope.\n\nHere\u2019s the solution: If you want to use AI coding assistants, don\u2019t use them as an excuse not to learn to code. The robots aren\u2019t going to do it for you. The engineers who will get the most out of AI assistants are those who know software best. They\u2019ll know when to give control to the coding assistant and how to constrain that assistance (perhaps to narrow the scope of the problem they allow it to work on). Less-experienced engineers run the risk of moving fast but then getting stuck or not recognizing the bugs that the AI has created."

Now it often provides higher quality, stronger security, better privacy, unparalleled extensibility, and access to innovation compared to proprietary rivals. It is no coincidence that 96% of all software today relies on open source, and large enterprises are increasingly inclined to invest in OSS-based solutions to capitalize on these advantages.\n\nFor venture investors like myself, this shift in market preferences represents a significant opportunity to fund the next generation of OSS-based category leaders in enterprise software. And a few notable trends will likely shape how this market area will likely evolve in 2025 and beyond.\n\nRise of open source AI\n\nThe rapid development of foundational large language models, related AI infrastructure, and their applications has ignited debates around the crucial AI challenges. Many of these issues \u2014 such as transparency, adaptability, and security \u2014 can be addressed through openness. After the initial wave led by closed-source pioneers like OpenAI and Anthropic, a new cohort of open source AI models, including Meta\u2019s Llama and Mistral AI, is now raising the tide and boosting the global AI ecosystem."

            "article_content": "This is a guest post for the Computer Weekly Developer Network written by Nikhil Cheerla in his role as co-founder & CTO of Nooks, a company that specialises in the creation of an AI sales assistant platform for sales teams.\n\nCheerla writes in full as follows\u2026\n\nData is at the heart of every successful application. It\u2019s especially vital when building AI assistants that make people\u2019s work more efficient. After all, a great assistant understands how to complement and support human actions\u2026. and that requires a rich set of data to learn from.\n\nBut not all data is created equal \u2013 and not all of it plays nicely together.\n\nFor AI to perform at its best, especially in applications like sales assistants, the data flowing into these systems needs to be clean, reliable and actionable. That\u2019s where the two toughest challenges come into play: standardisation and measurement.\n\nWhy standardisation is hard (and essential) When you\u2019re working with data from multiple sources \u2013 CRMs, sales engagement platforms, call transcripts and even web scrapes \u2013 it\u2019s messy. Every system has its quirks. A Salesforce database might store customer contact data one way, while HubSpot handles it completely differently. Let\u2019s not even get started on web data, which is often ad hoc and unstructured.\n\nThe stakes are high. Imagine a sales assistant providing a rep with an outdated contact history or failing to surface critical details from a previous call because a CRM field wasn\u2019t filled out correctly. That\u2019s not just frustrating \u2013 it can undermine the trust users have in AI. So, how do you tackle this? We use automated monitoring jobs to keep tabs on data quality. These jobs flag issues like missing fields or data that hasn\u2019t been updated recently, allowing the application to adapt its recommendations. We also use flexible storage solutions like JSON blobs to handle unstructured data. This way, we\u2019re not locked into rigid schemas and can adapt as customer needs evolve.\n\n\u2026 and then, measurement\n\nIf standardisation is about getting your data in order, measurement is about knowing whether the insights your AI generates are actually working. Let\u2019s say your AI flags a renewal opportunity for a sales rep. If that opportunity doesn\u2019t pan out, was the issue bad data? Or was the AI\u2019s interpretation of the data flawed? Figuring that out quickly is key to improving performance.\n\nWe solve this by building internal tools that make debugging signals easy through \u201cdata citations\u201d. These tools let us trace insights back to their source, whether it\u2019s a CRM entry, a call transcript, or a model prediction.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say a salesperson made a note in the CRM that their prospect would like a follow-up in six months. But then the AI spotted an update by the prospect on LinkedIn that suggested that the need is more urgent. Understanding how to prioritise the AI\u2019s recommendations and learn from the situation is critical.\n\nIf something doesn\u2019t look right, we can pinpoint whether the issue is with the data itself or with how the AI processed it. This not only helps our engineers but also gives sales leaders and other users confidence in the AI\u2019s decisions.\n\nTurning data into signals One way we streamline data for AI is by converting raw inputs into what we call signals. Signals are high-level insights \u2013 like \u201cthis prospect expressed interest in a competitor\u201d or \u201cthis lead has a renewal coming up soon\u201d and so on. Instead of sifting through raw data, our system presents these pre-computed signals, making it easier for users to take action. For example, when a sales rep is preparing to call a prospect, the assistant might highlight signals like recent job changes, prior engagement history, or competitive mentions \u2013 all compiled from multiple data sources. These signals are constantly updated in the background when any of the underlying data changes, ensuring they\u2019re always fresh and relevant.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Investing.com -- OpenAI's leading executives have announced plans to host events in Washington DC and two key swing states, aiming to strengthen support for investments in artificial intelligence (AI). This move comes as the company adapts to significant shifts in the US political landscape since the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nLater this month, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, along with other top personnel, will convene a meeting with policymakers in Washington. The purpose of this gathering is to discuss a new \"economic blueprint\" for AI, according to the company. The policy proposals, which were made public on Monday, urge the public and private sectors to collaborate in areas such as energy and infrastructure. This is part of a strategy to maintain the US's lead over China in AI, a pitch that is likely to resonate with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, also intends to host events in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama in the upcoming months. The company will announce new AI projects in each of these states, as stated by OpenAI's Vice President of Global Affairs, Chris Lehane, in an interview with Bloomberg News. These announcements are being framed as part of a fresh \"Innovating for America\" initiative that aims to stimulate economic activity around AI across the country.\n\nOver the last year, OpenAI and Altman have been urging the Biden administration to facilitate the construction of more data centers and the development of energy resources required for AI. Currently, OpenAI and other AI firms are adapting to the uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's AI strategy.\n\nThe President-elect, Donald Trump, is anticipated to revoke crucial elements of the Biden administration's AI agenda, including a 2023 executive order on artificial intelligence. Elon Musk, a supporter of Trump, has recently gained more influence in Washington. This has raised concerns that Musk might advocate for policies that benefit his own companies, including startup xAI, which is a competitor to OpenAI.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Behavior Monitoring: AI systems establish \"normal\" behavioral patterns for users based on their roles and activities. If something out of the ordinary occurs\u2014like an employee accessing large amounts of patient data outside working hours\u2014AI flags it as suspicious.\n\n2.Pattern recognition using Machine Learning: From past data, the machine learning algorithm identifies trends indicating a threat. As time goes by, such systems enhance their accuracy, hence highly efficient at detecting risks with minimal human involvement.\n\n3.Text analysis using NLP: AI-powered tools can analyze emails, messages, or documents to look out for warning signs in language use, including complaints, unauthorized transfer of data, or odd behavior that could suggest a risk.\n\n4. Predictive Risk Scoring: Based on historical data and real-time monitoring, AI can predict who is more likely to pose a risk. Those people or departments exhibiting unusual behaviors are given risk scores, so the organization can intervene early."

            "article_content": "The US president-elect has repeatedly promised to end the conflict in Ukraine, but the Kremlin has not endorsed any plans so far.\n\nAs United States President-elect Donald Trump prepares to re-enter the White House next week, there is uncertainty on both sides of the Ukraine war.\n\nThe world is waiting with bated breath to see whether he will maintain the US\u2019s commitment to Kyiv\u2019s defence, or strike some sort of deal with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump has repeatedly signalled his willingness to negotiate with Russia, telling a news conference on January 7 that he sympathised with Moscow\u2019s stated concerns about NATO expansion on its western borders.\n\nCertainly, there are those in Russia hopeful Trump can hasten an end to the conflict.\n\nLate last year, lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov described him as someone \u201cwith whom you can talk\u201d.\n\nHowever, overall the atmosphere in the Kremlin is more cautious, given Trump\u2019s track record during his previous presidency, during which extra sanctions were imposed on Russia and arms were sent to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not the same euphoria as there was the last time when Trump won [the election] and champagne glasses were raised,\u201d Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik consultancy firm, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, the Kremlin\u2019s attitude is much more sober and prepared for any scenario, both that there will be a new escalation and that Trump will propose some peace deal, although it is not highly expected,\u201d she said, on expectations that the Republican leader will present a solid proposal all parties agree on.\n\n\u201cThe intrigue of the whole situation is that Trump, his team, the Kremlin, Kyiv, or Europe \u2013 no one knows what will happen.\u201d\n\n\u2018Completely different\u2019 understandings of the conflict\n\nIn December, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed reported peace plans proposed by Trump\u2019s team, which included Ukraine giving up parts of its territory currently occupied by Russia, putting Ukraine\u2019s potential NATO bid on hold for 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers.\n\nLavrov said Russia was \u201ccertainly not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukraine\u2019s membership in NATO for 20 years and to deploy a peacekeeping contingent of \u2018UK and European forces\u2019 in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nIlya Budraitskis, a Russian historian, social scientist and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, told Al Jazeera: \u201cThe understanding of the essence of this conflict and the basis for negotiations is completely different between Moscow and Washington under Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump considers how to solve the issue related to the border of the Russian Federation with Ukraine. From the Kremlin\u2019s point of view, the issue of this war is completely different, connected with reviewing the current architecture of European security and the question of spheres of influence in the post-Soviet space.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Stanovaya added that Trump\u2019s supporters in the West have \u201ca somewhat exaggerated attitude to what Trump can do\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, the situation depends on what Ukraine itself is ready for,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cIt will decide the future of the conflict, how quickly the Russian troops will advance, how serious the resistance of the Ukrainians will be, how the situation with the elections will develop and whether there will be elections. These questions probably matter more than what Trump proposes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s European allies fear what may happen should Russia win, especially with Trump questioning the US\u2019s commitment to NATO.\n\n\u201cTrump has the idea, which he\u2019s voiced many times, that the European allies are manipulating America and are trying to solve their own security issues,\u201d said Budraitskis. But he noted the US has its own, long-term interests in Europe, to which it is unlikely to acquiesce to the Kremlin.\n\nRussia\u2019s wartime economy \u2018growing but not developing\u2019\n\nA recent survey from the independent polling agency Levada appeared to show that a majority of Russians are satisfied with how the war in Ukraine, or \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to use the official lexicon, is going, with more than three-quarters of interviewees supporting continued armed actions in Ukraine.\n\nA growing minority \u2013 39 percent as of November \u2013 even believe using nuclear weapons would be acceptable under certain conditions.\n\nMore than half of Russians support entering talks to end the conflict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kind of anxiety seen in the early days of the war seems to have settled down.\n\nA Levada poll at the end of 2024 showed more than 70 percent believe 2025 will be better than the last year \u2013 the most optimistic result in 12 years.\n\nFor St Petersburg pensioner Elena, however, there are more immediate concerns.\n\n\u201cIn the last few months, the main groceries grew in price one-and-a-half to two times,\u201d she complained.\n\n\u201cDairy products: milk, cottage cheese \u2013 I need very good cottage cheese; eggs, meat, butter. And, of course, these prices won\u2019t go anywhere, or go back down again, because the conditions [in our country] aren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s economy has performed better than many Western-based observers predicted. But experts told Al Jazeera that this was largely driven by spending in the military sector at the expense of other industries.\n\n\u201cThe growth of the Russian economy in 2024 compared to 2023 was about 4 percent, which in itself is not bad, but up to two-thirds of this growth was provided by the contribution of the military industry, without improving the lives of most Russians not involved in the military sector,\u201d said economist Olga Savochkina.\n\n\u201cIn general, Russian business has managed to adapt and continues to operate under sanctions, although it incurs additional costs. Russia sells oil to China, India; sells other sanctioned goods under the guise of, for example, Kazakh goods to Europe and other countries.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vladislav Inozemtsev, of the Center for Analysis and Strategies in Europe (CASE), \u201cThe only thing that these sanctions and this whole military situation provided for is that it drove the Russian economy into such a distant tunnel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt could be said that in the time of [ex-President] Dmitry Medvedev, everyone was talking about modernisation and so on. Now that\u2019s all completely over \u2026 during these years of war and sanctions regime, it seems that the economy is growing, but it\u2019s not developing.\u201d\n\nInflation in Russia has reached 9 percent this past year, widening the inequality gap.\n\n\u201cTeachers, state employees, minor officials, and of course pensioners, they are losing today because inflation exceeds their income,\u201d Inozemtsev continued.\n\n\u201cMoreover, their consumption is mainly focused on such basic goods, which are the most expensive. Therefore, I think that at least a quarter of the population, or maybe a third, as a result of last year, saw their incomes decrease. But people working in the service industry, small entrepreneurs, the self-employed, they are obviously the winners because their nominal salaries have grown by an average of 17 percent.\u201d\n\nOther problems include the historically low unemployment rate of just 2.3 percent, leaving a shortage in the workforce, and Russia\u2019s dependence on oil \u2013 Trump has pledged to ramp up the US oil production, which could eat away Russian profits.\n\n\u201cThe Russian economy is still resource-dependent and the budget receives significant revenues from oil sales since Russia was able to circumvent the imposed sanctions with the help of a \u2018shadow fleet\u2019,\u201d Savochkina said.\n\n\u201cThe predicted increase in oil production in the United States may lead to a decrease in world oil prices to $45-55 per barrel. Let me remind you that the price of oil exports included in the budget for 2025 is $69.7 per barrel. Such a significant decrease in budget revenues will negatively affect the country\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, the outgoing Biden administration imposed yet another round of sanctions, specifically targeting Russia\u2019s oil industry as well as the so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d responsible for shipping the produce worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe only option I see is that part of the sanctions can only be removed as part of a truce,\u201d Inozemtsev said.\n\n\u201cBut you see, I think that the removal of personal sanctions and the possibility of again accepting Russian capital in Europe and the United States could be a serious blow to the economy. This could lead to the outflow of capital and really reduce growth and undermine overall investment. Then it would make sense to sell Russian companies and take the capital to the West. But everyone in the West is convinced that the Russian elites are Putin\u2019s dogs and, accordingly, they need to [be] beaten as cruelly as possible. Therefore, I definitely do not expect this.\u201d\n\nBut Oleg Kouzmin, analyst at Moscow-based Renaissance Capital, believes any thaw in US-Russia relations could go a long way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine all the sanctions getting lifted overnight, but at least a clear understanding that no further sanctions are coming and geopolitical tensions are not getting worse would already reduce the current degree of uncertainty, which would be favourable for [the] economy and markets,\u201d he explained."

The commission, chaired by former California congresswoman Jane Harman, came to a sobering conclusion that did not get the attention it deserved: \u201cThe threats the United States faces are the most serious and most challenging the nation has encountered since 1945 and include the potential for near-term major war. \u2026 The nation was last prepared for such a fight during the Cold War, which ended 35 years ago. It is not prepared today.\u201d\n\nThe commission went on to warn that \u201cChina is outpacing the United States and has largely negated the U.S. military advantage in the Western Pacific\u201d and that \u201cthe U.S. military lacks both the capabilities and the capacity required to be confident it can deter and prevail in combat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that the U.S. military has gone \u201cwoke,\u201d as MAGA partisans such as Hegseth allege. The problem is that America became complacent after the Cold War when it downsized its armed forces and its defense-industrial base. Since then, the United States has prepared a military suitable for fighting insurgents in Afghanistan or Iraq \u2014 but utterly inadequate for an extended fight against a major power.\n\nFollow Max Boot Follow\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies recently staged a China war game and found, as scholar Seth G. Jones wrote in the Wall Street Journal: \u201cThe U.S. military spent its entire inventory of Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles by the end of the first week and ran out of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range missiles after a month. Taiwan used up its entire inventory of Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles after a week. It would be very difficult to sustain a fight without these weapons.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine war has revealed some of America\u2019s defense-industrial shortfalls and led to belated corrective action. But the process has been agonizingly slow and still has not gone nearly far enough. As retired Army Lt. Gen. David Barno and security scholar Nora Benshael noted in War on the Rocks, before 2022, the United States was producing only 14,000 155-millimeter artillery rounds a year. Once Russia\u2019s all-out invasion began, Ukraine was firing as many as 8,000 rounds a day. The U.S. Army invested billions of dollars to ramp up artillery production to between 70,000 and 80,000 rounds a month. \u201cBut that has taken almost three years to achieve \u2014 and the stark reality is that artillery expenditures by the U.S. military and its allies in any major war could quickly dwarf that amount,\u201d Barno and Benshael wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother example of how inadequate America\u2019s armory remains: A U.S. defense official told me last month that the Defense Department has more than 19,000 unmanned aircraft systems in its inventory. That might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s actually a paltry amount. In 2023, Ukraine was reported to be losing 10,000 drones a month, and Ukraine claims to have manufactured 1.5 million first-person-view drones (the simplest and cheapest type) in 2024.\n\nThe United States would be hard put to ramp up its own drone production, given that one Chinese company, DJI, claims 70 percent of the global market. Experts estimate that U.S. firms are producing only a few thousand drones a month \u2014 and they are generally more expensive and less capable than their Chinese counterparts.\n\nThe situation is just as dire when it comes to shipbuilding. As the defense strategy commission noted, \u201cOne Chinese shipyard has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined.\u201d (China has 20 large shipyards.) U.S. shipyards cannot even utilize all of their capacity because of a critical shortage of skilled workers. According to the Associated Press: \u201cMarinette Marine is under contract to build six guided-missile frigates \u2014 the Navy\u2019s newest surface warships \u2014 with options to build four more. But it only has enough workers to produce one frigate a year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis lack of shipyard capacity also makes it nearly impossible to repair and retrofit ships on time. As a result, fewer than half of the Navy\u2019s 164 surface ships are ready to deploy.\n\nThese deficiencies are all the more maddening given how much money taxpayers already devote to defense: $850 billion this year. But claims that the United States spends more on defense than the next nine countries combined are misleading. Dictatorships often spend more than they reveal, and they don\u2019t have all of the personnel and health-care costs that eat up much of the U.S. military budget. The defense strategy commission estimated that China actually spends as much as $711 billion annually on defense, or more than three times the official figure of $222 billion. While high in absolute terms, U.S. defense spending is just 3 percent of gross domestic product, far below Cold War levels.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump recently demanded that NATO countries raise their defense spending to 5 percent of GDP. If he applies the same standard to the United States \u2014 as advocated by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) \u2014 it would require boosting defense spending by about $600 billion a year, to more than $1.4 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat might seem like a crazy amount of money, but it\u2019s still a lot cheaper than failing to win \u2014 or deter \u2014 a major conflict. Any such spending increase, however, should be combined with reforms of the Pentagon\u2019s dysfunctional bureaucracy to maximize bang for the buck. As the defense strategy commission noted, the defense budget \u201ccan be spent more effectively and efficiently.\u201d Although the commission called for \u201cfinding savings\u201d and \u201creforming processes,\u201d it added that \u201cthese improvements would not obviate the need to spend \u2026 more.\u201d"

The sectoral benchmark index Nifty Metal dropped around 4% or 312 points to close at 7,951.\n\nThe US Labor Department released its employment report on Friday, which showed an unexpected rise in US jobs in December. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%. This reinforced the view that the US Fed would keep interest rates unchanged for longer. Traders are now reportedly expecting the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady until at least June, compared to earlier bets on cuts as soon as May.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhen US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, more liquidity is generated in the market, which in turn boosts infrastructure for companies. Delayed rate cuts, therefore, directly affect metal stocks.\n\nShares of Hindustan Copper were the worst hit, falling as much as 7% to close at Rs 217.2 apiece on January 13. Tata Steel shares, a major constituent in Nifty Metal, dropped 3.34% to close at Rs 123.15 apiece. The other metal stocks which recorded strong losses included APL Apollo (6.39%), Steel Authority of India (5.55%), and others.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve had cut its key interest rates for the third straight meeting in December. The rates were lowered by 25 basis points to 4.25%-4.50% range. The central bank in September had made its first rate cut in more than four years, since the early days of the pandemic.\n\nBrokerage firm Nomura in its latest note released on January 10 stated that it expects the shares of Jindal Steel & Power (JSP) to perform better than those of JSW Steel. It said JSP is \"relatively better placed than peers\", as it expects EBITDA to improve sequentially. The brokerage kept a 'Buy' rating for JSP with a target price of Rs 1,180. This implies an upside potential of 35% from the stock's closing price of Rs 873.4. For JSW Steel, the firm maintained a 'Buy' rating with a target price of 1,220. This implies an upside potential of 38% from the stock's closing price of Rs 883.15. Notably, JSP and JSW Steel shares have fallen 4.8% and 2% respectively on January 13.\n\nThe fall in metal stocks comes amid overall low market sentiment. The Sensex crashed over 1,000 points to close at 76,330 on January 13. Nifty dropped nearly 1.5% to end the day at 23,086.

According to Counterpoint Research, the smartphone market actually grew by 4% in 2024 compared to the previous year, which is a positive sign for both buyers and phone makers. One of the key highlights from Counterpoint\u2019s latest report is the fantastic growth journey one particular smartphone maker has been having.\n\nPer the research firm\u2019s preliminary calculations, Xiaomi has claimed the title of the fastest-growing smartphone manufacturer globally in 2024. The company\u2019s year-on-year (YoY) global market share increased by one percentage point, setting it apart from rivals Apple and Samsung, both of which saw their 2024 smartphone market shares dip by the same margin.\n\nCounterpoint Research\n\nWhat makes Xiaomi\u2019s growth particularly noteworthy is its lack of presence in the United States, one of the world\u2019s largest smartphone markets. Instead, the Chinese brand has focused on expanding aggressively in regions like Europe, Asia, and Africa. Counterpoint says a strategic portfolio realignment, a push into more premium devices, and innovative marketing campaigns have also helped Xiaomi achieve its latest growth numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung and Apple, which lead the smartphone market globally, saw flat performances in 2024. Samsung retained its top position with a 19% market share, thanks to strong performance by the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy A lines. Apple came in second with an 18% market share. The iPhone 16 series received a lukewarm reception as per Counterpoint. The limited availability of Apple Intelligence also dampened buyers\u2019 enthusiasm in Apple\u2019s core markets like the US.\n\nLooking beyond 2024, Counterpoint Research sees Generative AI becoming the norm for mid-range phones. The firm projects that by 2028, nine out of 10 smartphones priced above $250 will be GenAI-capable.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

This Mini PC boasts an incredibly compact form factor and potentially offers some very interesting upgrades post-launch.\n\nOf course, there are limitations to this modular mini PC design. Like modular Framework laptops or Framework-based devices, Emdoor Clink-X xCraft will only come with custom motherboards with soldered OEM CPUs. But since the motherboard is so easily removable compared to the majority of mini PC designs, long-term support could still offset the downsides of this, particularly if truly meaningful modular attachments like an extended heatsink, discrete graphics, etc, actually come to fruition.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft plate styles\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 1\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 2\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 3\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft\n\nEmdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 4\n\nAs far as the current fixed specifications go, the only two CPU options currently given with the motherboard are Ryzen \"Hawk Point\" CPUs, but specifically the Ryzen 7 250 and 260\u2014 which are just a rebadged Ryzen 7 8840U and Ryzen 7 8845HS, respectively. Those two CPUs are also rebadged Ryzen 7 7840U and Ryzen 7 7845HS, respectively, which makes the additional renaming cycle quite egregious. With either CPU, you'll be getting eight Zen 4 cores and AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics, with the differences boiling down to the CPU base clock.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 7 250 and its eight Zen 4 cores have a base clock of 3.3 GHz and boost up to 5.1 GHz, and are paired with 12 RDNA 3 iGPU Compute Units for graphical horsepower. The Ryzen 7 260 and its eight Zen 4 cores have a base clock of 3.8 GHz, boost up to 5.1 GHz, and also have 12 RDNA 3 CUs. These are still good specs since part of the reason 7840U and its ilk were so endlessly rebadgeable was because their iGPU performance took that long to be exceeded by the competition, but it's still worth noting.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI/O is fixed regardless of your CPU and also replaces your PCIe expansion besides the dual NVMe slots. The fastest connectors are dual USB4 20 Gbps Type-C ports, with dual USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports (one Type-A, one Type-C) following directly behind. There is also a USB Type-C port specifically for power input, one HDM1 2.1 port, one DisplayPort 2.1 port, and a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port.\n\nStorage and RAM support seem a little more interesting \u2014 with dual NVMe Gen4 slots (M.2-2280, up to 4TB) and support for up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM at 5600 MT/s, this mini PC definitely isn't slacking in those options. It's just a bit of a shame the CPU is soldered, but going unsoldered likely would have pushed them in the direction of AM4 or AM5 and presented a greater technical challenge for this form factor.\n\nAs-is, I think it looks decently promising, but the fastest expansion effectively being limited to dual USB4 20 Gbps does concern me, particularly at a $500 starting price point. OCuLink or even just a PCIe slot would be far preferable, particularly for whatever future discrete GPU attachments may be planned."

            "article_content": "Zora Neale Hurston was a philosemite. She believed that the Jews had been victims of stereotyping that started with Moses and that was promoted by the Bible and fed to children in Sunday school. Among other things, it produced the fiction of the Eternal Jew, a type unchanged since the time of the Pharaohs.\n\nIn fact, Hurston thought, the Jews had evolved, just like everyone else. And they had come to believe, long before other people did, in liberty, individualism, and the rights that define liberal democracies. The Jews were Americans thousands of years before there was an America.\n\nThe story of the Jews was extremely important to Hurston, as important as her mission, far better known, to preserve and to celebrate the style, speech, and folklore of the African diaspora\u2014the culture of what she called \u201cthe Negro farthest down.\u201d That mission yielded two works of cultural anthropology, \u201cMules and Men\u201d (1935) and \u201cTell My Horse\u201d (1938), and the novel on which her reputation is built, \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d (1937).\n\nWhat We\u2019re Reading Discover notable new fiction and nonfiction.\n\nBut Hurston devoted a big portion of her literary career\u2014which stretched from 1921, when she published her first short story in a Howard University literary magazine, to 1960, when she died\u2014to trying to write a history of the Jews. This meant, essentially, rewriting the Bible. It was a colossal ambition, and it is striking, although maybe not surprising, how little attention the effort has received in the critical literature on Hurston, of which there are now shelves full. Between 1975, when she was \u201crediscovered\u201d by Alice Walker, and 2010, more than four hundred doctoral dissertations were written on Hurston. \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d has sold more than a million copies, and Oprah Winfrey produced a film adaptation. In Hurston\u2019s lifetime, the most any of her books earned in royalties was $943.75.\n\nHurston was a grapho-compulsive. In addition to four published novels and three works of nonfiction, which include an autobiography, \u201cDust Tracks on a Road\u201d (1942), she wrote short stories, poems, plays, essays, reviews, and articles. She also staged concerts and dance performances. By the time she died, she had published more books than any Black woman in history.\n\nAnd she was a tireless correspondent, possibly because for much of her life, despite three somewhat mysterious marriages, she lived alone. An excellent edition of the correspondence, edited by Carla Kaplan, contains more than five hundred letters, and, since Hurston was not shy about writing to people she had never met (she once asked Winston Churchill to contribute an introduction to one of her books; he politely declined, citing poor health), it is believed that there may be hundreds more letters still out there, no one knows where.\n\nLike most freelance writers, she had a fairly high kill rate. Some pieces were rejected or didn\u2019t work out or for some other reason never appeared in print; her autobiography was expurgated by her publisher; and she wrote some or all of at least five novels that were turned down. Only one of these, \u201cThe Life of Herod the Great,\u201d survived in typescript\u2014the others appear to be missing completely. \u201cHerod\u201d has now been published by Amistad in a volume edited by Deborah Plant, an independent scholar. Plant is also the author of a critical biography of Hurston, published in 2007, and the editor of another Hurston manuscript, \u201cBarracoon: The Story of the Last \u2018Black Cargo,\u2019 \u201d which was published in 2018.\n\nHurston spent something like fifteen years researching and writing \u201cHerod.\u201d She called it her \u201cgreat obsession.\u201d This was far more time than she spent on any other book project. She wrote \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God,\u201d for example, in seven weeks, while she was doing field work in Haiti. The \u201cHerod\u201d typescript was partially burned when, after Hurston\u2019s death, workers who were cleaning out her house set fire to a trunk full of papers. An acquaintance driving past saw the flames, grabbed a hose (Hurston was a famous gardener), and put out the fire.\n\nWhat we have of \u201cHerod\u201d is therefore far from a complete work. The final chapters in the Amistad edition are fragmentary, and the book ends abruptly, ten years before Herod\u2019s death. Whether this is because those pages were damaged by fire and water or simply because Hurston hadn\u2019t finished yet is unclear. She did write three prefaces and four introductions; Plant prints what she calls \u201csynthesized versions\u201d of these. In general, the editorial apparatus is fairly minimal.\n\nHurston\u2019s papers are housed at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and, before this new edition, the \u201cHerod\u201d manuscript was read there by Hurston scholars. Their reports did not make a trip to Gainesville seem urgent. Hurston\u2019s first biographer, Robert Hemenway, wrote, \u201cZora\u2019s manuscript suffers from poor characterization, pedantic scholarship, and inconsistent style; the whole performance touches the heart by revealing a talent in ruins.\u201d He said it would have been \u201ca minor work.\u201d\n\nHemenway was a sympathetic biographer. An even more sympathetic biographer, Valerie Boyd, refrained from critical commentary on \u201cHerod\u201d altogether in her book, \u201cWrapped in Rainbows.\u201d Virginia Lynn Moylan, in \u201cZora Neale Hurston\u2019s Final Decade,\u201d described the writing of \u201cHerod,\u201d which was Hurston\u2019s chief preoccupation in those years, and even wrote something about Hurston\u2019s views on the Jews. But she, too, declined to say much about the novel itself.\n\n\u201cHerod\u201d was turned down by Hurston\u2019s publisher, Scribner\u2019s, in 1955. Her editor there, Burroughs Mitchell, known mainly for being the man who rejected three novels by Zora Neale Hurston, explained that the book \u201cdoes not seem to us to accomplish its intention. I mean to say that it does not vividly recreate the man and his time. . . . There is a wealth of fine material here but somehow it has failed to flow in a clear narrative stream. We think the book would prove difficult reading for the layman.\u201d\n\nHurston, characteristically, took this in stride. She was accustomed to adversity. Her field work was supported for a few years in the late nineteen-twenties and early thirties by a white patron and by grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, but she lived mainly on her writing. It was her good fortune to be the sort of person whom other people enjoy helping, but she disliked receiving unreciprocated gifts and did not depend on them. She took low-level jobs when she ran out of funds\u2014she once worked as a maid\u2014and sometimes she had to pawn her typewriter to buy food. For many years, she lived on a houseboat. None of her books sold more than five thousand copies in her lifetime.\n\nWhen Mitchell\u2019s rejection letter came, Hurston was living in Eau Gallie, a tiny town in Florida, in a one-room cabin that she rented for five dollars a week. It was a long way from the Harlem of the nineteen-twenties, where she had cut a flamboyant figure among what she liked to call (although the term was probably not her coinage) the Niggerati. But she\u2019d been born in Alabama and had grown up in Eatonville, Florida, an all-Black town\u2014making her one of very few members of the Harlem Renaissance who was from the American South\u2014and she was a Floridian at heart. She was content in Eau Gallie. \u201cNaturally, I am sorry that you found Herod the Great disappointing,\u201d she replied to Mitchell, \u201cbut do not feel concerned about the refusal upon me. I am my old self and can take it easily.\u201d\n\nShe continued working on the book. In 1958, it was turned down by another house, David McKay, the publisher of Fodor\u2019s travel guides and Ace Comics. In 1959, she wrote to Harper & Brothers to ask \u201cif you would have any interest in the book I am laboring upon at present\u2014a life of Herod the Great. One reason I approach you is because you will realize that any publisher who offers a life of Herod as it really was, and naturally different from the groundless legends which have been built up around his name has to have courage.\u201d Harper & Brothers was Richard Wright\u2019s publisher\u2014as the reference to \u201ccourage\u201d was intended to remind the recipients. But they passed on \u201cHerod.\u201d This was Hurston\u2019s last extant letter.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to publish an unfinished book, but it feels a little unfair to judge it. Maybe what we have is not the final version. But, based on what we do have, Hurston\u2019s biographers were not wrong: her voice is missing. There is no poetry in \u201cHerod.\u201d Instead, we are walked stiffly through the career of the man the Romans treated as the king of the client state of Judea, which he governed from 40 B.C.E. until his death, thirty-six years later\u2014an impressive run at a time when one held on to power by pre\u00ebmptively killing one\u2019s rivals, something the historical Herod was quite good at.\n\nAnd that is, of course, how most people know him today. In the Gospel of Matthew, it is said that, after Herod, the King of the Jews, learned of the birth of a new King of the Jews, he ordered the slaughter of all male children under two years of age in Bethlehem\u2014the Massacre of the Innocents, a scene that became iconic in Western art. (The Herod in the Bible who beheads John the Baptist to please his stepdaughter Salome and who hands Jesus over to Pontius Pilate was Herod Antipas, Herod the Great\u2019s son. He\u2019s the bad Herod.)\n\n\u201cI love cardio day!\u201d Cartoon by Lonnie Millsap Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nHurston told a friend that her interest in Herod the Great began when she learned that scholars had doubts about the story in Matthew. It is inconsistent with the account of Jesus\u2019 birth in the other Gospels, and is probably what is known as a \u201cfulfillment citation,\u201d something inserted to validate a prophecy in the Hebrew Bible\u2014in this case, from Jeremiah. It is also prefigured (another Biblical device) by Pharaoh\u2019s order, in Exodus, to kill all male babies born to Hebrew mothers.\n\nSo Hurston started reading ancient sources, notably the Jewish historian Josephus, who is our main source of information about Herod. (Herod was a member of the Edomites, a Semitic people forcibly converted to Judaism in the second century B.C.E.) She suddenly saw \u201cthis man I had always thought of as nothing but a mean little butcher, as a highly cultivated, Hellenized non-Jew, the handsomest man of his time, the greatest soldier of Southwest Asia, and ablest administrator, generous both of spirit and materially, \u2018Herod the Over-Bold,\u2019 \u2018Herod of the sun-like splendor.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis is the Herod of \u201cHerod,\u201d a superhero of the Levant. He excels at everything, from man-to-man combat to interior design, an impossible combination of rectitude and swagger. When Cleopatra tries to seduce him, he refuses her. He\u2019s a married man! When he has his wife executed, as the real Herod did, his reasoning is unassailable. When Cleopatra\u2019s lover, that dissolute sensualist Mark Antony, sizes him up for a possible same-sex hookup, he can see right away that Herod is not that type. As Hurston describes the moment, \u201cAntony was silently appraising Herod\u2019s masculine perfection, his large, luminous eyes and superb lashes, his muscular limbs well developed by military use. But he did not sense that Herod\u2019s mind would be capable of persuasion.\u201d\n\nThe whole book is written like this, in a kind of illustrated-classics prose."

But not enough people know of the amazing potential nuclear science has to make tangible differences in people\u2019s lives \u2013 helping farmers grow better crops, cancer patients get better treatment, governments understand and protect key natural areas. As the terrible effects of climate change become more obvious to people around the world, it is important for the public to also know there is hope. Science, as always, offers solutions to many of our main challenges.\u201d\n\nNajat Mokhtar, Head of IAEA Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, agreed: \u201cI am delighted to see ours labs' the vital research being shared on the respected Discovery Channel. Science is a vital force for good in the world, and nuclear science offers so many incredible innovations to help countries meet their development goals.\u201d\n\nJamie Cooke, Executive Vice President and Managing Director Central Europe, Middle East and Turkey said: \u201cWe are thrilled that our viewers will now get the opportunity to learn more about how nuclear science is being used in innovative ways to improve our lives and advance the environmental sustainability agenda. We consider it our duty to leverage the voice, storytelling strength and expertise we have, to cast light and tell the right stories that will positively impact our communities and viewers. It\u2019s part of our Social Good Strategy, and we want to use our media for good.\u201d\n\nAbout the International Atomic Energy Agency\n\nWidely known as the world\u2019s \u201cAtoms for Peace and Development\u201d organization within the United Nations family, the IAEA is the international centre for cooperation in the nuclear field.

            "article_content": "On Saturday, the new exhibition area \"Quantum computers \u2013 Supercomputers of the next generation\" opened at the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum (HNF). The exhibition was curated by physicist and educator Dr. David Woitkowski. It is the first exhibition on the subject of quantum computers in a German museum. The Paderborn HNF is the largest computer museum in the world and presents the history of 5000 years of information technology from cuneiform writing to artificial intelligence in its permanent exhibition.\n\nAnzeige\n\n\"Are we at the dawn of a new information age? Are quantum computers replacing our tried-and-tested digital calculating machines as the new supercomputers?\" asks Dr. Jochen Viehoff, Managing Director of the HNF, when introducing the new department. \"With this new department, we want to venture a look into the future of computers and present a technology that seems to contradict our previous experience.\"\n\nThe United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. Various events will take place throughout Germany throughout the year, and the Paderborn activities are part of the German program.\n\nThe largest quantum bit in the world\n\nAt the center of the exhibition is the \"world's largest quantum bit\": two glowing spheres that are intended to introduce visitors to the concepts of superposition and entanglement.\n\nQuantum bits, or qubits for short, are the basic building blocks of quantum computers. They consist of tiny building blocks that obey the rules of quantum physics. The exhibition focuses in particular on the question of what these qubits are made of. Information panels and demonstrators present four different approaches: superconducting qubits, photons, ions and nuclear spins.\n\nThe \"chandelier\" (provided by Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich) is often used to illustrate a quantum computer. However, this is only used to cool the actual quantum processor, which is installed inside. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nMany of the exhibits come from real research. For example, the exhibition features a \"chandelier cryostat\" from the J\u00fclich Research Center, in which superconducting qubits are installed. An adjacent screen with touch function clearly visualizes what the various components are used for and where the actual quantum processor is located.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe HNF also presents the experimental setup of a photonic quantum algorithm according to David Deutsch. The aim of this is to use entangled photons, i.e. particles of light, to distinguish a correct coin from a counterfeit coin in just one step.\n\nCurator David Woitkowski demonstrates the Deutsch algorithm with the aid of various mirrors, beam splitters and other optical components. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nOne of the ion traps on display once belonged to Nobel Prize winner Wolfgang Paul. A shoebox-sized quantum computer from the Chinese company SpinQ with two qubits will demonstrate small programs. Another exhibit illustrates Lov Grover's quantum search algorithm using a detailed hidden object picture. A news ticker will provide information on the latest developments, such as the breakthrough in effective error correction by a Google research team, which they recently demonstrated using their latest chip \"Willow\".\n\nAfter the official opening on Saturday evening, numerous visitors crowded into the exhibition, tried out the exhibits and discussed them with experts on site. Some were excitedly debating which architecture would prevail. For others, the possible areas of application for quantum computers were too short. The exhibition thus successfully introduces laypeople to quantum physics and encourages them to think about it.\n\nAnniversary year Nixdorf100\n\nThe opening of the quantum computer area marks the beginning of the Nixdorf100 anniversary year, with which the HNF is celebrating the 100th birthday of Heinz Nixdorf on April 9, 2025. \"With the development of the quantum computer, we are on the brink of a new dawn, just as Heinz Nixdorf dared to do in the 1950s to enter the age of electronics and computers,\" says Viehoff. Over the next twelve months, the HNF will be presenting new exhibition areas, events and various activities.\n\nNobel Prize winner Wolfgang Paul already worked with this ion trap in 1985. It can store dye particles for months and manipulate them electrically. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nHeinz Nixdorf was a German entrepreneur, engineer and pioneer of the computer industry. He founded Nixdorf Computer AG in 1952, which became one of the largest computer companies in Europe under his leadership. Nixdorf was known for his vision of providing powerful and affordable computers for medium-sized companies, which contributed significantly to the digitalization of Germany. He was born in Paderborn in 1925 and died in Hanover in 1986. One of his sons, Martin Nixdorf, became Chairman of the Board of the Heinz Nixdorf Foundation and the Westphalia Foundation.\n\n(spa)"
