Department of National Defence / CTV News\n\nOfficials in the US and Canada began tracking the UFO again when it crossed into Canadian airspace, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the order to shoot it down just after 4:50 p.m.\n\nAn American pilot struck the object with an AIM 9x missile.\n\nThe airborne object previously described as a \u201csmall, metallic balloon with a tethered payload\u201d was spotted amid three other cases in which North America dealt with unidentified objects in the sky.\n\nBetween Feb. 10 and Feb 12, three objects were spotted floating over North America before they were downed over Alaska, the Yukon and Lake Huron, respectively.\n\nThey were all smaller than the suspected Chinese spy balloon that traveled from Alaska across the United States before it was shot down over South Carolina on Feb. 4, 2023.\n\n4 The Canadian government was prepared to release the photo of the Yukon UFO, having declassified it and approved it for the public to see before holding off.

        "article_content": "This is the first image of UFO shot down by American fighter jets during a chase near Alaska last year.\n\nThe photo shows a seemingly glowing horse shoe-shaped object with ill-defined edges over the Yukon territory in northwest Canada in February 2023.\n\nIt was shot down by a US Air Force F-22 stealth fighter on a joint mission with the Canadian Armed Forces following the now infamous Chinese spy balloon drama of February 2023.\n\nRedacted documents show the image was designated as 'unclassified' within just days of the now 19-month-old incident, yet Canada's defense department did not release it to the public.\n\nCanada has released the first-ever image of the UFO shot down during a chase above Alaska and the Yukon that followed the Chinese spy balloon drama of February 2023 (above)\n\nThe odd pic shows a seemingly circular white object that had been shot down by a US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter in a joint mission with the Canadian Armed Forces. Above, another USAF F-22 Raptor during an air show over Toronto, Canada on August 31, 2024\n\nA possible reason, as one public affairs official with Canada's Department of National Defence (DND) warned colleagues, was internal fears that releasing this unclassified UFO image 'may create more questions/confusion.'\n\nThis official, a director of communications named Taylor Paxton, advised military colleagues that this confusion would be inevitable 'given the current public environment and statements related to the object being benign.'\n\nPaxton suggested that any move by the Royal Canadian Air Force to publish the photo on social media would likely only raise more inquiries from the general public and the press 'regardless of the text that will accompany the post.'\n\nThe craft was one of three shot down over Alaska, Yukon and Lake Huron between Feb 10 and 12 2023.\n\nThe three objects were reportedly much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was grounded off the coast of South Carolina days earlier.\n\nThe new emails, obtained along with the eerie new UFO photo by CTVNews.ca reporter Daniel Otis via an open records law request, also included efforts by members of Canada's armed forces to better understand the craft that had been shot down.\n\nOne email from Canadian Brigadier-General Eric Laforest described the UFO as a 'cylindrical object.'\n\n'Top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20-foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended,' Brig. Gen. Laforest wrote. 'Best description that we have.'\n\nThe suspected spy balloon was one of four airborne objects gunned out of the sky by the US over eight days of February 2023. One unusual feature of the newly released UFO photo is that it had already been designated 'unclassified' within just days of these 19-month-old incidents\n\nA possible reason, as one public affairs official with Canada's Department of National Defence (DND) warned colleagues, was the Canadian military's own internal fears that releasing this UFO image 'may create more questions/confusion'\n\nDark portions visible along the top center of the UFO in this newly released image may depict either that upper metallic region or the remains of the alleged 'package.'\n\nBut this release only adds more mystery to the wave of espionage-tinted UFO activity that surrounded the confirmed downing of an authentic Chinese-government spy balloon earlier that month off the coast of North Carolina's Myrtle Beach.\n\nIain Boyd, a professor of aerospace engineering and director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado, described the Canadian government's reticence to release the image as an issue of national security \u2014 despite the image's 'unclassified' designation.\n\n'It comes down to these episodes illustrating a potential vulnerability in the U.S./Canada defensive system,' Boyd opined.\n\n'Certainly the failure to provide more information has fed conspiracy theories,' as he told CTVNews.ca, 'but the military will likely accept that outcome over disclosing information that may help an adversary identify defensive weaknesses.'\n\nAccording to the report for CTV News, the network's journalists plan to petition the Canadian military for a higher resolution version of this UFO image."

It was one of the most famous UFO sightings -- in fact, that was the exact moment the term \"flying saucers\" was coined.\n\nAn Air Force investigation later concluded that what Arnold really saw were disc-shaped wave clouds called lenticular clouds, which are not uncommon in the Cascades and on top of Mt. Rainier, the highest peak in the mountain range.\n\nLenticular clouds are different from other clouds because they don't form and move along but rather sit in one place, continually re-formed as air moves through them, causing them to morph slightly over time. They are the result of air rising to its condensation point over and downstream of an object, typically a mountain; however, they can also result from waves generated in the atmosphere itself.\n\nA mysterious lenticular cloud forms over the Owens Valley,Eastern Sierra California. (Getty Images) A mysterious lenticular cloud forms over the Owens Valley,Eastern Sierra California. (Getty Images)\n\nMount Rainier is famous for its frequent lenticulars, as is Mount Fuji in Japan, and all tall mountains. When more than one lenticular layer appears on top of each other, they are referred to as \"stacked lenticulars.\" But don't believe every photo you see on the Internet -- this photo of five layers over Mount Fuji is a hoax. This one is real:\n\nLenticular Clouds over New Zealand on August 29, 2020. (Geoffrey Beckett via Storyful) Lenticular Clouds over New Zealand on August 29, 2020. (Geoffrey Beckett via Storyful)\n\nNot surprisingly, the state of California has a lot of lenticular clouds due to its rapidly changing landscape from deep valleys to tall mountains. This classification of cloud has been featured many times in our \"Weather Permitting\" Photo Blog, including sightings of the formations during a wedding near Lake Tahoe in June 2023, during a brilliant sunset in the Sierra Nevada in May 2021, near Los Angeles in spring 2022 and at sunrise in Tehachapi, California, in January 2020.\n\nLenticular, or Sierra Wave Clouds, by Christopher Balladarez on May 25, 2021. Lenticular, or Sierra Wave Clouds, by Christopher Balladarez on May 25, 2021. (AccuWeather Photo Blog)\n\nAfter Arnold's report, the UFO craze began to sweep the nation, sparking hundreds of copycat sightings. On July 8, 1947, as many as 30 residents of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, reported \"a very large and dark object which consisted of two superposed discs which seemed to move close to each other if not to merge every few seconds.\"\n\nR\u00e9nald Fortier from Ingenium, Canada's Museums of Science and Innovation suggests that the Montreal sighting might have been lenticular clouds as well. The description of superimposed large discs that merge certainly does sound like the wave clouds, perhaps a similar occurrence to lenticular clouds that recently scared residents over a South African town at night.\n\nThe cloud's form takes its name from the Latin word lenticularis, according to Merriam-Webster, meaning lentil-shaped. They are often saucer-shaped but can take many forms, including oblong and jellyfish-shaped.\n\nFrom above on weather satellite images, they look like smooth blobs, as seen over Mount Etna below, or long smooth streaks.\n\nA satellite image showing a lone lenticular cloud hovering above a snow-covered Mt. Etna in early December 2021. A satellite image showing a lone lenticular cloud hovering above a snow-covered Mt. Etna in early December 2021 (AccuWeather Photo Blog)\n\nLenticular clouds don't necessarily portend any specific weather conditions. Although the clouds look like gentle giants, the wind is actually speeding quickly through them, rapidly moving up and down, and pilots may want to avoid the area around them because of turbulence."

Long gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence. As more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly. The 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security. Across the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing \"dead alien corpses\" on display for Congress. Researchers recently verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of \"non-human\" life forms. A line-up of doctors confirmed at Mexico's Congress on Tuesday that the bodies, purportedly not of this Earth, were in fact real, once-living organisms. The Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme. The haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans, sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech. Top UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity \"in our backyard.\" The Pentagon's UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering \"some things\" and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens. Navy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet. The United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).\n\nIn 2021, Trump signed a bill calling on intelligence agencies to find out the truth behind UFO military base sightings.\n\nTrump also said he had heard some \"interesting things\" about aliens as he hinted he may declassify files on the infamous Roswell UFO.\n\nRoswell is regarded as one of the most notorious UFO incidents.\n\nIt happened when a rancher discovered a mysterious crash site on his pasture in New Mexico in 1947.\n\nThe US Air Force said it was a crashed weather balloon, and later admitted it was part of a secret nuclear test.\n\nTheories still rage about the crash, however, with the most outlandish claiming it was a flying saucer filled with alien bodies that were recovered and taken to Area 51.\n\n5 Speaking on Lex Fridman's podcast, Trump claimed he had faced pressure to declassify previous records of alien encounters Credit: YouTube/Lex Fridman"

        "article_content": "Deepak Chopra, the world-renowned author and health and wellness expert, has teamed with AI firm ElevenLabs to add his pipes to the company\u2019s roster of notable voices available for audio streaming of books, articles and other written materials.\n\nChopra\u2019s voice pact with ElevenLabs stemmed from the \u201cDigital Deepak\u201d chatbot app that he launched with the company in June. The bot is trained in Chopak\u2019s more than 90 books and numerous public appearances in order to allow people to ask him specific questions and get responses delivered back in Chopra\u2019s synthetic voice.\n\nLondon-based ElevenLabs has been getting attention in the entertainment industry for its work to partner with the estates of celebrities such as Judy Garland, Laurence Olivier, James Dean and Burt Reynolds to allow users to stream books, articles and other texts as read in the voices of iconic stars. ElevenLabs\u2019 deal with Chopra comes the same day that the industry-leading, Microsoft-backed OpenAI platform rolled out a host of new voices and features to its Advanced Voice Mode service.\n\nChopra\u2019s latest pact with ElevenLabs adds his distinctive voice to the roster that users can choose from when streaming audio spoken-word content. ElevenLabs has made a major effort to underscore that it has worked with estates to reach license agreements offering appropriate compensation. The company also emphasizes that its vault of celebrity voices is only available for audio streaming of written material. ElevenLabs users are not able to use those voices to create new works.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce my partnership with ElevenLabs. Listening can help cultivate emotional\n\nnurturing and engagement. This is no different in the age of AI, it is only more important,\u201d Chopra said.\n\n\u201cI have always written to connect with people, and now I can connect on a deeper level with a global audience as I make my teachings available for everyone in my own voice.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 outreach to the industry is an counteract the pervasive fear in Hollywood, particularly in the creative community, that AI tools will eventually pinch employment for actors, writers, directors, producers and below the line talent.\n\n\u201cAt ElevenLabs, we\u2019re committed to preserving and celebrating cultural legacies while pushing the boundaries of technology,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships for ElevenLabs. \u201cBy bringing voices like Deepak Chopra to our platform, we\u2019re not just enhancing our app \u2013 we\u2019re creating new ways for people to connect with the most influential figures and their work.\u201d\n\nMayim Bialik, actor and neuroscientist who is friendly with Chopra and closely following the growth of AI in content, added her thumbs-up for the ElevenLabs model. Actors in particular are focused in establishing the principle of compensation and consent when AI tools are employed to create new works from older material. AI concerns were at the heart of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s long strike last year and they are the key sticking point in the union\u2019s current strike against top video game publishers.\n\n\u201cDeepak has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to the mind-body connection and the significance of understanding ourselves, so it\u2019s no surprise to see him finding creative ways to leverage the latest and best in AI technology with ElevenLabs in a safe and responsible way,\u201d Bialik said. \u201cBeing able to access his content in his calm and soothing voice is a big win for his fans around\n\nthe world.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 latest deal also comes on the heels of AI legislation being signed in to law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom. With SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher at his side, Newsom on Sept. 17 signed two bills, championed by the union, that mandates that AI and tech firms receive the consent of performers if their likeness is to be used in AI-generated new material.\n\nElevenLabs sees the California legislation as a step in the right direction to establishing guardrails around a powerful new high-tech tool that has enormous potential to revolutionize productivity and the way we live and learn, but it also comes with enormous repercussions for copyright violations and misinformation concerns. Blank told Variety he sees such legislation at the state and federal level as essential to nurturing AI business opportunities in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe welcome \u2014 and we believe the whole industry should welcome \u2014 government efforts to hold accountable bad actors who create digital replicas of someone without their consent,\u201d Blank told Variety. \u201cRecognizing that there should be accountability for abuse of technology is an important part of making technology safer while still allowing progress to thrive.\u201d"

        "article_content": "The most capable open source AI model with visual abilities yet could see more developers, researchers, and startups develop AI agents that can carry out useful chores on your computers for you.\n\nReleased today by the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), the Multimodal Open Language Model, or Molmo, can interpret images as well as converse through a chat interface. This means it can make sense of a computer screen, potentially helping an AI agent perform tasks such as browsing the web, navigating through file directories, and drafting documents.\n\n\u201cWith this release, many more people can deploy a multimodal model,\u201d says Ali Farhadi, CEO of Ai2, a research organization based in Seattle, Washington, and a computer scientist at the University of Washington. \u201cIt should be an enabler for next-generation apps.\u201d\n\nSo-called AI agents are being widely touted as the next big thing in AI, with OpenAI, Google, and others racing to develop them. Agents have become a buzzword of late, but the grand vision is for AI to go well beyond chatting to reliably take complex and sophisticated actions on computers when given a command. This capability has yet to materialize at any kind of scale.\n\nSome powerful AI models already have visual abilities, including GPT-4 from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, and Gemini from Google DeepMind. These models can be used to power some experimental AI agents, but they are hidden from view and accessible only via a paid application programming interface, or API.\n\nMeta has released a family of AI models called Llama under a license that limits their commercial use, but it has yet to provide developers with a multimodal version. Meta is expected to announce several new products, perhaps including new Llama AI models, at its Connect event today.\n\n\u201cHaving an open source, multimodal model means that any startup or researcher that has an idea can try to do it,\u201d says Ofir Press, a postdoc at Princeton University who works on AI agents.\n\nPress says that the fact that Molmo is open source means that developers will be more easily able to fine-tune their agents for specific tasks, such as working with spreadsheets, by providing additional training data. Models like GPT-4 can only be fine-tuned to a limited degree through their APIs, whereas a fully open model can be modified extensively. \u201cWhen you have an open source model like this then you have many more options,\u201d Press says.\n\nAi2 is releasing several sizes of Molmo today, including a 70-billion-parameter model and a 1-billion-parameter one that is small enough to run on a mobile device. A model\u2019s parameter count refers to the number of units it contains for storing and manipulating data and roughly corresponds to its capabilities.\n\nAi2 says Molmo is as capable as considerably larger commercial models despite its relatively small size, because it was carefully trained on high-quality data. The new model is also fully open source in that, unlike Meta\u2019s Llama, there are no restrictions on its use. Ai2 is also releasing the training data used to create the model, providing researchers with more details of its workings.\n\nReleasing powerful models is not without risk. Such models can more easily be adapted for nefarious ends; we may someday, for example, see the emergence of malicious AI agents designed to automate the hacking of computer systems.\n\nFarhadi of Ai2 argues that the efficiency and portability of Molmo will allow developers to build more powerful software agents that run natively on smartphones and other portable devices. \u201cThe billion parameter model is now performing in the level of or in the league of models that are at least 10 times bigger,\u201d he says.\n\nBuilding useful AI agents may depend on more than just more efficient multimodal models, however. A key challenge is making the models work more reliably. This may well require further breakthroughs in AI\u2019s reasoning abilities\u2014something that OpenAI has sought to tackle with its latest model o1, which demonstrates step-by-step reasoning skills. The next step may well be giving multimodal models such reasoning abilities.\n\nFor now, the release of Molmo means that AI agents are closer than ever\u2014and could soon be useful even outside of the giants that rule the world of AI."

        "article_content": "You kind of had to be there.\n\nParanormal Activity, like The Blair Witch Project before it, is a movie best experienced in a large dark room with 100 screaming strangers. Maybe that\u2019s true of most movies, but found-footage thrillers attempt to hijack your brain into thinking they\u2019re real in a way that just doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re watching it at home when the lights are on and phone notifications are vying for your attention.\n\nBut even if you can\u2019t re-experience the original sensation of seeing Paranormal Activity in theaters when it was released back on September 25, 2009, it\u2019s still worth reflecting on how this micro-budget horror movie managed to become a worldwide phenomenon, and how it changed the entire industry in the process.\n\nThe plot is simple. A young couple, Katie and Micah, move in together. Katie then tells Micah that she\u2019s been haunted by an evil spirit ever since she was a kid, so Micah sets up a camera and records everything in the house, including their bedroom, while they sleep. The haunting starts small (a door moves on its own, there are some light noises), but things escalate within a few weeks, leading to a terrifying finale where Katie becomes possessed by a demon and murders Micah.\n\nParanormal Activity was made with just $15,000 and filmed in one week in first-time director Oren Peli\u2019s own home. Peli cast two unknown actors, shot the movie on a home video camera, and never bothered writing a script; like with The Blair Witch Project, actors were told to improvise based on a loose outline.\n\nKatie Featherston as Katie. Blumhouse\n\nIn a 2009 interview with Shock Till You Drop, Peli explained his lo-fi, found-footage approach.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make it look as real and natural as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to this storytelling style. It breaks the mental barrier when audiences see a regular film and become aware of the camera movements, they know a crew is there and there are stars. When you strip all of this away, the audience thinks they are seeing something with a higher degree of plausibility. The suspending of disbelief becomes all the easier. You have an audience that's more invested in the story and the characters.\u201d\n\nParanormal Activity made almost $200 million at the box office and spawned a seven-movie franchise, but its legacy is even bigger than that. Peli\u2019s thriller also gave rise to one of the biggest names in horror today: Jason Blum.\n\nJason Blum attends the Film Independent's Spirit Awards in 2010. Angela Weiss/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nAfter debuting at Screamfest in 2007, Paranormal Activity earned some Hollywood buzz. It landed on the desk of Blumhouse CEO Jason Blum, then an executive at Miramax, who worked with Peli to edit the movie and submit it to Sundance. They were rejected, but didn\u2019t give up, and eventually, an early copy of Paranormal Activity found its way to Steven Spielberg.\n\nSpielberg made a deal with Peli and Blum to release the movie through Paramount. The plan was to completely reshoot it with a bigger budget while releasing the original cut as a DVD extra, but after a test screening scared audiences so much that some people walked out, the team realized they had a potential hit on their hands. The rest is history.\n\nSinister followed a similar formula, giving director Scott Derrickson the freedom to experiment. Blumhouse\n\nSpeaking to The LA Times just days before Paranormal Activity finally hit theaters, Jason Blum broke down exactly what makes the movie so special. \u201cOnce every five years, a guy makes a movie for a nickel that can cross over to a broad audience,\" he said.\n\nYou could practically hear the gears turning in Blum\u2019s head. While his studio, Blumhouse, had already existed for a few years, it was Paranormal Activity that cracked the code. Movies like Insidious and Sinister would soon follow, giving ambitious directors little money but lots of freedom to make bold horror movies that could rake in millions and launch new franchises.\n\nIn that sense, we have Paranormal Activity to thank for our current glut of horror movies. Blumhouse is still pumping them out 15 years later, and so is everyone else, from indie studios like A24 to Hollywood titans like Paramount. Even Disney is cashing in on horror thanks to its Fox acquisition and the IP, like Alien, that came with it.\n\nBut while Paranormal Activity\u2019s legacy may be mighty, the movie itself hasn\u2019t exactly held up, at least not in the context that most people experience movies these days.\n\n\u201cYou watch it in your bedroom, it can look like your kid made it,\u201d Blum said back in 2009. \u201cYou watch it with an audience, it's an entirely different experience.\u201d\n\nSo if you want to watch Paranormal Activity the way it was meant to be seen, just get 100 of your closest friends and family together in a dark room. If that\u2019s not viable, you can explore the entire genre it spawned instead."

I think we\u2019ve got one,\u201d said Hailong Chen, an associate professor at the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cOur cathode can be a game-changer. It would greatly improve the EV market \u2013 and the whole lithium-ion battery market.\u201d\n\nBatteries are responsible for around 50 per cent of the cost of an electric vehicle, with current technologies making them slightly more expensive than fossil fuel-powered vehicles at today\u2019s prices.\n\nWorldwide EV adoption has been largely driven by government subsidies, however many schemes have already come to an end, making the vehicles less economically viable.\n\nThe new cathode material could make electric cars cheaper than their polluting counterparts, while also offering a solution for larger-scale energy storage needs.\n\n\u201cThis could not only make EVs much cheaper than internal combustion cars, but it provides a new and promising form of large-scale energy storage, enhancing the resilience of the electrical grid,\u201d Professor Chen said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our cathode would greatly improve the sustainability and supply chain stability of the EV market.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was published in the journal Nature Sustainability this week in a study titled \u2018Low-cost iron trichloride cathode for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries\u2019.\n\nOther recent battery breakthroughs have seen scientists improve the range and charging times of electric cars, both of which are frequently cited as barriers to adoption.\n\nEarlier this month, researchers from the University of Boulder Colorado used an X-ray machine to figure out how to significantly increase the range of electric cars using lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\u201cHaving a better battery is very important in shifting our energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels to more renewable energy sources,\u201d said Michael Toney, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. \u201cAll consumers want cars with a large driving range.\u201d"

The Perseverance rover is on the hunt for ancient rocks that could teach mankind about the early Martian history.

However, the science team, NASA said, thinks that this rock has a texture unlike any seen in Jezero Crater before, and perhaps all of Mars.\n\nNASA said its knowledge of Mars' chemical composition is limited, but early interpretations are that igneous and/or metamorphic processes could have created its stripes.\n\nSince Freya Castle is a loose stone that is clearly different from the underlying bedrock, it has likely arrived here from someplace else, perhaps having rolled downhill from a source higher up.\n\nThis possibility has got NASA excited, as it hopes that as it continues to drive uphill, the Perseverance rover will encounter an outcrop of this new rock type so that more detailed measurements can be acquired."

        "article_content": "The world of technology has always been dynamic and rapidly evolving, but in recent years, a powerful movement has emerged \u2014 one that puts the ability to innovate directly in the hands of individuals without requiring a technical background. This movement is known as \u201cno-code,\u201d and it is transforming how we build software, websites, and even entire businesses.\n\nNo-code tools are a game changer for women in tech, particularly those who may not have formal coding experience. This is where Women of NoCode comes in as a LinkedIn group dedicated to supporting, mentoring, and empowering women in tech through no-code solutions.\n\nThe Inspiration Behind Women of NoCode\n\nWhen creating Women of NoCode, the goal was to build a supportive and empowering community where women could gain confidence in using no-code tools to achieve their goals. The group was born to democratize access to tech innovation and provide an inclusive space where women could learn, collaborate, and elevate each other. The inspiration for the group stemmed from witnessing firsthand how no-code platforms were breaking down barriers that had historically kept women \u2014 and many others \u2014 from entering tech.\n\nTrending Peacock Spider Dances Its Way Into Our Arachnophobic Hearts\n\nThe tech industry is often dominated by people with formal coding skills, which can be intimidating to those without a programming background, but no-code solutions have changed that dynamic. These platforms allow users to build and automate processes without writing a single line of code, meaning someone with an idea can bring it to life, whether creating a mobile app, automating workflows, or developing a new website without extensive technical expertise.\n\nWomen of NoCode was created to connect women with the resources, knowledge, and community to use these tools confidently. By leveraging no-code solutions, women can bring their innovative ideas to life and challenge the notion that tech innovation is reserved for coders.\n\nSupporting Women in Tech Through Resources and Networking\n\nOne of the key pillars of the Women of NoCode group is the support it provides to women in tech through a variety of resources and networking opportunities. From curated content to expert-led discussions, the group offers a wealth of information on how to navigate the no-code landscape. Women who are just starting their tech journey and seasoned professionals alike can all find something of value in the group.\n\nNetworking plays a vital role in advancing one\u2019s career, and Women of NoCode fosters this through a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation. The group offers a platform where women can collaborate on projects, seek advice, and exchange best practices. Whether through virtual meetups, webinars, or simply engaging with posts on the LinkedIn group, members have countless opportunities to grow their network and gain insights from others in the field.\n\nWhat makes Women of NoCode unique is that it is not just a space to talk about tools and platforms but a space to celebrate women\u2019s achievements in tech. Every success story shared within the group serves as a reminder of what women are capable of when given the right tools and opportunities. These stories help inspire others, fostering a ripple effect of empowerment across the community.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the no-code movement is how it democratizes access to tech. In the past, building a software application or automating business processes required either hiring a developer or learning to code \u2014 both of which are traditionally costly and time-consuming. No-code platforms have changed that, making it possible for anyone, regardless of their background, to become a creator in the tech space.\n\nFor women, this is particularly empowering. Studies show that women are still underrepresented in many technical fields, often due to a lack of access to the necessary training or mentorship. No-code platforms offer a way to bridge this gap by enabling women to acquire tech skills without writing code or requiring programming skills.\n\nThrough Women of NoCode, women are discovering how to leverage no-code tools to solve real-world problems, launch new businesses, and innovate within their existing roles. The accessibility of these tools means that more women can enter the tech industry, contribute to digital transformation, and bring important and unique perspectives to the table.\n\nNo-code solutions also help to level the playing field for entrepreneurs. With the rise of tech startups and the increasing demand for digital transformation, no-code platforms are giving women the ability to build, test, and launch products quickly, opening more doors for women entrepreneurs who may have previously faced challenges securing technical talent or funding. By removing these barriers, no-code empowers more women to become tech leaders and innovators.\n\nJoin The Movement\n\nThe Women of NoCode LinkedIn group is a movement that encourages women to take control of their tech journeys, embrace innovation, and break down barriers that may have held them back. In this group, members are given access to free training, learning how to use no-code tools effectively while building the confidence to lead in an industry that is constantly evolving.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman in tech, a woman in business, and a woman with a great idea for the next great company \u2014 or even just someone curious about the possibilities of no-code \u2014 joining Women of NoCode will connect you with a thriving community of innovators, problem solvers, and leaders. The future of tech is inclusive, and no-code is helping to make that a reality. Being a part of this group will help you stay at the forefront of tech innovation and contribute to a growing ecosystem of empowered women ready to change the world."

        "article_content": "FRISCO \u2014 CeeDee Lamb took the blame for everything.\n\nHe owned the end zone tantrum, loud chats with teammates and coaches, and his poor performance.\n\nAfter skipping out on speaking with the media following the Cowboys\u2019 loss to the Ravens on Sunday, Lamb discussed everything two days later.\n\n\u201cHonestly I got to be truthful to myself and I played a part in that loss,\u201d he said. \u201cA big part honestly, and nor did my body language nor attitude, approaching the situation help the situation or the outcome of the game.\u201d\n\nCowboys Be the smartest Cowboys fan. Get the latest news. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLamb added of his actions, \u201cVery detrimental. Detrimental and, yeah, I\u2019ll make up for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLamb is normally a smooth operator on the field. It\u2019s the reason the Cowboys signed him to one of the richest contracts in NFL history at the receiver position. But the first three weeks of the season have been turbulent.\n\nOut of 24 targets, he has 13 catches and one touchdown. Last season he caught a career-high 74% of passes directed toward him.\n\nThe offensive issues Lamb faced came to a head against the Ravens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a moment telling of that 28-25 loss, Prescott misfired on a potential touchdown pass to Lamb in the end zone. A pass interference call was negated by an offsetting holding penalty, and Lamb sat in the end zone yelling and slapping both hands to the turf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe later arrived on the sidelines and had a loud discussion with Prescott and anyone else nearby. You could tell he was frustrated. Maybe the contract was getting to him. Maybe the pressures of trying to find a flow within an offense he didn\u2019t work in during training camp because of his contract holdout was rearing its ugly head.\n\nHe finished the game with two drops, a false start and four catches for 67 yards. He also fumbled in the red zone.\n\n\u201cYou got to start with the man in the mirror and I\u2019m a huge believer in that,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cAnd watching that game kind of pissed me off, but I did that. I can\u2019t get mad at nobody else. So with that being said, I\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cowboys have gone through this with Lamb, most recently last season. After four weeks, Lamb had 23 catches for 309 yards with a touchdown. He caught 76.7% of his passes. Those numbers look so much better than what he\u2019s producing now.\n\nAnd Lamb wasn\u2019t happy about it then. The next week at San Francisco, Lamb caught four passes for 49 yards and no touchdowns in a 42-10 loss. Lamb went off.\n\nAfter the 49ers game, receiver Brandin Cooks became Lamb\u2019s consigliere. Cooks understood then Lamb was playing for a huge contract and poor performances hamper that. The two talked about getting on the same page with Prescott and coach Mike McCarthy, in his first year with this team as the playcaller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the next eight games, Lamb had 69 catches for 859 yards and seven touchdowns. Lamb\u2019s confidence soared along and everyone forgot about that sorry performance against the 49ers.\n\nOn Thursday night, the Cowboys visit the New York Giants and Lamb has to respond in a similar fashion.\n\n\u201cI plan on doing it again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem with doing it again isn\u2019t so much what defenses are doing to Lamb, it\u2019s finding a rhythm with Prescott.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQB1 wasn\u2019t available to tell his side of the story because team officials elected to have him speak after the Giants game.\n\nMcCarthy has turned Lamb into an elite receiver that takes over games. But it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen in the early stages of the season.\n\n\u201cCeeDee is a primary focal point for us game planning and it\u2019ll be a primary focal point for the defense,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you play the game. We\u2019ll continue to do what we have done with him. There\u2019s always little things you\u2019re looking to build on, certain routes and so forth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cowboys can line Lamb up in the backfield, use him on jet sweeps, line him up in three receiver spots. When he\u2019s on the field and used properly his talent is unmatched.\n\nAfter three weeks, he hasn\u2019t shown it.\n\n\u201cGranted, it was a bad game on my end. I fully take accountability in that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no shame in that. So with that being said, I will be better in the future and it\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nX: @calvinwatkins\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

        "article_content": "Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng knew they wanted to start a company together\u2014but they had some rules.\n\nThe two, who first met at Airbnb, had left their jobs with comically bad timing in 2020. But Cheng and Zaparde were determined to figure out what might work for them and as a business.\n\nAs the surrounding world reeled from the pandemic, the pair spent months developing a 16-point set of criteria to determine if a business idea was worth pursuing. It\u2019s a colorful set of rules. There\u2019s the \"bomb test,\" a gallows humor screening of a potential business idea\u2019s scalability, sustainability, and enterprise software-ness. Then there\u2019s the hair-on-fire principle, which describes a must-solve problem that cannot, under any circumstances, be ignored.\n\n\"It's a real problem that they have to solve, because it's causing that much pain,\" said Zaparde.\n\nOthers include: \"Why is now the right time to start the company?\" and \"Is this really sticky and super hard to rip out?\" They tried on different ideas and even stumbled on a prospective services business that began generating revenue faster than they\u2019d imagined\u2014but they nixed it. Their startup idea had to fit all the criteria. And that\u2019s how they got into the business of procurement, the labyrinthine corporate process of finding, buying, receiving, and checking goods.\n\nIt's a process that every business undergoes but no one seems to like, which is perhaps putting it mildly. Once, someone cried to Cheng and Zaparde in procurement-induced frustration.\n\n\"We had a notes doc that had about 120 pages, and the word \u2018pain\u2019 shows up 110 times in it,\" said Cheng. \"People had these visceral reactions to the challenges around procurement and how the industry has evolved, how types of spend have evolved, and how technology just hasn\u2019t caught up.\"\n\nAnd there was that key word: Pain. Procurement problems were hair-on-fire problems. In the four years since Cheng and Zaparde founded Zip, the procurement software startup has covered a lot of ground\u2014backed by Y Combinator, CRV, and Tiger Global, it was last valued at $1.5 billion in 2023. Zip\u2019s current customers include OpenAI, Discover, Sephora, and Snowflake.\n\nThis week marks another big milestone for Zip: The company today announced its expansion into Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and revealed a design rebrand. This is all just two days after IDC placed Zip at the top of its newly minted \"spend orchestration category,\" even beating out publicly traded giants like ServiceNow.\n\n\"This is an acknowledgment that they actually have found a legitimate category,\" said Zip investor Ali Rowghani, who\u2019s former managing director of YC\u2019s Continuity Fund, former CFO at Pixar, and former COO at Twitter. \"I think it\u2019s going to be really big. From an investor's point of view, it validates the thesis that there\u2019s a real problem here that not just a small number of companies have, but that a lot of companies have.\"\n\nAnd the problem, more or less, is this: Procurement can cover almost anything, from pens and printers to industry-specific must-haves. It inherently requires many layers of approval\u2014there have been more and more layers added over the years, as companies have gotten bigger and more complex. So, requests get denied and no one knows why. Procurement has become a procedural maze with trap doors, hidden corners, and nonsensical dead-ends. And like a maze, it\u2019s hard to see clearly and (without tech help) impossible to see as a whole. The overall effect: Procurement divisions feel like black boxes, and the people who work in them are usually unseen and underappreciated. Case in point, when was the last time you thanked your procurement specialist?\n\nZip already has international customers, and that\u2019s been true \"from the very beginning,\" according to Cheng. For example, Tel Aviv and New York-based Pagaya since 2022 has been a Zip customer. David Eckstein, Pagaya\u2019s director of procurement, said via email that, though the procurement process in most places is considered \"chaotic,\" that\u2019s something that Zip \"solved for me, for us.\" Other existing international Zip customers include U.K.-based semiconductor company Arm and Germany-based digital bank N26.\n\nSo, the EMEA expansion is a formalization of something that\u2019s been happening for years. Zip is opening a new office in London and will be hiring aggressively there, and will also court talent in Germany and France.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of pull from EMEA naturally,\" Zaparde said. \"We didn't have an EMEA team at all until about a year or so ago, give or take\u2026We had just been receiving all this inbound from prospective customers, because they had this pain around procurement intake and orchestration.\"\n\nZaparde and Cheng, respectively CEO and CTO, are eyeing APAC next. But that\u2019s down the road. Today (and probably today only) Zip is concentrated on San Francisco, where it\u2019s holding its second-ever conference, Zip Forward, and unveiling new products like AI invoice coding. Buses and billboards across the city will feature the company\u2019s brand redesign, taking something that was frankly generic and turning it electric blue.\n\nIt would be a big week for anyone. But it\u2019s especially so for a startup that was founded just four years ago to solve a problem setting hair on fire.\n\nElsewhere\u2026Yesterday, former FTX executive Caroline Ellison was sentenced to two years in federal prison. Here\u2019s more from my colleague Leo Schwartz.\n\nSee you tomorrow,\n\nAllie Garfinkle\n\nTwitter: @agarfinks\n\nEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\n\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\n\nNina Ajemian curated the deals section of today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Late last week, cybersecurity company Kaspersky started deleting its anti-malware software from computers located in the United States. As a replacement, the company automatically downloaded antivirus software from UltraAV instead.\n\nIf you use Kaspersky antivirus software, you may know the Russian company was added to the U.S. government\u2019s Entity List and subjected to a ban on sales and updates within the United States earlier this year. As a result, the company told BleepingComputer in July that it had decided to shut down its U.S. operations and lay off its American employees.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThese developments aren\u2019t a secret, but it can\u2019t be said that everyone knew about them, either. As a result, Kaspersky\u2019s sudden and badly explained decision to automatically delete its software came as a surprise to many.\n\nEmails went out at the start of September informing customers that the company had teamed up with UltraAV to provide continued protection for customers even after Kaspersky withdrew from the United States. The emails did not, however, make it clear that this continued protection would be automatically installed on their computers.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t see the email for whatever reason, the transfer came as even more of a shock. Users on Reddit and other forums have been expressing their confusion about the situation along with their distrust of the new UltraAV software. One poster even worried their desktop had been compromised when they woke up to find their Kaspersky antivirus software gone and UltraAV in its place.\n\nThis distrust isn\u2019t surprising since little is known about the company other than its connection to multiple VPN brands such as UltraVPN, Hotspot Shield, and Betternet. According to customer reports online, many people are uninstalling UltraAV because of this \u2014 and because it appeared on their devices in such an unsettling way.\n\nKaspersky has since posted an official statement explaining that it took this action to make sure customers \u201cwould not experience a gap in protection upon Kaspersky\u2019s exit from the market.\u201d The post also went on to say the company had chosen UltraAV because it offered similar features and products to Kaspersky. For instance, people who used Kaspersky\u2019s VPN service also found UltraVPN installed on their devices.\n\nFor a lot of people, the explanation is too little too late and likely won\u2019t stop them from replacing UltraAV with a more well-known antivirus software application."

Throughout this 30-plus minute show, Sony and its third-party partners showcased over 20 games coming to PlayStation 5 and PSVR2 in the coming months. We got a new look at PS5 games like Lego Horizon Adventures and Monster Hunter Wilds, as well as some exciting new announcements such as Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered , which was leaked by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), and the Ghost of Tsushima sequel Ghost of Y\u014dtei.\n\nWe also got to see some more games that will run on PS5 Pro hardware (its set to release this November). September\u2019s State of Play was a big one PlayStation fans, so there\u2019s a lot to keep track of. To help, we\u2019ve rounded up everything announced during this State of Play.\n\nAstro Bot is getting a major update this fall\n\nAstro Bot - Speedrun and Special Bots Add-On Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nTo kick off the State of Play, we learned that Team Asobi\u2019s critical darling Astro Bot will be getting a significant update. It will add five new online speedrun levels and 10 new bots based on games like Helldivers 2 and Stellar Blade. This new content for Astro Bot will be entirely free and launch sometime this fall on the PS5.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPalworld is out now on PS5\n\nPalworld - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nPalworld launched on PC and Xbox Series X/S and became a viral success early this year. That happened because the game had the cute creature-collecting elements of Pokemon, but was also extremely violent, like most survival games. In fact, it may be a little too similar to Pokemon, as Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing developer Pocketpair. That\u2019s not stopping them from bringing Palworld to more platforms, as it surprise launched on PS5 during tonight\u2019s State of Play.\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds is out next February\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds - Release Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds got a new trailer during this State of Play. It showed us some more story cutscenes, a new jungle-like biome, and some threatening new monsters that players will have to fight in the game, like the White Wraith. We also saw Felynes in action in Monster Hunter Wilds for the first time. Most importantly, we finally got a release date for this long-awaited Capcom game. Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 28, 2025.\n\nLego Horizon Adventures is out in November\n\nLego Horizon Adventures was revealed in June, but still had no release date. That finally changed today as a new trailer confirmed that Lego Horizon Adventures will be released for PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on November 14. That lines up with a previously leaked release date for the title. Its new trailer reaffirmed the core concept of the game: it is a kid-friendly, Lego-fied reimagining of the story of Horizon Zero Dawn that isn\u2019t afraid to break canon with costumes based on other PlayStation characters like Sackboy or Ratchet & Clank.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered is launching sooner than you think\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 & PC Games\n\nEarlier in the month, an ESRB listing revealed the existence of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. Following in the footsteps of similar treatments for the two The Last of Us games, this is a refurbishment of a bestselling PS4 game for Sony\u2019s current platform. The reveal trailer highlights the improved visuals and over 10 hours of rerecorded dialogue. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will be released on October 31, which is much sooner than expected. It will be available across PS5 and PC and will only cost $10 for those who own the original.\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei is Sucker Punch Productions\u2019 next game\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nTo close out the show, Sucker Punch Productions surprised us by revealing Ghost of Y\u014dtei, a sequel to 2020\u2019s critically acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima. It follows a new \u201cghost\u201d named Atsu, and takes place around Mount Y\u014dtei in Northern Japan. It also takes place in 1603, which is hundreds of years after Ghost of Tsushima, which is known for its gorgeous vistas and industry-leading visuals. Ghost of Y\u014dtei is shaping up to be very much the same. It will be released exclusively for PS5 sometime in 2025.\n\nEverything else"
