I say that as a longtime iPhone user who still dreads going to the Settings app even after the big redesign in iOS 18. The equally important Control Center redesign makes it easier to access some of the key settings you interact with more frequently.\n\nThe same applies to Android, of course. The Settings app has too many menus to remember, so I usually resort to using the built-in search feature.\n\nBut what if AI could help with that? Samsung is reportedly designing an AI feature that might stop you from visiting the Settings app that often. Instead, Galaxy AI might detect your needs and adjust the settings automatically. That\u2019s the kind of useful AI feature we could all use on our smartphones.\n\nAccording to ETNews, Samsung is developing AI software that would customize the phone experience without the user having to open the Settings app. That doesn\u2019t mean the phone will lack a Settings app. After all, not all Galaxy phone buyers want to use Galaxy AI features.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how this new Galaxy AI feature would work. The report says that Samsung plans to improve the \u201cperformance of \u2018touch points\u2019 such as keyboards and cameras to enable the ability to predict what consumers want in advance.\u201d\n\nAs Android Authority points out, Samsung already lets you control some Settings with the Bixby assistant. But the new Galaxy AI feature above would be more sophisticated than that. Adjusting settings on the fly with minimal user interaction would be incredible.\n\nAs someone dying to see AI evolve on smartphones and computers to the point where I can reliably control the devices, apps, and app features via voice or text prompts, I\u2019d love it if the AI could adjust my settings in real time on its own. The AI would simply learn what I like and then adjust the settings without me having to do anything.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself here. It\u2019s unclear how this Settings-related feature would work on future Galaxy AI phones, and there\u2019s no release timeline estimate for it either. What\u2019s certain is that Samsung will want to demo new Galaxy AI abilities when the Galaxy S25 series launches in early January. AI will continue to be a big marketing point for all phones, including Samsung handsets."

        "article_content": "While most countries\u2019 lawmakers are still discussing how to put guardrails around artificial intelligence, the European Union is ahead of the pack, having passed a risk-based framework for regulating AI apps earlier this year.\n\nThe law came into force in August, although full details of the pan-EU AI governance regime are still being worked out \u2014 Codes of Practice are in the process of being devised, for example. But, over the coming months and years, the law\u2019s tiered provisions will start to apply on AI app and model makers so the compliance countdown is already live and ticking.\n\nEvaluating whether and how AI models are meeting their legal obligations is the next challenge. Large language models (LLM), and other so-called foundation or general purpose AIs, will underpin most AI apps. So focusing assessment efforts at this layer of the AI stack seem important.\n\nStep forward LatticeFlow AI, a spinout from public research university ETH Zurich, which is focused on AI risk management and compliance.\n\nOn Wednesday, it published what it\u2019s touting as the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, meaning it\u2019s sought to map regulatory requirements to technical ones, alongside an open source LLM validation framework that draws on this work \u2014 which it\u2019s calling Compl-AI (\u201ccompl-ai\u201d\u2026 see what they did there!).\n\nThe AI model evaluation initiative \u2014 which they also dub \u201cthe first regulation-oriented LLM benchmarking suite\u201d \u2014 is the result of a long-term collaboration between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Bulgaria\u2019s Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT), per LatticeFlow.\n\nAI model makers can use the Compl-AI site to request an evaluation of their technology\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the EU AI Act.\n\nLatticeFlow has also published model evaluations of several mainstream LLMs, such as different versions/sizes of Meta\u2019s Llama models and OpenAI\u2019s GPT, along with an EU AI Act compliance leaderboard for Big AI.\n\nThe latter ranks the performance of models from the likes of Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral against the law\u2019s requirements \u2014 on a scale of 0 (i.e. no compliance) to 1 (full compliance).\n\nOther evaluations are marked as N/A where there\u2019s a lack of data, or if the model maker doesn\u2019t make the capability available. (NB: At the time of writing there were also some minus scores recorded but we\u2019re told that was down to a bug in the Hugging Face interface.)\n\nLatticeFlow\u2019s framework evaluates LLM responses across 27 benchmarks such as \u201ctoxic completions of benign text,\u201d \u201cprejudiced answers,\u201d \u201cfollowing harmful instructions,\u201d \u201ctruthfulness,\u201d and \u201ccommon sense reasoning\u201d to name a few of the benchmarking categories it\u2019s using for the evaluations. So each model gets a range of scores in each column (or else N/A).\n\nAI compliance a mixed bag\n\nSo how did major LLMs do? There is no overall model score. So performance varies depending on exactly what\u2019s being evaluated \u2014 but there are some notable highs and lows across the various benchmarks.\n\nFor example there\u2019s strong performance for all the models on not following harmful instructions; and relatively strong performance across the board on not producing prejudiced answers \u2014 whereas reasoning and general knowledge scores were a much more mixed bag.\n\nElsewhere, recommendation consistency, which the framework is using as a measure of fairness, was particularly poor for all models \u2014 with none scoring above the halfway mark (and most scoring well below).\n\nOther areas, such as training data suitability and watermark reliability and robustness, appear essentially unevaluated on account of how many results are marked N/A.\n\nLatticeFlow does note there are certain areas where models\u2019 compliance is more challenging to evaluate, such as hot-button issues like copyright and privacy. So it\u2019s not pretending it has all the answers.\n\nIn a paper detailing work on the framework, the scientists involved in the project highlight how most of the smaller models they evaluated (\u2264 13B parameters) \u201cscored poorly on technical robustness and safety.\u201d\n\nThey also found that \u201calmost all examined models struggle to achieve high levels of diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that these shortcomings are primarily due to model providers disproportionally focusing on improving model capabilities, at the expense of other important aspects highlighted by the EU AI Act\u2019s regulatory requirements,\u201d they add, suggesting that as compliance deadlines start to bite LLM makes will be forced to shift their focus onto areas of concern \u2014 \u201cleading to a more balanced development of LLMs.\u201d\n\nGiven no one yet knows exactly what will be required to comply with the EU AI Act, LatticeFlow\u2019s framework is necessarily a work in progress. It is also only one interpretation of how the law\u2019s requirements could be translated into technical outputs that can be benchmarked and compared. But it\u2019s an interesting start on what will need to be an ongoing effort to probe powerful automation technologies and try to steer their developers toward safer utility.\n\n\u201cThe framework is a first step towards a full compliance-centered evaluation of the EU AI Act \u2014 but is designed in a way to be easily updated to move in lock-step as the Act gets updated and the various working groups make progress,\u201d LatticeFlow CEO Petar Tsankov told TechCrunch. \u201cThe EU Commission supports this. We expect the community and industry to continue to develop the framework towards a full and comprehensive AI Act assessment platform.\u201d\n\nSummarizing the main takeaways so far, Tsankov said it\u2019s clear that AI models have \u201cpredominantly been optimized for capabilities rather than compliance.\u201d He also flagged \u201cnotable performance gaps\u201d \u2014 pointing out that some high capability models can be on a par with weaker models when it comes to compliance.\n\nCyberattack resilience (at the model level) and fairness are areas of particular concern, per Tsankov, with many models scoring below 50% for the former area.\n\n\u201cWhile Anthropic and OpenAI have successfully aligned their (closed) models to score against jailbreaks and prompt injections, open source vendors like Mistral have put less emphasis on this,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd with \u201cmost models\u201d performing equally poorly on fairness benchmarks he suggested this should be a priority for future work.\n\nOn the challenges of benchmarking LLM performance in areas like copyright and privacy, Tsankov explained: \u201cFor copyright the challenge is that current benchmarks only check for copyright books. This approach has two major limitations: (i) it does not account for potential copyright violations involving materials other than these specific books, and (ii) it relies on quantifying model memorization, which is notoriously difficult.\n\n\u201cFor privacy the challenge is similar: The benchmark only attempts to determine whether the model has memorized specific personal information.\u201d\n\nLatticeFlow is keen for the free and open source framework to be adopted and improved by the wider AI research community.\n\n\u201cWe invite AI researchers, developers, and regulators to join us in advancing this evolving project,\u201d said professor Martin Vechev of ETH Zurich and founder and scientific director at INSAIT, who is also involved in the work, in a statement. \u201cWe encourage other research groups and practitioners to contribute by refining the AI Act mapping, adding new benchmarks, and expanding this open-source framework.\n\n\u201cThe methodology can also be extended to evaluate AI models against future regulatory acts beyond the EU AI Act, making it a valuable tool for organizations working across different jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

        "article_content": "India's AI Advantage: Building Applications on LLMs\n\nShare on:\n\nBy Rediff Money Desk, New Delhi Oct 16, 2024 12:22\n\nIndia emerges as a global AI hub, leveraging engineering talent and vast data to build innovative applications on top of LLMs, transforming industries like SaaS and IT services.\n\nIllustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com\n\nNew Delhi, Oct 16 (PTI) In 2023, the world's early AI applications and large language models (LLMs) emerged primarily from the Bay Area, driven by highly specialised PhDs in deep learning. India then lagged in terms of access to these expert resources. A year later, the India story has changed dramatically.\n\n\n\nThe year 2024 will go down as a turning point with engineers in India beginning to develop innovative AI applications across various verticals, without needing deep learning PhDs. The number of AI startups building solutions on top of LLMs has since surged significantly.\n\n\n\n\u0093India is rapidly becoming a global hub for AI applications,\u0094 says Shekhar Kirani, a partner at global venture capital firm Accel.\n\n\n\nHe points to specific examples that demonstrate India's unique advantage in AI. A Bengaluru-based engineering team, for instance, built an AI application that automates 10-Q filings for US companies. Traditionally handled by accounting firms, the process took several days. However, the team trained a deep-learning model on top of open-source LLMs, reducing the time needed to generate these filings to under an hour.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kirani, India's vast services sector\u0097encompassing call centres, accounting, healthcare management, IT, and document processing\u0097offers access to a rich dataset for training AI models. \u0093India is a goldmine for trainable data, and our engineers are perfectly positioned to build industry-specific AI applications.\u0094\n\n\n\nLEVERAGING PROPRIETARY DATA FOR AI INNOVATION\n\n\n\nA standout example of India's growing expertise in AI is CareStack, a dental practice management software company in Accel's portfolio.\n\n\n\nCareStack's engineers in Kerala developed an AI application that records voice annotations from dentists and automates data entry into patient management systems. This solution, built on OpenAI's LLM, was made possible because the company had amassed a large dataset of voice samples from its dentist customers.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Zenoti, another Accel-backed company, developed an AI-powered front-office management system for spas and salons. The AI agent handles appointment scheduling, cancellations, and customer queries in real-time. These examples, says Kirani, illustrate how Indian companies are combining proprietary datasets with existing LLMs to create solutions that are transforming industries.\n\n\n\nINDIA'S EDGE IN BUILDING AI APPLICATIONS ON LLMS\n\n\n\nIn Kirani's view, India's combination of engineering talent, industry expertise, and access to trainable data gives the country a clear advantage in building AI applications on top of LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u0093We are seeing small, young teams\u0097engineers just three years out of college\u0097creating phenomenal AI applications,\u0094 he explains.\n\n\n\nKirani predicts that India will lead the way in developing middleware and application layers for LLM engines, integrating and personalising AI to meet enterprise needs.\n\n\n\nHowever, he also acknowledges that India faces significant competition in building the core LLM engines. \u0093The West is investing billions of dollars in this space. It's unlikely that India will outpace these global players in LLM engine development in the short term.\u0094\n\n\n\nInstead, India's strength lies in its ability to adapt and integrate these engines, making them work for specific enterprises and personalising AI applications for users.\n\n\n\nAI'S IMPACT ON INDIA'S SAAS AND IT INDUSTRIES\n\n\n\nAccording to Kirani, the fusion of AI with India's services and SaaS industries presents a massive opportunity. India's USD 250 billion IT services industry is already partnering with SaaS startups to offer AI-powered solutions on an outcome-based pricing model. AI is not just revolutionising SaaS startups but is also reshaping the rules for the services industry.\n\n\n\n\u0093Much like the disruption we saw in global telecom prices that fuelled the growth of India's services companies, we are now witnessing AI's ability to elevate Indian SaaS companies to the next level,\u0094 Kirani explains.\n\n\n\nHe believes that India's engineering talent, combined with the right business model innovation, could make the country a shining global leader in AI productized services over the next decade.\n\n\n\nA NEW WAVE OF TECH DISRUPTION\n\n\n\nKirani predicts that the next wave of tech disruption is just beginning. Companies that fail to adapt to this new reality will perish, while a new generation of startups will emerge to ride the AI wave.\n\n\n\n\u0093At Accel, we are betting big on this wave, investing heavily in AI-based productized services. The future is bright for Indian startups that embrace the fusion of AI and services,\u0094 Kirani says.\n\nDISCLAIMER - This article is from a syndicated feed.

        "article_content": "A new study seems to suggest that \u201cJedi\u201d rodents don\u2019t actually vocalize just to make noises. Instead, the study claims that they vocalize to \u201cshake matter\u201d around them, allowing them to influence how their noses inhale particulates, thus enhancing their smell.\n\nThis new discovery is highlighted in a study published in Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews earlier this month. The researchers involved say that this kind of behavior has never been observed before or even suspected in any animal that we\u2019ve discovered thus far. They also say that the rodents are actually creating new \u201cpathways of information\u201d by using sound to manipulate the environment around them.\n\nThis is honestly crazy, and I can see why some might refer to them as \u201cJedi\u201d rodents because of this phenomenon. One of the researchers described the entire discovery as being \u201clike magic,\u201d and honestly, he isn\u2019t wrong. The inspiration for the study came from one of the researcher\u2019s previous studies on humpback whales and the songs they sing.\n\nImage source: motortion / Adobe\n\nFrom there, the researchers noticed that rodents explore their environment by stroking surfaces with their whiskers, while also sniffing incessantly. From there, the researchers noted that previous researcher showed rodents actually sniff immediately after producing vocalizations, which piqued their interest even more.\n\nTech. Entertainment.

It could also lead to revolutionary breakthroughs in understanding other animals. Because if we weren\u2019t aware of this, the researchers say it means we don\u2019t really understand how nanoparticles can be manipulated by sound for complex and complicated uses.\n\nBut, this research may give us a big head start, as it kind of confirms that nature has already solved this problem, which we may be able to piggyback off in different ways. Because it could help confirm that the sense of smell has evolved to help drive more sophisticated processes in the brain. Rats and other rodents have long been at the forefront of scientific works\u2014including being taught how to move things with their minds\u2014and this latest research only helps to further showcase just how vital they are to better understand our world and the various animals that call it home."

During a video call last week, I watched him use some viral GitHub code and a single photo to generate a simplistic deepfake of Elon Musk that maps onto his own face. This digital impersonation was to demonstrate how the startup\u2019s new AI detection tool could work. As Ren masqueraded as Musk on our video chat, still frames from the call were actively sent over to Reality Defender\u2019s custom model for analysis, and the company\u2019s widget on the screen alerted me to the fact that I was likely looking at an AI-generated deepfake and not the real Elon.\n\nSure, I never really thought we were on a video call with Musk, and the demonstration was built specifically to make Reality Defender's early-stage tech look impressive, but the problem is entirely genuine. Real-time video deepfakes are a growing threat for governments, businesses, and individuals. Recently, the chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations mistakenly took a video call with someone pretending to be a Ukrainian official. An international engineering company lost millions of dollars earlier in 2024 when one employee was tricked by a deepfake video call. Also, romance scams targeting everyday individuals have employed similar techniques.\n\n\u201cIt's probably only a matter of months before we're going to start seeing an explosion of deepfake video, face-to-face fraud,\u201d says Ben Colman, CEO and cofounder at Reality Defender. When it comes to video calls, especially in high-stakes situations, seeing should not be believing."

This software handles various tasks, including payment processing, interest calculation, escrow account management, delinquency tracking, and customer communication. The adoption of such software helps lenders maintain accurate loan records, ensure timely payments, and provide efficient customer service, thereby streamlining operations in the financial sector.\n\nThe market\u2019s growth is driven by the increasing demand for streamlined lending operations, escalating adoption of cloud-based solutions, and rising costs associated with credit servicing. Financial institutions are increasingly integrating advanced technologies and software to offer optimized portfolios and enhanced solutions to customers. Cloud-based payment platforms enable quicker payment collection and offer financial institutions the ability to provide fast and efficient services. Additionally, the global trend of adopting new technologies like blockchain, RPA, and AI in the banking sector is shaping the market, as these innovations reduce processing and servicing times.\n\nHowever, the market faces challenges such as competition from open-source loan servicing software. Smaller organizations, such as non-banking financial companies and small lenders, often opt for open-source solutions due to their lower IT budgets, which can impede the growth of paid software solutions.\n\nRequest To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw10064\n\nDespite this challenge, the growing focus on streamlining business operations in the financial sector is expected to foster the continued development and adoption of advanced loan servicing software.\n\nKey regions considered in the global loan servicing software market study include North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Rest of the World. North America is anticipated to dominate the market growth during the forecast period, driven by the presence of major financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America, which process large loan volumes. These institutions utilize loan servicing software to manage their operations efficiently, enabling them to track banking services, access servicing information, and manage borrower payments. Whereas, the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate over the forecast period fueled by rapid growth of the lending industry, increasing loan volumes, and the need for efficient loan management.
