            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) app downloads rose to 1.5 billion in 2024 compared to 800 million reported in 2023, according to a report by SensorTower.\n\nThe report titled \u201cThe State of Mobile 2024,\u2019 revealed that in 2024, apps mentioning AI-related terms in their names, subtitles, or descriptions amassed more than 17 billion downloads globally, an increase from 5 billion downloads in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis accounted for 13 percent of all app downloads that year. Key markets contributing over a billion downloads each included India, the United States, China Mainland, Indonesia, and Brazil,\u201d it said.\n\nIn late 2022, the world witnessed the rise of generative AI applications, driven by the debut of ChatGPT. Since then, interest in these technologies has surged, resulting in growth in in-app purchase (IAP) revenue and downloads.\n\nAccording to SensorTower data, IAP revenue for AI chatbot and AI art generator apps soared from $30 million in 2022 to $455 million in 2023, and nearly $1.3 billion by 2024.\n\nThe report said the United States emerged as the dominant market for generative AI apps in 2024, accounting for 45 percent of global revenue, the United Kingdom (4 percent), Germany (4 percent), Japan (3 percent), and Canada (3 percent) followed, reflecting a strong adoption of AI technology in developed markets.\n\nBrazil ranked as the seventh-largest market for generative AI apps despite not being a top 10 market for overall mobile consumer spending. Conversely, China Mainland lagged, contributing less than 2 percent of IAP revenue for this genre in 2024.\n\nIt said that while AI chatbots remain the most popular subgenre, some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies have launched their own AI chatbots, including Google Gemini, ByteDance\u2019s Doubao, and Microsoft Copilot.\n\n\u201cThis influx of competition spurred rapid growth in the sector, with AI chatbot downloads climbing 119 percent year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 2024. Although AI art generators experienced slower growth, they still achieved 85 million downloads, up 21 percent YoY,\u201d it stated.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT maintained its position as the market leader, commanding 40 percent of global generative AI consumer spend and 23 percent of total downloads in 2024.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile adoption has skyrocketed since its launch, with monthly active users (MAUs) increasing by 500 percent YoY to more than 160 million in Q3 2024.\n\nAmong apps released in the past three years, ChatGPT was the third-fastest to reach 50 million MAUs globally, achieving the milestone just five months after its launch in May 2023, this growth came despite the app\u2019s delayed release on Google Play in July 2023, several months after its iOS debut.\n\n16 different generative AI apps also achieved at least $10 million in IAP revenue in 2024, while 25 surpassed 10 million downloads.\n\nOn the other hand, developers are increasingly incorporating AI features into apps across various categories. From travel to education to social networking, the possibilities for integrating generative AI are vast.\n\n\u201cApp developers have also shown agility, with the number of apps adding AI-related terms to their names or descriptions more than doubling in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n\u201cEven as the growth rate of AI-themed apps slowed in 2024, interest remained robust. Over 3,000 apps introduced AI-related terms in 2024, spanning 15 different categories, including productivity, photo & video, lifestyle, finance, and music,\u201d it said.\n\nShare"

I just think the world is more interesting with magic and love is its own special kind of magic.\"\n\nAn author of 15 books with such titles as \"A Shadow Among the Stars\" and \"Soul Sacrifice,\" Davis will release her newest tale Tuesday via 5 Prince Publishing and Books LLC: \"Demons and Tea Leaves.\"\n\n\"I came up with the idea of a woman accidentally summoning a demon. From there I expanded the idea,\" Davis explained. \"What would the circumstances be that she'd accidentally perform a spell, and what then would the demon do?\"\n\nThis particular story is for readers of sweet romances and fans of the paranormal, Davis said.\n\n\"If you enjoy the movie 'Practical Magic' and the show 'Charmed,' I think you'll enjoy 'Demons and Tea Leaves,'\" she said.\n\nAn educator for 10 years, Davis is a longtime North Idahoan. She grew up in Bonners Ferry, where she graduated from high school, then went to North Idaho College for an associate degree and attended the University of Idaho, where she earned a master's degree in elementary education.\n\n\"I love so many things about living here, aside from the cold dark winters,\" she said.\n\nDavis has been writing since she was a teenager. The first story she published was started when she was 18. She said she always knew she wanted to write.\n\n\"I was a voracious reader growing up and felt like I could do just as good as many of the books I enjoyed, so I gave it a shot,\" she said. \"I published quite a few eBooks in my 20s then took a break from writing for a bit as I had my two boys and came back to it in 2020.\"\n\nShe said her favorite thing about writing is exploring a story that comes into her head as a tiny idea and expanding that idea into a full story for others to enjoy.\n\n\"Any time someone reads one of my books, I hope that it gives them a momentary escape from reality and a trip through a fantastically entertaining story,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis will be signing books at It's a Love Story bookstore, 8927 N. Hess St. Suite A, Hayden, at 4:30 p.m. Feb. 21. Her works can be found locally at the Well-Read Moose, It's a Love Story, Kindred Bookstore and the Coeur d'Alene Public Library, as well as on amazon.com.\n\nInfo: authorcourtneydavis.com"

            "article_content": "Blades in the Dark, a game of espionage and debauchery, of gangs, scoundrels, and paranormal entities, is moving into the late 60s with its latest official supplement, Blades '68. While time is tracked differently in Blades in the Dark \u2013 with the original game set in 847 IE \u2013 we're now entering 968 AC and the rulebook takes some groovy-as-heck cues from real-world '60s graphic design.\n\nCurrently on our best tabletop RPGs list, Blades in the Dark has a huge following. And as much as we didn't expect a '60s sequel, I can certainly see where they're going with it. This is a zippy, engaging TRPG, and one that's sure to work well with revolutionary '60s counter-culture references and, of course, a swingin' aesthetic.\n\nUsing the same core mechanics, and compatible with Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts modules as well, there have been a few changes to the system outlined in the playtest document.\n\nOne of the main changes to note comes in the form of the Gameplay Cycle. This is split into three parts: Crew business, trouble engine, and personal business. Crew business is the quickfire setup of a situation, and the runthrough of the score (which sees players overcoming obstacles, having flashbacks and maybe completing an operation).\n\nPreviously in the later Downtime phase, the payout, heat, harm, and complications come in here, with a moment to debrief before the trouble engine revs up and the GM moves forward faction clocks, generates and updates trouble for the Crew to encounter.\n\n(Image credit: Evil Hat Productions)\n\nBlades in the Dark's original 'Downtime' phase now comes under 'personal business', which forms the second half of the gameplay cycle in Blades '68. In it, players can \"indulge their vice to remove stress, recover harm, work on a long-term project, or achieve other goals.\"\n\nOne of my favorite things is that you can be a Swinger, who handles the complex social landscape with \"audacity, charisma, and panache\". Their list of questions to ask the group, to get a feel for how everyone knows each other, include:\n\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhich one of you went to that big party with me the other night?\n\nWhich one of you is my competition on the dance floor?\n\nWhich one of you comes to me for fashion advice?\n\n(Image credit: Evil Hat Productions)\n\nAs for the lore, a lot has happened since the start of the Unity Era. Still set in Doskvol, the times have changed greatly in 100 years. The Imperial fleet has seen its last successful leviathan hunt lead into \"Dark years of failing lightning barriers, famine, and panic\"; the Age of Consensus had Shattered Isles nations collaborating in a time of \"peace, rationality, and stability through conformity\"; and Imperial troops were sent to invade a separatist city set up in a bastion by Severosi radicals in The Sevrin Invasion.\n\nRight now you can sign up for the Blades '68 playtest materials from Evil Hat Productions, which outlines the full round of changes in a fully playable draft of the game. Just be aware that the final draft could see changes to the system as it currently stands, based on player feedback.\n\nFor more recommendations, why not check out the some solo RPGs, or work your way through the best D&D books."

It is the subject of multiple lawsuits along those lines, including from The New York Times, which claims the company built its model in part by ingesting millions of the newspaper\u2019s stories without permission.\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a congratulations to DeepSeek on X, saying it had developed \u201can impressive model, particularly around what they\u2019re able to deliver for the price.\u201d\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson indicated the White House may get involved in the dispute.\n\n\u201cWe take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump\u2019s AI adviser, David Sacks, told Fox News that he believed DeepSeek did distill from OpenAI, but stopped short of declaring that the White House would take action.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things you\u2019re going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would definitely slow down some of these copycat models.\u201d\n\nBrian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in an email to NBC News that the White House was looking into the broader issue but didn't specifically address OpenAI's distillation accusation.\n\n\u201cAt the President\u2019s direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government are working in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security. As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nWeb client runtime security (WCRS) refers to the security or behavior of the code executed in users' internet browsers during their web interactions. The first part of this article series includes details of why WCRS as a security discipline warrants specific focus in addition to traditional web application security practices. Traditional approaches to web application security have often focused on scanning code for vulnerabilities, as well as scanning and monitoring for security weaknesses from the perspective of the web hosting provider.\n\nThis second article describes the limitations of traditional security solutions in addressing WCRS risk and proposes implementation options for purpose-built security solutions. Specifically, the strengths and limitations of three key traditional application security mechanisms are covered, before proposing certain viable implementation options for addressing WCRS needs. These mechanisms include static analysis, dynamic analysis, and manual code reviews, each offering unique benefits and challenges in the context of web application security.\n\nStatic Application Security Testing\n\nStatic application security testing (SAST)1 involves analyzing source code for vulnerabilities while the application is being developed or analyzing any code changes that are made to an existing application. This is a traditional approach to code scanning that is utilized by many organizations. SAST can catch many vulnerabilities before applications are released into production. Some vendor products generate a report of potential vulnerabilities. Others go a step further, by scanning code while a developer is typing, and highlighting potential problems in the integrated development environment. After reviewing the vulnerability report produced by one of these tools, developers might go through multiple code remediation and re-scanning cycles until a passing scan is achieved. This approach is beneficial for early vulnerability detection, allowing developers to address issues before the code is deployed. Figure 1 summarizes the pros and cons of SAST.\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nHowever, SAST does not account for runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts, which are common in modern web applications. As a result, vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks can go undetected. SAST tools are designed to assess code as it is written, not as it is executed in the varied web application environments, limiting their effectiveness in addressing WCRS threats.\n\nStrengths\u2014SAST analyzes source code for vulnerabilities, offering early detection during the development phase.\n\nLimitations\u2014SAST does not cover runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts. It may also not detect vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks.\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing\n\nDynamic application security testing (DAST)2 involves testing applications in their running state and simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities. This method provides insights into application behavior while under attack and can uncover issues that static analysis might miss. Many organizations supplement their SAST processes with DAST because DAST scans can detect vulnerabilities in the deployed environment, which would not be evident from reviewing application code. Server misconfigurations, weak authentication, and security headers are some examples of vulnerabilities detected by DAST scans. The pros and cons of DAST are depicted in figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 \u2014 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nDAST has its limitations, particularly in detecting vulnerabilities that manifest only in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can evade DAST by activating only under certain conditions that the testing environment does not replicate. Additionally, DAST cannot fully understand and evaluate the behavior of third-party scripts, rendering it less effective against the threats that exploit these external dependencies. Last, DAST scans are detective by nature, offering few preventive capabilities that would protect organizations during supply chain attacks at runtime.\n\nStrengths\u2014DAST tests applications in their running state, simulating real-world attacks.\n\nLimitations\u2014DAST might miss vulnerabilities that only manifest in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can hide from DAST by only executing in specific user contexts, and DAST does not provide real-time protection from unwanted script behavior.\n\nInteractive Application Security Testing\n\nInteractive application security testing (IAST)3 combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations. This method allows for more comprehensive detection of vulnerabilities by observing code execution and interactions from within the application, as opposed to external DAST scanning. It enables organizations to detect issues that may go unnoticed by SAST or DAST, such as vulnerabilities arising from specific application workflows or interactions between components. Figure 3 depicts relevant IAST considerations for organizations.\n\nFigure 3 \u2014 Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) Consideration\n\n\n\nWhile IAST provides deeper insights compared to purely static or dynamic testing, it still faces challenges in WCRS. IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and resource intensive. Moreover, they may not fully capture the behavior of third-party scripts or adequately monitor client-side code that executes in user browsers, limiting their effectiveness in preventing client-side attacks.\n\nStrengths\u2014IAST combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations.\n\nLimitations\u2014IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and may not detect client-side script vulnerabilities introduced by third parties.\n\nTraditional Security Mechanisms are Limited\n\nSAST, DAST, IAST, and other traditional security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are limited by their perspective of application and infrastructure runtime states from a provider\u2019s point of view. They might inspect the observable network traffic between client web browsers and the trusted private hosting environment where much of the web application content might be hosted. However, these tools may overlook unintentional data leaks between client browsers and third-party services, as well as Magecart attacks that could exploit these trusted third-party services. The gaps in coverage of the traditional security tools are illustrated as potential risk in figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 \u2014 WCRS Limitations of Traditional Security Solutions\n\n\n\nThese limitations underscore the need for specialized client-side security solutions. Such specialized solutions should examine runtime states from a client\u2019s perspective and address the unique challenges of securing client-side code.\n\nTechnology Solutions for WCRS\n\nAs traditional application security mechanisms or approaches do not provide necessary safeguards against WCRS risk, organizations may need to consider other options for their WCRS capabilities. This section proposes certain mechanisms, each of which may have distinct approaches and corresponding benefits.\n\nThe web client-side security market has witnessed significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing recognition of the risk associated with third-party scripts and supply chain attacks. This rapidly maturing space features a variety of solutions, each with distinct approaches and benefits.\n\nOrganizations should evaluate each approach carefully before selecting the most suitable options for their specific website contexts.\n\nCDN and Proxy-Based Solutions\n\nMany internet-facing web applications are already deployed behind content delivery networks (CDNs) to protect them from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and improve performance by caching content closer to end users. Given their strategic position in the delivery chain, CDN providers are well-suited to enhance client-side security by examining all resources before they reach client browsers. By intercepting and analyzing web traffic, CDNs can identify and block malicious scripts, ensuring that only safe and verified content is delivered.\n\nCDN and proxy-based solutions offer a transparent layer of security without requiring significant changes to existing infrastructure. This transparency is a major advantage, as it simplifies deployment and reduces the burden on development and operations teams.\n\nThese solutions typically feature a web-based portal that offers near real-time visibility into the resources loaded by clients. Through this portal, customers can monitor scripts and other elements being delivered to end users.\n\nStrengths\u2014 CDN and proxy-based solutions require minimal effort for the initial deployment if monitored web applications are already protected by the CDN solution from DDoS attacks. In such cases, the CDN provider is already able to monitor web traffic, and the client security module is simply enabled by the third-party CDN provider upon purchase. This solution also avoids the introduction of third-party code into web applications, often shortening implementation timelines and avoiding delays due to vetting by other cybersecurity and third-party risk teams within the purchasing organization.\n\nLimitations\u2014Visibility of third-party script behavior is limited to data transmitted via the CDN network and is not always representative of third-party script behavior on customer browsers, particularly once they begin interacting with the web application. Furthermore, this solution is only offered by a limited number of CDN providers. Internally facing applications, including traffic that is not routed through a particular CDN, would require a different approach for client-side protection.\n\nRemote Scanning Solutions\n\nRemote scanning solutions provide an external perspective on the security of web applications by assessing them from outside the organization\u2019s network. These tools are designed to identify vulnerabilities and malicious code that may be present in the client-side scripts and resources delivered to users. By periodically loading and crawling an internet-facing web application, remote scanners can detect and analyze scripts, security headers, and other resources that would be loaded by client browsers while interacting with a monitored web application, offering a simplified view with minimal effort from customers.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of remote scanning is its ease of implementation. Since these tools operate externally, they require minimal configuration and do not require updates to the existing infrastructure or code. Remote scanning can quickly provide a high-level overview of the security posture of web applications, highlighting areas of concern that require further investigation. However, while remote scanning is effective at identifying many common vulnerabilities, it has its limitations. For example, it may struggle to access and analyze content behind authentication barriers, and sophisticated malicious code can sometimes hide from these scans by only activating under specific conditions.\n\nRemote scanning solutions often include a web-based interface that offers detailed reports on the findings. These reports provide insights into the resources that would be loaded by client browsers. Customers can justify the presence of certain scripts, ensuring that they are necessary for enterprise operations while maintaining compliance. Additionally, these tools can notify users of any changes to the scripts or security headers, enabling timely responses to new risk and maintaining the integrity of client-side security measures.\n\nStrengths\u2014Remote scanning solutions are easy to implement and provide a basic, limited view into a monitored web application.\n\nLimitations\u2014Limited visibility and accuracy can lead to potential blind spots, especially when dealing with sophisticated threats. Resources that require user login, or those requiring more complicated actions from users before they are loaded and executed, may be overlooked. Furthermore, this solution offers no protection or remediation capabilities, as it is used for detection only.\n\nVendor Solutions Based on CSP Headers\n\nThe HTTP Content Security Policy (CSP) response header, universally supported by modern web browsers, provides advanced client-side security capabilities. Web applications can instruct client browsers via detailed policies on what resources are necessary parts of a web application and which safe locations they can be loaded from. Web browsers can also be instructed to block or report unexpected behavior.\n\nIn their simpler form, WCRS solutions may leverage a custom CSP header directive that does not directly block any suspicious behavior and simply instructs all client browsers to report what content was loaded in near real time. Dashboards display script inventories and observe script behavior for monitored applications. Many vendor solutions will take this a step further, leveraging proprietary and open-source threat intelligence feeds to alert their customers to any known malicious content and behavior. To further protect their customers, some vendor solutions will suggest more advanced CSPs that could be implemented in \u201cprevent mode\u201d. This mode will automatically block unexpected scripts. However, this option works best for simple web applications managed by technically savvy organizations due to the complexity and operational stability risk.\n\nIntegrating CSP headers requires customers to modify their web applications, which can delay implementation. Despite this, the header directive is transparent in its function and does not necessitate extensive vetting. By providing accurate and timely reporting without the need for more complex vendor-provided script integration, CSP header-based monitoring offers a balanced solution that enhances security while keeping code changes minimal and transparent to customers.\n\nStrengths\u2014CSP headers provide accurate real-time reporting of resources and scripts executed by client browsers. This solution requires minimal changes to the web application code.\n\nLimitations\u2014CSP headers require basic changes to the web application, which may necessitate change control, testing, and approvals. These necessary steps may delay implementation. Moreover, implementation of optional custom CSP policies may only work well for simple web applications, as these policies are often much more complex and can cause operational impact. They can block external resources and other essential web application functionality if they are not explicitly approved ahead of time.\n\nSolutions Based on Custom Vendor-Provided JavaScript\n\nMany WCRS solutions require monitored applications to include custom JavaScript provided by the vendor. This option introduces risk and can extend timelines for approval and vetting. However, despite these challenges, it provides additional granular visibility of script behavior at the data element level and enables dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement.\n\nThis approach allows for the implementation of script behavior policies, which go beyond the detection and reporting of unauthorized script behaviors and actively block unwanted actions in real time. For example, certain scripts can be authorized to access credit card fields and/or perform keystroke logging, while all others are denied from performing such actions. Vendor-provided JavaScript solutions can dynamically adjust policies based on the ongoing evaluation of script behaviors, enabling more proactive and robust client-side security controls.\n\nImplementing CSP headers with custom JavaScript requires significant changes to the web application, necessitating rigorous change control, testing, and approvals. Although preparations for this solution tend to be robust, its ability to provide granular control and advanced security features makes it a compelling choice for organizations that require high levels of WCRS.\n\nStrengths\u2014This solution offers granular real-time visibility and control over client-side resources at the data element level. It also offers dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement, including advanced security measures such as data firewalls.\n\nLimitations\u2014This solution\u2019s granular nature requires slightly more significant changes to web applications, leading to longer timelines for vetting third-party vendor code, approval, and implementation. To this end, vendor JavaScript code must be trusted by all monitored applications, introducing additional supply chain risk.\n\nVendor Solution Summary\n\nThere are several options available for organizations looking to gain better insights and control over WCRS, depending on organizational security needs. These options\n\nFigure 5 \u2014 Web Client Runtime Security Integration Options\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOrganizations may consider the pros and cons of each of the above options before selecting solutions for their WCRS objectives. It may be the case that a single solution may not suit every website and organization, given the likely differences in the criticality of the business functions supported by the websites and the sensitivity of the information processed.\n\nThe next and final article (part 3) in this series will cover certain guidelines that organizations may find useful in operationalizing their WCRS programs.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 OWASP, Static Application Security Testing (SAST)\n\n2 OWASP, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\n\n3 OWASP, Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)\n\nSergei Vasilevsky, CISSP\n\nIs the founder and president of ILIAM Consulting.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

            "article_content": "OVER the last four centuries, the physical sciences have undergone a metamorphosis marked by breath-taking discoveries and the evolution of sophisticated the\u00ad\u00ad\u00adories about the nature of reality. From Isaac Newton\u2019s ground-breaking work on matter and motion, to Albert Einstein\u2019s revolutionary ideas about energy and space-time, and finally to David Bohm\u2019s hypothesis linking quantum mechanics to consciousness, each era has expanded humanity\u2019s understanding of the universe. This transition paves the way for better understanding of the interface between science and spirituality.\n\nThe groundwork for classical mechanics was laid by Sir Isaac Newton. His matter hy\u00ad\u00adpothesis postulated that the universe was composed of indivisible discrete particles called atoms, governed by invariable laws of motion and gravity. Newton\u2019s landmark work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathe\u00admatica, integrated the motion and gravitation laws into a collected framework. He provided a predictable and perceptible understanding of natural phenomena.\n\nFor example, his equations explained how stellar bodies move in elliptical orbits. Newton\u2019s reductionist ideas formulated matter as dormant and passive, subject only to external forces. While Newton\u2019s ideology successfully elaborated macroscopic phenomena, questions about the nature of light, electromagnetic waves, and the behaviour of matter at exceedingly small scales remained unanswered.\n\nAdvances in applied physics and the discovery of phenomena such as radioactivity exposed substantial gaps in Newtonian mechanics by the early 20th century. These challenges were consummated in the innovative work of Albert Einstein, who radically reshaped humanity\u2019s understanding of energy, matter, and space-time. Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity introduced the famous equation, e=mc2. This equation smashed the Newtonian assumption of matter as inert and invariable, showing that matter is a concentrated form of energy instead. His general theory of relativity further revisited gravity as the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.\n\nThe boundaries between physics, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid.\n\nEinstein\u2019s ideas replaced the deterministic framework of Newton with a relativistic model, where time and space were no longer considered absolute but rather relative to the observer. This drastic change laid the groundwork for innovations such as GPS technology and nuclear energy.\n\nDavid Bohm introduced a radical outlook that sought to desegregate the perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics with broader inquiries about reality and consciousness in the mid-20th century. Influenced by Eastern philosophy and quantum physics, Bohm hypothesised that the universe is interconnected, operating as a holistic system at all levels. His implicate order theory suggested that the visible, tactile universe (the explicate order) emanates from an elementary, enwrapped reality (the implicate order). This idea addressed the ability of particles to exhibit wave-particle duality and distant interactions, where particles influence each other expeditiously across gigantic distances.\n\nBohm\u2019s work outstretched beyond physics into the domain of consciousness, which is synonymous with awareness of God. Bohm\u2019s implicate order theory explains the mind-matter connection, suggesting that consciousness plays a role in orchestrating reality thus influencing interdisciplinary research in the realms of neurosciences, philosophy, and spirituality. Bohm\u2019s approach signifies an important shift from reductionism to a more inclusive understanding of the universe and humanity. The science that was repulsive to an idea of religious belief thus began to embrace religious ideas culminating with the discovery of the Higgs boson or \u2018God particle\u2019, completing the stan\u00ad\u00ad-dard model of particle physics. This evolution is illustrated in the Quran as: Allah \u201cbuilt the universe with great might, and We are certainly expanding it\u201d (51:47).\n\nThe progress of physical science reflects humanity\u2019s ongoing desire to understand the true nature of reality. After these step-wise calculations, we are now beginning to realise that the boundaries between physics, philosophy, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid and not as rigid as once thought. Each archetype has not only transfigured our understanding of the physical universe but also reshaped our scientific, philosophical, and sociocultural viewpoints.\n\nThe likes of Newton, Einstein and Bohm remind us that the pursuit of knowledge is an unending journey, challenging us to expand our horizons. As we advance from the early 17th-century concept of the nonexistence of God in science towards more recent awareness of consciousness, these ideas continue to evolve into new lines of inquiry thus paving the way to connect science with the ultimate Creator of the universe.\n\nThe writer is an assistant professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine.\n\nX: @mohsinfareed\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025"

            "article_content": "Kore.ai unveils no-code platform for creating and deploying knowledge-based agentic AI\n\nKore.ai, a global leader in enterprise AI, is debuting AI for Process, a no-code, agentic AI platform designed to streamline knowledge-intensive, complex business processes. With AI for Process, enterprises can quickly build, deploy, and manage custom AI agents, or Agentic Apps at scale, that can understand context, make complex decisions, and more.\n\nAutonomous AI agents have struggled to implement its value in highly intricate operations and do so at scale, according to Kore.ai. AI for Process aims to rectify this challenge, transforming rules-based process automation to intelligent process orchestration.\n\n\"Traditional enterprise process automation was limited by rigid, rule-based systems lacking any autonomy,\" said Raj Koneru, CEO and founder of Kore.ai. \"With the advent of advanced AI models capable of evaluation and reasoning, we\u2019re ushering in a new era where intelligent AI agents can independently manage business processes, reducing over-reliance on human support. AI for Process enables enterprises to design scalable, reliable Agentic Apps that redefine efficiency while elevating humans into more strategic, supervisory roles.\"\n\nThrough the help of proprietary agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), AI for Process combines advanced retrieval with intelligent agent orchestration to deliver highly accurate, contextual AI agent technology. Paired with a no-code, highly intuitive visual workflow designer that comes with over 65 pre-built prompt templates, enterprises can achieve the promises of agentic AI with ease.\n\nSpecialized agents work together to intelligently execute a variety of knowledge-based tasks. For example, the Orchestrator Agent coordinates workflows while Reasoning Agents handle complex decision-making; the Task Agents automate workflows, Knowledge Agents process enterprise information, and API Agents manage system integrations.\n\nEach agent is centralized under an advanced Agent Evaluation Framework, ensuring that agents are continuously assessed and analyzed for utmost efficiency and alignment. Furthermore, Kore.ai\u2019s human-in-the-loop strategy incorporates human touchpoints within automated workflows, enabling asynchronous human actions, approvals, and form inputs.\n\nAdditionally, AI for Process seamlessly integrates with commercial and open source large language models (LLMs), as well as major cloud providers\u2014including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud\u2014eliminating vendor lock-in. Kore.ai\u2019s solution offers pre-built connectors for enterprise data sources and APIs and delivers real-time data synchronization across systems.\n\nAs far as security and governance, AI for Process features data anonymization, protection against prompt injection attacks, custom content filters, and audit trails, as well as centralized governance controls for managing role-based access and AI guardrails.\n\n\u201cThe future of enterprise operations lies in AI agents collaborating to manage and optimize processes under human supervision,\u201d said Prasanna Arikala, CTO and head of products at Kore.ai. \u201cThese agents will operate autonomously, seamlessly discovering and working with each other. Achieving this vision requires a robust AI agent platform integrating autonomous agents, advanced knowledge retrieval, and intelligent orchestration. With AI for Process, we\u2019re delivering these future-ready capabilities today.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about AI for Process, please visit https://kore.ai/.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

            "article_content": "Top of the Champions League table and into the last 16 with the most money banked.\n\nThis was the perfect return to Europe\u2019s elite competition for Liverpool, setting up Arne Slot\u2019s side for a crack at lifting the trophy for a seventh time and significantly boosting the club\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nAfter recording seven wins out of eight games, Liverpool are closing in on at least \u20ac100million (\u00a383.8m; $104m) in Champions League prize money alone, with a further \u20ac56.5m still to play for. Factor in the additional matchday revenue that big fixtures at Anfield bring \u2014 the club earn between \u00a33m and \u00a34m for each home game, with sellout crowds as good as guaranteed \u2014 and the importance of being back in Europe\u2019s premier competition after a year away becomes clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlot will rightly focus on his side\u2019s positive on-field performances, which included memorable victories against Real Madrid, Milan and Bayer Leverkusen, but the influx of such a large amount of cash will fuel the angst among the fans who want to see greater investment from Fenway Sports Group (FSG, the club\u2019s owner).\n\nSeeing that money flow in certainly makes it harder for FSG to stick so resolutely to its careful approach to spending. Such prudence could easily be justified last season, when Liverpool were playing in the Europa League while building the new Anfield Road End (which took capacity to over 60,000), but less so now.\n\nYet history suggests that more money coming into the club does not always equate to a big investment in the squad. FSG places sustainability at the heart of its operations and prefers to wait for the right player to become available, rather than being lured into overspending. An example came last summer with Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi: he was Liverpool's top transfer target but, when that deal could not be done, they opted not to go for an alternative in his defensive midfield position.\n\nThere is no sign it will stretch the club beyond its means anytime soon, despite seeing the value of its asset multiply considerably since its \u00a3300m takeover in 2010.\n\nLiverpool were the lowest spenders in last summer's transfer window, signing only Federico Chiesa for a deal worth up to \u00a312.5m. A \u00a329m deal for goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was also agreed, although he stayed at Valencia until the end of this season, and with four days of the current transfer window remaining, Liverpool are yet to do any business.\n\nFederico Chiesa was Liverpool's only summer arrival (Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cPeople haven\u2019t seen us do a lot in the transfer window but we\u2019re happy with the squad,\" Slot told the BBC this week. \"In the background, we are working on strengthening the squad for the summer. That would mean that for the upcoming years, we will be able to challenge for every trophy we are playing for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey to the future are also the three soon-to-be out-of-contract players \u2014 Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk \u2014 available to discuss free moves away this summer when their deals expire.\n\nSalah, Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk have been offered extensions but are yet to agree terms. Tension among the Anfield crowd continues to grow, with a recent banner reading, \u201cNow give Mo his dough,\u201d referencing the importance of FSG securing Salah beyond this season.\n\nOf course such negotiations aren\u2019t that simple. Neither is it as straightforward to suggest that now Liverpool are doing well in the Champions League again, they should break from a structure that, despite criticism, has served them well over the years.\n\nThere is still a little catching up to do, too. Liverpool dropped a place in the annual Deloitte Football Money League this year as the impact of no Champions League football last season was laid bare.\n\nAccording to the figures, which are expected to be backed up when the club's official accounts are released, total revenue was up to around \u20ac714m, an increase on the previous season, which had stood at \u00a3594m. Much of that was down to a \u20ac45m increase in commercial revenue and a \u20ac29m boost to matchday revenue, helped by the opening of the new Anfield Road Stand.\n\nA \u20ac42m drop in broadcast revenue, however, highlighted the missed opportunity in the Champions League and allowed Arsenal to leapfrog Liverpool in the standings.\n\nThat Liverpool are back in the competition and the favourites to win it, is a good start to the recovery. Never before has it been more important to be in the competition than now with the prize pot bubbling away.\n\nAnfield makes huge sums for every home game (Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nA 22 per cent increase in the money distributed from UEFA this year means that if Liverpool lift the trophy in May they can expect to earn around \u20ac160m. First they will have to progress through the last-16 against either Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest. But even finishing as a runner-up or semi-finalist may be enough to record Liverpool's most profitable season in Europe, largely because of their early form and history in the competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs The Athletic's Phil Buckingham explained in more detail, the prize pot is split in three ways: first through an equal share (\u20ac18.62m for each club), then performance-related extras before a third part \u2014 a new 'value pillar' shaped by market pools and coefficients \u2014 completes the total.\n\nWe already know what some of these figures are in advance so they can be totted up along the way. Each win is worth \u20ac2.1m, with a draw bringing \u20ac700,000, then additional payments are made for the final league position, qualifying for the last 16 (\u20ac11m), the quarter-finals (\u20ac12.5m), the semi-finals (\u20ac15m) and the final (\u20ac18.5m). The winners also get \u20ac6.5m, as well as an additional \u20ac4m for featuring in the following season's European Super Cup.\n\nLiverpool's total for performance payments currently stands at almost \u20ac40m. The value pillar is the more complex of the three and relates to the size of each club\u2019s domestic TV deal and historical performances in Europe. Liverpool were among the highest and are expected to bring in around \u20ac40million, which, added to their on-field performance, represents a good start to 2025.\n\nThe club's accountants will be thrilled, and Slot himself does not seem to be agitating for the kind of spending that some of his Premier League rivals are indulging in.\n\nBut given the sums pouring in, another quiet summer would lead to more awkward questions being asked of FSG and its long-term ambitions.\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

Whether DeepSeek fundamentally upends those plans remains to be seen. But at a bare minimum, it has shaken investors who have poured money into OpenAI, a company that reportedly believes it won't turn a profit until the end of the decade.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman concedes that the DeepSeek R1 model is \"impressive,\" but the company is taking steps to protect its models (both language and business); OpenAI told the Financial Times and other outlets that it believed DeepSeek had used output from OpenAI's models to train the R1 model, a method known as \"distillation.\" Using OpenAI's models to train a model that will compete with OpenAI's models is a violation of the company's terms of service.\n\n\"We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the US government to protect the most capable models being built here,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told Ars.\n\nSo taking data without permission is bad, now?\n\nI'm not here to say whether the R1 model is the product of distillation. What I can say is that it's a little rich for OpenAI to suddenly be so very publicly concerned about the sanctity of proprietary data."

            "article_content": "The rapid adoption of digital platforms for financial transactions has transformed how people manage their finances. However, this convenience comes with heightened cybersecurity risks, as cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in traditional systems. Addressing these challenges, the study titled \"Secure Internet Financial Transactions: A Framework Integrating Multi-Factor Authentication and Machine Learning\" by Alsharif Hasan Mohamad Aburbeian and Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez-Veiga, published in AI 2024, proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-factor authentication (MFA) with machine learning (ML). This research provides a dynamic and user-friendly system designed to enhance security while maintaining a seamless user experience.\n\nWhy traditional systems fall short?\n\nTraditional authentication methods, such as single-factor passwords, have proven inadequate in combating sophisticated cyber threats like phishing, brute force attacks, and social engineering. While two-factor authentication (2FA) has added a layer of security by incorporating OTPs or tokens, it remains vulnerable to interception and can be cumbersome for users. Static MFA systems often fail to adapt to the evolving nature of cyber risks, leaving gaps in security protocols.\n\nThe proposed framework addresses these limitations by embedding machine learning into the authentication process. This integration allows for dynamic risk assessment and adaptive responses, reducing the complexity for legitimate users while strengthening safeguards against fraudulent activities. Such a framework not only ensures security but also balances usability, a critical factor in today\u2019s digital economy.\n\nThe framework consists of two distinct layers designed to secure online financial transactions on platforms such as banking apps and e-commerce websites. The first layer focuses on traditional MFA methods, while the second introduces an advanced ML component to enhance fraud detection.\n\nThe first layer employs a combination of username-password credentials and OTPs sent via SMS or email. These elements form the initial defense, ensuring unauthorized access is filtered out. The second layer leverages a supervised machine learning model that analyzes transaction data to detect anomalies indicative of fraud. If the system identifies a suspicious transaction, it escalates the authentication process by requiring facial recognition. This dual-layered approach ensures that users face minimal disruptions while fraudulent activities are promptly intercepted.\n\nThe framework\u2019s adaptive nature is its standout feature, offering a seamless experience for legitimate users and robust defenses against threats. Unlike traditional static MFA systems, this model evolves based on the behavior of both users and attackers, providing a dynamic and secure environment.\n\nMachine Learning: The core of fraud detection\n\nMachine learning plays a pivotal role in the framework by analyzing transaction data and identifying patterns associated with fraudulent behavior. The study utilized a publicly available credit card fraud dataset, addressing the inherent class imbalance using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to ensure accurate results.\n\nFour machine learning algorithms were evaluated: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and naive Bayes. Among these, logistic regression emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 97.938% and a precision of 99%. The model\u2019s ability to accurately classify legitimate and fraudulent transactions makes it the cornerstone of the framework\u2019s fraud detection mechanism.\n\nThe ML model acts as an embedded layer of security within the framework. It monitors real-time transaction data and identifies anomalies indicative of fraud. When a transaction is flagged, the system requires the user to undergo facial recognition verification, providing an additional layer of security without imposing unnecessary burdens on legitimate users.\n\nUser-centric design: Balancing security and simplicity\n\nThe authors emphasized usability as a core principle in designing the framework. They developed an Android-based e-commerce application to demonstrate how the system functions. The application features an intuitive interface that guides users through the authentication process, ensuring a seamless and secure experience.\n\nUsers begin by signing in with a username and password or biometrics, such as a fingerprint. Once they complete a purchase, an OTP verification step is triggered to confirm their identity before payment details are entered. If the ML model detects potential fraud, the user is prompted to complete a facial recognition step. This layered approach ensures that security measures are implemented only when necessary, reducing user friction and enhancing trust in the system.\n\nBy integrating multiple security layers with a user-friendly design, the framework addresses common criticisms of traditional MFA systems being overly complex. It demonstrates how advanced technologies like ML can simplify processes without compromising security.\n\nMeasuring the framework\u2019s effectiveness\n\nThe framework demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting and preventing fraudulent activities. Logistic regression was identified as the most effective algorithm, with an accuracy of 97.938%, a precision of 99%, and a recall rate of 97%. These metrics highlight the model\u2019s reliability in identifying fraudulent transactions while maintaining a low rate of false positives.\n\nThe researchers also evaluated the framework using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, where logistic regression achieved an AUC (Area Under Curve) score of 0.98. This indicates the model\u2019s near-perfect ability to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The integration of ML within the MFA framework significantly enhances security without imposing undue complexity on users.\n\nThe Android application further validated the framework\u2019s usability, showcasing a streamlined process from user registration to transaction completion. The design balances security with ease of use, ensuring that users can navigate the system confidently.\n\nChallenges and future directions\n\nWhile the framework shows great promise, it is not without challenges. Ensuring data privacy and security remains a top priority, especially given the sensitive nature of financial transactions. The study also highlights potential user resistance to MFA systems perceived as overly complicated. Addressing these concerns through intuitive design and efficient workflows will be crucial for widespread adoption.\n\nAnother challenge lies in the technical requirements for deploying ML models in real-time. Organizations must invest in infrastructure capable of handling large-scale data processing and analysis. Future research should focus on incorporating additional biometric factors, such as voice recognition, and expanding the dataset diversity to improve the system\u2019s adaptability and resilience."

In a month, they have routed Congo\u2019s underequipped army several times and caused more than half a million people to flee. On Monday, they captured Goma, a major Congolese city along the Rwandan border. (They grabbed it once before, in 2012.)\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to Goma residents. They\u2019ve been hiding in their houses for the past week without electricity or running water. Gunfire, and occasionally bombs, explode around them. Some of them took in families who had fled from camps and villages outside the city. But plenty of those displaced people arrived in Goma knowing nobody.\n\nWhy are the rebels, known as M23, grabbing parts of eastern Congo? In their telling, they\u2019re protecting ethnic Tutsis, the minority group massacred in a 1994 genocide, some of whom also live in Congo. But experts say the real reason is Congo\u2019s rare minerals, which power our phones and devices. Congo\u2019s mines are making the rebels \u2014 and their patrons in Rwanda \u2014 rich."

Though the stock has been in the red for five days, the majority of losses were incurred in the previous session when it was locked in the 20 percent lower circuit.\n\nAt 10.21 am, shares of Whirlpool of India were trading at Rs 1,183.05 on the NSE. The steep fall in today's session was further intensified by heavy trading volumes. As much as 10 lakh shares of the company changed hands on the exchanges thus far, already 10 times the one-month daily traded average of one lakh shares.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe stock was hammered in the last session after Whirlpool India's holding company, Whirlpool Corporation announced its intention to trim down its stake in the Indian unit to about 20 percent by mid to late 2025. The parent entity plans to execute the stake reduction through one or more open market transactions, which will see it ownership come down from the current 51 percent.\n\nFollow our market blog to catch all the live action\n\nThis development came nearly a year after the company sold around 24 percent of its stake in the Indian unit for approximately $468 million earlier last year as part of efforts to reduce debt.\n\nAt the time, Whirlpool Corp CEO Marc Bitzer told CNBC that the decision to sell the stake was driven by Whirlpool India\u2019s high valuation, which stood at an earnings multiple of 50 times. \u201cWe are not leaving India,\u201d he has emphasised. \u201cWe believe in India for the long term\u2026 but if we have a business trading at 50 times multiple, and your own company trades a lot lower, it\u2019s basically an asset arbitrage,\u201d Bitzer explained.\n\nWhirlpool Corp anticipates net cash proceeds of $550-600 million from the transaction. Reports suggest that the sell-down will help optimize capital allocation, enabling Whirlpool to focus on core operations while retaining significant interest in the Indian market. This move aligns with the parent company's strategy to strengthen its balance sheet and maximize shareholder returns.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "article_content": "Olaf Scholz's re-election hopes are. being hit by the country's struggling economy.\n\nShares in Germany's largest lender plunged by 6%, after the bank announced a massive drop in profits. Deutsche Bank's profits plummeted by an astonishing 92%, as Germany's economy struggled. Profits attributable to shareholders dropped to \u20ac106 million (\u00a389m) in the final three months of 2024, down from \u20ac1.26 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. The earnings crash is likely to lead to massive redundancies, which could affect the bank's UK employees. Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief executive, said: \"Our clear ambition is to operate the bank with a lower headcount.\n\nDeutsche Bank's profits plunged by over 90&\n\n\"We plan to actively reduce management layers and roles.\u201d More than 90,000 people work for the banking giant in offices worldwide, including 7,000 in the UK. This is not the first time the bank's management has had to wield the axe after disappointing financial performance. Last February, Deutsche Bank announced plans to slash staff numbers by 3,500 worldwide in a major shakeup.\n\nMr Sewig said mortgages and \u201cmiddle-market lending\u201d in Germany were pulling down the wider business. \u201cThe real challenge which we are working on is in retail Germany,\" he added. The bank's struggles are symptomatic of a greater malaise in the German economy, which has contracted for a second year. German industry is grappling with higher energy prices in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the same its car industry , which employs around 780,000 workers and contribute 5% to GDP, is facing intense pressure from Chineses rivals.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "A recent study conducted by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay analyzed the financial impact of floods and cyclones across 25 states in India. The study, which covers a span of 23 years (1995\u20132018), highlights how the damage caused by these natural disasters severely affects the states\u2019 budgets on an annual basis. The research also offers solutions for better disaster preparedness and economic protection, providing a roadmap to help mitigate the financial repercussions of such crises.\n\nPublished in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, the study titled, \u2018The impact of floods and cyclones on fiscal arrangements in India: An empirical investigation at the sub-national level\u2019 is conducted by Nandini Suresh,a research scholar with the Center for Climate Studies, IIT Bombay, Professor Trupti Mishra, and Professor D. Parthasarathy of IIT Bombay.\n\nAlso Read | Natural disasters caused 2.5 million internal displacements in India in 2022, report says\n\nTraditionally, disaster response funding relies on estimating the cost of damages based on evaluating economic losses, the number of deaths, and the number of people affected. \u201cThese evaluations are often inconsistent and biased,\u201c Ms. Suresh said. \u201cWe relied on data from weather and geographic sources [IBTrACS and the India Meteorological Department] to accurately measure cyclone strength [using wind speeds] and flood severity [based on unusual rainfall],\u201d she explained.\n\nBy combining this information, the researchers created a Disaster Intensity Index (DII), ensuring all types of disasters are treated fairly. This method avoids inconsistencies and biases and gives a clearer picture of disaster impacts, especially for floods and cyclones, which caused 80% of disaster-related losses in India during the study period.\n\nThe study uses a statistical model called panel Vector Auto Regression (VAR) to examine how revenue and expenditure affect each other from one year to the next few years. The model allows accounting for differences between states and ensures that past economic conditions do not unfairly influence disaster severity measurements, giving a reliable way to study the financial impacts of disasters.\n\nAlso Read | Wanted: a strategy to turn climate research into disaster management\n\nThe findings from the study show that disasters put a heavy financial burden on the affected States by increasing their expenditure while also reducing their revenue. As a result, the States allocate substantial funds for immediate relief efforts such as evacuation, medical aid, food, and shelter. The government also invests in rebuilding essential infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and homes. As agriculture, trade, and business operations are frequently disrupted by these disasters, tax collection and income from these sectors also decline.\n\nThe study highlights a cycle in which increased expenditures and falling revenues lead to significant budget deficits.\n\nMs. Mishra said, \u201cHowever, the DII shows that disasters impact States differently. Less disaster-prone States like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which experience droughts and occasional floods, can handle relief with their own resources and suffer less financial damage. The disaster intensity is not high enough to affect people\u2019s income or production; hence, there is no decrease in tax or non-tax revenues. On the other hand, disaster-prone coastal States like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal, which frequently experience cyclones and floods, have higher recovery expenses and higher revenue losses. As a result, they often need to rely on external funding like loans, increasing state debt and making it difficult to fund other development projects.\u201d\n\nThe assistance offered by the National and State Disaster Response Funds (NDRF and SDRF) could be optimised for improved efficiency and faster disbursal. \u201cCertain regulations, such as the 25% cap on SDRF allocations for relief operations and some procedural requirements, may create hurdles in utilising these funds in a timely manner. By simplifying these processes, there may be an opportunity to enhance the overall impact of disaster relief initiatives,\u201d Mr. Parthasarathy said.\n\nThe study emphasises the need for proactive disaster risk financing mechanisms such as resilience bonds, disaster insurance, and catastrophe bonds.\n\nResilience bonds encourage investments in disaster prevention projects and offer incentives for reducing the effects of disasters. Disaster insurance supports individuals, companies, or governments in recovering from losses brought on by natural disasters. Catastrophe bonds allow governments or organisations to shift disaster risk to investors who receive interest unless a disaster occurs. \u201cThese provide quick funds during emergencies and reduce the need to take external loans after disasters,\u201d Ms. Nandini said.\n\nOpinion | The lapses in the disaster management Bill\n\nHowever, implementing such measures in India is challenging due to a lack of awareness and understanding among stakeholders, including governments and the public, about the benefits of such instruments, she added. The other key challenges include the high cost of disaster insurance premiums and a lack of a clear financial and legal framework for issuing resilience bonds or incorporating them into state budgets.\n\nPublic-private partnerships are also essential for building a climate-resilient economy. Governments can offer tax incentives for businesses to invest in climate resilience infrastructure and enforce sustainability regulations.\n\nDiverting funds from other projects is a usual way for governments to handle disasters while staying within budget. However, it is difficult to move money from fixed expenses like debt payments, salaries, or pensions as these take up most of the budget and are already set by law. Governments need flexible budgets, backup plans, and quick ways to adjust spending based on what is required so that they can quickly reallocate funds during emergencies.\n\nOpinion | India\u2019s disaster management story as a work in progress\n\n\u201cThe states need to invest in early warning systems, cyclone shelters, and resilient infrastructure and promote sustainable land use that can minimise the economic impact of climate change and lower the long-term costs of dealing with disasters. Many states have already made progress: Tamil Nadu has installed advanced cyclone monitoring systems, Kerala has adopted climate-adaptive urban planning, and Odisha and many others have introduced budget tracking for climate-related spending,\u201d Ms. Nandini said.\n\nWith climate change driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of disasters, the researchers warned that Indian states will face even greater financial challenges in the future. However, by adopting the recommended measures, they believe India can mitigate long-term financial risks, protect lives and infrastructure, and work toward building a stronger, more sustainable future."

            "article_content": "In this Pharmaceutical Executive video interview, Shakthi Kumar, Chief Strategy and Business Officer, EDETEK, Inc. further explores the company's launch of R&D Cloud, emphasizing the platform's open API access, extensive library of pre-built connectors for various data sources, and real-time data and workflow capabilities.\n\nHe highlights key differentiators including the breadth and depth of integrated capabilities (covering the entire clinical trial lifecycle), robust workflow and event management, multi-SSO integration, and a state-of-the-art cloud architecture.\n\nFuture development plans include incorporating AI, expanding connectors, and specializing in additional therapeutic areas. Ultimately, the R&D Cloud aims to provide cost reduction, improved business outcomes (faster trials, real-time insights), and enhanced data quality and compliance for clients.\n\nA transcription of the conversation is available below.\n\nThe press release emphasizes the R&D Cloud's flexibility and ability to be customized. Can you elaborate on how clients can tailor their R&D Cloud environment to their specific needs and the level of control they have over the selection and integration of third-party software?\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving pharmaceutical landscape, the shift from one size fits all products and restrictive platforms to more collaborative ecosystems is truly transmitted, and many of our clients also emphasize the need for best-in-class collaboration and synergistic integration of different capabilities. At EDETEK, we've recognized this through our R&D Cloud, and it's built on two of our flagship platforms. It's eClinical for clinical trial design, execution and management and CONFORM\u2122, which is our clinical data management, aggregation, standardization and regulatory submission.\n\nClients have full flexibility in terms of selecting the capabilities they desire with either of our two platforms or with third-party software and edit tag provides the data integration and the plumbing, if you may, across the entire ecosystem, and that combined with our multi SSO integration and events driven system orchestration truly provides a very seamless collaboration and workflow, both data and human, across both internal external stakeholders, which we believe is the flexibility that the industry desires right now, and we're very excited about it.\n\nHow does the R&D Cloud address potential integration challenges and ensure seamless data flow and interoperability between different software components, both within the EDETEK ecosystem and with third-party solutions?\n\nOur R&D Cloud ecosystem is actually designed on four principles, and this is all keeping in mind the seamless data flow, the interoperability and the seamless orchestration that's desired. The first one is we make it easy for life sciences companies to integrate with various clinical sources. So how do we do this? We do this by providing an extensive library of ready to use connectors. In fact, we have over 80 different data sources that our entire R&D Cloud ecosystem right now is prebuilt, and this includes major EDC systems, central labs, imaging, PV, safety systems and various other clinical sources. All of this is facilitated through our data integration gateway, right so this makes integration much easier. It's prebuilt, and it's also very extensible.\n\nThe second one is the data and the human workflow. All of this is in real time. One is the challenges of getting data, but then the question becomes, what do you do with the data? So that has to do with collaboration and workflow, and we provide that in near real time. Our event and Collaboration Hub facilitates that particular functionality.\n\nThe third one is we provide public open API access. This is for integration and extension of our capabilities. Because, you know, when life sciences companies want to build their R&D environments, they want to build they want to tailor it, but they can also expand it, you know, working with other different partners, right? And so, the public open API access is a very important component.\n\nThe fourth one is extremely important. We call it any data, any source, any format. Our R&D Cloud provides a semantic level standardization of data, and the clients get the flexibility to customize that data models. They customize their structures with zero programming. It's all driven by metadata. And we believe that these design principles, along with a whole bunch of others, actually provides that flexibility for seamless data integration, for seamless, you know, workflow orchestration and truly building an ecosystem for our clients.\n\nWhat are the key differentiators of the EDETEK R&D Cloud compared to existing cloud-based clinical trial solutions offered by other companies in the market?\n\nWe have many key differentiators, but I'll highlight a few. The first is the breadth and depth of our capabilities I talked earlier about our two flagship platforms. Our R&D Cloud comes prebuilt with the entire suite of products for clinic, clinical trial design, execution and management, so systems like CTMS, ETMF, electronic patient reported outcomes, randomization and trial supply management, eConsent and so on. Our R&D Cloud comes prebuilt with these capabilities for clinical trial design and execution.\n\nOnce you collect the data, you also need the clinical data management and analytics capabilities that's still delivered through conform. We provide pretty much near time data collection, comprehensive data cleansing, standardization, automated, regulatory, data set generation and sophisticated visualization. And these are kind of like provides the execution part of it, and then what you really do with the data, right and the third level, which we're really excited about is because, you know, it's not just the technology our clients are looking for. They're also looking for domain specialization.\n\nWe have launched therapeutic area accelerators. For instance, a couple of months ago, we released ONCO+, which is a clinical trial accelerator just for oncology trials. And so, if you really look at it, it's not only the breadth, but also the depth and the specialization. So that's the first differentiator of the platform.\n\nThe second one, which we truly believe provides a very robust set of workflow and collaboration, is that the R&D Cloud. When you actually start building the ecosystems, you have different systems. You have different integration requirements. You have both workflow management and so on. We have an extensive set of capabilities for managing the event and the workflow within the R&D so what happens when a patient is enrolled in a particular site, you know, does it need to trigger off other events in the ecosystem, or when you collect the data, what kind of events does the R&D Cloud need to drive? And so, the event and collaboration workflow is a true differentiator and how it is actually built, because it can not only orchestrate events within our own product suite, but it can also do so for other third-party ones, right? The multi SSO integration extremely important security. Most major pharmaceutical companies, the clinical trials are running globally, and so you need to have the ability to provide that multi SSO integration across different regions, different types of user classes and groups and so on. So that actually comes, you know, pretty prebuilt within the R&D Cloud. So that is the second differentiator.\n\nThe third one is the R&D cloud is built on a state-of-the-art cloud architecture, and so there is no tying down the client to a specific environment. It's all there in cloud. I provide scalability, it provides security, reliability, speed of innovation and as well as compliance. So that's we believe makes it easier to incrementally layer our R&D Cloud into existing operating environments. And the fourth one is we provide a very intuitive, interactive visual platform. And the rule that we use is, you know, a user should be able to perform a particular function within two clicks within the entire system. We have taken care through human interface engineering that you know it is easy to use across both you know, specialized users as well as people that you know are using it for review and so on and so forth. So, we do believe that all these differentiators, along with some of the other ones will truly differentiate R&D Cloud today.\n\nAre there future development plans for the R&D Cloud ecosystem?\n\nWe have very ambitious development plans for the R&D Cloud ecosystem. We continue to invest in a number of areas, and you know, I can probably highlight a few. We are incorporating advanced, of course, artificial intelligence capabilities within the RNA cloud, specifically agentic AI and machine learning technologies to drive better insights and decision making for our clients. So that's something that's ongoing.\n\nThe second one is we are expanding the list of upstream and downstream connectors. This is to make it easy to integrate our R&D Cloud, with other third-party software, and we expect to continue to partner with others. For us partnership is a key tenet of what we want to do, so we will continue to do that. And we will double down and specialize in other therapeutic areas as well. I talked about on cop loss, but next in the line, we're working on CNS and that immunology. So, I think we do believe that that provides, you know, significant benefits to the industry, you know, getting much needed therapies faster to patients. And so those are some of the areas we're looking at right now.\n\nHow does the R&D Cloud translate into tangible benefits for EDETEK's clients?\n\nTangibility comes in three different ways. The first one is the best metric for tangibility is cost reduction, so they can incrementally layer our R&D Cloud offering in. To existing operational environments where there are gaps to really build an ecosystem. So, there is no need to replace an expensive, lift and shift of their existing environments, as well as costly integrations, because our on the cloud already comes prebuilt with over 80 different integrations with major software, so cost reduction is one.\n\nThe second one is in terms of business outcomes. We do believe it has significantly helped our clients to improve the speed and efficiency of clinical trial execution. Miranda, just to give you an overview today, our platform is used by over 100 Life Sciences organizations. We have our conform platform. And eClinical platforms have managed over 3 billion data points, including many, many mega trials. In terms of business outcomes, we're very confident in driving faster study start up, as well as real time data insights and accelerated regulatory submissions, right? So that's kind of driving business outcomes. Is a key benefit to our clients.\n\nThe third one is improved data quality and compliance. The platform, we have robust, you know, validation rules, we have alerts as well as a whole library of checks that we perform on the data that's ingested into the R&D Cloud, which means that the data quality improves, as well as compliance to various regulatory standards, right? Those are kind of three tangible benefits, as I mentioned earlier, we are really excited for our clients that the dream of build your own R&D Cloud is actually becoming a reality, and we here to support it."

            "article_content": "A data science firm claims that a painting rescued from a garage sale bin in Minnesota for less than $50 could be a lost work by Vincent van Gogh\u2014potentially worth $15 million. Newly attributed to the famed Post-Impressionist painter by art tech firm LMI Group, the artwork, titled Elimar, has undergone extensive scientific and stylistic analysis. The discovery, if confirmed, would mark a major addition to Van Gogh\u2019s known oeuvre and reignite debates about the role of technology in art authentication. The Van Gogh Museum, however, refutes the claim.\n\nIn 2018, the buyer of Elimar hoped they might have a priceless masterpiece on their hands and submitted an inquiry to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The museum replied in 2019, stating that, having examined the information provided, \u201cbased on stylistic features\u201d the work could not be attributed to the artist. That same year, the owner sold the painting for an undisclosed sum to the New York-based data science company LMI Group, which was established the previous year.\n\nThe best of Artnet News in your inbox.

You have successfully subscribed to Artnet News.\n\nNow, the company claims the \u201corphaned\u201d painting Elimar was indeed made by Van Gogh in 1889, towards the end of his life while he was living at the Saint-Paul asylum in the south of France. The word \u201cElimar\u201d scrawled in the lower-right hand side of the canvas refers to the name of a character from Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s 1848 novel The Two Baronesses. However, LMI believes the painting is the artist\u2019s interpretation of a similar painting, Portrait of Niels Gaihede, by the Danish artist Michael Ancher.\n\n\u201cThe analysis conducted on this distinctive painting provides fresh insight into the oeuvre of Van Gogh, particularly as it relates to his practice of reinterpreting works by other artists,\u201d said Maxwell L. Anderson, an art historian and the chief operating officer of LMI Group.\n\nThe principal authority on the authenticity of paintings attributed to Van Gogh is the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. A spokesperson for the institution said that, after considering the new information in the LMI Group\u2019s report, \u201cwe maintain our view that this is not an authentic painting by Vincent van Gogh.\u201d\n\nProof in the Data?\n\nNew scientific approaches to art authentication have gained popularity over the past decade but have yet to become mainstream within the trade. LMI Group says it teamed up with various experts, from chemists to curators, to devise a \u201cdata-based\u201d approach to analyzing the artwork. Costing over $30,000, according to the Wall Street Journal, this approach merged traditional connoisseurship\u2014which considers formal analysis, provenance, and historical context\u2014with newer scientific methods. A lengthy report detailing the findings along with extensive art historical context intended to situate the painting within Van Gogh\u2019s oeuvre has been published online.\n\nIn one traditional visual analysis, the canvas was compared to known authentic Van Gogh paintings, with which it apparently shares significant similarities, most notably the decision to show the fisherman in a three-quarter view, matching Van Gogh\u2019s four self-portraits from 1889. LMI says that in the final year of his life, a hospitalized Van Gogh stopped painting with his trademark vibrant colors and opted instead for a more muted palette, like that used for Elimar. In this same period he also did several \u201ctranslations\u201d of other artists\u2019 works found in books.\n\nAnother test, this time of the pigment used in the painting, dated it to the 19th-century. It also found that the surface had been given a temporary glaze of egg-white, which Van Gogh was known to apply to protect rolled canvases.\n\nA human hair found embedded in the surface of the painting was submitted to a DNA analysis. It was found to have belonged to a man, with the investigating scientists \u201cobserving\u201d that it appeared to be red in color, according to the report.\n\nFinally, a more experimental analysis method involved the close \u201cmathematical\u201d comparison of the letters in \u201cElimar\u201d in the bottom-right hand corner with other words that have appeared on known Van Gogh paintings. In particular, the word was compared to the word \u201cEmile Zola\u201d on Van Gogh\u2019s Still Life With Bible (1885). This apparently showed significant similarities in certain characteristics of the letters, including the stroke length and width, the bounding size, and the angle. In some cases, this resemblance was measured to be 94 percent. It is worth noting that Van Gogh didn\u2019t sign all his canvases, excusing the lack of signature on Elimar.\n\nThe company has also suggested that Elimar could be interpreted as being autobiographical. A press release announcing the discovery describes how the artist \u201creimagines himself as an older, wiser man depicted against the serene palette-knife-sculptured sky and smooth expanse of the water, evoking Van Gogh\u2019s lifelong personal interest with life at sea.\u201d It said the composition evokes The Poor Fisherman (1881) by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, which Van Gogh allegedly admired.\n\n\u201cThrough Elimar, Van Gogh creates a form of spiritual self-portrait, allowing viewers to see the painter as he wished to be remembered,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nAuthentication Debates\n\nPreviously the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art between 1998 and 2003, Anderson founded LMI Group with former lawyer and LMI Group president Lawrence M. Shindell and the company\u2019s CFO, ex-Wall Street investor Steven P. Novak. The company is inviting Van Gogh scholars and dealers to book a private appointment to view the work in person.\n\n\u201cLMI Group\u2019s data-based approach to verifying authorship of this painting represents a new standard of confidence for bringing to light unknown or forgotten works by important artists,\u201d said Shindell. \u201cBy integrating science and technology with traditional tools of connoisseurship, historical context, formal analysis, and provenance research, we aim both to expand and tailor the resources available for art authentication based on the unique properties of the works under our care.\u201d\n\nThe firm did not provide information on how Elimar ended up at a garage sale in Minnesota, but alleges in the report that Van Gogh lost many works by giving them away to friends or being neglectful in his lifetime. It did not provide any provenance prior to 2016, which would indicate that the alleged Van Gogh painting was completely unknown to scholars until now since catalogues raisonn\u00e9s usually list an artist\u2019s lost works, whether destroyed or missing.\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum has rejected independently authenticated works before. In 2016, the Van Gogh expert Bogomila Welsh-Ovcharov authenticated drawings that she said were from one of the artist\u2019s 1888 sketchbooks, publishing the works in her book Vincent van Gogh: The Lost Arles Sketchbook. Their authenticity was later denounced by the Van Gogh Museum.\n\nLike many artists\u2019 foundations, the museum has previously been threatened with legal action over past disputes and now no longer accepts authentication requests from individual members of the public. Hopefuls must already have the backing of serious specialists before their claim will be considered, reducing the number of annual submissions from several hundred to around 40.\n\nIf the painting is real, it is sure to drum up excitement among collectors and everyday art fans alike. A recent exhibition of works from the end of Van Gogh\u2019s life at the National Gallery in London recently broke the museum\u2019s previous attendance records by attracting 334,589 visitors.\n\nThe use of new, data-driven methods to authenticate art has been adopted by several start-up tech companies in recent years. Late last year, the Swiss company Art Recognition used A.I. tools to authenticate three artworks offered for sale by Germann Auction House in Zurich. Most notably, it was the only certification listed for an untitled, undated watercolor attributed to the German Expressionist artist Marianne von Werefkin, which sold for CHF 15,000 ($17,000) over a high estimate of $9,300 on November 25.\n\nThis story was updated on Friday, January 31, at 6:24 a.m. ET."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

However, poor agricultural management practices such as the overuse of pesticides and fertilisers have led to soil degradation."
