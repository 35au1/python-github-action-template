Lee said Andrews half expected her Majesty to get out of the car, only to find out it was actually her chief scientific advisor.\n\nRetired CID officer John Hanson, who is a UFO researcher and author said there was \u2018undoubtedly\u2019 a link between crop circles and UFOs.\n\nHe said: \u201cParticularly the early crop circles were just circular, burnt formations in the grass or in the fields. I think they described them as UFO nests back in the olden days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to witnesses who have more or less seen these things appear and then gone over and then ended up with some quite terrifying experiences.\u201d\n\nThe doc also claims that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were hugely interested in the Rendlesham UFO case from 1980 - which has been dubbed the British Roswell.\n\nThe case allegedly saw a UFO land in the forest at Rendlesham over Christmas weekend in 1980. Numerous airforce personnel, from nearby RAF Bentwaters, which was a US NATO base at the time, went to investigate and saw strange orbs and beams of light shining through the forest.\n\nThe film also investigates wild claims that, the then, Prince Charles piloted an experimental UFO type craft in 1975, and explores what he can do now as King to aid UFO disclosure.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhat I wanted to show in this film is how passionate and serious the senior royals were on the subject of UFOs. They had to keep this mostly a secret because of possible ridicule but if such high standing, balanced people, took them seriously why can\u2019t we?\n\n\u201cThere is something that pilots and police officers are seeing in the skies that can\u2019t be explained so why can\u2019t the British government take them seriously?\u201d\n\nJoin the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

He added: \u201cHere is somebody who could pick up the phone and say look here what\u2019s going on in the United States. He could ask for a full classified briefing.\u201d\n\nThe film includes footage from John Hanson, taken in 2000, of the alleged UFO sighting Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk.\n\nThe \u2018sighting\u2019 became known as the British Roswell - in reference to the 1947 crash of a United States Army Air Forces balloon near Roswell, New Mexico which birthed a conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nLee claims Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, was the first member of the Royal Family to have a UFO experience in around 1875. Lee said: \u201cHe wrote an entry in his journal saying he saw strange, dazzling lights in the sky, like orbs flying past and he couldn\u2019t describe them. It was powerful enough for him to make an entry in his diary and the basis of modern, royal UFOlogy.\u201d\n\nLee said Lord Mountbatten, Prince Phillip\u2019s uncle had a passion for UFO\u2019s. Nick Pope, a retired member of the Ministry of Defence, also claims the Royals have been interested in UFO\u2019s for decades.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut this was always a matter of extreme sensitivity because in some ways it was counter to the government\u2019s public position on this. Or if not directly counter to it, certainly difficult to gel with it.\n\n\u201cPrince Phillip was very much at the forefront of Royal interest in this, though arguably he was introduced to that subject by Lord Mountbatten.\u201d\n\nThe film also looks at the story that the the Prince Charles flew a prototype UFO in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1975. Lee said: \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t extra terrestrial, it was a saucer shaped craft. But the funny thing is it has some strange magnetic propulsion system which was unknown.\u201d\n\nThe craft was said to have emitted a blue ionic flame and was controlled magnetically by a larger craft behind it.\n\nBut the film does acknowledge Prince William is not known to have had any UFO experiences.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhoever is King is going to have an important role to play on the world stage with disclosure being imminent that we are not alone.\u201d\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

        "article_content": "When a rancher in New Mexico came across scattered pieces of an alleged UFO in 1947, the US Air Force gathered the debris for further examination. The entire controversy that followed is covered in detail in the episode titled \u2018The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 of Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries,\u2019 which also features interviews with various UFO enthusiasts. One of the prominent Ufologists in the UFO community, Kevin Randle, also talks about his views on the 1947 Roswell incident.\n\nKevin Randle is a Retired Lieutenant Colonel With Decades of Experience in the Army\n\nKevin Douglas Randle was born on June 4, 1949, into a loving household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. From his early days, he was ambitious and wanted to achieve great things in life. While he was in high school, his interest in UFOs and aliens rose so much that he began studying the subject in his free time. After graduating from high school, he went to the University of Iowa, where he studied journalism. Finding interest in psychology, Kevin then got his master\u2019s degree in the same and a Ph. D. from California Coast University. Expanding his knowledge in different subjects, he also got into the American Military University and earned a second master\u2019s degree in military studies.\n\nFulfilling his dream of serving his nation, Kevin became an integral part of the US Army in the Vietnam War as a helicopter pilot and in the Iraq War as a Battalion Intelligence Officer. He was also in the US Air Force, serving as a general\u2019s aide, a public affairs officer, as well as an intelligence officer. After completing his Air Force Reserve duty, he filled the position of an intelligence officer at the Iowa National Guard. For the courage he displayed on the battlefield while deployed in Iraq several times, he was given a Combat Action Badge. After serving his nation for numerous decades, Kevin retired from the Iowa National Guard as a Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nThe Successful Author Also Runs a UFO-Based Podcast Show\n\nIn order to feed his curiosity and passion for UFOs, Kevin also started writing for UFO magazines at a fairly young age. Having more than three decades of experience under his belt as a professional writer, he has written and published all kinds of write-ups, from science fiction and techno-thrillers to action-adventure and non-fiction. However, out of more than 80 books that he has written, Kevin is widely recognized for his books about the 1947 Roswell story and UFOs. Some of his popular books include \u2018The Roswell Encyclopedia,\u2019 \u2018A History of UFO Crashes,\u2019 \u2018Conspiracy of Silence,\u2019 and \u2018Project Moondust.\u2019\n\nBesides that, he has also co-authored books such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 and \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell.\u2019 Given his knowledge of the Roswell story and everything related to UFO, Dr. Kevin Douglas Randle is considered one of the leading researchers and experts on those subjects within the community of UFO enthusiasts. For nearly eight years, he has also been hosting a podcast series titled \u2018A Different Perspective with Kevin Randle,\u2019 where he interviews alleged UFO witnesses and gets them to talk about their purported encounters and experiences with the unknown. Currently, the renowned Ufologist resides in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and continues to focus on proving the existence of UFOs and aliens.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

        "article_content": "It was back in the late evening of July 2, 1947, that something crashed in an open field around 40 miles north of Rosewell, New Mexico, opening the doors for a historic moment unlike any other. After all, it was almost immediately reported to be a UFO wreck, per Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: The Roswell UFO Incident,\u2019 only to then suddenly be changed to a US Army weather balloon. That\u2019s when Major Jesse Marcel was allegedly also ordered to remain mum about this matter, but he, his son, as well as his grandkids have all eventually iterated the belief it was a \u201cflying saucer.\u201d\n\nJesse and Denice Marcel Grew Up With Tales of the Rosewell Incident\n\nAccording to records, Major Jesse was an integral part of the Army\u2019s 509th unit stationed in New Mexico in the 1940s, just for it to turn out to be the only atomic bomb unit in the world at the time. He was actually a part of the team that had planned the nuclear strike over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan after already having an illustrious career with some key people during this World War. Therefore, when tasked with investigating the July 1947 crash site before directly reporting back to a Colonel, it was understood it was a big deal, yet he never could have expected what he seemingly saw.\n\nAs per records, Major Jesse claimed to have come across debris, unlike anything he had seen before, comprising a flexible metal and some glass-like fiber optic materials strewn throughout. What\u2019s more is that the former allegedly even had some violet-colored symbols on it that appeared to be part of a different language, which was even corroborated by his son Jesse Marcel Jr. After all, the Army official had ostensibly broken protocol and taken some debris home to show his wife as well as his only child, which the latter always remembered despite being just 11 at the time.\n\nTherefore, when Jr. ultimately had kids \u2014 Jesse Marcel III, Denice Marcel, and John Marcel \u2014 they grew up listening to the possibility of there being UFOs and extraterrestrial beings too. The truth is, they purportedly heard everything about the crash and the two alleged alien bodies found in intervals, only for it all to be iterated when their grandfather went public with his accounts. That\u2019s why they never once doubted him or their father because all their statements to the media were practically the same as what they had been told for years, driving them to stand by in support.\n\nJesse and Denice Have Partly Followed in Their Father and Grandfather\u2019s Footsteps\n\nEven though Jesse, Denice, as well as John have all grown up and establi shed different lives of their own, the former two continue to unwaveringly reiterate their father and grandfather\u2019s claims. They wholeheartedly believe their late family members were telling the truth, especially since their grandfather also left behind a private diary through which one can supposedly uncover the location of the debris and additional secrets that have not yet come to light. However, their aim is just to continue talking about this incident to ensure it goes down in history as possibly one of the most remarkable proofs of life beyond Earth, with their ancestors being one of the first believers.\n\nComing to Jesse and Denice\u2019s individual standings at the moment, it appears as if the former is based out of Spokane Valley, Washington, whereas the latter resides in Los Angeles, California. He is actually the Co-Founder, Chief Design Officer, and Director at Airborne Motorworks, which aims to manufacture sustainable electromagnetic technology innovatively. As if that\u2019s not enough, he is also a television producer and a published author \u2013 his book \u2018The Roswell Legacy: The Untold Story of the First Military Officer at the 1947 Crash Site\u2019 was first released in 2007.\n\nAs for Denice, she has reportedly been serving as the State Section Director for Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) Los Angeles since 1983, through which she\u2019s doing everything in her power to keep the Roswell incident in the limelight. From what we can tell, she is also a dog mom who is in a happy, healthy, long-term relationship with Jim Fitzgerald at the moment, a former PA announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers, all the while also beautifully maintaining her familial bonds.\n\nRead More: Barry Fitzgerald: Where is the Paranormal Investigator Now?\n\n"

Learn More\n\nAs the generative AI continues to progress, having a simple chatbot may no longer be enough for many enterprises.\n\nCloud hyperscalers are racing to build up their databases and tools to help enterprises deploy operational data quickly and efficiently, letting them build applications that are both intelligent and contextually aware.\n\nCase in point: Google Cloud\u2019s recent barrage of updates for multiple database offerings, starting with AlloyDB.\n\nAccording to a blog post from the company, the fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible database now supports ScaNN (scalable nearest neighbor) vector index in general availability. The technology powers its Search and YouTube services and paves the way for faster index creation and vector queries while consuming far less memory.\n\nIn addition, the company also announced a partnership with Aiven for the managed deployment of AlloyDB as well as updates for Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase.\n\nUnderstanding the value of ScaNN for AlloyDB\n\nVector databases are critical to power advanced AI workloads, right from RAG chatbots to recommender systems.\n\nAt the heart of these systems sit key capabilities like storing and managing vector embeddings (numerical representation of data) and conducting similarity searches needed for the targeted applications.\n\nAs most developers in the world prefer PostgreSQL as the go-to operational database, its extension for vector search, pgvector, has become highly popular. Google Cloud already supports it on AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, with a state-of-the-art graph-based algorithm called Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) handling vector jobs.\n\nHowever, on occasions where the vector workload is too large, the performance of the algorithm may decline, leading to application latencies and high memory usage.\n\nTo address this, Google Cloud is making ScaNN vector index in AlloyDB generally available. This new index uses the same technology that powers Google Search and YouTube to deliver up to four times faster vector queries and up to eight-fold faster index build times, with a 3-4x smaller memory footprint than the HNSW index in standard PostgreSQL.\n\n\u201cThe ScaNN index is the first PostgreSQL-compatible index that can scale to support more than one billion vectors while maintaining state-of-the-art query performance \u2014 enabling high-performance workloads for every enterprise,\u201d Andi Gutmans, the GM and VP of engineering for Databases at Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGutmans also announced a partnership with Aiven to make AlloyDB Omni, the downloadable edition of AlloyDB, available as a managed service that runs anywhere, including on-premises or on the cloud.\n\n\u201cYou can now run transactional, analytical, and vector workloads across clouds on a single platform, and easily get started building gen AI applications, also on any cloud. This is the first partnership that adds an administration and management layer for AlloyDB Omni,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase?\n\nIn addition to AlloyDB, Google Cloud announced enhancements for Memorystore for Valkey, the fully managed cluster for the Valkey in-memory database, and the Firebase application development platform.\n\nFor the Valkey offering, the company said it is adding vector search capabilities. Gutmans noted that a single Memorystore for Valkey instance can now perform similarity search at single-digit millisecond latency on over a billion vectors, with more than 99% recall.\n\nHe also added that the next version of Memorystore for Valkey, 8.0, is now in public preview with 2x faster querying speed as compared to Memorystore for Redist Cluster, a new replication scheme, networking enhancements and detailed visibility into performance and resource usage.\n\nAs for Firebase, Google Cloud is adding Data Connect, a new backend-as-a-service that will be integrated with a fully managed PostgreSQL database powered by Cloud SQL. It will go into public preview later this year.\n\nWith these developments, Google Cloud hopes developers will have a broader selection of infrastructure and database capabilities \u2014 along with powerful language models \u2013 to build intelligent applications for their organizations. It remains to be seen how these new advancements are deployed to real use cases, but the general trend indicates the volume of gen AI applications is expected to soar significantly.\n\nOmdia estimates that the market for generative AI applications will grow from $6.2 billion in 2023 to $58.5 billion in 2028, marking a CAGR of 56%."

Samsung\u2019s annual developer conference, SDC 2024, will kick off in San Jose later in the day and we\u2019re hoping the delayed software beta will finally make an appearance at the event. Nevertheless, we\u2019re now hearing some exciting updates about One UI 7 from tipster Ice Universe.\n\nOne UI 7 will make some optimizations to Samsung\u2019s gallery and add convenient features related to AI search https://t.co/JdkDZSJrgg \u2014 ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) October 2, 2024\n\nThe leaker claims that Samsung is planning to add several optimizations and a convenient AI Search feature to its stock Gallery app with the One UI 7 update. While the tipster didn\u2019t share details about the new feature, Samsung is likely implementing a Google Photos-like Ask Photos functionality. Ask Photos is powered by Gemini and allows users to search the Photos app for specific images in a natural, descriptive way. For example, you can search for things like, \u201cphotos of me and my dog playing catch.\u201d\n\nAI Search would be a welcome improvement for Samsung\u2019s Gallery app, which has been seen as somewhat lacking. Recently, the company has made efforts to enhance the experience, notably with the One UI 6.1 update, which brought in a range of Google-inspired AI editing tools. The addition of this new AI Search feature could help elevate the Gallery app further, making it a more compelling alternative to Google Photos.\n\nStay with Android Authority for more details about the One UI 7 update. We\u2019ll bring you all the latest from SDC 2024 as the day progresses.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

However, the episode also acquaints them with various other professionals in the field of the paranormal and the unknown, such as Barry Fitzgerald. As he talks about his views on the subject, questions about his whereabouts arise in the minds of the viewers.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald\u2019s Expertise in the Field of Paranormal Has Allowed Him to Explore Other Avenues\n\nBorn in 1972 in the city of Lisburn in Northern Ireland, Barry Fitzgerald allegedly experienced supernatural occurrences in his early days, leading him to form an interest in the unknown. After completing his education, he reportedly worked at the Southern Education and Library Board as the warden. Given his affinity towards the paranormal, he got into the field of paranormal research and worked for a couple of paranormal groups in Northern Ireland. With more than thirty years of experience as a paranormal investigator, he has encountered all kinds of cases, including ancient tombs, myths, hidden spiritual doorways, and legends.\n\nMoreover, Barry has been featured on several TV shows over the years, including \u2018Destination Truth,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Hunters,\u2019 and SyFy\u2019s \u2018Ghost Hunters International.\u2019 In 2016, rumors about him disappearing during his search for a Neolithic doorway to another world were spread. However, he denied these to be true when he featured on the podcast \u2018Stirring the Cauldron.\u2019 Thanks to his expertise in the field, he started writing books based on the paranormal and the unknown, such as \u2018The Influence,\u2019 \u2018Banshee,\u2019 \u2018Searching the Sidhe,\u2019 and \u2018The Mist of Gods.\u2019 He has also co-authored a book with Brian Allan \u2014 \u2018The Deception Of Gods And Men.\u2019\n\nGiven his experience as a television personality, Barry Fitzgerald co-hosts \u2018Project Doorway\u2019 with Steve Mera, another renowned paranormal investigator. When he is not busy with that, he spends his time researching new investigative techniques. The paranormal investigator also has other hobbies, like cooking. In February 2024, he traveled to Albert Halls Bolton in Manchester to attend the Awakenings event, where the attendees discussed the dark side of ufology.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald and His Loving Wife Are Proud Dog Parents\n\nFrom what we can tell, Barry Fitzgerald knows how to strike a balance between his personal and professional life. He shares a great bond with his loving wife, Donna, and is committed to nurturing the fulfilling life they have built together in the quaint town of Sligo in the northern part of Ireland. The duo loves to embark on trips across the globe to feast their eyes on stunning landscapes and have amazing experiences. When they\u2019re back home, they often stop by their local pub to sip on a large glass of cold Guinness and share some laughs with friends. Even after so many years of being together, Donna and Barry still appear to be deeply in love with each other. They haven\u2019t welcomed any kids of their own into the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean their love for their furry babies isn\u2019t unconditional.\n\nAn avid animal lover and a dog dad, Barry went on multiple adventures with his snowy white baby, Max, for several years until his passing. The \u201cmystery legend seeker\u201d passed into the land of rainbows a few years ago, leaving a giant hole in the hearts of the pair. Though one can\u2019t truly move on from the loss of a dear one, in a post he shared in January 2024, Barry revealed that he has found a companion as precious as Max to accompany him on his adventures. Alongside an adorable picture of his furry baby, Barry wrote, \u201cMeena has crept into the hole left by Max, I\u2019ll be forever broken by his death but Meena is a ball of life and mischief to keep me distracted.\u201d The heartwarming caption is a testament to his love for Meena and how she has impacted his life.\n\nBarry\u2019s love for canines runs so deep that he doesn\u2019t hesitate to show up for them in any part of the world if needed. In fact, he flew to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in March 2024 to attend Pawtographs Parafest 5, a paranormal convention held by Pawtographs for Pooches to raise money for a local animal shelter. Interestingly, exploring the realm of the paranormal to unearth new claims is not the only thing that sparks joy in Barry Fitzgerald\u2019s life. Aside from the purported elements of the unknown, nature\u2019s beautiful gifts also pique the interest of the paranormal investigator, and he regularly shares his findings with the world via his social media profiles. Accompanying him on his escapades in the peaceful embrace of nature is, of course, his baby, Meena.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

In order to put his abilities to the test, Paranormal Specialist Steve Mera joined Don on numerous of his paranormal projects and claimed that he witnessed his conversations with the spirit on the recording device. Despite Don being the focal point of the majority of the episode, Steve still manages to invoke several questions in the minds of the viewers.\n\nSteve Mera Has Accomplished a Lot in the Field of UFOs and Paranormal\n\nThe subject of UFOs and the Paranormal has fascinated Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera from his early childhood, so much so that he ended up making a career out of it. However, before he made a name for himself in the community, he earned a degree in Electrical Engineering from North Trafford College and GEC Electrical after passing out from Wellington Boys Secondary School. Meanwhile, he ensured that he gave some time to his passion and carried out consistent research on UFOs and the Paranormal, which would prove to be vital in his future. By 1989, his efforts got him a job at NATO as a Telecommunications Officer before working at MAPIT (Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team) and BUFORA (British UFO Research Association).\n\nA few years later, Steve created the BITC (British Investigators Training Course) in Anomalous Phenomena, which turned out to be a huge success across the United Kingdom. The 1990s were quite productive in his professional career as he reformed MAPIT and helped in the launch of MARA (Merseyside Anomalies Research Association) and NUFORA (The National UFO Research Association). Around 1996, he also launched the SEP (Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology) and worked in the para-psychological departments. By 1998, he had completed the Pre-Degree Psychology at South Trafford College, Manchester, and the BSY Parapsychology Course. He has also worked with Parkway Green Housing Association and Zohar Entertainment Group as a UAP Geological Research and Paranormal Specialist.\n\nIn 2017, he also co-founded ONSTELLAR. Steve also earned his degree in Human Behavioral Psychology from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Steve has also been a part of more than 90 TV shows and radio stations throughout his career, thanks to his expertise in the field of UFOs and the Paranormal. Not only that, he has worked with more than 300 different publications across the world and written for numerous TV shows. Some of the shows he has worked on are \u2018Conspiracy Corner,\u2019 \u2018The X-Files,\u2019 \u2018The Late Night Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018The Scream Team,\u2019 \u2018The Great Unexplained Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018UFO Hunters,\u2019 The Afterlife,\u2019 and more. As for the magazines that have featured his articles, some of them are \u2018UFO Review,\u2019 \u2018UFO News UK,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Voices,\u2019 \u2018Naro Minded,\u2019 \u2018Fate,\u2019 \u2018UFO Magazine,\u2019 \u2018Alien Encounters,\u2019 \u2018Sightings,\u2019 and many more.\n\nWhile he is currently handling his responsibilities as the owner and editor of Phenomena Magazine, Steve also stays busy with running MAPIT and SEP. Having written three books \u2014 \u2018The A-Z of the Unknown,\u2019 \u2018Strange Happenings: Memoirs of a Paranormal Investigator,\u2019 and \u2018Paranormal Insight: A Concise Study of the Strange and Profound\u2019 \u2014 the Paranormal Specialist is also reportedly working on a couple of new books, which would revolve around the UFO Phenomena. On September 30, 2024, Steve conducted a Birmingham UFO Group meeting at the Hot Shots Snooker Club function room at 100 Crosswells Road in Oldbury, Birmingham. In the same month, he also featured as a guest in a podcast called \u2018Paranormal Pendle.\u2019\n\nSteve Mera is Also a Dedicated Partner and Friend\n\nOriginally from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, England, Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera leads a content life on the personal front. After all, he has been navigating life\u2019s ups and downs with his one true love, Jackie Heighway, for over a decade now. Though neither of the two has shared when they fell in love, we know that their paths crossed in 2011 in Bolton, and it was in the same year, on November 28, that they turned their fondness for each other into a full-fledged relationship. Together, the two have seemingly built a beautiful world of their own in Greater Manchester, UK, with trust, care, understanding, and loads of love. Jackie is a Salford native who has been self-employed since 2018. Steve has her biggest cheerleader in Jackie, who makes sure she has his back every step of the way. Whether it is accompanying Steve on his research trips or sharing details about his talks, Jackie does everything to showcase her support for her partner.\n\nFrom what we can tell, Steve seemingly has a daughter named Jenny from a previous relationship. However, not much is known about her. For the uninitiated, Steve is also a huge animal lover and got his first pet in 1997. Losing a pet leaves a huge void in the lives of pet parents and sadly, Steve and Jackie had to experience that pain and grief when their beloved cat, Lucy, crossed over the rainbow bridge in August 2024. \u201cWe will never forget you. You were a huge part of our family. We will meet again one day,\u201d wrote Jackie announcing Lucy\u2019s departure from this world. Though they\u2019ll always miss Lucy, Steve and Jackie are grateful they got to create so many beautiful memories with her.\n\nWhen Steve is not investing his time in furthering his passion, the paranormal specialist enjoys spending time with his family and friends. Even today, he continues to impart all the knowledge he has gathered from his decades of extensive research with the world by setting up meetings and talks every now and then. He also keeps his admirers updated and captivated by sharing his insights on a regular basis on his YouTube channel. Apart from spending time with the love of his life, Jackie, and embarking on trips with her, Steve also looks forward to hanging out with his friends.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA student's drawing and theory of how a Portuguese Moth Fly was found in their Australian schoolyard. Credit: CSIRO\n\nMore than 60% of Australia's known insects are unnamed and a mystery to science. Of an estimated 500,000 Australian species, roughly half are insects, but many aren't categorized.\n\nA group of sharp-eyed school students from Queensland is changing that. With the guidance of their dedicated teachers and enthusiastic experts, they've helped lift the lid on the secrets of two more insect species.\n\nThe Year 4 students from Yeronga State expected to find various insects in their Malaise insect trap. A tiny fly, first identified in a botanical garden in Portugal and unrecorded in Australia, was not one of them.\n\nExpert analysis found that some of the fly's DNA sequences were nearly identical to a moth fly species, Alepia viatrix. They sent specimens to Germany for testing, where scientists confirmed the fly's Alepia viatrix identity. It was far from home.\n\nThe students sketched and labeled the insect, and discussed their theories of how this fly came to be in their backyard. Popular theories included it swimming the distance, stowing away on a shipping container, or attempting world domination.\n\nThis work became part of a paper published in the journal Check List. The authors suggest the fly likely made its 18,000-km journey to Australia by hitchhiking in a bromeliad.\n\nFortunately, experts expect the fly to be harmless for Australia's environment. Its discovery highlights the importance of community involvement and citizen science.\n\nTaking the sting out of armyworm invasion\n\nMore recently, students from Yeronga and five other schools each collected a new wasp species in their Malaise traps. The discovered wasp is a natural enemy to the fall armyworm, a destructive cereal crop pest that entered Australian agriculture in 2020.\n\nBecause their wasp was unnamed and undescribed, students got to workshop potential names for the newly recognized species. Researchers credit the students and described the shared naming process in a journal article published in Austral Entomology.\n\nThe students' wasp discoveries and information gathered will be useful to the Queensland Government's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Knowing the wasps' locations will assist scientists researching solutions to armyworm population control, aiding Australian agriculturalists and farmers.\n\nOpening doors to science\n\nThe learning opportunities came from a partnership between teacher Clare Triggell from Yeronga State School and entomologist Dr. Andy Howe from the University of the Sunshine Coast. Thanks to their collaboration, students got a unique chance to learn about insect taxonomy, biodiversity, conservation and biosecurity.\n\nTriggell and Howe have been working as partners for more than three years through our STEM Professionals in Schools program. The initiative pairs Australian teachers with science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) professionals, connecting curriculum and real-life industry and research.\n\nDr. Howe helped make learning activities even more meaningful by basing some exercises on the citizen science projects of Insect Investigators. This school-based program teams up scientists with schools to discover, document and describe Australia's biodiversity. Through the program, Yeronga State School students have joined other emerging scientists around Australia. Together, they've named 17 new insect species and documented 5,000 species using DNA.\n\nThe Australian Museum celebrated Insect Investigators' efforts with a Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science in 2024. Dr. Howe says the enthusiasm of all the teachers and students involved drove the Eureka's shared achievement.\n\n\"Working with Clare is wonderful. She eagerly facilitates hands-on learning and has taught me how it works best in schools,\" Dr. Howe says.\n\n\"The partnerships to increase teacher capability, as well as the students, in a new STEM area, and I've seen that here. Last year, teachers ran their own insect trapping and monitoring exercise with minimal input from me. I can't wait to learn what they discover next.\"\n\nMore information: Santiago Jaume-Schinkel et al, The hitchhiker's guide to Australia: the 18,000-km-long journey of Alepia viatrix Jaume-Schinkel, Kvifte, Weele & Mengual, 2022 (Diptera, Psychodidae) discovered through citizen science, Check List (2023).

The app is already equipped with an AI assistant and is piloting an enterprise product offering.\n\n\"The battle for offline attention is the next big thing in consumer,\" Dunn told Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid a loneliness epidemic declared by US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and social-media users growing jaded with online life, startups like Posh (a sort of TikTok feed for events) and 222 (a way to meet strangers via dinners or events) have also raised venture capital this year with apps aiming to help people find friends.\n\nPie recently announced that it raised a $11.5 million Series A led by Forerunner Ventures' Kirsten Green. The round also included participation from Chicago-based fund Origin Ventures and Twitter cofounder Ev Williams. Its latest round puts Pie's total capital raised at $24 million, per the company.\n\nBuilding and growing an app for making friends\n\nLike many startups, Pie has had to pivot. It launched in 2020 as a friend matchmaking app, akin to a Bumble Friends experience.\n\n\"We got a lot of matching, a lot of profile browse, but no one would reach out to the other person,\" Dunn said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter reading Dr. Marisa Fanco's book \"Platonic,\" Dunn said he went back to the drawing board. Scrolling through potential friends wasn't going to cut it \u2014 it had to be recurring group hangouts to help people meet and stay connected.\n\nWith a team of 10 Chicago-based staffers, Pie doubled down on building an IRL app and using the city as a testing ground.\n\n\"Chicago doesn't have the saturation of consumer apps you have in New York City, Los Angeles, or San Francisco,\" Dunn said.\n\nIn February and March, the startup began testing local, curated events, dubbed \"Pie Originals,\" in Chicago, such as a monthly silent book club or a bi-monthly \"Dudes Getting Pancakes\" hangout. Dunn credits the app's growth to this strategy. It hit 20,000 monthly active users in six months of testing the Pie Originals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal event creators, like Mary Doctor, who hosts a show-and-tell event for adults, have used Pie to gather people and make money.\n\n\"There's this whole creator economy of people who want to bring people together in person,\" Dunn added.\n\nWith its Series A capital, Pie is rolling out a creator fund for event hosts, which pays $5 to the creator for every RSVP to an event (all of which are free for attendees).\n\nThe startup plans to experiment with different monetization models, eyeing a potential freemium model that apps like Bumble and Hinge have opted for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is venture-backed startups,\" Dunn said, adding that by the time of Pie's Series B, it will have a monetization engine locked down. \"You have costs, and then you figure out revenues later.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dunn is betting on Pie's Gen-Z staff and the app's user growth, which stands at 40% month-over-month.\n\nRead the 31-page pitch deck that Andy Dunn used to raise Pie's Series A:\n\nNote: Pie has redacted details and amended some pages so that the document could be shared externally."

        "article_content": "Rosh Hashanah, one of the most important days on the Hebrew calendar, is this week. It marks the beginning of the new year and celebrates the creation of the world. It's also the start of the Jewish High Holy Days leading up to the Jewish day of atonement, Yom Kippur.\n\nRosh Hashanah is translated from Hebrew to mean the \u201chead\u201d of the year. It\u2019s commemorated with special prayers, foods, gatherings and more.\n\n\"These are moments where we come together as a community, where we take time to think about ourselves as individuals, but also think about the ways that we can help others,\" Rabbi Rob Gleisser, the Peter J. Rubinstein reform senior Jewish educator at Penn State Hillel, told USA TODAY. \"Think about the ways that we want to create a safe community, a welcoming community, a warm community and then be able to enrich the world around us after having those moments of introspection.\"\n\nHere's what to know about Rosh Hashanah 2024:\n\nWhen is Rosh Hashanah 2024?\n\nThe exact date varies every year since it is based on the Hebrew calendar, where Rosh Hashanah begins on the first day of the seventh month. It is almost always in September or October.\n\nThis year it starts on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2024 at sundown, and ends at sunset on Oct. 4, 2024.\n\nThe celebration of the new year is the only Jewish holiday that is two days long both inside and outside Israel. It\u2019s called yoma arichta, translated as \u201ca long day\u201d because the 48-hour celebration may be thought of as one extended day.\n\nHow to celebrate Rosh Hashanah\n\nMany people attend services at synagogues and other community spaces for worship on Rosh Hashanah. Jewish congregations with recite special prayers and songs to mark the new year.\n\nSome communities will blow a curved ram's horn called a Shofar.\n\nThe Shofar at Temple Israel of Brevard, located at 7300 Lake Andrew Drive in Viera.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant to kind of stir you, awaken you to the idea of thinking of new year, taking stock, preparing to atone, and in the month leading up to Rosh Hashanah it begins to be used as a kind of wake up,\u201d said, Jordan Rosenblum, the Belzer Professor of Classical Judaism and Max and Frieda Weinstein-Bascom Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt really kind of pierces the air, and you can't ignore it.\u201d\n\nSome Jews may also pray near a body of water in a Tashlich ceremony, in addition to tossing pieces of bread or other food into the water to symbolize sending off sins.\n\nWhy is Rosh Hashanah celebrated?\n\nRosh Hashanah is often treated as a time to reflect on the previous year and focus on hopes for the coming year, according to Rosenblum.\n\n\u201cIt's the beginning of the Jewish calendar, and like all new years there are, it\u2019s a time for sort of taking stock, right? ... What do I want to improve? You know, the equivalent of joining the gym in January,\u201d he said.\n\nRosh Hashanah is also important for some Jewish people as a celebration of the creation of humanity. It may be referred to as the \"birthday of the world,\" marking the time when God created \u2013 or when the breath of life entered \u2013 Adam and Eve.\n\nWhat are some traditional foods eaten during Rosh Hashanah?\n\nRosh Hashanah celebrations don\u2019t just take place within the walls of a synagogue. Many Jews will gather with friends and family to eat special foods and hold commemorations:\n\nSome Jewish people eat apples and honey together to represent a sweet new year.\n\nPeople may also eat challah, a braided bread, in a round loaf to represent a cycle of the year.\n\nPomegranate seeds also represent the 613 mitzvot, or commandments, that are cited in the Torah, the Jewish holy book.\n\n\"For Rosh Hashanah, in particular, there's just a lot of emphasis on sweetness so that you are stepping into the year with good tastes and good feelings, and with this idea that you want to have a sweet and bountiful year ahead,\" Rabbi Danielle Leshaw, senior educator and campus support director for Hillel International, told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is the Rosh Hashanah greeting?\n\nHappy Rosh Hashanah or happy new year are both appropriate greetings if you are talking to Jewish friends, family, co-workers, or classmates around the holiday.\n\nYou can also say shanah tovah, which means good year in Hebrew.\n\n\"Happy New Year is great,\" Gleisser said. \"Happy Rosh Hashanah, that\u2019s a beautiful thing to say.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Akron Beacon Journal: When does Rosh Hashanah start?"

        "article_content": "The occasional risks associated with downloading beta releases have been highlighted by Apple\u2019s decision on Wednesday to pull the watchOS 11.1 beta 3 update following user reports that it had bricked their Apple Watch. The company took the decision just hours after releasing it to developers for testing.\n\nA MacRumors reporter noted the development in a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that Apple had pulled watchOS 11.1 beta 3 update after users on various online forums started complaining about their watches \u201clocking up\u201d until they were rebooted, though in some cases even rebooting was met with limited success.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA comment spotted on Reddit by 9to5Mac said that after installing the beta software, their Apple Watch was \u201ccompletely locking up every single boot.\u201d It continued: \u201cI hold the side button and crown to restart it, it reboots, and not even a minute later is completely frozen. Time won\u2019t update, nothing. It happened right when someone had text me and it\u2019s nonstop since. It\u2019s currently locked up for the 7th time and it just started 15 minutes ago.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first device to experience problems with new Apple software. The company recently pulled HomePod Software 18.1 beta 2 over bricking concerns, and even paused access to iPadOS 18.0 (which wasn\u2019t a beta but a full public release) for M4 iPad Pros following similar bricking reports.\n\nThe latest development is a reminder to always tread carefully when it comes to downloading beta software, regardless of whether it\u2019s from Apple. While the Apple Watch beta is for developers to test, Apple often releases a public beta prior to a full public release, and even these will likely have some disruptive bugs.\n\nThe general advice is to avoid installing beta software on a device that you rely on for daily use. Indeed, on its website, Apple reminds folks that beta software often contains bugs and the whole point of offering it as a download is so that it get can get feedback to squash those bugs.\n\n\u201cPlease note that since the beta software has not yet been commercially released by Apple, it may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not function as well as commercially released software,\u201d the company says, adding, \u201cWe strongly recommend installing on a secondary system or device, or on a secondary partition on your Mac.\u201d"

        "article_content": "We have some good news for those waiting for an iOS update. According to 9to5Mac, a reputable private account\u2019s social media post suggests that a new update for iOS 18 might be coming soon. However, it\u2019s likely to be iOS 18.0.1, not the much-awaited iOS 18.1 update many are anticipating.\n\nThe new iOS 18.0.1 update is expected to feature bug fixes, including one that addresses an iMessage bug. Perhaps more importantly, the adjacent iPadOS 18.0.1 update could finally provide relief to iPad users who experienced bricking issues when installing iPadOS 18.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe iMessage bug we reported on last month affects anyone who replies in a threaded message with someone who shares a watch face from the Apple Watch. When this happens, the phones crash for both users. It seems the issue is resolved with the iOS 18.1 betas, but with the release of iOS 18.0.1, everyday users will also be able to avoid the problem.\n\nResolving the iPadOS 18 bug will help many folks who recently spent a lot of money on a new iPad Pro only to find their tablets unusable. After installing iPadOS 18, the bug caused bricking on the 11-inch and 13-inch M4 iPad Pro (2024) models. Soon after the bug was identified, Apple pulled the iPadOS 18 update for anyone with an M4 iPad Pro.\n\nWith these bug fixes hopefully resolved soon, Apple\u2019s attention can finally turn to the release of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1. These software updates will be the first to include pieces of Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple Intelligence, announced in June, is the company\u2019s first foray into artificial intelligence. Though initially expected to launch with the iPhone 16 series in September, Apple delayed the launch this summer. As a result, parts of Apple Intelligence will be released piecemeal across multiple software updates, such as iOS 18.1, 18.2, etc.\n\nThe iOS 18.1 betas released to developers and members of Apple\u2019s public beta community include Apple Intelligence-powered components like Siri improvements, writing tool updates, and more. The first official version of iOS 18.1 should be released before the end of October, with iOS 18.2 available before the end of the year.\n\nLate in September, MacRumors was the first site to say Apple was expected to launch iOS 18.0.1 soon."
