            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nThe competition between startups and big companies such as Google and Meta to offer compelling AI video creation tools has entered a new phase.\n\nLuma AI, a startup founded by former Googlers and others, is dramatically expanding its Dream Machine AI video model with a new interface, mobile app and new image generation foundation model. The model, Luma Photon, combines personalization, efficiency and creative power to push the boundaries of image and video creation.\n\nNow available on web and iOS, the new Dream Machine aims to blend simplicity and sophistication across input devices through a unified intuitive conversational interface.\n\nPromotional image of new Luma desktop interface. Credit: Luma AI\n\nWith over 25 million registered users since its launch in June 2024, Dream Machine is evolving into a subscription-based service for both casual creators and professionals in industries such as fashion, marketing and filmmaking.\n\n\u201cWe built Dream Machine as a visual thought partner, powered by a whole new image model called Luma Photon,\u201d said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI, during a video interview with VentureBeat. \u201cIt\u2019s creative, intelligent, and designed for the people who build our world\u2014designers, creators in fashion, media, and entertainment.\u201d\n\nPromotional image of Dream Machine iOS. Credit: Luma AI\n\nA new approach to visual creation\n\nDream Machine aims to remove the complexity traditionally associated with creative tools. Users can simply describe their ideas in natural language or provide reference images to guide the platform\u2019s outputs. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which requires precise and technical input, Dream Machine is built for intuitive interaction.\n\n\u201cUnlike prompt engineering, where you have to carefully craft specific commands, Dream Machine lets you talk to it like you\u2019re talking to a person. This conversational interface makes editing and creating intuitive,\u201d Jain explained.\n\nThe platform\u2019s new personalization features, including multi-image prompting and single-image character references, enable users to bring their visions to life with greater accuracy and detail. For instance, designers can upload textures, colors and other visual cues to guide the system\u2019s outputs.\n\n\u201cWith Dream Machine, you can give it reference images\u2014colors, structures, or textures\u2014and it will intelligently combine and iterate until you get exactly what you want. It\u2019s a game-changer for designers and creatives,\u201d Jain added.\n\nNew modes include a Brainstorm mode which allows users to apply different style influences to their imagery and video, as well as Boards of multiple images and videos that can be shared between team members and fellow creators, and \u201cConcept Pills\u201d that offer pre-set unified stylistic visuals users can apply to their video and image outputs.\n\nConsistent characters from a single image\n\nLuma AI envisions a future where visual creation is as seamless and accessible as typing text. Dream Machine bridges this gap, making advanced generative tools usable for everyone, from hobbyists to industry professionals.\n\n\u201cWhy should creating images and videos be as hard as using Adobe\u2019s tools? Imagine if making text was that difficult\u2014there\u2019d be no digital revolution. Visual thought should be just as accessible,\u201d Jain argued.\n\nBeyond accessibility, the platform introduces groundbreaking capabilities for video creation. Users can animate storylines with consistent characters derived from a single image, opening new doors for storytelling.\n\n\u201cYou can now create infinite variations of a person from just one image. This consistency allows for entire storylines in videos with the same character\u2014something that hasn\u2019t existed in video creation until now,\u201d Jain said.\n\nNew image generation model Photon\n\nAt the core of these advancements is Luma Photon, the company\u2019s latest image foundation model, which generates high-quality still images from text prompts \u2014 and includes \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d embedded text, something many other image generation models still struggle to accomplish reliably.\n\nPhoton is built on Luma\u2019s Universal Transformer architecture, which Luma says is eight times faster and more cost-efficient than comparable models.\n\nThis efficiency enables rapid iteration without sacrificing quality, making it ideal for high-demand use cases.\n\n\u201cOur new Photon model is the most creative and personalizable model available today. It adapts in real-time without training, using an advanced universal transform architecture,\u201d Jain explained.\n\nDevelopers can also harness the power of Photon through the Luma AI API, which supports text-to-image, text-to-video and image-to-video transformations. The API ensures privacy for user data and offers scalability for products built on its platform.\n\nNew subscription pricing\n\nThe updated Dream Machine is offered in four pricing tiers:\n\nHobbyists: $9.99/month\n\nExplorers: $29.99/month\n\nProfessionals: $99.99/month\n\nEnterprise: Custom pricing for large teams\n\nThese tiers provide flexibility for users with varying needs, whether they\u2019re creating for personal projects or commercial ventures.\n\nA new era of possibilities\n\nSince its founding in 2021, Luma AI has raised $80M in funding from strategic investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Amplify Partners, Matrix Partners, General Catalyst, and South Park Commons.\n\nAnjney Midha, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlighted the platform\u2019s potential to power industries ranging from photorealistic video generation to interactive 3D worldbuilding.\n\nAs Dream Machine evolves, Luma AI is delivering on its mission to democratize creativity. \u201cDream Machine is where you come to visualize what\u2019s in your head. It helps make sense of the increasingly complex world by leveraging AI\u2019s ability to process and simplify vast amounts of information,\u201d Jain concluded.\n\nWith its blend of accessibility, personalization, and cutting-edge technology, Dream Machine is poised to redefine how people create and share their ideas in the digital age.\n\nCorrection: this article originally misstated the amount Luma AI had raised and erroneously mentioned Amazon as an investor. The article has since been updated to the correct number and investor list."

            "article_content": "Jackie O Henderson has told how she plans to 'trick' her 13-year-old daughter Kitty into a 'demon cleansing' ritual.\n\nThe radio host, 49, and her best friend Gemma O'Neill laughed about the bizarre scenario as they recorded the Manifesting episode of their Her Best Life podcast on Friday.\n\nThe single mothers said they had called back paranormal cleaning specialists the Mystic Mums, after Jackie employed the trio to cleanse herself and her home earlier this month.\n\n'Remember when we got the demons exorcised from the house?' Jackie said on the podcast.\n\n'One of the things they said is, we need to make sure Kitty's clear as well. But we've got to do it in a way that's not going to scare them because I really don't want Kitty to think that she's got some demon attached to her.'\n\n'She does, though,' Gemma said, to which Jackie agreed.\n\nJackie O and her daughter Kitty pictured at Australian Fashion Week in Sydney in May\n\n'She does, okay,' Jackie replied. 'But I don't want that getting back to her.'\n\nThe trio, India, Sharona and Aisling, are working on a show called Mystik3 to educate the general public on their spiritual work.\n\nJackie and Gemma explained how they planned to tell their children that the trio were friends coming over to hang out and then spring a game of 'spiritual cleansing' on them randomly.\n\n'We're going to pretend they're our friends coming around for a cup of tea and then after about 10 minutes we're going to play a game: \"Let's all get our energy cleared and then they're going to bring out the smoke cleansers, the sage, the tools that look like big tongs that pull out the demons.\"\n\n'Oh my god this could go either way.'\n\n'My daughter's going to grow up traumatised, thinking her mum is nuts,' Jackie admitted.\n\nGemma then explained how when she told her son Darcy that they were 'popping round' to Jackie's house to use the swimming pool and see the spiritual specialists, he told her: 'Jackie's a bit silly mum.'\n\nJackie O Henderson hired Mystic Mums (pictured) to perform a second exorcism at her home, this time on her daughter\n\n'Oh great I'm getting the blame!' Jackie screamed. 'Aunty Jackie is whacky. Whacky Jackie.'\n\n'So before they arrive and we have to line the children up for the demon exorcism that they're not across,' Gemma joked.\n\n'I'm sure this is what every mum does with their kids after school on a Friday afternoon.'\n\nJackie has previously spoken about her dealings with the Mystic Mums on Sydney's number one breakfast radio show with her co-host Kyle Sandilands.\n\nShe told Kyle that she'd called in the experts after her sleep tracker picked up a man\u2019s voice which she couldn\u2019t explain and played the 'freaky' audio recording on-air.\n\nJackie is currently renting a house, where she lives with Kitty.\n\nHer best friend Gemma, who has two children, rents a house around the corner from her in Sydney.\n\n'Apparently there\u2019s demons in both houses and a demon attached to me as well. Trust me when I say these women know what they\u2019re doing,' she told him.\n\nThe podcast duo went on to reiterate that they're both 'big believers' in spirituality and in manifestation and meditation."

            "article_content": "\u2018The Activated Man\u2019 Exclusive Clip Features Tony Todd In His Final Lead Role\n\nJust when this year felt like it couldn\u2019t get any worse, we lost genre icon Tony Todd unexpectedly. The Candyman himself shaped the horror genre with each of his iconic performances, and that legacy extends into now, with the upcoming release of Nicholas Gyeney\u2019s supernatural thriller The Activated Man. The film marks Todd\u2019s final lead role, and we have an exclusive clip featuring the icon below.\n\nRead the full synopsis below:\n\nOrs Gabriel is an everyman who loses his beloved dog, Louis. His grief spurs disturbing visions that cause him to wonder if he\u2019s dealing with the usual highs and lows of a painful loss, or if darker forces are preying on his mind.\n\nIn our exclusive clip, Tony Todd discusses the world of mediums and psychics with Gabriel.\n\nWatch now:\n\nTodd stars in the film with fellow genre icons Sean Young (Blade Runner) and four-time Jason Voorhees, Kane Hodder. Jamie Costa, Andrew Keegan (10 Things I Hate About You), Vladimir Kulich (Vikings), Sab Shimono (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III), and Ivana Rojas (Hulu\u2019s This Fool) also star in the film, with Scott Brown appearing as the villainous \u2018Fedora Man.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Activated Man embarked on its festival run almost one year ago,\u201d said Gyeney. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to be able to share our special film with audiences throughout North America this December. Not only will our film appeal to fans of horror and the paranormal, we believe it also will resonate with those dealing with loss and grief through spirituality.\u201d\n\nTo honor the late Tony Todd, the December 12 premiere will serve as both a night to celebrate the release, and to bid farewell to the star. Two special opening-day screenings in Los Angeles on Friday, December 13 will be fan events with Gyeney and Kane Hodder in attendance to meet fans and give out free exclusive The Activated Man t-shirts designed by popular t-shirt brand Rucking Fotten.\n\nAfter its exclusive premiere, The Activated Man will have a limited theatrical run starting December 13, 2024. It also comes to digital and cable on demand on December 13, 2024."

            "article_content": "Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya has reiterated that his team know what they want, hoping that a win against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday night could achieve them straight qualification to the latter stages of the tournament.\n\nThe Spanish international has been one of Arsenal\u2019s standout players in a challenging start to the season, saving his side with game-defining saves in some important games.\n\nRaya took the number one spot from Aaron Ramsdale back in September 2023 and hasn\u2019t looked back, becoming a stalwart under Mikel Arteta. Ramsdale has since made the move over to relegation contenders Southampton, while Norberto Neto and Charlie Setford have been brought in as cover for the former Brentford \u2018keeper.\n\n\"I think it's about adaptation. Everything has a process. I know that at the beginning of last season, there was a lot. There was a lot of controversy outside. Since January of this year, it has changed completely. I became more confident. After the summer I felt I was in the right place. It was clear from the performances I was giving.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old has impressed many with his impeccable shot-stopping abilities, denying forwards with one-handed saves, acrobatic efforts and paranormal movements.\n\nHis denial of Ollie Watkins earlier in the season at Villa Park won the Premier League\u2019s \u2018Save of the Month\u2019 award, preventing the England international from close range.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s something that you work on. Like I said before you adapt to a new set of circumstances and a new environment. With the players, it was a matter of time before I could show what kind of goalie I was.\u201d\n\nHowever, tomorrow night sees Raya paired up against one of Europe\u2019s most in-form forwards at the moment. Former Coventry City danger man Viktor Gy\u00f6keres has gone on a scintillating goalscoring riot, scoring 21 goals in all competitions for Sporting this season.\n\n\u201cWe know he is a world-class player and we know his strengths when playing from the back. We will do everything possible to give him no chances and try to keep the goal clean, which is always a great motivation for any goalkeeper.\u201d\n\nRaya is similarly aware of Sporting\u2019s abilities, even without the Swedish bagsman. The Portuguese outfit are top of their league and despite losing their manager, Ruben Amorim, to Manchester United, Joao Pereira seems to have swiftly handled the quick transition over the international break period.\n\n\"It will be a difficult game and we are aware that they have scored a lot of goals in recent games,\u201d Raya said. \u201cBut we are focused on our football and we will get the three points. We know that there has been a change of coach, with the departure of Ruben Amorim, but we have studied them well.\"\n\nThe Spaniard also provided his verdict on the new Champions League format and his desire to make the final stages of the tournament. Arsenal impressed many last season but fell at the quarter-final stage, losing 1-0 in the second leg to Bayern Munich, courtesy of Joshua Kimmich\u2019s second-half header.\n\n(Photo by Silas Schueller/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI only had one season in the Champions League before. This season is different. Every three points is important in this competition. We know what we want, which is to qualify straight away. The Champions League is the best competition and we\u2019re really happy to be here.\u201d\n\nRaya\u2019s stellar performances have drawn comparisons to some of the best goalkeepers in the world, namely Thibaut Courtois for his spider-like attributes and outstanding reach. The 29-year-old has been amongst the top in the Premier League, winning the Golden Glove last season and achieving three clean sheets in the league so far.\n\n\n\nThe former Brentford man was quick to negate claims that he is one of the best at the moment, suggesting clearly that Real Madrid\u2019s Courtois \u2018is the best goalkeeper in the world right now\u2019."

            "article_content": "Flagstaff\u2019s Lowell Observatory recently opened the long-awaited Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center. Hundreds of visitors flocked to the new exhibits, which aim to connect people to the universe in unexpected ways. You can feel the texture of Saturn\u2019s rings, jam to the music of interstellar space, and even smell moondust.\n\nA brass band ushers in the ribbon cutting ceremony. Three years of construction and $53 million led up to this moment. Despite gray skies and a few flakes of snow, a large crowd is on hand to give a resounding cheer as the doors officially open.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Lowell Observatory's sole trustee, William Lowell Putman, cuts the red ribbon to officially open the doors to the Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nLowell Observatory has been an active research facility for more than a century (it\u2019s famous for the discovery of Pluto in 1930) but executive director Amanda Bosh says bringing in the public is part of their mission, too.\n\n\"It\u2019s not enough to just learn things about the universe,\" Bosh says. \"If you don\u2019t spread that out and tell everybody else about it, then it doesn\u2019t benefit people as much as it could, so that is a big part of who we are and what we do.\"\n\nFor Bosh, it\u2019s about expanding perspectives: \"Connecting to the night sky connects us to who we are, how we came to be humans.\"\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Exhibits in the Stardust gallery at Lowell Observatory's new Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nThat theme is clear in the new Stardust gallery\u2019s interactive exhibits. One family creates a hip hop mix out of the sounds of space, while nearby Haley Johnson uses a touchscreen to design a space mission to Saturn\u2019s largest moon Titan, exclaiming in delight when the activity is finished, \"I did it! I completed my research!\"\n\nFor some in the crowd, Lowell has always been a treasured part of the community. Sandra and Saylor Darling are newlyweds who celebrated their engagement here on Mars Hill.\n\n\"It's so beautiful,\" Sandra says of the new discovery center.\n\n\"This is making me so proud,\" Saylor adds. \"We're going to invite all our friends back.\"\n\nThey each sniff a silver tube that offers a whiff of the hydrocarbons found in moondust, and have wildly different reactions: \"It's almost pleasant,\" Sandra says, while Saylor interrupts: \"I think it's horrid.\"\n\nSamantha Christensen of Lowell Observatory led the design of the new exhibits. \"Everyone learns in a different way, so the more senses we can engage, we figure, the better,\" she says.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Kids play in the children's gallery, which has quieter areas with puzzles and games as well as interactive exhibits and a slide.\n\nShe gestures to the new children\u2019s gallery, where joyful chaos reigns as kids make water vapor rings, toss parachutes into wind tunnels, and launch model rockets. One girl dissolves into giggles when her rocket falls to pieces during launch. Christensen says the hands-on activities teach the scientific process: \"It's an opportunity to fail,\" she says, \"but fail in a fun way.\"\n\nTwelve-year-old Metta Kuehn says the rocket launching is one of her favorite activities: \"You pressurize it,\" she explains, \"and then you hit a button and the rocket shoots. It's really loud but really fun.\"\n\nKuehn has big dreams for her future: she wants to be the first person on Mars.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Opening weekend included live theater performances, a one-person show about the importance of imagination in science.\n\nAnd the kids here may be just starting out with a passion for science, but some grownups in the crowd are coming from illustrious careers. Famed comet hunter David Levy says he first saw Lowell in 1967 before it had a visitor center.\n\n\"Coming here today is like being wrapped in a cloud of passion and love for the night sky,\" Levy says. \"I\u2019ve been happy as a clam all day.\"\n\nAs night falls, visitors make their way to the open-air planetarium on the building\u2019s roof. It\u2019s just like any planetarium except the starry skies are real, not a projection.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Visitors enter the Stardust gallery, which has exhibits that engage nearly all the senses, including smell.\n\nLowell\u2019s historian Kevin Schindler says this is his favorite part: \"Seeing people come up here every night, and listening to them ooh and aah\u2014even if there\u2019s no program or anything, just looking up and seeing the night sky, or seeing the Milky Way in the night sky and being stunned by it.\"\n\nSchindler says they\u2019re all making their own discoveries, just as astronomers have done on this spot for more than a century.\n\n\"The need to explore and to look up and wonder, that\u2019s part of us,\" he says.\n\nA gasp rises from the crowd as they learn a bright star overhead is the planet Saturn. It\u2019s what every scientist and educator at Lowell was waiting for: that moment of awe."

            "article_content": "A recent customer survey by Rockwell Automation shows that improving product quality is considered to be the top accelerant for manufacturing\u2019s digital transition. In addition, survey respondents said the number one area of impact for artificial intelligence (AI) is in closed-loop quality control.\n\nAt Automation Fair 2024, Amanda Thompson, Rockwell Automation product manager for FactoryTalk Analytics VisionAI, held a session highlighting the newest edition of VisionAI that was released in September 2024. This new release of VisionAI addresses the quality and AI capabilities ranked so highly by Rockwell Automation\u2019s customers.\n\nThompson explained that, while VisionAI does leverage machine vision technology, it\u2019s more than a machine vision system. \u201cThis is a quality inspection platform designed to help you understand the quality of the product you're producing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt not only tells you if a part or product is good or bad, it also tells you why.\u201d\n\nShe added that the system can support vision inspection at line speeds up to 500-600 parts per minute, depending on the application, to read barcodes, classify parts for identification and sorting, detect defects on surfaces, perform presence/absence detection and read/verify text.\n\nBeyond inspection, VisionAI also provides traceability so that users can see the images highlighted by the system as defective to drive comparisons with acceptable images and provide proof of specific defects. \u201cVisionAI features root cause analysis capabilities that will tell you why an item failed, and it provides notifications so that detected issues can be addressed immediately,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nIn keeping with Rockwell Automation\u2019s direction of developing AI-powered technologies that depend on end user domain expertise to refine them, Thompson pointed out that VisionAI is a no-code platform designed for operations and quality control personnel and \u201crelies on your expertise to provide the information needed for the system to make good quality decisions.\u201d\n\nVisionAI architecture and operation\n\nThe architecture of VisionAI stretches from the cloud to the edge, incorporating embedded analytics, data storage, and application programming interfaces for integrations with manufacturing execution and enterprise resource planning systems. The cloud hosts the AI engine and remote access features for monitoring, management, and deployment of VisionAI's edge functionalities. At the edge are local hardware such as edge computers, human machine interfaces, PLC integration and the vision system cameras, lenses and lighting.\n\nThompson noted that VisionAI currently works with Basler cameras but support for more third-party vision systems will be announced in 2025.\n\nExplaining how VisionAI works, Thompson said the first step is for the user to \u201cdefine the type of inspection they want VisionAI to run. Then they can start capturing images and labeling them as good or bad. The number of images needed to train the system will depend on the type of inspection.\u201d\n\nShe added that VisionAI provides a chart for image training that shows the user when enough images have been supplied to successfully train the model. A training report generated by VisionAI shows the model accuracy as it\u2019s developed to indicate if you\u2019ve labeled images incorrectly and allows users to correct them to improve accuracy before deployment.\n\nOnce the cloud-based model has been trained, it\u2019s then deployed to the edge where up to eight cameras can be supported on one system, with live camera feed capabilities available on site and via remote access.\n\n\u201cThe defect carousel feature shows failed images, which lets users double-click on the images to learn more about the failure reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cVisionAI also aggregates data across systems and time periods so that the system\u2019s dashboard supports comparison of batches, stations, production days and other factors to support specific troubleshooting needs.\u201d\n\nQuality reports are generated directly by VisionAI so that every stakeholder receives the same report.\n\nThompson added that VisionAI\u2019s remote access also lets users label images so that they can train and deploy models even if they are not on site. \u201cPlus, version control allows users to see when models were changed so that if a new model doesn\u2019t perform as expected, you can revert back to a previously deployed model,\u201d she said.\n\nIndustry applications\n\nThompson noted several different industry applications suitable for VisionAI, including:\n\nPackaging. VisionAI can do numerous packaging inspections, such as checking a bottle for defects, checking the expiration date and time stamps on labels, and assessing a cap to see if it\u2019s twisted correctly or leaking. Thompson pointed out that all of these inspections can be done at the same time with VisionAI to provide one quality result for the product. She added that VisionAI works on a recipe concept. \u201cIf you are running different shampoo brands on a line and you want to run a slightly different set of inspections, you can create an inspection recipe per product or SKU,\u201d she said.\n\nFood and Beverage. VisionAI can identify issues even on complex backgrounds. For example, it can be used to inspect cereal as it passes on a conveyor to verify correct shape and color and to flag imperfections or foreign objects. It can also assess the placement of toppings on a product to identify issues like gaps in topping placement on bagels or doughnuts.\n\nAutomotive. Applications here can include presence/absence of required labels, verification of correct label placement, identification of wrinkles/bunching on car seat covers and note the specific area on the seat where these wrinkles are located for ease of physical assessment."

Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to do so alone, since we\u2019ve got everything you need to know about the latest macOS updates.\n\nShould you upgrade to the newest macOS release, and how do you do that in the first place? How does it compare to older versions of macOS \u2014 and, indeed, Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system? We\u2019ve set out to answer all those questions and more, giving you all that you need to know when it comes to the newest macOS update.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nmacOS Sequoia\n\nThe latest macOS release is macOS Sequoia, which launched on September 16, 2024, and it comes with a host of new features for your Mac. Perhaps the most significant addition is Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s own AI system. This brings new powers to Siri, can create images and text based on a few quick prompts, summarizes notifications so you\u2019re less distracted, better organizes your email, and much more.\n\nAnother worthwhile new feature is iPhone Mirroring. Here, connecting your iPhone to your Mac now places a virtual mockup of your phone on your computer\u2019s desktop, allowing you to run apps, see notifications, and drag and drop content from one to the other.\n\nAnd Apple has revamped a bunch of its macOS apps, too. There\u2019s a new Passwords app, window tiling is far more powerful, there are new text and image effects in Messages, you can create custom routes in Maps, and the Notes app can transcribe audio and carry out mathematical equations.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely an update worth checking out for the iPhone Mirroring feature alone.\n\nRecent macOS updates\n\nmacOS Sonoma (2023): Released in 2023, its new features included a new Lock Screen design and moving screen savers that slowed down and settled into new wallpapers. You could place interactive widgets on your desktop, while Safari got new profiles that kept bookmarks, extensions, and cookies separate. Gaming also got some love with the addition of Game Mode and the Game Porting Toolkit. When macOS Sonoma launched, Apple dropped support for Macs released in 2017.\n\nmacOS Ventura (2022): Ventura saw the Stage Manager productivity feature, which grouped open apps and windows into a sidebar on the left-hand side of your screen. Elsewhere, there were new Weather, Clock, and Freeform apps, support for passkeys in Safari, a new high-security Lockdown mode, and an upgrade to the Metal 3 graphics engine. Apple also introduced Continuity Camera, which allowed an iPhone to be used as a Mac webcam. Macs released in 2015 and 2016 were no longer supported when macOS Ventura launched.\n\nmacOS Monterey (2021): One of this update\u2019s best features was Universal Control \u2014 when enabled, you could use one mouse and keyboard for multiple devices, with the pointer moving across screens. It even allowed you to seamlessly drag files across connected products. We also got the Shortcuts and TestFlight apps on the Mac, Live Text, and Visual Look Up for images, plus SharePlay video controls in FaceTime. Apple ended support for Macs from 2013 and 2014 with the launch of macOS Monterey.\n\nmacOS Big Sur (2020): This was macOS\u2019 first major visual redesign since OS X Yosemite in 2017, and it helped bring the Mac operating system right up to date. Aside from that, Apple added support for its Apple silicon chips, which meant iOS and iPadOS apps could run natively on the Mac. There was new functionality in Safari, Messages, and other apps, plus the porting of the Control Center across from the iPhone. Support for Macs from 2012 and early 2013 was ended, however.\n\nmacOS Catalina (2019): This last one that I\u2019ll mention foreshadowed macOS Big Sur\u2019s cross-platform app support by introducing Mac Catalyst, which let developers port their apps from the iPad to the Mac. Strengthening the link was Sidecar, which turned your iPad into a Mac drawing pad. Apple also split iTunes into Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Podcasts, while it also launched Apple Arcade for gamers. As for security, all apps had to be notarized by Apple in order to function properly. If a Mac could run the previous year\u2019s macOS Mojave, it worked with macOS Catalina too, with the exception of Mac Pros launched in 2010 to 2012.\n\nHow to update macOS\n\nIf you want to update your Mac to run the latest version of macOS, the good news is that it\u2019s very simple to do so. It\u2019s also totally free, but you will need to check that your Mac is compatible before starting. Apple explains which Macs can run macOS Sequoia on its website, so be sure to check that out.\n\nTo get started, open the System Settings app on your Mac and head to General > Software Update in the sidebar. When you land on this page, macOS will start searching for updates.\n\nIf an update is found, you\u2019ll see its details listed on the screen. To proceed, select the Update Now button. Your Mac will then download the update.\n\nWhen it\u2019s ready, your Mac will restart and install the new version of macOS. It might restart several times, so just let it do its thing. When it\u2019s finished, you\u2019ll see the macOS login page.\n\nOn the Software Update page, it\u2019s a good idea to enable the checkbox next to Automatically keep my Mac up to date. That way, you\u2019ll get important feature and security updates as soon as they\u2019re available.\n\nDifferences between macOS and Windows\n\nPeople often wonder whether they should use macOS or Windows, and the two rival operating systems have a lot in common since the Windows 11 update rolled out since 2021. There are plenty of differences between them though.\n\nOne of the first things people notice when coming to macOS first is the basic UI. Windows has a taskbar whereas macOS has the Dock. Both are used to launch apps but have slightly different looks and features. Aside from the taskbar, you can open apps in Windows with the Start menu. In macOS there\u2019s the Launchpad and the Applications folder, plus the aforementioned Dock.\n\nVarious operating system features work a little differently, too. That includes how to take a screenshot, how to use Split View for multitasking, how to accessing menus within apps (macOS has the menu bar and Windows puts menus inside the apps themselves), and much more. There are also different key layouts and keyboard shortcuts, although they\u2019re not hugely dissimilar. If you\u2019re using a MacBook or Magic Trackpad, there are some gestures you\u2019ll want to know.\n\nOn a software level, you might not find the same apps on both operating systems. While many apps work perfectly well on both macOS and Windows, some are exclusive to one system or the other. That extends to games, where you\u2019ll find many of the best games are not available on the Mac (although that\u2019s starting to change).\n\nArtificial intelligence has exploded in recent years, and this is a key difference between macOS and Windows. Both systems use AI, but the specific AI systems vary: macOS has Apple Intelligence and Windows has Copilot. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, so it\u2019s worth checking out our full breakdowns of Apple Intelligence and Microsoft Copilot to find out more."
