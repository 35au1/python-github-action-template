It\u2019s a collection of 50 original 8-bit games that both reference gaming history and iterate on it. Even with a handful of misses in the oddball package, these are lovingly crafted retro throwbacks that encapsulate what made that creative era of gaming so special. It\u2019s also a game that is invested in creating a fiction that its players will buy into. The invented premise is that all of these games were created by a cult classic studio named UFO Soft in the 1980s. It\u2019s a fictional company with very real roots in pioneers like Jeff Minter\u2019s Llamasoft.\n\nTo properly communicate how well UFO 50 builds that fiction, we decided to take a structural swing of our own crafted from the same historical roots. The below review imagines a fictional Digital Trends Magazine, modeled after historic gaming publications like Zzap!64. It is both a review of all 50 games in the collection, as well as a fictional play about three critics that unfolds through their writing over an eight-year span. If you\u2019re just here for a straight recommendation, UFO 50 will give you more value for your buck than any game released in 2024. But if you\u2019re willing to get a little experimental with us, read on.]\n\nHappy New Year, Trendsetters! We have a good feeling that 1992 is going to be a great year for video games, especially with the continued rise of the Super Nintendo. We\u2019ll have plenty of great games to review this year, but before barreling forward, we wanted to take a moment to reflect. Sometimes we\u2019re so focused on the future of tech here at Digital Trends Magazine that we lose sight of the games, developers, and lost eras that brought us so much joy. It\u2019s with that thought that we present a very special issue.\n\nThis year marks the 10-year anniversary of UFO Soft (originally known as LX Systems). The eccentric developer was a staple of the 8-bit era, reaching cult classic status after releasing a barrage of 50 games between 1982 and 1989 on LX home computers. Its wide-ranging catalog represents what we love about video games. The bulk of these games carry an oddball creative spirit. They are not afraid to experiment with new ideas, or iterate on old ones in ways that make them feel brand new. Even its \u201cduds\u201d are at least interesting failures that reach for innovation rather than playing it safe. And all of those games are lovingly crafted with memorable visual and sound design that showcases how expressive 8-bit tech could be.\n\nTo celebrate that achievement, we\u2019ve put together this issue as a comprehensive retrospective on UFO Soft. In these pages, you\u2019ll find every single review we published for the studio\u2019s games over the years. These works paint a picture of a changing era as the shape-shifting joys of gaming\u2019s Wild West days slowly coalesced into repeatable formulas and franchises of rising scale, sometimes to the detriment of even these games.\n\nThis was a great time of change for Digital Trends Magazine, too. Our own writers went through their own transformation during this eight-year span. Their outlooks on art and life morphed alongside these games and the real-world tragedies surrounding them, including the shocking death of one of our own critics. This UFO 50 issue is not just a fun excuse to revisit some old games; it\u2019s a reminder that our worlds are ever-shifting.\n\nOur very own Mark Kemp put it best in his landmark review of Mortol 2: \u201cGames, like lives, are fragile things. Cradle them carefully in your hands as long as you can before they become fading memories.\u201d\n\n~ Amelia Bancroft, Editor in Chief\n\nBarbuta (1982)\n\nArthur Webb: Exploring a winding castle, collecting gold, and dodging devious traps. It all sounds like the recipe for a grand adventure. So then why am I so bored? My gran moves faster than this plodding hero, and the only danger she\u2019s running from is gout! This sprawling play area is too often let down by an overabundance of dead ends and sparse sounds. But I admit, I\u2019m still thinking about this castle\u2019s dense secrets and unexpected tricks even after putting it down. I wish to solve it like a crossword puzzle.\n\nRating: 51%\n\nBug Hunter (1983)\n\nMark Kemp: I\u2019ve slayed more insect baddies than I can count in my life, but never quite like this! Though it took me a few tries to wrap my head around Bug Hunter\u2019s delicate energy and action juggling act, the strategic bug-slaying actions quickly got their hooks in me. With so many special movement and attack patterns to experiment with, all of which change how I manage a lethal grid that fills with evolving nasties on each turn, this is the kind of brainy action you could lose a job to.\n\nRating: 89%\n\nNinpek (1983)\n\nBarty Hughes: Don\u2019t you dare call this another Ninjamania clone! Ninpek brings plenty of new thrills to the trendy action formula. My colourful hero is quite nimble thanks to his second jump (I wish I could do that!), which lets him whiz past enemy attacks as he sends back his shuriken in midair \u2014 just like a real ninja! The use of advanced screen scrolling on the LX just makes that action even more exciting. It\u2019s an easy to learn high-score chase that requires some real discipline to master.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nPaint Chase (1983)\n\nMark Kemp: Paint Chase is a peculiar program that\u2019s more about out-painting rival cars than outracing them. Each level places your car in a small maze, and the goal is to paint as much of the ground as possible by driving over it before the timer runs out. It\u2019s a novel idea helped by a few handy power-ups and nail-biting rounds, but it runs out of gas eventually. For more fun, bring a pal along for some tense two-player battles that are sure to ruin friendships!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nMagic Garden (1984)\n\nBarty Hughes: Aside from showing off the power of the LX-IT\u2019s visual power with its splendid pastel colours, Magic Garden is an otherwise fine program. The player simply walks around a checkered grid picking up blobs, who follow the witch hero like a snake until she drops them off in designated zones to rack up points. It\u2019s pleasant in short bursts, but I can\u2019t say that it fully cast a spell on me! At least these slimes are cute little buggers.\n\nRating: 69%\n\nMortol (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Death is not the end \u2026 or at least it isn\u2019t in the bloody brilliant Mortol. The player embarks on a dangerous quest to save the world of Mortolia. In order to overcome its obstacles, the player can sacrifice one of their 15 lives to stick into a wall like an arrow, turn into a stone, or explode to take out walls and alien nasties. Each decision will let the next summoned soldier move forward by trampling on the remains of their predecessors. Grim, but morbidly fun! Only by using each life wisely to solve the level like a puzzle can the player reach the finish. It\u2019s a suicide mission you\u2019ll want to go on over and over again!\n\nRating: 90%\n\nVelgress (1984)\n\nArthur Webb: Velgress has it all on paper. It requires precise jumping as the pirate Alpha scrambles up a well full of small footholds that crumble almost instantaneously, while blasting baddies or dodging them with her second jump. And yet, it\u2019s all a bit of a science fiction snoozefest with all the repetitive jumping, lame power-ups that can be bought between levels, and a musical ditty that grates after your hundredth death. I\u2019ll give credit where it\u2019s due, though. The fact that the layout of the well changes with each play makes every attempt feel just a bit new. The programmers may be on to something there.\n\nRating: 61%\n\nPlanet Zoldath (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: I must say, this is one of the more cerebral adventure games I\u2019ve played as of late, even if it\u2019s not the most exciting. This vibrant alien planet is filled with mysterious gizmos, resources that power them, and secret areas that can only be accessed by using the right one. It really feels like I\u2019m learning the ins and outs of a foreign world each time I take another crack at its ever-changing map.\n\nRating: 76%\n\nAttactics (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Never before has a program captured the epic scale of war as well as Attactics. The tactical battles here, as soldiers automatically march forward every few seconds, make for a brainy game of split-second decision-making. You\u2019ll feel like a general sending your troops to their death! With several distinct unit types, two-player clashes, and even a never-ending mode, this is the total bloody package!\n\nRating: 84%\n\nDevilition (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Dare I say that LX Systems is becoming devilishly clever? Like Attactics and Bug Hunter, this is another unique strategy game that turns battles against demons into a puzzle. The goal is to rid a checkerboard of beasts by placing down forces with specific attack patterns. Once all are placed to your liking, you choose to detonate one and begin a chain reaction. That is, if you\u2019ve placed your units in the right spot! It\u2019s a bit too hard to keep track of that once I place down a piece, so getting through all 10 boards and protecting the civilians on them requires a lot of concentration. God help you if you accidentally blow a pilgrim to smithereens!\n\nRating: 79%\n\nKick Club (1984)\n\nBarty Hughes: Now here\u2019s a game I can get behind! Football becomes deadly in this famil- friendly sports game where the player kicks their ball to destroy some menacing athletic equipment. It\u2019s an enchanting scenario propped up by pleasant cartoon visuals and jaunty music. It\u2019s perhaps a little too simple to command long-term interest from the tykes, but I\u2019m just glad to be allowed back on the pitch after getting a lifetime ban a few months back (don\u2019t ask!).\n\nRating: 75%\n\nAvianos (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: I can\u2019t make heads or tails of this one \u2026 or should I say beaks or wings? This strategy game imagines a world where birds and dinosaurs have gone to war. I appreciate the idea and the detailed reptile portraits to match it, but its actual battles are a mess. From what I can gather from the unclear instructions and cluttered screen, players take turns gathering resources, summoning monsters, and using them to overtake castles. Oh bother, just devour me already and get it over with!\n\nRating: 55%\n\nMooncat (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: LX Systems has really outdone itself this time. It\u2019s managed to make an adventure game even more frustrating than its dull debut Barbuta. The cryptic art and eerie sounds are enticing, but don\u2019t let those fool you. The strange control scheme and boring level construction aren\u2019t nearly as exciting as its psychedelic world. Don\u2019t bother writing in to complain, Barbuta fans. I\u2019ll send your letters straight to the trash along with this art house rubbish!\n\nRating: 46%\n\nBushido Ball (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: As far as Pong clones go, you could do worse than this straightforward, but thin offering. The twist is that the paddles are replaced with samurai and ninjas who can trick one another with special shots. That freshens up a tired formula a bit, but not enough to cut through the competition. Hey Arthur, how about you let me take some of those artsy games off your hands next time! Why do I get stuck with all the simple ones these days, huh? Don\u2019t you trust me?\n\nRating: 59%\n\nBlock Koala (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: Don\u2019t let these adorable marsupials mislead you. Koala Park will put your brain to the test. Each stage tasks the player with moving a star block to an end goal, but there are pesky number blocks in the way. Creating a clear path becomes a bit of a math problem, as there are rules to remember. For instance, a block can\u2019t push another if the first one has a smaller number value than the other. It might be too tricky for youngsters (or our own Barty) despite its cutesy visuals, but adults will find a lot of tough challenges to crack.\n\nRating: 75%\n\nCamouflage (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: Who\u2019s the dumb one now, Mark? Old Barty boy had no trouble at all with this ingenious puzzle game. The player takes control of a friendly chameleon who must evade the sight line of hungry frogs by properly camouflaging to match the coloured environment. The boys didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be smart enough for this one, but joke\u2019s on them! This is an easy to pick up puzzler that oozes with charm. I made it all the way to level 5 even!\n\nRating: 87%\n\nCampanella (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: Imagine your average program where you duck and dodge through a screen full of obstacles. Now, replace your grounded hero with a spaceship that must be piloted with careful precision. That\u2019s what LX Systems delivers with Campanella, perhaps the most tense game since Lunar Lander (which it no doubt draws inspiration from). If you fly into an obstacle, your ship will shatter into a million pieces! I do have a few qualms. I find the little UFO\u2019s slashing action is too short-ranged, and the music and visuals aren\u2019t up to par with LX sci-fi offerings like Planet Zoldath, but the anxious energy kept my palms constantly coated with a layer of sweat.\n\nRating: 77%\n\nGolfaria (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: By now, our most loyal readers likely know that LX Systems has not taken kindly to my reviews over the past few years. I have been dragged through the mud in several of its newsletters, with so-called visionaries like Thorson Petter calling me a \u201chack.\u201d Well add some more hate mail to the pile, because Golfaria is another stinker! As LX so often tends to do, this game overthinks an ambitious adventure by putting players in control of an unwieldy golf ball. I\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s a cutesy idea, but it\u2019s simply a pain to navigate confusing topography before going over a needless \u201cstroke limit\u201d and getting warped back to faraway checkpoints. LX\u2019s inventive design may be its defining quality, but that strength can just as easily be its weakness.\n\nRating: 57%\n\nThe Big Bell Race (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: Oh, I see how it is. I thought we were all equals here, but no! \u201cCampanella is a high-priority game, Barty! You can\u2019t review it, Barty! Here, why don\u2019t you do the Campanella spinoff racing game that we\u2019re too smart to review instead, Barty!?\u201d Is that how it\u2019s going to be? Well fine. The Big Bell Race is a mediocre racing game hastily built from Campanella\u2019s visuals to capitalize on its instant success. I beat it in 12 minutes. It\u2019s an unremarkable afterthought. I\u2019m starting to know the feeling!\n\nRating: 52%\n\nWarptank (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: This has proved to be a strange year for LX Systems. It may have had a big hit in Campanella, but the company\u2019s offerings have proved divisive. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone will disagree with Warptank. This isn\u2019t just the finest LX offering of 1985; it may just be the best game of this whole year! This mind-bending game has the player controlling a little tank that can warp onto the wall opposite of it. That opens the door for some of the year\u2019s sharpest puzzles. It makes Camouflage look like a baby\u2019s toy!\n\nRating: 88%\n\nWaldorf\u2019s Journey (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: A walrus game. A bloody Walrus game. Is that all I\u2019m good for? You know, I studied at uni like the rest of these tossers. So what if I didn\u2019t attend Oxford? And alright, I flunked out! But that means I have to review the cartoon animal games now? Well, fine. This is a sweet little program about a sleeping walrus who dreams of leaping through the air and collecting fish. It\u2019s a simple little jumping game that can be tricky to control as the player must hold the jump button to move, but it is elevated by some lovely illustrations and a dreamlike musical ditty. But don\u2019t expect another review like this from me this year! New year, new Barty, I say!\n\nRating: 66%\n\nPorgy (1986)\n\nArthur Webb: Well, well, LX Systems has changed its name to UFO Soft. Now, was that to capitalize on the success of Campanella or to salvage their reputation? No matter, because you can smell the LX stink on Porgy. Sure, this is an improvement over Barbuta and the dreadful Mooncat. This submarine exploration game is suitably tense, as the player must find ship upgrades and then return to base to install them before their fuel runs out. But that\u2019s not without frustration, as persistent enemies like sharks can appear at random and ruin a perfectly good dive. It\u2019s another overworked concept, but I\u2019ll be the bigger man and admit that the sprawling ocean play area and loads of upgrades make for a sizable underwater journey.\n\nRating: 73%\n\nOnion Delivery (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: How alien it is to be human! That is the thesis of Onion Delivery, a story of an extraterrestrial forced to spend his menial days delivering vegetables around a chaotic city by car. A troglodyte may tell you that this is a simple-minded driving game with poor controls that render it nearly unplayable. But I beg thee, look beneath the hood. Consider the sharp social satire here about how, uh, cars are \u2026 sort of \u2026 weird. Oh, this isn\u2019t working either.\n\nRating: 45%\n\nCaramel Caramel (1986)\n\nMark Kemp: I can already hear Arthur calling this one \u201coverworked.\u201d What a load of codswallop! Well, let me tell you, Caramel Caramel shows the exact thing I enjoy about UFO Soft. This is your standard scrolling spaceship shoot-\u2019em-up, yes. But it makes that idea new again with a camera function that lets the player attack aliens by taking pictures, a bevy of colourful alien planets, and an imaginative alien world. The appeal of games is the way they build on one another\u2019s ideas. It\u2019s a conversation between programmers who are unafraid to be a little silly, try something new, and reinvent themselves. It\u2019s not the most sophisticated product, but who would root against a spirited underdog?\n\nRating: 76%\n\nParty House (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: This brilliant game about managing a house party is one that\u2019s easy to relate to. Who hasn\u2019t felt like an outcast from the \u201ccool kid\u2019s club\u201d who\u2019s struggling to be let into the party? The goal is simple: throw the ultimate party. To do that, the player collects a set of partygoers, each of which has their own popularity and cash value. Those resources can be used to add more guests to your rolodex or increase the size of the house to invite more guests. All players need to do is open the door to fill the room with guests and amass points to add new ones to the guest list. But watch out! Some guests bring trouble, which can alert the police and shut down the shindig for the night. It\u2019s one of the most clever games UFO Soft has made yet and I simply can\u2019t stop playing it.\n\nRating: 94%\n\nHot Foot (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: Yet another relatable game from UFO Soft! I guess they must be reading my diary! This is a sports game where children play dodgeball with beanbags. It\u2019s a fine adaptation of the schoolyard game that adds special throws and duos combat, but it\u2019s mostly a shallow little sports game that\u2019s only good for a few plays. Do you know what stands out, though? At the start of each round, you and the computer take turns drafting a team from five students. After four are drafted, the last one is left crying on the sidelines. Very sad, wouldn\u2019t you say, readers?\n\nRating: 59%\n\nDivers (1986)\n\nArthur Webb: Oh hardy har har. The fools at UFO Soft must have read my complaints on Porgy and made a much worse underwater adventure to punish me. This aimless exploration game is burdened by dull turn-taking battles, a confusing shop system, and an environment that feels empty, as impressively detailed as it is. This is where Mark and I disagree. Just because a program is doing something different doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s suddenly worthy of praise. Some things, such as a UFO Soft adventure game, are just destined to be unremarkable, no matter how many times they may change their gimmick!\n\nRating: 58%\n\nRail Heist (1987)\n\nBarty Hughes: I bought a motorcycle. That\u2019s right, I\u2019m a wild man now, just like the gun-toting cowboy in Rail Heist. This strategic heist game has the player stealing cash from train cars while avoiding the sight of gunmen. The twist is that the action happens in turns, so the player has a few seconds to move through the train, knock out guards, hide behind walls, or punch holes in the wall to create faster getaway routes. It takes some time to get the hang of, making it one of UFO Soft\u2019s more expert level games. But it\u2019s no match for a dangerous man like me!\n\nRating: 84%\n\nVainger (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: Readers, I come bearing some sad news. Barty is in the hospital. He got into a motorcycle accident. He is in a coma and the doctors don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll wake up. Arthur and I are stunned. Barty didn\u2019t even know how to ride a motorcycle. I guess he just bought one to impress us.\n\nIt\u2019s all weighing heavily on me, so much so that I can\u2019t even get excited about a spiritual follow-up to the excellent Warptank. This larger iteration takes the gravity-shifting hook and applies it to a shoot-\u2019em-up adventure. It\u2019s a thrilling sci-fi action game filled with secrets and an intriguing mystery, though it loses the elegance of its predecessor in its larger scale. I wish I could enjoy it more right now. But like its hero standing on the ceiling, my world is upside down. Maybe a map would help.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nRock On! Island (1987)\n\nArthur Webb: You know, this is the kind of game that we would have just made Barty do. I would have said it was beneath me. Let that big, old oaf take it so I can handle the big adventure games! Maybe I\u2019ve had it wrong all these years. Rock On! Island is, dare I say \u2026 fun? The player places down cavemen who defend their home from waves of dinosaurs with their automatic attacks. It\u2019s not deep, sure, but the light strategy is refreshing after years of reviewing overly complicated games that I don\u2019t even care for. Maybe there is more joy in a simple, easily communicated idea than I had realized. Barty must understand that. I hope to ask him about it one day.\n\nRating: 75%\n\nPingolf (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: This is a fine miniature golf game. You charge your shot and hit a ball toward a hole while avoiding science-fiction obstacles that look like they were pulled out of Campanella. Lose the intergalactic tournament and you can try again. You don\u2019t need me to tell you if you\u2019ll enjoy it. It does what it says on the package, no more, no less.\n\n(Readers, we have heard you. We, too, miss Barty\u2019s odd sense of humour. There is still no word on his recovery, but we will be starting a new writer in the coming months to bring some levity back to this magazine. You will be seeing a lot of him soon, as Arthur has opted to take a sabbatical for the next few months. He says he needs to find himself. Bear with me as I run the show alone for the next month or so.)\n\nRating: 61%\n\nMortol 2 (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: I\u2019ve been thinking about death a lot recently. Not just human death, though that weighs heavy on my mind too. But this video game world is itself always in a cycle of death. Home consoles live out their lives and then fade away. Development studios have their meteoric rises, but we know they will not be around forever. Even franchises like Mortol no doubt have an expiration date. It is too easy to take for granted that this 8-bit era \u2014 its games and its stars, like UFO Soft \u2014 will leave us one day. We will cherish them later in life, looking back on them with fond nostalgia, but it is so easy to forget that in the moment. We must soak in this era of inventive play, one that fights back the tide of commercialization. We must hold on to the strange, quirky games we love, for they will die 100 deaths before we know it.\n\nMortol 2 is a reminder of that truth. In this adventure, the player must navigate a map full of traps and demons, but they only have 100 lives to do it. Like in the first Mortol, these heroes can be sacrificed to help the ones that come later to navigate. One turns into a platform upon their demise. Another leaves behind a teleporter. Each death is a reminder of what came before; lost lives that paved a path for the future. It\u2019s maddeningly difficult, often to a fault, but there is truth in this somber scenario. Let the dead be a monument. Let them be a persistent reminder to embrace the present while it is here. Games, like lives, are fragile things. Cradle them carefully in your hands as long as you can before they become fading memories.\n\nRating: 83%\n\nFist Hell (1987)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Wacky Jerry reporting in for duty all the way from the U.S. of A! Honk honk! I\u2019m new to the team, but I just know we\u2019re going to have fun together! Now, I hope you didn\u2019t just eat, because Fist Hell will make you puke \u2014 in a good way! This gross-out beat-\u2019em-up has you pummeling zombies and werewolves up and down the city streets with your deep arsenal of attacks. It\u2019s like having a Hollywood action movie in your hands. There\u2019s so much blood \u2026 it\u2019s awesome!!! No more of this sci-fi crud or boring puzzles. This is the future of games!!\n\nRating: 85%\n\nOverbond (1987)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Say goodbye to boring old Velgress and say hello to Overbond. This sequel cuts out all the crap like jumping. Instead, the bounty hunter Alpha gets dropped in an arena and she has to survive eight battles against enemies, all while collecting money to upgrade her gear between fights. Best of all? She has a gun! It\u2019s all like POW POW! And then you drop a bomb and they EXPLODE. It\u2019s crazy!!! I wish there were more kinds of guns and blood and stuff, but I think the \u201cshooter\u201d game is going to be big, you watch. I wish every game was like this!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nCampanella 2 (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: Something is changing. I can feel it. Games are getting bigger, more spectacular, but more templatized too. Compare Campanella to its new sequel. The original was a concise concept built on a simple tension. Campanella 2 is bigger. There are on-foot shooting segments, upgrades, and a vast world to explore. It should feel grander. It does, sometimes. But why, I ask, does it feel narrower too? It\u2019s as if UFO Soft\u2019s eclectic vision is all funneling toward one \u201caction-adventure\u201d bucket? What is happening to imaginative games like Bug Hunter or Warptank? Is there still hope that the underdogs can survive?\n\nPlease wake up, Barty.\n\nRating: 73%\n\nHyper Contender (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Hyper Contender is chock-full of action! This fighting game has players beating the snot, and rings, out of one another! The first to get five rings wins the match, so it\u2019s not just about who\u2019s better at punching. That\u2019s a radical spin on the fighting game, even if there aren\u2019t too many modes or characters here. But what I really love is that this game features characters from a bunch of other UFO Soft games! Isn\u2019t that so cool?? Give me more, more, more of my favorite characters please!!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nValbrace (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: This fantasy adventure has shades of classic maze games like 3D Monster Maze, but with more modern RPG touches that you\u2019d see in something like Gauntlet. The player crawls through a labyrinthian dungeon full of traps in search of valuable treasure. It\u2019s a basic concept, but it replaces turn-based encounters against monsters with real-time slashing. It\u2019s a more fast-paced spin on an old formula that fits with UFO Soft\u2019s push toward more mechanically sophisticated action. Won\u2019t Mr. Wack Job be happy to hear it \u2026\n\nRating: 76%\n\nRakshasa (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Namaste, readers. Where have I been the past few months? Well, where haven\u2019t I been? I have cleansed my soul in the waters of the world. I feel refreshed, born anew. How fitting is it, then, that my first task upon returning is writing about the great Rakshasa? At first, this feels similar to the side-scrolling high-score action of Ninpek, but there\u2019s a hopeful twist. Every time the hero dies, their spirit pops out. By dodging enemies and collecting shards, they can bring themselves back to life. It is a game of second, third, and even fourth chances. It posits that there is always hope that we may wipe the slate clean and come back anew. Perhaps I am not fated to become an old grump. And maybe this era of 8-bit games does not have to end with the advent of 16-bit fast approaching. Maybe it too can rise again, a reinvented version of itself crafted by developers who care enough to return to this style of game-making with new ideas. I hope to see that day.\n\nRating: 82%\n\nStar Waspir (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: This space shoot-\u2019em-up is par for the course. Fly a ship through the air, blast baddies, rack up a high score. Its sole innovation is that the enemies drop power-up blocks, with the player needing to collect three. And the ability they ultimately get is determined by which blocks they collect. That adds some mix-and-match potential that upgrades each of the three ships with additional tools like helper drones or more powerful shots. It\u2019s a smaller twist than UFO Soft usually delivers on familiar formulas. Maybe it\u2019s running short on ideas. It must be exhausting to keep this kind of creative pace up. (Sigh, after turning in this draft, the powers-that-be here asked me to include a \u201csecond opinion\u201d from Jerry.)\n\nWacky Jerry: POW! POW! POW! Isn\u2019t it so cool when you get to blast spaceships and watch them explode in fiery glory?? I say, don\u2019t listen to Mark! He\u2019s such a drag! Buy this game today from your local Electro-Mart! Shop today and save 15% off* on a purchase of an LX-III! And don\u2019t forget to spank my butt and call me wacky!\n\n*Terms and conditions apply, see in-store for details.\n\nMark\u2019s Rating: 69%\n\nJerry\u2019s Rating: 90%\n\nGrimstone (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! OK, so you know those lame-o Dragon Quest games? Well what if I told you they made them cool? Grimstone is basically that game but with cowboys and guns! You shoot bandits and monsters in turn-based battles where you need to press a button at the right time to hit. There are tons of towns to explore, horses to ride, and more. It\u2019s a full-on Western fantasy! I\u2019m so glad to see UFO Soft making more games with American sensibilities! Yee-haw partner!!!\n\nRating: 82%\n\nLords of Diskonia (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: Finally, UFO Soft makes a return to the innovative strategy games I came to love them for in 1982. This creative wargame imagines troops as discs that can be flung into one another. Battles see the player bouncing off their foes\u2019 discs to damage them, sending them retreating to their camp to restock. The goal is to eventually overtake their camp after winning battles and pushing them back enough, all while using gold to hire more troops. Perhaps it speaks to me so much because sometimes it feels like we\u2019re always fighting a war in the world of games. There is a push and pull between creativity and safety. More and more, the latter seems to be winning. Games are settling into formulas. The enthusiasts who refuse to question it gain control of the battlefield. The people who care fall one by one. All these forces ricochet into one another, but I fear that it\u2019s the ones with the most gold who will stand tall at the end of the day. What will we lose when the frontlines of creativity fall?\n\nRating: 89%\n\nNight Manor (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky because I\u2019ve got some great news to share today! I\u2019ve been promoted to lead reviewer! Apparently, our bosses love how excited I sound about every game in all my reviews! I\u2019m going to celebrate hard tonight, but first let\u2019s talk about Night Manor because this game is tubular! This is a point-and-click horror game (ew, I know, reading), and it is totally awesome. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat and the atmosphere is total creepsville. And it\u2019s so freaky and bloody! Your parents are gonna flip!\n\nRating: 85%\n\nElfazar\u2019s Hat (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Well, I\u2019m not sure how to say this, but I\u2019m sad \u2014 well more puzzled, I suppose \u2014 to report that Jerimiah Johnson (or Wacky Jerry, as you know him) has passed away. I guess his promotion celebration went awry. Something about a deep-fried turkey and a fireworks snafu. I\u2019ll spare you the details. I have sent word to the elders of Aswan, who I lodged with during my travels to Egypt. With their blessing, may he be born anew in the waters of the Nile.\n\nThere\u2019s no real elegant way to transition to a review of a game about cute animals escaping the clutches of an evil wizard, is there? Well, then I\u2019ll just say that this is a charming little adventure that iterates on Star Waspir\u2019s power-up matching system. This feels like a far more fully realized version of that project, as it combines shoot-\u2019em-up play with a more traditional level-based adventure. It is further proof that a boorish game can get a second life as something vibrant and delightful. I\u2019m sure Jerry would have loved it.\n\nOn second thought, I haven\u2019t the slightest clue. I\u2019m not even sure he played the games he reviewed.\n\nRating: 76%\n\nPilot Quest (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Now, this is something. Imagine a program that you barely have to play at all. That is the conceit of Pilot Quest, a sort of automation game about a spaceman who crash-lands on an alien planet. First, I must smack a crystal to gather some moon resources. But soon, I spend them to create a few plants that automatically produce crystals every second. After a bit of setup, I don\u2019t need to play at all. I leave my LX-III running in the background until I have enough to set up my next task, culminating in me repairing my ship. Occasionally, I can enter a zone for a few minutes to smack enemies with my yo-yo and obtain supplies, but I have gotten so much done as it played itself. I went for a walk. I watched the Goldfinches flutter merrily. What real adventures have I been missing all these years while trudging through digital ones? Like my little spaceman, I yearn for escape.\n\nRating: 78%\n\nMini & Max (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: When Mini & Max begins, I am a little girl locked in a tiny storage room. I can barely move. But soon, my dog, Max, shows me a trick. By holding the down button, I shrink to the size of a bug. Suddenly, that tiny room becomes a sprawling metropolis full of stars to collect, dust bunnies to aid, and abilities that make the world feel even bigger. As an 8-bit game that feels like the last of a dying breed (especially as I hear that Sega\u2019s fancy 16-bit console may be coming to more countries imminently), Mini & Max is a revelation. It is a reminder that there is infinite depth in even the smallest things. These pixel games may seem limited, but UFO Soft continues to show us how boundless they are. Just when it feels like we\u2019ve hit the bottom, we discover a whole subatomic level of design decisions. There is more to explore in this 8-bit world. Why, I wonder, are we so eager to leave uncharted territory behind?\n\nRating: 90%\n\nCombatants (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: Since its second game, UFO Soft have long been obsessed with war. Combatants once again explores that idea, but at an insect level. The player controls an army of ants with a list of commands. They can summon workers to spawn more creepy-crawlies, send them into battle, or tell them to fall back. Rushing in without a plan is a surefire way to lose. These missions are frustrating. You\u2019ll want to throw your controller out the window and give up. But with patience and strategy, there is hope for survival.\n\nOh, I wasn\u2019t going to say this. I fear I\u2019ll jinx it, but \u2026 I visited Barty over the weekend and I swore I saw his eyes flutter. They fluttered! The doctor told me not to get too excited. His condition is unpredictable. I know I should be measured, but I feel a surge of hope. My sweet friend. My eccentric pal, so full of life and spirit. Will you wake up once more? Will you bring back what I was so sure we had lost? For the first time in ages, it feels as though we may win this war yet.\n\nRating: 62%\n\nQuibble Race (1989)\n\nArthur Webb: Readers, forgive me if this week\u2019s writing is sloppy. Mark has gone to be with Barty and I am taking on his work for this issue. I have also consumed a fair amount of opium this week. In any case, Quibble Race is a psychedelic alien racing game that continues UFO Soft\u2019s newfound automation experiments. You do not control your alien racer here. Rather, you bet on a winner, give them illegal boosters, and sabotage your opponents. Perhaps it is just the purple albatross with great wings of water speaking through me, but the less and less I actually have to play these games, the more at peace I become. Peculiar.\n\nRating: 65%\n\nSeaside Drive (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: Yes, yes, Seaside Drive is a blast. It is a brilliant driving-action hybrid in which players shoot at enemies from their convertible while drifting along a highway to charge their weapon\u2019s power. It\u2019s a simple, fun shoot-\u2019em-up concept with great high-score-chasing potential. I don\u2019t mean to rush through it, but I have more important news to share.\n\nI was sitting by Barty\u2019s side on a warm Sunday afternoon. A light beam poked in from the window and warmed his face. As I looked at him, bathed in angelic light, it happened. He woke up. His pupils were red and tired, but I could see that light shining through.\n\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d he said weakly. I could barely speak. My lips too stunned to move.\n\n\u201cBarty. You \u2026 there was \u2026 an accident. You\u2019ve been \u2026 asleep \u2026 for two years.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me, trying to process this, his head ever so slightly cocked to the side.\n\n\u201cDid Campanella 2 come out?\u201d he asked me, his sense of goofball humour awakening before his body.\n\n\u201cBarty,\u201d I said through tears, \u201cThey\u2019re about to release Campanella 3. And I want you to review it.\u201d\n\nRating: 83%\n\nCampanella 3 (1989)\n\nBarty Hughes: In my dreams, I saw UFOs.\n\nIsn\u2019t that something? Bloody UFOs! I don\u2019t remember much about being unconscious for two years, but I remember seeing those little pink buggers flying about. I was afraid they would shatter, as they so easily do in Campanella, but they never did. There were no walls for them to smash against in my dreams. There was only black space stretching to infinity. They could fly on forever.\n\nMark tells me that Campanella 3 is nothing like Campanella 2 even though it features that blasted UFO. I hear it shares more in common with a game called Seaside Drive (oh dear, I have a lot of catching up to do, don\u2019t I?). Mark seemed a bit peeved that the tense ship-flying of the past two games had gone away in favor of a shoot-\u2019em-up with a 3D scrolling trick. Well, that doesn\u2019t bother me very much! I think this is a fun little jolt of action, simple as it may be. And anyways, why would I want to play the same old thing again? I\u2019d be cross if I came out of a bloody coma only to play the same game again!\n\nWhen I told Mark that, he looked surprised. We got to talking and he told me that he\u2019s just afraid that everything is changing. He doesn\u2019t know where games are going with this 16-bit world coming, and he hears rumors that UFO Soft may be on the verge of closing its doors soon. I told him he worries too much! It\u2019s not like his memories of the 8-bit age are going to shatter when the Sega system comes to the United Kingdom! You don\u2019t have to lock the past in a storage closet full of junk to crash into. Let those UFOs loose into the night sky where they belong. They\u2019ll always wave down to us with their blinking lights.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe they\u2019ll touch down on Earth again once they\u2019ve explored the deepest reaches of space and find something new to show us!\n\nRating: 81%\n\nCyber Owls (1989)\n\nArthur Webb: It\u2019s the end of the world as we know it and only a gang of militarized owls can save it. Cyber Owls takes the player through four missions with very different playstyles, from a standard beat-\u2019em-up to a motorbike chase to a top-down stealth infiltration segment. It\u2019s action-packed, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s the last game I will ever review.\n\nYes, I am retiring, dear reader, to pursue a new career in bird conservation. The Cyber Owls may defend the world from harm, but who will protect the real owls in our own world? Don\u2019t let anyone tell you there\u2019s no such thing as second chances \u2014 especially me! As the great wise men of Chaukhamba once told me, resurrection is not so much a miracle as it is a trust that even the simplest things contain an infinite capacity for reinvention. There may yet be a future within the past. Or something like that. Namaste, readers. May you rise anew one day.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nIn loving memory of Jerimiah \u201cWacky Jerry\u201d Johnson."

        "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nBack on August 4, 1990, two men were northwest of Perth in Calvine, just on the edge of Scotland\u2019s Cairngorms National Park, when they snapped a photo of a UFO that became known as the \u201cCalvine Photograph.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCalvine Photograph\u201d has gone on to be called by some, the most spectacular UFO picture ever captured.\n\nThe photos the men took were turned over to Scotland\u2019s Daily Record newspaper who then gave them to Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense (MoD).\n\nFor over 30 years, the infamous UFO photos were never published and never made them available to the public, and were considered to be lost until 2023.\n\nAndrew Robinson, a senior lecturer in photography at Sheffield Hallam University, who examined the \u201cCalvine Photograph,\u201d said after examining it last year, \u201cMy conclusion is that the object is definitely in front of the camera, that is, it\u2019s not a fake produced in post-production, and its placement within the scene appears to be approximately halfway between the foreground fence and the plane in the background.\u201d\n\nNo one, however, has ever been able to discern exactly what the UFO in the photographs actually was. At least not until now. Maybe.\n\n\u201cLuckily I have recently had access to retired CID Officer John Hanson\u2019s UFO archive in Stratford Upon Avon. It\u2019s a treasure trove of UFO sightings going back to the 1940\u2019s,\u201d said UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee.\n\n\u201cFrom going through all these documents there seems to have been a lot of sightings of diamond shaped crafts since the 1970\u2019s and especially around UK military bases.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a connection \u2013 is the Calvine UFO a secret military technology either of ours or an adversary that has been kept secret? Why is this diamond shaped craft seemingly accompanied by military jets?\u201d\n\nAnother researcher who has inspected the photos, Mike Bara, offers a slightly different take.\n\n\u201cWhat you are looking at here is not a flying UFO, but something else,\u201d Bara recently stated. \u201cThe Calvine UFO lines up with the mountain in the background perfectly. So what happened?\n\n\u201cI think it is pretty obvious what happened. There was an inverted cloud layer here, fog, down on the ground in the valley, probably right up to the fence and they took a picture of the Harrier Jet, which was streaking around for whatever reason, maybe doing exercises, and the peak of this background mountain was sticking through the clouds, probably at about 2,500 feet.\n\n\u201cTwo guys took a picture of a Harrier and then realized there looked like there was a UFO and probably thought why don\u2019t we turn it into the press to maybe get some money. The Calvine UFO is not a UFO, it is not a flying object. I understand that for some people this is going to be hard to take but you have to go where the evidence goes. We can say the Calvine UFO mystery is solved.\u201d\n\nBut has it really been solved?\n\nThe two men who took the Calvine photographs have never been identified and the MoD suspiciously says they won\u2019t be revealing their names anytime before the year 2076, citing \u201cprivacy concerns.\u201d Why?"

        "article_content": "Microsoft is unveiling new features in its $30 per user Microsoft 365 Copilot monthly subscriptions that are designed to improve AI integration inside of Office apps. Excel is getting Python integration inside of Copilot, PowerPoint has an improved AI-powered narrative builder, Word is getting better at AI-assisted drafts, and Copilot will be able to help you organize your Outlook inbox, too.\n\nAfter bringing Python to Excel last year, Microsoft is now combining its Python support with Copilot to let Excel users easily perform advanced analysis on spreadsheet data. \u201cNow, anyone can work with Copilot to conduct advanced analysis like forecasting, risk analysis, machine learning, and visualizing complex data \u2014 all using natural language, no coding required,\u201d says Jared Spataro, corporate vice president of AI at work at Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s like adding a skilled data analyst to the team.\u201d\n\nThe Copilot and Python integration inside of Excel enters public preview today, just as Microsoft makes Copilot in Excel generally available to its Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers. Microsoft has also added Copilot support for XLOOKUP and SUMIF, conditional formatting, and the ability for the AI assistant to produce more charts and PivotTables.\n\nCopilot in PowerPoint is also getting improvements, with an improved narrative builder that\u2019s designed to let you quickly create a first draft of a slide deck. The AI assistant will even soon use a company\u2019s branded template to create drafts or company-approved images from SharePoint libraries.\n\nCopilot in Microsoft Teams will summarize conversations that happened in the text chat as well as spoken ones in meetings later this month. This will help meeting organizers make sure they didn\u2019t miss any unanswered questions that were typed into the chat. \u201cOur customers tell us Copilot in Teams has changed meetings forever \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the number one place they\u2019re seeing value,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nCopilot is getting more useful inside of Outlook inboxes. Image: Microsoft\n\nI\u2019ve personally been waiting for improvements to Copilot in Outlook beyond drafting and summaries, and now Microsoft is starting to allow its AI assistant to organize your inbox. A new \u201cprioritize my inbox\u201d feature lets Copilot automatically prioritize emails. Later this year, you\u2019ll also be able to \u201cteach Copilot the specific topics, keywords, or people that are important to you,\u201d according to Spataro. These emails will then also be marked as high priority in your inbox.\n\nLater this month, Microsoft is also improving Copilot in Word to let you reference data from emails and meetings, alongside data from documents. This will make it easier to bring in attachments from emails or entire talking points from meetings. Microsoft is also rolling out Copilot in OneDrive later this month, making it easy to summarize and compare up to five files to spot differences between them.\n\nOneDrive\u2019s file comparison tool. Image: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s improvements to Copilot in Office are designed to make the AI assistant more enticing to businesses, alongside a new Copilot Pages feature and AI agents that will automate certain tasks. Recent reports have suggested there has been a lukewarm reception to Microsoft\u2019s paid Copilot version for businesses, due to bugs and a reluctance to pay the $30 per user price."

Gates has said whoever wins the battle for releasing the most capable AI agents may quickly eclipse other companies, since the AI agents could obviate the need for users to directly interact with sites such Amazon or Google, and may reduce the need for people to use many kinds of business productivity software, from word processors and spreadsheets to enterprise resource planning tools.\n\n\n\nGoogle is known to be working on AI agents of its own, while Apple and Amazon have been trying to update their existing digital assistants, Siri and Alexa, with newer generative AI engines to give them the power to perform many more tasks than they can currently.\n\n\n\nThe Microsoft AI agents are part of a larger of update to Microsoft 365 Copilot that also includes added AI features in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and One Drive.\n\n\n\nThe update also includes a new document type for BizChat\u2014a feature Microsoft introduced in March 2023 where different kinds of customer data types can live, allowing Copilot to draw on them when generating responses. The new document is called Pages and it is a kind of collaborative work surface for both human coworkers and AI digital assistants to share. Microsoft is calling it \u201cthe first real digital artIfact for the AI era.\u201d But it is essentially a kind of digital corkboard onto which other kinds of files can be posted, allowing both humans and AI agents to work simultaneously across them, and making the transfer of data between the files more seamless than with Microsoft\u2019s existing SharePoint and Teams products.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft first rolled out Copilot, as it has branded its generative AI offering in its 365 business productivity suite, in November 2023. While the product has seen widespread adoption by large companies, some chief information officers have complained that their employees have not found use cases for the AI features that justify the $30 per user per month price Microsoft charges. A few companies have even decided to ditch Copilot or have restricted how widely it is available within their organization.\n\n\n\nJared Spataro, Microsoft corporate vice president for AI@Work, told Fortune that Microsoft has taken on board such feedback, engaging with more than 1,000 customers and rolling out more than 700 updates to its Copilot product since it launched.\n\n\n\nHe said that the most popular Copilot feature has been the ability of the AI software to automatically summarize Teams meetings. He said Microsoft realized it needed to find AI features that would produce a similar \u201cspark\u201d with customers across the other 365 apps\u2014\u201cthat thing that, now you\u2019ve seen this and worked with it, you don\u2019t want to work without it,\u201d he said. Spataro said Microsoft believed it had now found such \u201csparks\u201d for Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook and was rolling those out in this latest Copilot update.\n\n\n\nThe main feature enhancement for Excel is the ability for generative AI to automatically compose code in Python directly in Excel and use that to automatically run sophisticated data analysis tasks, including forecasting and data visualization, for users.\n\n\n\nIn PowerPoint, Microsoft is launching a feature called \u201cNarrative Builder\u201d that will let users have a back-and-forth conversation with a generative AI design tool and iteratively edit and improve the PowerPoint deck. While the previous version of 365 Copilot included a generative AI feature that could build a deck from a prompt, users found it did not offer the ability to then easily continue to refine the deck through a dialogue with the AI chatbot.\n\n\n\nFor Outlook, Microsoft is unveiling an AI feature called \u201cPrioritize My Inbox\u201d that Microsoft says will provide personalized, and sophisticated, prioritization of emails.\n\nThe new genAI features for the 365 apps will be included in the current price of Copilot. But Spataro said Microsoft was still working out how the AI agent capabilities will be priced.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft also reiterated that even users of its free Copilot chatbot enjoyed data privacy protections, meaning that documents or conversations with the chatbot are not used for training future AI systems and even queries that Copilot sends to Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine are anonymized so they can\u2019t be linked back to the user.\n\n\n\nJamie Teevan, Microsoft\u2019s chief scientist, said she was excited to research how people could best work with new generative AI tools, particularly agents. She said Microsoft was investigating three essential aspects of working with AI agents. The first is intent expression, which has to do with how users can be sure to convey their intentions to the agent so that the agent correctly completes specific tasks without doing things the user doesn\u2019t want the agent to do.\n\n\n\nShe said Microsoft was still working to figure out things such as when and how the agent should ask the user clarifying questions to better understand their intent and how and when the agent should interrupt users to offer suggestions. Microsoft is keen to avoid repeating the experience many users had with Clippy, a much-derided early AI assistant it rolled out in Microsoft Word (\u201cI see you are writing a business letter!\u201d) whose interjections users often found intrusive and unhelpful.\n\n\n\nThe other two areas Microsoft researchers are keen to figure out as it rolls out agents is around persistence (what should the agent remember about the user or the project, and how much of this should it retain even across projects) and collaboration.\n\n\n\nTeevan said that Microsoft has realized that many Copilot users may not be seeing the full value of the product because they don\u2019t know the best ways to use it, so the company has begun rolling out more of what it calls \u201cprompt support\u201d\u2014which are basically suggested prompts and suggestions for using Copilot to derive business value.\n\n\n\nUpdate, Sept. 16: This story has been updated to clarify the relationship between BizChat and Pages."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nNvidia has long dominated the market in compute hardware for AI with its graphics processing units (GPUs). However, the Spring 2024 launch of Cerebras Systems\u2019 mature third-generation chip, based on their flagship wafer-scale engine technology, is shaking up the landscape by offering enterprises an innovative and competitive alternative.\n\nThis article explores why Cerebras\u2019 new product matters, how it stacks up against both Nvidia\u2019s offerings and those of Groq, another new startup providing advanced AI-specialized compute hardware and highlights what enterprise decision-makers should consider when navigating this evolving landscape.\n\nFirst, a note on why the timing of Cerebras\u2019 and Groq\u2019s challenge is so important. Until now, most of the processing for AI has been in the training of large language models (LLMs), not in actually applying those models for real purposes. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs have been extremely dominant during that period. But in the next 18 months, industry experts expect the market to reach an inflection point as the AI projects that many companies have been training and developing will finally be deployed. At that point, AI workloads shift from training to what the industry calls inference, where speed and efficiency become much more important. Will Nvidia\u2019s line of GPUs be able to maintain top position?\n\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model evaluates new data and produces results\u2013 for example, during a chat with an LLM, or as a self-driving car maneuvers through traffic\u2013as opposed to training, when the model is being shaped behind the scenes before being released. Inference is critical to all AI applications, from split-second real-time interactions to the data analytics that drive long-term decision-making. The AI inference market is on the cusp of explosive growth, with estimates predicting it will reach $90.6 billion by 2030.\n\nHistorically, AI inference has been performed on GPU chips. This was due to GPUs general superiority over CPU at the parallel computing needed for efficient training over massive datasets. However, as demand for heavy inference workloads increases, GPUs consume significant power, generate high levels of heat and are expensive to maintain.\n\nCerebras, founded in 2016 by a team of AI and chip design experts, is a pioneer in the field of AI inference hardware. The company\u2019s flagship product, the Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), is a revolutionary AI processor that sets a new bar for inference performance and efficiency. The recently launched third generation CS-3 chip boasts 4 trillion transistors, making it the physically largest neural network chip ever produced\u2013at 56x larger than the biggest GPUs it is closer in size to a dinner plate than a postage stamp. It contains 3000x more on-chip memory. This means that individual chips can handle huge workloads without having to network, an architectural innovation that enables faster processing speeds, greater scalability, and reduced power consumption.\n\nThe CS-3 excels with LLMs; reports indicate that Cerebras\u2019 chip can process an eye-watering 1,800 tokens per second for the Llama 3.1 8B model, far outpacing current GPU-based solutions. Moreover, with pricing starting at just 10 cents per million tokens, Cerebras is positioning itself as a competitive solution.\n\nThe need for speed\n\nGiven the demand for AI inference, it is no surprise that Cerebras\u2019 impressive stats are drawing industry attention. Indeed, the company has had enough early traction that its press kit cites several industry leaders lauding its technology.\n\n\u201cSpeed and scale change everything,\u201d according to Kim Branson, SVP of AI/ML at GlaxoSmithKline, where the boost provided by Cerebras\u2019 CS-3 has reportedly improved the company\u2019s ability to handle massive datasets for drug discovery and analysis.\n\nDenis Yarats, CTO of Perplexity, sees ultra-fast inference as the key to reshaping search engines and user experiences. \u201cLower latencies drive higher user engagement,\u201d said Yarats. \u201cWith Cerebras\u2019 20x speed advantage over traditional GPUs, we believe user interaction with search and intelligent answer engines will be fundamentally transformed.\u201d\n\nRussell d\u2019Sa, CEO of LiveKit, highlighted how Cerebras\u2019 ultra-fast inference has enabled his company to develop next-gen multimodal AI applications with voice and video-based interactions. \u201cCombining Cerebras\u2019 best-in-class compute with LiveKit\u2019s global edge network has allowed us to create AI experiences that feel more human, thanks to the system\u2019s ultra-low latency.\u201d\n\nThe competitive landscape: Nvidia vs. Groq vs. Cerebras\n\nDespite the power of its technology, Cerebras faces a competitive market. Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI hardware market is well established, with its Hopper GPUs being a staple in training and running AI models. Compute on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs is available through cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure and Nvidia\u2019s established market presence gives it a significant edge in terms of ecosystem support and customer trust.\n\nHowever, the AI hardware market is evolving, and competition is intensifying. Groq, another AI chip startup, has also been making waves with its own inference-focused language processing unit (LPU). Based on proprietary Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) technology, Groq also boasts impressive performance benchmarks, energy efficiency and competitive pricing.\n\nDespite the impressive performance of Cerebras and Groq, many enterprise decision-makers may not have heard much about them yet, primarily because they are new entrants to the field and are still expanding their distribution channels, whereas Nvidia GPUs are available from all major cloud providers. However, both Cerebras and Groq now offer robust cloud computing solutions and sell their hardware. Cerebras Cloud provides flexible pricing models, including per-model and per-token options, allowing users to scale their workloads without heavy upfront investments. Similarly, Groq Cloud offers users access to its cutting-edge inference hardware via the cloud, boasting that users can \u201cswitch from other providers like OpenAI by switching three lines of code\u201d. Both companies\u2019 cloud offerings allow decision-makers to experiment with advanced AI inference technologies at a lower cost and with greater flexibility, making it relatively easy to get started despite their smaller market presence compared to Nvidia.\n\nHow do the options stack up?\n\nNvidia\n\nPerformance : GPUs like the H100 excel in parallel processing tasks, but cannot match the speed of the specialized CS-3 and LPU for AI inference.\n\n: GPUs like the H100 excel in parallel processing tasks, but cannot match the speed of the specialized CS-3 and LPU for AI inference.

While Nvidia remains the market leader, the emergence of Cerebras and Groq offers compelling alternatives to watch. Long the gold standard of AI compute, Nvidia GPU now appears as a general tool made to do a job, rather than a specialized tool optimized for its purpose. Purpose-designed AI chips such as the Cerebras CS-3 and Groq LPU may represent the future.\n\nHere are some steps that business leaders can take to navigate this changing landscape:\n\nAssess Your AI Workloads: Determine whether your current and planned AI workloads could benefit from the performance advantages offered by Cerebras or Groq. If your organization relies heavily on LLMs or real-time AI inference, these new technologies could provide significant benefits. Assess Cloud and Hardware Offerings: Once your workloads are clearly defined, evaluate the cloud and hardware solutions provided by each vendor. Consider whether using cloud-based compute services, investing in on-premises hardware, or taking a hybrid approach will most suit your needs. Evaluate Vendor Ecosystems: Nvidia GPU compute is widely available from cloud providers, and its hardware and software developer ecosystems are robust, whereas Cerebras and Groq are new players in the field. Stay Agile and Informed: Maintain agility in your decision-making process, and ensure your team stays informed about the latest advancements in AI hardware and cloud services.\n\nThe entry of startup chip-makers Cerebras and Groq into the field of AI inference changes the game significantly. Their specialized chips like the CS-3 and LPU outperform the Nvidia GPU processors that have been the industry standard. As the AI inference technology market continues to evolve, enterprise decision-makers should continually evaluate their needs and strategies."

        "article_content": "Founded in 1994 as \u201cThe World's First Living Television Network\u201d with a focus on original, live broadcast\u2014as well as rebroadcasts of classic series\u2014it wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s that FX started to resemble the network it is today.\n\nWith the critically acclaimed debuts of The Shield, Nip/Tuck, and Rescue Me in the early aughts, FX began to be seen as a home for edgy, hard-hitting dramas. Today, the network continues to push the envelope, with much of its original content showcasing a certain appetite for riskiness and approaching things non-traditionally.\n\nThat through line has only become more emboldened in the streaming era, where FX has gone toe-to-toe with giants like HBO when it comes to must-watch content. For a network with interactivity and the internet in its DNA\u2014FX was one of the first to use email for feedback in the '90s\u2014that success seems less like a surprise and more like an expectation.\n\nEven so, curating a list of the best shows FX has released over the past two decades is pretty tough because of the bangers the network consistently drops. But that didn't stop us from trying! So, presented in alphabetical order, here are 20 of the best FX shows of all time.\n\nThe Americans\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nA period drama and a political thriller, The Americans stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys as two KGB spies posing as a married couple in Washington, D.C. One of the defining series from the early-to-mid aughts, The Americans often graces top lists of the era alongside shows like Game of Thrones, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad\u2014and for good reason.\n\nWith richly developed characters and exceptional writing, The Americans is to FX what The Sopranos was to HBO: a deeply engrossing slow burn buoyed by strong performances and simmering suspense. Perhaps most impressively, The Americans manages to stick the landing when it comes to finales, meaning that for first-time viewers wary of the series\u2019s 75 episodes, the journey is well worth the time commitment.\n\nAmerican Horror Story\n\nSeasons: 12\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nShow runner Ryan Murphy is responsible for several hit series\u2014on FX and otherwise\u2014but perhaps none is as idiosyncratic as the ensemble-driven horror anthology American Horror Story.\n\nFeaturing an array of big-name talent, including the likes of Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Angela Bassett, this series tackles a broad array of well-known horror tropes and settings. From haunted murder houses and insane asylums to covens, cults, and a paranormal reality series, no stone is left unturned in this pulpy, twisty series. While sometimes plots get a little convoluted over the course of a seasons, its gaudy sense of style and strong performances are reason enough to sit back and enjoy the bloody ride.\n\nArcher\n\nSeasons: 14\n\nGenre: Adult Animation, Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nA hilarious animated parody of the spy genre, Archer follows the adventures of Sterling Archer and seven other agents of the International Secret Intelligence Service (yes, ISIS, but not that ISIS).\n\nFeaturing the voices of H. Jon Benjamin (Bob\u2019s Burgers) and Judy Greer (The Big Bang Theory), this series takes visual inspiration from the bold comic style of artists like Jack Kirby and combines its approach to animation with rapid-fire dialogue similar to the work of Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing). As far as humor goes, Archer\u2019s cynical edge and referential style neatly fits in with other modern TV comedies. However, thanks to strong character work from Benjamin, and a willingness to reinvent itself into different settings as seasons continued, Archer remains undeniably fresh in a crowded field of adult animation.\n\nAtlanta\n\nSeasons: 4\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nAcross four seasons, show runner and star Donald Glover explored themes of race and class through Atlanta\u2019s potent afro-surrealist lens, earning recognition from the Emmy Awards and Golden Globes in the process.\n\nWhile ostensibly about the life of Earn (Glover) and his rapper cousin, Alfred (Brian Tyree Henry), this comedy takes a departure from traditional multi-episode narrative arcs in favor of smaller, bottle episodes. From a stranger on the bus making a Nutella sandwich to the character of Teddy Perkins, played by Glover in white face, Atlanta has no trouble pushing the envelope to better convey the surreal experience of being Black in America. With moments like this in mind, it\u2019s clear why Glover has compared the series to another great work of surrealist television: David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks. (Watch both, they're good.)\n\nThe Bear\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nWhile reality television has long mined chefs and restauranteurs for drama, The Bear shows that the cutthroat world of cooking doesn\u2019t need a competition element in order to be compelling.\n\nVisceral and raw, FX\u2019s The Bear features an explosive ensemble cast struggling to transform a humble Italian beef joint in Chicago into a culinary mecca. Featuring career-best work from Jeremy Allen White (Shameless) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Girls), as well as a breakout performance from Ayo Edebiri, this character-driven series about how an industry\u2019s quest for perfection is paved by trauma and toxicity is wholly exhilarating. Even in the face of its divisive third season, does The Bear deserve to be on this list? That's a resounding, \u201cYes, chef!\u201d\n\nBetter Things\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nExpertly balancing both comedy and drama, Better Things follows working actress and single mother of three Samantha \u201cSam\u201d Fox (Pamela Adlon) as she navigates life and motherhood in Los Angeles.\n\nGentle, endearing, and laugh-out-loud funny, Better Things excels in large part due to the chemistry between Adlon and the series\u2019s three young child actors. Featuring semi-auto-biographical stories and events, this series had enough heart that fans were understandably concerned it would be completely lost as collateral damage to the Louis C.K. sexual misconduct allegations. However, it thankfully survived that controversy thanks to Adlon jettisoning C.K. (as well as her own manager) in order to get seasons three through five made. Bless her.\n\nDamages\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nThis legal thriller starring Glenn Close and Rose Byrne goes beyond traditional legal dramas to showcase both the defense and prosecution\u2019s sides of each case.\n\nWith a single case anchoring the full season, that also means Damages leaves plenty of room for windy character development. All the while, the relationship between the infamously ruthless Patty Hewes (Close) and her newest hire, law school graduate Ellen Parsons (Byrne), becomes more and more engrossing with each episode. Thanks to the show\u2019s non-linear narrative techniques and willingness to leave some plot points unresolved, you\u2019re never quite sure where a season is headed\u2014even if you think you do. And that makes for great television.\n\nDave\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nCreated by and starring rapper Lil Dicky (aka Dave Burd), Dave is a comedic series about a man who believes he is going to be one of music's GOATs.\n\nAs you might be able to guess by learning that Dave\u2019s on-stage persona is \u201cLil Dicky,\u201d Dave is full of crude jokes. Even so, it has a lot of heart underneath its sophomoric veneer, particularly in later episodes where the price of fame is explored. Just as fun as the show\u2019s writing are its extensive number of cameos across three seasons of episodes. From Justin Bieber, Mackelmore, and Charlamagne tha God to Lil Nas X and Drake, it\u2019s always enjoyable to see who might pop up.\n\nFargo\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nWho would have thought that the Coen brothers\u2019s 1996 film could be the basis for one of FX\u2019s most engrossing anthology series?\n\nCreated by Noah Hawley and inspired by the film of the same name, Fargo features the dark sense of Midwest humor and atmosphere that made the Coen brothers' film stand out. However, rather than continuing to follow Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), the series sets each season in a different period with a different cast. While season one features actors Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman, later seasons include Kirsten Dunst, Ewan McGregor, Chris Rock, and Lamorne Morris. If you like your crime dramas with a bit of the off-kilter, or if you love the Coen brothers, Fargo is definitely a series to watch.\n\nIt\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\n\nSeasons: 16\n\nGenre: Dark Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nSet in the middling Paddy\u2019s Pub, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia follows the degenerate, despicable, and all-around-hilarious exploits of the pub\u2019s owners, collectively referred to as \u201cThe Gang.\u201d\n\nRenewed for a total of 18 seasons as of 2020, it\u2019s the longest-running, live-action sitcom in history. So, what makes It\u2019s Always Sunny worth watching? That's simple. It's how the show turns typical sitcom formulas inside out by populating the series with horrific characters, outrageous schemes, and narcissistic cons.\n\nFeaturing the talents of the incomparable Danny DeVito, and with sharp writing and acting from Charlie Day and Rob McElhenney, among others, this is a laugh-out-loud show with so many memorable moments and episodes (we\u2019re looking at you \u201cThe Nightman Cometh\u201d) you\u2019ll be ready to binge it again the second you finish it. It's that good.\n\nJustified\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nGenre: Crime, Neo-Western\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nIf you like your crime dramas with a bit of western flair, there\u2019s plenty to enjoy across Justified\u2019s six compelling seasons.\n\nCentered around the unconventional U.S. Marshal, Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant), the series follows a different major crime family each season. Appalachia and Eastern Kentucky serve as the perfect backdrop for a story about a modern-day law enforcement officer with more Wild West notions of justice, one of the major wins for a series with impressive production design. And, if you can\u2019t get enough of Justified, make sure to check out Justified: City Primeval, the 2023 limited series sequel. It's equally worth the watch. Trust us.\n\nMayans\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nGenre: Crime\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nAlso called Mayans M.C., the show takes place in the same world as another FX hit, Sons of Anarchy.\n\nFocusing on the Mayans Motorcycle Club (the Sons\u2019 former rivals) and taking place shortly after the events of the original series, this spinoff is every bit as thrilling as the show it\u2019s based on. From dark secrets to broken bonds, there\u2019s no shortage of drama across Mayans\u2019s five, vengeful seasons. Anchored by strong performances by J. D. Pardo, Sarah Bolger, and Michael Irby, Mayans\u2014much like AMC\u2019s Breaking Bad spinoff, Better Call Saul\u2014proves that sometimes viewers just want to continue living in the same universe for a few more seasons.\n\nMrs. America\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nGenre: Political Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nOne genre that FX clearly excels in is the political drama, and the 2020 miniseries Mrs. America is just another feather in the network's cap alongside shows like The Americans and American Crime Story.\n\nThe series stars Cate Blanchett as Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative activist determined to prevent the Equal Rights Amendment from being ratified. Even with Blanchett at the helm, this is an ensemble series featuring a veritable who\u2019s who of acting talent and historical figures. Amongst them over the course of the mini-series\u2019s nine episodes are Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem, Uzo Aduba as Shirley Crisholm, and Elizabeth Banks as Jill Ruckelshaus. Vividly detailed by showrunner Dahvi Waller (a writer on series including Mad Men and Halt and Catch Fire), this mini-series is one of the best pieces of 2020s TV thus far.\n\nNip/Tuck\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nGenre: Medical\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nAs a producer, Ryan Murphy is no stranger to hit TV shows. From Glee to American Horror Story, Murphy is responsible for some of the most original shows, a career marked by his first big FX hit: Nip/Tuck.\n\nA medical drama set in a plastic surgery center (and featuring graphic depictions of the operation), this Ryan Murphy series owes its inspiration, in part, to the before-and-after photos on popular makeover segments of Oprah and Jenny Jones. Across 100 episodes, viewers get up close and personal with the lives and loves of Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), while also enjoying a more serialized format than most medical dramas use.\n\nShogun\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nDebuting with a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score, Shogun isn\u2019t just one of the best new series of the 2020s, it\u2019s one of FX\u2019s best, too.\n\nSet in Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, the series follows Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada) as he fights against political rivals and a shipwrecked sailor from England, John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis). While James Clavell\u2019s novel of the same name was previously adapted into a miniseries in the '80s, it\u2019s 2024\u2019s Shogun that shines as faithful to the source and stunning in its visuals, writing, and acting.\n\nFor fans of epic historical dramas and political intrigue, Shogun feels as gripping and ambitious as early seasons of HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones. Plus, there's more sword clanging and gut opening to come as the series was green lit for two more seasons. Seriously, go watch it.\n\nSnowfall\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nGenre: Crime, Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nInitially intended to premiere on Showtime in 2014, FX wound up picking up Snowfall, a crime drama exploring the origins of Los Angeles\u2019 crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s through the lens of an ensemble cast.\n\nFrom drug kingpin Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) to a CIA operative (Carter Hudson), a Mexican wrestler (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), and the daughter of a crime lord (Emily Rios), the tapestry of unique characters in Snowfall\u2014and the ways they intersect with each other and cocaine\u2014makes this series one of the more ambitious entries in FX\u2019s already ambitious catalogue. With so many characters and storylines to track, Snowfall could easily collapse under the weight of its ambition; however, across its six seasons, the series remains tight and engrossing in large part due to solid performances from its central cast.\n\nThe Shield\n\nSeasons: 7\n\nGenre: Crime Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nThe breakout series that in many ways made FX what it is today, it\u2019s no surprise that so many crime dramas followed on the network in the wake of The Shield\u2019s success.\n\nCentered on the exploits of Detective Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his experimental LAPD Strike Team, The Shield explores how a police force using a less-than-legal approach to facing off against criminals could itself become an investigation of police misconduct and corruption. A major entry into anti-hero stories on the small screen, The Shield represented a bold new foray into crime dramas for FX ansd TV.\n\nSons of Anarchy\n\nSeasons: 7\n\nGenre: Crime Drama\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nBrimming with references to Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet in both event and episode titles, Sons of Anarchy follows Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the son of the founding member of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO). Indebted to and inspired by the Hells Angels motorcycle club, this series is as much about loyalty and betrayal as it is about motorcycle vigilantism. Beyond its high ratings while it aired, the lasting influence of Sons of Anarchy can also be seen in its spin off series, Mayans M.C., as well as its Boom! Studios comic book series, episodic adventure game, and 2014 novelization.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nGenre: Comedy, Horror\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nBased on a feature film by Taika Waititi (Our Flag Means Death) and Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) of the same name, What We Do in the Shadows is a hysterical mockumentary about four vampires living not-so-under-the-radar in Staten Island.\n\nFrom Nandor the Rentless (Kayvan Novak) and his familiar Guillermo (Harvey Guill\u00e9n), to lovers Laszlo and Nadja and the energy vampire Colin Robinson, the ensemble cast of this series knocks it out of the park with each episode. With plenty of memorable bits\u2014such as the \u201cSuperb Owl\u201d party to Laszlo\u2019s stint as \u201chuman\u201d barkeep Jackie Daytona\u2014What We Do in the Shadows is one of the most consistently innovative, consistently hysterical sitcoms currently on TV. A must-see.\n\nWilfred\n\nSeasons: 4\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nFrequent FX viewers understand that if a comedy appears on the network, it\u2019s most likely going to be something bold and brazen, and Wilfred certainly has those qualities in spades.\n\nStarring Elijah Wood, Wilfred features a depressed lawyer, Ryan Newman, who sees his neighbor\u2019s pet dog\u2014anthropomorphized as a man in a dog suit (Jason Gann)\u2014as a bad influence. Based on an Australian series of the same name, Wilfred mixes vulgarity and sentimentality to great effect. While Wilfred seems like a bad influence on Wood\u2019s character, throughout the series, viewers are treated to the ways that Wilfred's presence in Newman\u2019s life is ultimately for the best.\n\nReplete with all the absurdity its premise promises, Wilfred is a singular experience, the kind that epitomizes the best FX has to offer you.\n\nDistilling any network to its 20 greatest hits is always a difficult task, and for a network as storied and influential as FX, that task is twice as hard. Which series do you feel got snubbed? What FX show do you think reigns supreme? Let's very civilly discuss in the comments below."

        "article_content": "Credit: Holistic Drug Discovery and Development Centre\n\nI grew up in Muwele, a small village in northern Zambia where the schools had no laboratories and we learned science solely on the blackboard. But thanks to some excellent teachers, I earned the opportunity to study and work abroad at well-endowed institutions like the University of Cambridge and the Scripps Research Institute.\n\nMy appointment as a lecturer at the University of Cape Town in 1996 was a return home in more than one way. Unlike at the bustling research hubs of Cambridge and Scripps, resources at the university were scarce, and infrastructure to conduct drug discovery was limited. These challenges, while daunting, ignited a fire within me to make a difference. I found a continent brimming with untapped potential, a rich tapestry of biodiversity, and a burning desire in its research groups to tackle the health challenges plaguing our communities.\n\nInspired, I embarked on a journey to build a drug discovery ecosystem in Africa. The creation of the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development Centre (H3D) at the University of Cape Town in 2010 was a pivotal moment. Our early days established the relentless pursuit of excellence that continues to drive our work. Supported by various research and funding partners, H3D has emerged as a state-of-the-art facility (Nat. Med. 2022, DOI: 10.1038/s41591-022-01885-1).\n\nTo my fellow African scientists, I would like to say: We are trailblazers.\n\nToday, our team of 75 researchers investigates novel chemical compounds that could become lifesaving medicines, with a focus on malaria, tuberculosis, and antibiotic-resistant microbial diseases. We\u2019re also developing preclinical tools to better understand the variability of drug response in the genetically diverse African populations, addressing a critical gap in global drug development. We\u2019ve invested in training young African scientists, nurturing their talents, and empowering them to become leaders in their fields.\n\nThese efforts have borne fruit. Considering that we had to build drug discovery infrastructure from scratch, one of our proudest achievements has been the development of MMV390048, the first ever small-molecule clinical candidate, for any disease, discovered by an Africa-led international team. This first-in-class antimalarial drug candidate reached Phase 2 human clinical trials, a milestone that represents not only a major scientific breakthrough but also what is possible when African scientists have the necessary resources and support.\n\nBut our work is far more than individual projects. We are constructing a self-sustaining ecosystem, investing in both cutting-edge infrastructure and the next generation of African scientists. Through comprehensive training and mentorship programs, we empower scientists with the skills and knowledge to become leaders in their fields. Our commitment extends beyond the laboratory; we are actively shaping a culture of innovation that generates high-skill jobs, combats the brain drain, and nurtures a thriving scientific community on the African continent.\n\nDespite our progress, African scientists continue to be relegated to the sidelines of global drug discovery. Our achievements are overlooked, and our potential is underestimated. This must change.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the world to recognize the transformative power of African-led science. We\u2019re not just tackling diseases; we\u2019re also leading the charge in pharmacogenomics by recognizing and tapping into the genetic diversity of the African population. Through initiatives like Project Africa GRADIENT (Genomic Research Approach for Diversity and Optimizing Therapeutics), we\u2019re partnering with global pharmaceutical companies like GSK and Novartis to harness the power of artificial intelligence and develop tailored treatments for diverse African populations.\n\nThis is a new era for African science. We\u2019re notcatching up; we\u2019re leading the way in precision medicine. The recent multimillion-dollar investment by LifeArc and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in the Grand Challenges African Drug Discovery Accelerator program is a testament to the pharmaceutical world\u2019s growing confidence in African science. This investment is a financial boost as well as an endorsement of African scientists\u2019 ability to tackle global health challenges. It signifies a new era of pan-African collaboration, in which researchers from different countries and institutions join forces to accelerate drug discovery and development.\n\nBut we need more than just financial investment. We need the global scientific community to embrace African expertise, collaborate with African researchers, and champion our cause for equitable representation in global health initiatives.\n\nTo my fellow African scientists, I would like to say: We are trailblazers. We are the architects of our own scientific destiny. Let us continue to push boundaries, challenge norms, and strive for excellence. Let us embrace our unique perspectives and leverage our diverse strengths to solve the most pressing health challenges of our time.\n\nTo the global scientific community, I would like to say: Do not overlook our achievements. Together, let us forge collaborations that transcend continents, invest in research that addresses the needs of diverse populations, and amplify the voices of scientists from all corners of the globe. In doing so, we can foster a truly inclusive scientific community that harnesses the power of diversity to drive innovation and improve lives worldwide.\n\nThe time for African drug discovery is now. We have the talent, the ambition, and the determination to make a lasting impact on global health. Let us seize this moment and create a brighter future for Africa and the world.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Kelly Chibale\n\nKelly Chibale is a professor of organic chemistry and Neville Isdell Chair in African-centric Drug Discovery and Development at the University of Cape Town.
