        "article_content": "Trump's second term in office could be good news for UFO enthusiasts, Nick thinks\n\nThere could be \"seismic\" consequences for UFO disclosure after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States for the second time. Nick Pope, who once worked for the Ministry of Defence's UFO department, told the Mirror Trump's presidency is the \"perfect storm\". He explained: \"It's the perfect storm: a maverick, populist President in his second term, and \u2013 thus \u2013 not up for re-election.\" Pope added that Trump's unique standing could provide an unprecedented opportunity for transparency. He went on: \"For those in the UFO community who believe there's been a decades-long conspiracy to cover up the truth about an alien presence, Trump in his second term offers the best-ever hope for pushing back against the Deep State and delivering Disclosure.\"\n\nNick is regarded as one of the leading lights in UFO research\n\nHis views tie in with previous speculations that official revealings regarding extraterrestrial contact may coincide with the forthcoming Inauguration Day in January. Nick, a staunch critic of governmental secrets and manipulation, has showcased his opposition through his latest documentary, Apocalypse Covid, which aims to uncover \"the flawed response and government overreach during the pandemic\". US-based Nick suggests that Trump has been hinting at being privy to significant secrets regarding extraterrestrial contact. He added: \"I believe Trump views the subject in the same way as he views the JFK files, where, if there's top secret information still being withheld, it should be declassified and released. \"Trump released most of the JFK files in his first term and has essentially undertaken to release the rest early in his second term. As he seems to link the two issues, there's a strong possibility of bombshell UFO information being released early in 2025, soon after his inauguration.\"\n\nTrending\n\nTrump has often hinted that he knows something about extraterrestrials\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

        "article_content": "Those curious of life outside our world can find fun Saturday at the Carbondalien Festival, which celebrates the milestone of a mysterious event in Carbondale\u2019s history.\n\nThe Carbondalien Festival marks the 50th anniversary of the infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974. The festival will be held Saturday at the park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Carbondale Arts Alliance and will have vendors, food trucks, speakers, art and live music.\n\nNicole Curtis, the Carbondalien Festival\u2019s organizer, \u201cCarbondalien-in-Chief\u201d and co-owner of the City Line Shop Cafe in Carbondale, was inspired to start the festival as an alien art walk after seeing how art helped save other nearby small towns.\n\nMany townspeople are not aware of the UFO event since many did not want to discuss it for fear of being ridiculed. There were many sightings of the UFO that allegedly crashed from around the county, from the Scranton area to Carbondale, according to Curtis.\n\nWhat occurred 50 years ago is an \u201camazing incredible thing that not many people know about that should be celebrated and not be ashamed about,\u201d said Curtis. On that day, \u201csomething glowed in the water for nine hours and left on a flatbed truck,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper archives, the legend began on Nov. 9, 1974, when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond.\n\nCurtis started planning for the Carbondalien Festival a year ago by looking for an artist to design an alien and reached out to Jennifer Forgione, known as JFo, studio artist of JFo Generation in Spring Brook Twp.\n\nForgione\u2019s mother was an eyewitness to the UFO while observing the sky at her home in Dunmore. This synchronistic event is \u201cwhy I am so passionate about it and it is a very good thing,\u201d said Forgione, who is excited to participate in the festival linked to her mother\u2019s UFO sighting.\n\nThose wanting to know about the legend can watch the theatrical performance, \u201cThe Russel Park Experience,\u201d presented in partnership with the Lackawanna Historical Society. The performance immerses the audience as a member of the press at the crash site trying to get the facts of what happened. Performances will take place at Russell Park at 11:45 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe festival is a \u201cgreat opportunity to meet interesting people and learn new things,\u201d as well as a place to meet \u201clike-minded people in the cryptid and UFO world,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nFestivalgoers can learn more about UFO topics at the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite. Speakers include: James Krug with \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers & How to Become a MUFON Investigator,\u201d Bill Weber with \u201cUFO Sightings and Cover Ups,\u201d Tim Renner with \u201cThe 1920\u2019s Bigfoot Flap in Pennsylvania\u201d and Alan B. Smith with \u201cExposing UFO Debunkers.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Carbondalien Festival will have a ticketed after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite with a cocktail hour, dinner and presentation of \u201cWorld of the Weird\u201d by Heather Taddy, known as the team documentarian on A&E\u2019s hit television series \u201cParanormal State,\u201d from 6 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nThroughout the city, 34 local businesses are hosting a scavenger hunt with 7-foot-tall wooden aliens unique to each location. Visitors can vote for their favorite design on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nOther activities include a free Alien Swim at the Carbondale YMCA, and an Alien Storytime and Craft, Alien Teen Bingo and Extraterrestrial Film Festival at the Carbondale Public Library.\n\nAccording to Forgione, the more people who get excited about the festival, the less people will be afraid of aliens.\n\n\u201cYou see a cute little heinie on the alien and smile and laugh,\u201d Forgione said of her artwork. Forgione will be selling handmade 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-tall and 2-foot-tall wooden aliens at the event, along with alien ornaments.\n\nCurtis said the event is to keep \u201can openness to what the story could be.\u201d This gives people an opportunity to not argue over the story, but ponder the possibilities.\n\n\u201cMany feel ostracized talking and sharing their story,\u201d said Forgione. \u201cThere might be so many stories that people are afraid to tell.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous and was first on the scene has donated stacks of photos, business cards of reporters who came to town and typed-up reports about the event to the Lackawanna Historical Society, according to Curtis.\n\nCurtis hopes the Carbondalien Festival helps to build tourism for the town by getting people to see what the town has to offer. She wants the Carbondalien Festival to evolve into an annual event.\n\nThose attending the event will find \u201can escape from a regular day and have a magical one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d said Forgione.\n\nFor more information about the Carbondalien Festival and to purchase tickets for the after-party, go to carbondalienfestival.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Carbondalien Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Russell Park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nEvents: The immersive \u201cThe Russel Park Experience\u201d at the park, the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite, a citywide scavenger hunt, alien-themed activities at the Carbondale Public Library and more.

        "source": "AOL",
        "article_content": "Tech companies continue to roll out new generative AI apps and services. Microsoft (MSFT) has its Copilot for Windows; Apple (AAPL) has Apple Intelligence for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac; Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has Gemini for its apps and Pixel phones; and Meta (META) has Meta AI for its various social media services. But despite all of the hype, I\u2019m still not sold on these apps. At least not yet.\n\nI\u2019ve been using each company\u2019s products for a while now, and while they\u2019ve got some intriguing capabilities, none of them has the kind of features that make me want them to be a part of my daily life. The problem, at least so far, is that much of what these companies have to offer are solutions for niche situations or kitschy demos for what\u2019s to come down the line.\n\nWhether that\u2019s manipulating photos to completely alter their settings, changing an artificial intelligence app\u2019s voice to a celebrity\u2019s voice, or creating generative AI-based emojis, I haven\u2019t come across a single generative AI feature that would convince me to spend $800 on a new phone or PC or make me want to change how I use apps. But there\u2019s potential on the horizon.\n\nLimited uses for most users\n\nIf you\u2019re an Android user, you\u2019ve likely at least tried some of the company\u2019s generative AI capabilities via Google\u2019s Pixel phones or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line of devices. There\u2019s the ability to edit photos to do things like make your 4-year-old appear as though she\u2019s dunking a basketball on a regulation-height hoop or that your dog is driving your car. You can also reimagine your photos to, say, transform a road into a rushing river, or even add objects to them that weren\u2019t there before.\n\nApple also offers photo editing capabilities with its first wave of Apple Intelligence features, though it\u2019s far tamer than Google\u2019s, only allowing you to remove objects from the background of your photos like a person walking behind your subject in a shot or a cup off of a table.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot+PCs are Windows PC with added generative AI features like the company's Copilot chatbot software. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nMeta AI can pull off the same tricks as Google, letting you do things like remove large objects from images or transform the floor in a photo into lava. It\u2019s all a bit of fun to use at first, but unless you\u2019re spending a lot of time posting the perfect shot to Instagram every day, there\u2019s little reason to regularly use these apps. Is that worth buying a new $799 iPhone or $999 for a Surface laptop or changing your routine to use a new piece of software? Not really.\n\nTech companies are also offering features that can summarize large chunks of text, rewrite emails to make them more professional or more casual, and prepare bullet points to help quickly digest the most important parts of a report. These can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to plow through a massive document, but it\u2019s hard to imagine most people taking advantage of such an option in their daily lives.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re the type of person who needs to closely read reports, surveys, or emails for exact details, you\u2019re probably not going to put all of your trust into a generative AI app to get all of the information you require, especially when they\u2019re able to make up information and then present it as though it\u2019s fact.\n\nI find chatting with AI bots helpful at times, but it still hasn\u2019t replaced Google as my go-to for looking up information on the web. And I\u2019m definitely not about to pony up a chunk of change just to chat with a robot.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come\n\nWhile the first slate of generative AI apps and services may not be the generation-defining raft of technologies that tech companies have been hyping them as, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity ahead.\n\nApple plans to continue to update its Apple Intelligence platform throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025, while Google and Microsoft regularly announce new capabilities for their respective consumer generative AI offerings. Meta also continues to debut new options for its own Meta AI service.\n\nBut the real excitement will come as third-party developers begin to push out their own generative AI-enabled apps over the months and years ahead. What we\u2019re getting right now is sort of a test run of what generative AI can do for the average consumer, but third-party developers will likely be the ones that give us the killer apps that make the technology a hit among users.\n\nThink of it like when Apple first launched the App Store. Sure, iPhones were cool and interesting, but sales really took off once Apple allowed third-party developers to start selling apps of their own for its flagship device. If generative AI is going to be as revolutionary a product as the tech industry promises, it\u2019ll be third-party developers that get us there.\n\nNow we just have to wait for them to do their thing.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "date": "Windows Latest12h",
        "source": "Windows Latest",
        "article_content": "It\u2019s finally happening. Back in February, Windows Latest reported that Microsoft is planning to add Copilot AI to Notepad, a feature that will allow you to create content using generative AI on Windows 11. With today\u2019s preview update, AI in Notepad is now rolling out to testers, but remember, it may not show for everyone just yet.\n\nThe feature is called \u201cRewrite in Notepad,\u201d and it basically allows you to rewrite your existing content. At the moment, it cannot create content from scratch. The \u201cRewrite\u201d feature is designed to refine or improve existing content, and Microsoft officials said that it is powered by \u201ca powerful AI model named GPT.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the \u201cGPT\u201d model is referring to ChatGPT or something else, but it\u2019s fair to assume it\u2019s ChatGPT. With Rewrite in Notepad, you can reword sentences and change tone, making them sound more formal, casual, inspirational, or humorous. You can also change the format of their text.\n\nYou can keep it as default or convert it into different styles like a paragraph, list, business format, academic style, marketing pitch, or even poetry.\n\nAt Windows Latest, we test everything before we discuss it in articles, so I also tried Notepad\u2019s AI rewrite. It\u2019s quite handy, and its performance is impressive. It gets the job done.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how the AI works inside Notepad and what happens behind the scenes.\n\nHands on with AI rewrite in Notepad on Windows 11\n\nFirst and foremost, AI rewrite in Notepad is exclusive to testers in the Canary and Dev Channel of the Windows Insider Program. It\u2019s available only in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany and Canada.\n\nYou also need to sign into your Microsoft account to use AI in Notepad. The feature requires authentication, and it sends your content to Azure.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s online service does not store the text or generated content after processing, ensuring that your data remains private and secure,\u201d Microsoft officials clarified.\n\nMicrosoft limits the usage and performance based on the \u201cCredits\u201d system. If you run out of credits, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to Copilot Pro or wait for a month.\n\n\u201cAI credits reset on the first day of each month,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Latest. Copilot Pro removes the credit usage limit.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the updated Notepad experience, you can check for updates, but Microsoft told us the feature isn\u2019t widely available yet.\n\nHow to use ChatGPT \u201cRewrite\u201d in Notepad for Windows 11\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to write something yourself and then select the text where you want AI rewrite to work. For example, in my case, I had written a short essay on Dogs, and I selected everything except the first line. Then, I clicked the Rewrite button in the toolbar to access it.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the following options as you as you click on the Rewrite button:\n\nRewrite\n\nMake shorter\n\nMake longer\n\nChange tone\n\nChange format\n\nUnder \u201cChange Tone,\u201d the available options are:\n\nDefault\n\nFormal\n\nCasual\n\nInspirational\n\nHumor\n\nUnder \u201cChange Format,\u201d the available options are:\n\nDefault\n\nParagraph\n\nList\n\nBusiness\n\nAcademic\n\nMarketing\n\nPoetry\n\nThese options are self-explanatory, but you can find them again in the next AI pop-up if you\u2019re unsure.\n\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that Notepad AI generates three versions of the content. The three variants are slightly different from each other, and the system prompt is apparently all about switching between words. They do not change the content significantly, but the third version has more changes compared to the second.\n\nYou can use the arrow keys to go through the three variants. You can finalize one of the variants, but you again have the choice to change everything.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s a \u201cLength\u201d button with a dropdown menu. When clicked, it gives you options to make the text similar in length, shorter, or longer. Next, there is a \u201cTone\u201d button with a dropdown, where you can adjust the tone of the text.\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201cFormat\u201d button (labeled as \u201cList\u201d in the below screenshot).\n\nUnder the rewritten text, there\u2019s a Replace button, which will replace your original text with this new version if you are happy with it.\n\nThere\u2019s a star icon with a number (showing 46). This shows your AI credit points. When you run out of credits, AI will take longer than usual to generate content.\n\nIs more Copilot stuff coming to Notepad in Windows 11?\n\nMicrosoft also quietly tested the AI integration in Notepad in a blog post published last month, but nobody noticed it.\n\nIn it, the company stated that Microsoft 365 subscribers will get AI credits to use Copilot inside Office apps and elsewhere, including \u201capps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on Windows.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell what\u2019s next for Copilot inside Notepad, but it\u2019s clear the company is betting big on AI in Windows 11. It\u2019s hopeful that it can convince more people to subscribe to Copilot Pro to remove the AI credit balance limit.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you pay for Copilot Pro to limit AI limitations in Notepad and other Windows apps?"

Over the decades, several US outlets have carried stories about ghostly sightings and mysterious night-time noises plaguing the 18th-century building. On the big result day, these stories are circulating again on the internet, and here's what we know about them.\n\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, there are numerous accounts of encounters with former residents, including the founding father and third president, Thomas Jefferson. However, the most famous spirit believed to haunt the White House is that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president.\n\nIn 1946, President Harry S Truman wrote to his wife in a letter that is archived in his presidential library and museum.\n\n\"I jumped up and put on my bathrobe, opened the door, and no one there,\" he wrote. \"Went out and looked up and down the hall, looked in your room and Margie's. Still no one. Went back to bed after locking the doors and there were footsteps in your room whose door I'd left open. Jumped and looked and no one there! The damned place is haunted sure as shootin'. Secret Service said not even a watchman was up here at that hour.\"\n\n\"You and Margie had better come back and protect me before some of these ghosts carry me off.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, the most famous ghost haunting the White House is undoubtedly that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president. After his assassination in 1865, Lincoln's ghost reportedly appeared in both the Yellow Oval Room and the Lincoln Bedroom. He is said to have materialised to notable figures, including First Lady Grace Coolidge (wife of President Calvin Coolidge), British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, making him the most frequently sighted spirit in the White House.\n\nThe news outlet also reported that residents and staff members have, on various occasions, witnessed the ghost of Abigail Adams, America's second First Lady, hanging laundry or noticed a scent of lavender and damp clothing in the East Room.\n\nIn a 2018 interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Jenna Bush Hager shared that she heard 1920s piano music emanating from her room's fireplace. Jenna and her sister Barbara, daughters of President George W. Bush, heard music from the fireplace in the Lincoln Room on two separate occasions: first, 1920s piano music one week, and then opera music the following week, as Jenna later recounted to Hoda Kotb on the Today show.\n\n\"Our phone rang, and I woke up, and all of a sudden we heard like 1920s piano music coming out of our fireplace ... It was like the middle of the night, and you can feel the music out of the fireplace,\" Jenna said on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\".\n\n"
