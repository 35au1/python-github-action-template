            "article_content": "Iranian vessel, drone or UFO: Mystery over bizarre lights spotted in skies over New Jersey\n\nDrones of indeterminate origin have been buzzing New Jersey over the last month, prompting a mixed bag of responses from regional lawmakers. The state\u2019s governor has insisted the drones are safe, while a Congressman believes they\u2019re the vanguard of an Iranian \u201cmothership.\u201d\n\nHomeland security officials and regional lawmakers met on Wednesday to discuss the sightings further.\n\nDozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over president-elect Donald Trump\u2019sgolf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must also be FAA certified.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists, with reports claiming some are the size of an SUV,\n\nThe number of sightings has increased in recent days, though officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It\u2019s also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once.\n\nA drone of unknown origin was spotted flying over Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf club in New Jersey (TMX)\n\nGov. Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don\u2019t appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have.\n\nMany municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019re taking deadly seriously. I don\u2019t blame people for being frustrated,\" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said earlier this week.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew echoed Murphy's sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe have a serious problem with our aerospace,\u201d he said on Wednesday before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \u201cThe recent sightings of unidentified drones in the state of New Jersey, my home state, is justifiably causing tremendous public concern.\u201d\n\nUnlike Murphy, however, Van Drew blamed the drones on an \"Iranian mothership.\"\n\n\"I've learned, for real, that there is circumstantial evidence that there's an Iranian mothership off the East Coast of the United States, and that's launching these drone incursions,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh shot that theory down, assuring ABC News that there \"is not any truth to that \u2014 there is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there's no so called mothership launching drones towards the United States.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to monitor what is happening,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAt no point were our installations threatened when this activity was occurring.\u201d\n\nVan Drew did not buy the Pentagon's response, insisting during an ABC News interview that there is a \"real possibility that it is a foreign entity.\"\n\n\"[The Pentagon says] to us there's nothing to fear, but we have no idea who it is, where it comes from, what it's about, and what it can do,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetails about Wednesday's meeting were not immediately disclosed, and Murphy did not attend.\n\nRepublican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he and other legislators met with Homeland Security and state police officials for about 90 minutes at a state police facility in West Trenton.\n\nPeterson said DHS officials were generous with their time, but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones.\n\n\u201cSo who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? \u201cMy understanding is they have no clue,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA message seeking comment on Peterson\u2019s remarks was left with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMost of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states, including the New York City area, and over Pennsylvania\u2019s Delaware County and Philadelphia.\n\nJames Edwards, of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month.\n\n\u201cIt raises concern mainly because there's so much that's unknown,\u201d Edwards said Wednesday. \u201cThere are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press"

It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "American computer scientist and professor Alan Perlis famously said that a year spent in AI (artificial intelligence) was enough to make one believe in God\u2026\n\nIt might be a little too (uncomfortably) close to the truth, considering that now questions are arising about the societal and ethical implications of AI. However, there is no denying that AI also has the potential to transform healthcare and well-being.\n\nWe are talking specifically about the Safe Delivery App, a training and learning tool and a job aid, all combined into one, for midwives and other healthcare professionals.\n\nBackstory\n\nA major chunk of all newborn and maternal deaths can be prevented if women receive quality healthcare. However, there is a lack of almost a million midwives around the world. What\u2019s more, many people who currently practice midwifery do not possess the necessary knowledge or skills, making the situation all the more critical. This is an urgent goal, considering nearly 6,400 newborns and 800 women are dying every daily day from birth-related and pregnancy complications.\n\nThis was the basis of thought for Finnish AI startup Neuvo Inc. Global and International NGO Maternity Foundation, who are currently exploring this potential. They have joined hands to develop a unique AI-powered application to help ensure safer childbirth in settings with fewer resources.\n\nAll About the Safe Delivery App\n\nThe Maternity Foundation carefully used technology for over a decade to build midwifery skills and knowledge via the Safe Delivery App. This app, which is free to download and use even offline, ensures that midwives living and working in fragile and poor areas, with most neonatal and maternal births, have access to it.\n\nThis learning and training tool-cum-job aid for midwives and other healthcare workers is not only an essential and critical guide to handling birth delivery but also other common complications. It does so by using descriptions of practical procedures and animated instruction videos, among other features.\n\nWith support from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN\u2019s reproductive and sexual health agency, and other key partners, the Safe Delivery app has now reached more than 435,000 healthcare working professionals across more than 70 countries. That being said, the Maternity Foundation is always looking for ways to advance and boost this useful tool further.\n\nThe NeMa Smart Bot: A Step Further\n\nWith the Maternity Foundation\u2019s vision in mind, Neuvo Inc. Global took the second step in this direction. It developed the NeMa Smart Bot, an AI-powered conversational smart bot, which will eventually be integrated into the Safe Delivery App. The objective?\n\nTo answer pregnancy and birth-related questions instantly. Since time is critical when it comes to managing complications surrounding pregnancy and birth, the idea and hope are that this smart bot will elevate the assistance provided through the app to midwives and other healthcare professionals, ultimately aiding safer births.\n\nWhat about the authenticity of the information? The very objective of the app has been evidence-based guidance right from the outset. Both organizations have ensured that the answers that the NeMa smart bot provides are based on audited clinical material and have been scientifically verified. In fact, the content behind the smart bot\u2019s answers was screened and eventually cleared by the clinical team at the Maternity Foundation.\n\nPlus, they were even aligned with the country\u2019s national guidelines. In other words, the smart bot has been developed in and as a closed system, as opposed to open-ended answers generated via internet searches. And since it also works offline, it still remains accurate in areas with no or limited connectivity.\n\nThe Effect\n\nCan this useful AI tool help bridge important healthcare gaps in India? Quite possibly.\n\n\n\nSince the Maternity Foundation has focused on strengthening midwifery skills and knowledge in those parts of the country that lag behind others, in tandem with Indian authorities, they knew what they were doing. As a matter of fact, the NeMa smart bot was pilot-tested with Indian authorities in two rounds over the course of 2023, along with support from UNFPA and the pharma company Organon.\n\nIn case you missed:"

            "article_content": "Something weird is going on in New Jersey, and it's not just the swamp gas. Residents across the state have been calling in nighttime sightings of unidentified flying objects for the past month, including over military bases and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course. Neither local police nor the feds can explain what is going on\u2014but Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R\u2013N.J.) believes he has the answer.\n\n\"Iran launched a mothership, probably about a month ago, that contains these drones. It's off the east coast of America,\" the congressman told Fox News on Wednesday, citing \"sources who can't reveal who they are.\" Then he hedged his bets, saying that the \"drones should be shot down, whether it was some crazy hobbyist that we can't imagine, or whether it is Iran, and I think it very possibly could be.\"\n\nThe U.S. military denied that Van Drew's story was, in fact, very possible. Asked about the Iranian mothership theory, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh seemed almost annoyed to have to answer the question. \"There is not any truth to that. There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States and there's no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States,\" she told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that Van Drew accused Iran\u2014rather than China, which has actually deployed spy balloons over American airspace\u2014may say more about the current political moment than what his \"sources\" know. With the fall of the Syrian government, some Israeli officials and their supporters in Washington say that the time is ripe for war with Iran.\n\nThis mix of hawkish national security panic and strange sightings in the sky is nothing new. The UFO fever of the 1940s and 1950s was always tied to Cold War paranoia; U.S. government coverups of experimental military aircraft led people to believe that the unexplained flying machines they saw were alien visitors. Van Drew is working in the opposite direction: Instead of trying to explain military technology with paranormal theory, he started with an unexplained phenomenon and turned it into a military issue.\n\nAnd he isn't the only one. \"We know nothing. PERIOD. To state that there is no known or credible threat is incredibly misleading,\" state Rep. Dawn Fantasia (R\u2013Sussex) wrote on social media after a Wednesday meeting between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and state officials. \"At this point, I believe military intervention is the only path forward. There will be no answers in the absence of proactivity.\"\n\nFantasia's own description of the drone threat, however, raises questions about how real it is in the first place. \"Current radio frequencies do not pick up drone signals,\" she claimed. (Fantasia was probably referring to Remote ID, the \"digital license plate\" that the Federal Aviation Administration requires civilian drones to broadcast.) And when the New Jersey State Police sent a helicopter to investigate a drone sighting over the Raritan River, she said, its thermal cameras didn't pick anything up.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drone could have been carrying an advanced new technology that allows them to anticipate and evade police detection efforts. Or there could have been nothing to \"detect\" in the first place. Gov. Phil Murphy admitted on the radio that there's \"some amount of overreporting\" of drone sights, as well as \"other flying objects, including small Piper Cub planes and others, that are being understandably mistaken for drones.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the local Asbury Park Press published a photo of a \"drone\" that \"seemed to be well above the 400-foot height [Federal Aviation Administration] regulations allow. This object in the sky was thought to be a helicopter, but there was no audible sound associated with it.\" In other words, it very well could have been a helicopter that was too far away to hear.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean that all of the flying object sightings are fake. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that it spotted a drone swarm off the Jersey Shore over the weekend. But the mass panic about a drone menace is also causing people to connect unrelated incidents and see things that aren't there.\n\nIn 1954, after police in the Seattle suburbs reported that vandals had shot through some car windshields with BB guns, a \"windshield pitting epidemic\" spread through Washington state. Car owners around the state started reporting all kinds of mysterious holes\u2014on far too many cars in far too many places for it to have been the work of human hands. Rumors spread about some kind of military technology attacking people's windshields.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Seattle Police Department crime lab eventually got a look at the cars, concluding that the \"epidemic\" was really \"5 per cent hoodlum-ism, and 95 per cent public hysteria.\" The reports of pitting stopped soon after. Someone had attacked some cars, which caused others to report normal dents and dings as vandalism. The scale of the problem became so large that it could only be explained by fantastical conspiracy theories.\n\nIran itself has a history of UFO mania. In 1972, an Iranian fighter pilot reported trying to shoot down an unknown flying object that could make aerodynamically impossible maneuvers, jam his radar, and change colors. Over the years, Iran has reported more aerial dogfights with hyper-advanced technology. Military affairs journalist Michael Peck believes that in some of these cases, the Iranian military encountered spy drones and simply \"exaggerated the performance of the intruders.\"\n\nAuthorities probably should figure out what people are seeing in the sky. Even if it's not as widespread and sophisticated as reported, someone could be running a malicious surveillance operation or probing air defenses. Even if there is no security threat, unexplained swarms of flying objects are a problem for the safety of air traffic. The most extreme claims about motherships and undetectable drones, however, might be up there with the Pine Barren ghosts and the Jersey Devil.\n\nThe post No, an Iranian 'Mothership' Isn't Attacking New Jersey With UFOs appeared first on Reason.com."

Those earnings calls have been pretty much the only source of concrete info we\u2019ve had on the game since it was originally announced via that image of a medallion in the snow that we\u2019ve all seen nine million times by now.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nNow, taking to the stage alongside the Keighley, CD Projekt has shown a new trailer, running in Unreal Engine 5 and running on as-yet-undisclosed GeForce RTX GPU tech, that shows off some incredible-looking footage (with incredible lighting, no less) that introduces Siri as the new, titular, Witcher.\n\nThe trailer shows off Ciri's forays into protecting the people and dealing with the fantasy paranormal, and her distressing visions and flirtations with the astral don't seem to have gotten any better since the events of Wild Hunt.\n\nCheck out the trailer below.\n\n\"The Witcher IV is an upcoming single-player open-world RPG from CD PROJEKT RED, the creators of Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,\" says the trailer description. \"The beginning of a new saga, and a follow-up to one of the most acclaimed RPGs of all time, Ciri takes center stage as the protagonist, embarking on her own journey to become a professional monster slayer.\"\n\nSo, we now know that we\u2019ll be playing as Ciri in the game, something a lot of folks had theorised even prior to Geralt actor Doug Cockle suggesting that the star of every Witcher game to this point will be \"a part\" of the game, but not the main focus. He's since revealed he got a bit of a telling off for that.\n\nAside from Gerry, the only other character that\u2019d been hinted as being in The Witcher 4 was some guy called Branko, found via the CV of Star Wars: Andor and EastEnders actor Jake Lampert listed on a Spotlight, a UK casting website.\n\nIf you want to celebrate now knowing more about the next Witcher game, why not do what I did not long ago and goof around in The Witcher 3 with a mod that allows Geralt to turn into a centaur by blowing a big horn."

From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience. Accurate and engaging story-telling can do a lot to explain the benefits of nuclear science and technology in our daily lives.\u201d\n\nWatch original IAEA films on the IAEA YouTube channel here."

            "article_content": "NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty Images\n\nWith the holiday season upon us, many companies are finding ways to take advantage through deals, promotions, or other campaigns. OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's Sora AI video generator is here - how to try it\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a bit more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and will occur daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches will be both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat has been dropped so far?\n\nThursday, December 12\n\nWhen the live stream started, OpenAI addressed the elephant in the room -- the fact that the company's live stream went down the day before. OpenAI apologized for the inconvenience and said its team is working on a post-mortem to be posted later today.\n\nThen it got straight into the news -- another highly-anticipated announcement:\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode now has screen-sharing and visual capabilities, meaning it can assist with the context of what it is viewing, whether that be from your phone camera or what's on your screen.\n\nThese capabilities build on what Advanced Voice could already do very well -- engaging in casual conversation as a human would. The natural-like conversations can be interrupted, have multi-turns, and understand non-linear trains of thought.\n\nIn the demo, the user gets directions from ChatGPT's Advanced Voice on how to make a cup of coffee. As the demoer goes through the steps, ChatGPT is verbally offering insights and directions.\n\nThere's another bonus for the Christmas season: Users can access a new Santa voice. To activate it, all users have to do is click on the snowflake icon. Santa is rolling out throughout today everywhere that users can access ChatGPT voice mode. The first time you talk to Santa, your usage limits reset, even if you have reached the limit already, so you can have a conversation with him.\n\nVideo and screen sharing are rolling out in the latest mobile apps starting today and throughout next week to all Team users and most Pro and Plus subscribers. Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe will get access \"as soon as we can,\" and Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next year.\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 today. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, today's live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams are held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. To make access easier, OpenAI will also post a link to the live stream on its X account 10 minutes before it starts, which will be at approximately 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET daily.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n\nThe releases remain a surprise, but many anticipate that Sora, OpenAI's video model initially announced last February, will be launched as part of one of the bigger drops. Since that first announcement, the model has been available to a select group of red teamers and testers and was leaked last week by some testers over grievances about \"unpaid labor,\" according to reports.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's o1 lies more than any major AI model. Why that matters\n\nOther rumored releases include a new, fuller version of the company's o1 LLM with more advanced reasoning capabilities, and a Santa voice for OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode, per code spotted by users only a couple of weeks ago under the codename \"Straw.\""

From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience. Accurate and engaging story-telling can do a lot to explain the benefits of nuclear science and technology in our daily lives.\u201d\n\nWatch original IAEA films on the IAEA YouTube channel here."

            "article_content": "Led by Bucknell University Professor Jack Gallimore, physics & astronomy, an international team of astronomers and students, including Bucknell physics student Virginia Hostetter '25, set out on a new way to study NGC 1068, a well-known, relatively nearby (45 to 50-million light years away), bright galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center.\n\nTheir research had twin goals: astrometric mapping of the galaxy's radio continuum and measurements of polarization for its water masers \u2014 naturally occurring sources of microwave radio emissions. In radio astronomy, water masers observed at a frequency of 22 GHz are particularly useful because they can shine through much of the dust and gas that obscures optical wavelengths around the black hole.\n\nUsing the High Sensitivity Array (HSA) \u2014 a multi-facility network supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) \u2014 the international team observed for the first time evidence of magnetic filaments in the accretion disk surrounding the galaxy's supermassive black hole. Their discovery was announced Wednesday by the NRAO and reported in a recent paper published by The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nBy measuring the polarization of water masers and the continuum of radio emissions from NGC 1068, the team generated a map revealing the compact radio source now known as NGC 1068*, as well as mysterious extended structures of more faint emissions.\n\nMapping the astrometric distribution of NGC 1068 and its water masers revealed that they are spread along filaments of structure.\n\nProfessor Jack Gallimore, physics & astronomy. Photo courtesy of Jack Gallimore\n\n\"It really came out in these new observations that these filaments of maser spots line up like beads on a string,\" Gallimore said in the NRAO story. The team was stunned to see that there was a clear offset \u2014 a displacement angle \u2014 between the radio continuum showing the structures at the galaxy's core and the locations of the masers themselves. \"The configuration is unstable, so we are probably observing the source of a magnetically-launched outflow,\" he said.\n\nHSA measurements of the polarization of these water masers revealed striking evidence of magnetic fields.\n\n\"No one has ever seen polarization in water masers outside our galaxy,\" Gallimore said. Similar to the looping structures seen on our sun's surface as prominences, the polarization pattern of these water masers clearly indicates that magnetic fields are also at the root of these light-year-scale structures as well. \"Looking at the filaments and seeing that the polarization vectors are perpendicular to them, that's the key to confirming that they are magnetically driven structures. It's exactly what you'd expect to see.\"\n\nPrevious studies of the region hinted at patterns usually associated with magnetic fields, but such conclusions remained beyond the reach of observing technology until recently. This discovery is the first to confirm the existing theory.\n\n\"Only the HSA has the combination of resolution and sensitivity needed to map out magnetic fields using polarized light,\" said Gallimore.\n\nTheir findings reveal evidence of a compact central radio source (the galaxy's supermassive black hole), clear polarization of the water masers indicating structure within NGC 1068's magnetic fields, and spectacular extended features across the continuum of radio frequencies. Together, these findings indicate that magnetic fields are the underlying drivers of these phenomena.\n\nPlenty of mysteries remain, however. Within the radio continuum map, for instance, there is a diffuse, faint protrusion that the team nicknamed \"the foxtail,\" which extends northward from the central region.\n\n\"We said to ourselves when we set out to do this, \u2018let's see if we can really push the limits and get a good continuum as well as polarization data. And both of those goals succeeded,\" Gallimore said. \"With the NSF NRAO High Sensitivity Array, we detected water megamaser polarization for the first time, and we also made a really amazing continuum map that we're still trying to wrap our minds around.\"\n\nSpecial thanks to the NRAO and author Jessi Almstead for the use of their story."

Whether in finance, real estate, e-commerce or healthcare, the ability to extract, analyze and leverage data can provide a competitive edge for businesses across a wide range of industries. However, to fully harness the power of data, it is crucial to use a tool that can deliver reliability, precision and customizability.\n\nCustom web-scraping company Sequentum recently announced the launch of its cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, Sequentum Cloud. The company says this cutting-edge platform is the ultimate web scraping tool, allowing users of all sizes to access high-quality, trusted, auditable, custom web data on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\nWhy Low-Code Is Better Than No-Code\n\nWhen it comes to web scraping, many platforms aim to provide a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that forgoes the need for traditional hand coding. So-called no-code tools may offer simplicity, but with the evolving nature of the internet, they lack the customizability required to handle ever-changing data extraction needs.\n\nSequentum Cloud is a low-code solution, aiming to strike the perfect balance between usability and customizability. Like no-code platforms, Sequentum offers a point-and-click interface for easy agent creation. The company says that around 95% of tasks can be achieved with reusable, composable assets, thereby saving time and allowing you to scale easily.\n\nHowever, for the remaining 5% of tasks, Sequentum Cloud supports custom coding in JavaScript, Python, C# and Regular Expression, giving you the flexibility to handle any data from any data source, in any data structure, to any destination.\n\nHarness The Sequentum Agent Human-Friendly Text Format To Build Trust And Train Your AI To Interact In Complex Ways With The Web\n\nOne of the advantages of Sequentum Cloud is its new and innovative nested, human-readable, text format of the agent you create. With all the data extraction process logic presented in this way, all stakeholders can understand the data and the extraction process, helping to promote trust and transparency in the process and the resulting data.\n\nFurthermore, non-technical staff will be able to review your data collection process by seeing all the steps laid out in a human-readable format and easily read every step that is being followed to obtain the data and ensure compliance with guidelines. For example, some companies might restrict their staff from using web scraping bots to automatically bypass CAPTCHA tests. With human-readable results, compliance teams can more easily verify that restricted activities such as CAPTCHA automation are not happening in their data collection.\n\nSimilarly, the human-friendly agent text format is a turnkey way to train AI to make use of websites and mobile apps no matter how complex the interaction needs to be.\n\nTrust, Transparency And Ethical Compliance\n\nData trustworthiness, transparency and regulatory compliance are of the utmost importance for companies. Sequentum Cloud aims to address this by ensuring that users can see exactly where their data originates from and every step of the collection process, all auditable with full documentation.\n\nSequentum argues that this not only mitigates legal risks, such as those relating to privacy and security, but also makes sure that data aligns with ethical standards. This is crucial when it comes to monetizing data assets since documenting full lineage on all data from how data is sourced and processed will not only enable dataset creators to demonstrate where they added value but will also point to the web sources that contributed to that value.\n\nThis is particularly important for AI, analytics and data-driven decision-making, as a lack of data transparency could mean risking future monetization opportunities or compliance failures as new regulations are adopted. By being proactive and applying transparent data practices today, companies can avoid losing out on all the value they've added once the laws catch up to the way people are working today.\n\nGet Started Today\n\nIn today's competitive environment, trust, precision and transparency are essential if you want to gain an edge. In November, CIOReview named Sequentum as the Enterprise Data Delivery Platform of the Year for 2024. Sequentum Cloud seems poised to be the ultimate web scraper for the most precise and trusted data, combining a low-code platform and point-and-click interface with the power of customization and human-readable nested text format of the agent you create.\n\nSign up for a free trial today and experience the Sequentum Edge.\n\nFeatured photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash.\n\nThis post contains sponsored content.

The 49ers looked pretty good against a Chicago Bears side that can\u2019t score the football, but the Rams can score and have a good chance of beating the injury-riddled 49ers.\n\nIf the Rams win, you\u2019ll win $120 plus the bet. If the 49ers win, Fanatics will give you a No Sweat bet in the amount of the wager up to $100 if the bet loses."

His 261.2 passing yards per game represents his lowest average since 2019, while his 89.0 passer rating is his worst mark since 2014.\n\nCousins' subpar performance is especially worrisome after he signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract to join Atlanta as a free agent in March.\n\nDespite his turnover issues and the Falcons' inconsistent offense, Morris has remained steadfast in his approach to the top quarterback spot on the depth chart.\n\nHe confirmed that Cousins would remain Atlanta's starter following a 42-21 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.\n\nDianna Russini of The Athletic also reported that the Falcons haven't held any \"internal discussions\" regarding a change at quarterback.\n\nEven though Cousins is expected to retain his status as the starter, Morris also expressed his support for Penix as the team's eventual top signal-caller.\n\n\"I told you right from the beginning, he's our future,\" Morris said on Thursday, per Raimondi.\n\nPenix, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, still appears to have the support of the coaching staff as a long-term option."

            "article_content": "Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 MSRP $279.99 Score Details \u201cCanon's MegaTank Pixma G4280 is an affordable inkjet tank with economical ink, but there are some trade-offs at that price.\u201d Pros Low price for an inkjet tank\n\nIncludes 2 years of ink\n\nInk costs are super low\n\nSetup was quick and easy Cons Slow scanning and printing\n\nLow-contrast plain paper photos\n\nDisplay is small\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Specs Design Printing performance Special features Software and compatibility Price Is the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon recently introduced the new MegaTank Pixma G4280 all-in-one, a low-cost inkjet tank printer that refills with bottles instead of cartridges. That means ink lasts much longer and costs significantly less.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPrice isn\u2019t the only important consideration when you\u2019re shopping for the best printer. I went hands-on with the MegaTank Pixma G4280 to test print quality and speed, make copies, and scan photos to check out the automatic document feeder (ADF) and flatbed scanner.\n\nSpecs\n\nCanon MegaTank Pixma G4280 Dimensions 16.4 x 14.3 x 8.4 inches Weight 16.5 pounds Print speed 11 ppm (black), 6 ppm (color) Copy speed 8 cpm (black), 3.5 cpm (color) Print resolution 4800 x 1200 dpi Scan resolution 600 x 1200 dpi Ports Hi-Speed USB Paper capacity 100 sheets Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, dual band\n\nDesign\n\nThe MegaTank Pixma G4280 is very compact for an all-in-one printer with an ADF. The footprint is 16.4 inches by 14.3 inches and it stands just 8.4 inches high. The weight is 16.5 pounds, so it\u2019s easy to unbox and move around.\n\nThe lightly textured body in off-white works well in a home office and every corner is rounded, softening the appearance. It\u2019s a tank printer, so the ink levels are visible at a glance. The black tank is on the left side of the printer, with cyan, magenta, and yellow on the right.\n\nThe adjustable central control panel tilts up 45 degrees for easy viewing while standing or seated. Canon gave the MegaTank Pixma G4280 a 2.7-inch color touchscreen for easy access to menus. The controls also include buttons to make monochrome or color copies with one touch.\n\nThe main paper tray is in the back and holds 100 sheets. The ADF can handles 35 pages at a time. Overall, it\u2019s a nice design, but paper capacity could be larger.\n\nPrinting performance\n\nThe Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 is fast for short documents, completing the first page in about seven seconds. Inkjet printers don\u2019t have to warm up before starting, so they can beat laser printers in a sprint.\n\nFor longer print jobs, I felt the slowdown. Monochrome prints have a maximum speed of 11 pages per minute (ppm) and color manages just 6 ppm.\n\nA faster inkjet tank like Epson\u2019s EcoTank ET-3850 (16 ppm) or EcoTank Pro ET-5850 (25 ppm) cost more upfront, but offer economical printing without having to wait as long for the prints and copies.\n\nThat said, color and black-and-white documents look professional, and the MegaTank Pixma G4280 supports borderless printing. Fine lines and small print are sharp and easy to read.\n\nPhoto quality is good on glossy paper, but contrast is a little low. That problem is more obvious on plain paper where blacks look gray.\n\nWith tinkering, it\u2019s possible to improve picture quality. For example, selecting Photo Matte as the paper type improves plain paper photo quality.\n\nThere are better photo printers out there, and some are quite affordable.\n\nSpecial features\n\nThere\u2019s an option for duplex in copy settings, but the printer has what Canon calls semi-auto, which means I had to manually reinsert each sheet to complete the scan. It works, but takes time.\n\nIf you need to copy double-sided documents often, Canon\u2019s Maxify GX2020 costs more, but the full-duplex capability will save you a huge amount of time.\n\nThe copy quality is good and relatively fast for a slow printer. There are options to reduce, enlarge, and copy multiple pages to a single sheet, saving paper costs.\n\nThe flatbed scanner captures up to 600 dots per inch (dpi), which is good enough in most cases. For photos and negatives, you might want a dedicated scanner to maintain maximum resolution.\n\nSoftware and compatibility\n\nInstalling the MegaTank Pixma G4280 took about 15 minutes and was quite simple. I plugged in power, scanned the QR code on the printer\u2019s screen to get the app, and pressed the link button to connect Wi-Fi. There\u2019s a USB-B port if you prefer to use a wired connection to a computer.\n\nCanon ships the MegaTank Pixma G4280 with four full ink bottles, including a large supply of cyan, magenta, and yellow, along with a double-sized container of black. The box also contained replaceable black and color printheads.\n\nEverything was clearly marked. I installed the printheads and filled the ink tanks in about two minutes. The printer alerted me that the initial ink priming takes about seven minutes, so I could be productive elsewhere instead of waiting for it to finish.\n\nLike most major brands, Canon printers are easy to connect to Windows PCs and Macs. The Canon Print app allows printing and scanning from mobile devices and Chromebooks.\n\nPrice\n\nCanon\u2019s list price for the MegaTank Pixma G4280 is $280, but the printer is often available for $230. The low upfront price might catch your eye, but the real value is in the ink, which Canon estimates is equal to about $1,000 worth of ink cartridges.\n\nThe included bottles hold enough ink to last up to two years, equivalent to 30 black (PG-260) and color (CL-261) cartridges. That\u2019s the type used in the Canon\u2019s budget-priced Pixma TR7020a inkjet printer.\n\nWith full tanks, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 can print up to 6,000 monochrome pages and 7,700 color pages. Based on current ink prices, that means each color document costs about five-tenths of a cent per page, while black ink costs drop to two-tenths of a cent per page.\n\nIs the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 is inexpensive for an inkjet tank printer, but there are trade-offs to keep the cost that low. It\u2019s slower than cartridge-based inkjets and laser printers and has limited 100-sheet paper capacity. The semi-auto duplex ADF works, but is slow and requires your presence through the entire process.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t in a hurry, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 minimizes ink costs. It handles color document copies and prints nicely. Glossy photo prints also look good.\n\nAll in all, though, there are better all-in-one printers with full-duplex ADFs, and you can save you money on specialty paper costs by choosing the best photo printers, which can print with good quality on plain paper.\n\nThat means Canon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 could work well in a home office where you aren\u2019t sharing the printer with co-workers, but it\u2019s compromises make it harder to recommend for its intended audience."

His visionary leadership continues to transform organizations and inspire the global AI community.\n\nPlease tell us your name and a little more about yourself.\n\nMy name is Himanshu Sinha, and I am a data scientist with over 15 years of experience in leveraging machine learning and AI to drive transformative change across industries. From fintech to healthcare and hospitality, I have had the privilege of developing and deploying innovative AI solutions that blend technical excellence with business strategy. My expertise spans a wide range of areas, including generative AI, predictive analytics, and data observability.\n\nBeyond my technical work, I am a passionate mentor, a published co-author of books on AI and ML, and a patented innovator. I thrive on building solutions that not only solve complex problems but also inspire others to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.\n\nYou\u2019ve had an extraordinary career in AI and machine learning, spanning various industries like healthcare, hospitality, and fintech. Can you walk us through your journey and how it has shaped your current role as Director of Advanced Data Science at Marriott International?\n\nI began my professional journey in consumer-focused research for a CPG brand, here I developed a fascination for consumer behaviour change indicated through and their business implications . This passion deepened as I worked on leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze behavioral changes and their impact on business outcomes. My focus has always been on helping organizations use patterns in data to inform strategy and drive results.\n\nWorking in large scale consulting such as Wipro brought me close to enterprises\u2019s pain areas and help create machine learning cored solutions for them. In 2012, I established a Center of Excellence for analytics at Agilis, a lesser-known company at the time, helping telecom clients predict fraud and mitigate risks like churn. Over the years, Agilis went through multiple acquisitions, becoming Infogix and later Precisely Inc. During this period, I led the development of a bespoke software product with an embedded ML-based \u2018Anomaly Detection\u2019 system. This solution predicts \u2018data drift and shift\u2019, ensuring data quality and integrity. Today, it\u2019s a multimillion-dollar offering used by Fortune 100 companies to maintain operational excellence of data dependent functions.\n\nCurrently, as the Director of Advanced Data Science at Marriott International, I lead transformative AI initiatives, including personalization models, generative AI applications, and global acquisition strategies. My journey has been about building scalable AI solutions that align technical innovation with business impact, and I continue to be inspired by the limitless potential of machine learning and AI to transform industries.\n\nIn your article, \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed\u201d, you discuss the challenges of fragmented chatbot strategies. What inspired you to advocate for a unified chatbot framework, and how do you see it transforming industries?\n\nThe inspiration came from witnessing the inefficiencies and frustrations caused by fragmented chatbot strategies in enterprises\u2014siloed implementations, inconsistent user experiences, and high maintenance costs. I realized the need for a unified framework that could streamline development, ensure scalability, and provide a seamless experience across touchpoints.\n\nA unified chatbot framework transforms industries by enabling businesses to deliver consistent, personalized interactions while reducing operational overhead. It empowers enterprises to integrate.\n\nEnterprises often face the dilemma of balancing ROI with the complexity of AI solutions. How do you approach this challenge in your projects, and can you share a specific example where you had to make such decisions?\n\nBalancing ROI with AI complexity is a common challenge, but I approach it by focusing on simplification and scalability without compromising value. In my article, The Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed, I discussed how fragmented chatbot strategies often create inefficiencies and diminish user satisfaction. To address this, I advocate for a unified framework that prioritizes intent-driven design and reusable components.\n\nA specific example is a chatbot project for a travel enterprise. Initially, individual bots were handling separate use cases like booking management, trip planning, and customer support, leading to redundancy and confusion. By implementing a unified triage bot as the primary entry point, we streamlined user interactions and routed intents to specialized APIs. This reduced operational complexity and boosted ROI by consolidating efforts into a cohesive system.\n\nThe result? Enhanced user satisfaction and scalable deployment across multiple business units\u2014all while maintaining a strong ROI through reduced maintenance costs and improved efficiency. Simplifying complexity is not just about technology\u2014it\u2019s about creating value for both users and businesses.\n\nYour work highlights generative AI\u2019s role in creating personalized user experiences, such as credit card recommendations. How do you envision the future of generative AI in personalization across industries?\n\nGenerative AI is revolutionizing personalization by creating tailored, intuitive experiences that resonate with individual users. In the context of chatbots, like those for credit card recommendations, generative AI plays a pivotal role in breaking decision paralysis. It simplifies complex choices by presenting relevant options in a conversational and engaging way, helping customers make faster and more confident decisions.\n\nLooking ahead, I envision generative AI expanding its influence across industries\u2014from retail to healthcare\u2014where it will not only personalize user interactions but also anticipate needs, provide proactive solutions, and streamline decision-making. The future of personalization lies in AI\u2019s ability to combine deep contextual understanding with dynamic adaptability, ultimately creating experiences that are both efficient and deeply human-centered.\n\nYou\u2019ve authored books, published scholarly articles, and filed patents in advanced AI domains. How do you balance your role as a technical leader and a thought leader in the ever-evolving field of AI?\n\nBalancing my roles as a technical and thought leader in AI comes down to a shared foundation: curiosity , giving back to learners community and a commitment to impact. As a technical leader, I focus on driving practical innovations\u2014building systems like scalable enterprise chatbots or anomaly detection frameworks that solve real business problems. This hands-on work keeps me connected to the evolving challenges and opportunities in AI.\n\nAs a thought leader, I view my role as amplifying these learnings for a broader audience. Writing articles on social blogs like \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots\u201d allows me to distill complex ideas into actionable strategies, fostering industry-wide collaboration and growth. It\u2019s a synergy\u2014my technical work feeds my thought leadership, while my engagement with the AI community sharpens my ability to lead in dynamic environments.\n\nUltimately, the key is staying grounded in purpose: using AI not just to innovate, but to inspire and drive meaningful change.\n\nMany of your projects aim to enhance customer experience through AI, like anomaly detection and marketing optimization. How do you align technical innovation with customer-centric outcomes?\n\nI believe the key to aligning technical innovation with customer-centric outcomes is to start with the end in mind\u2014understanding what the customer truly values. Whether it\u2019s anomaly detection, marketing optimization, or enterprise chatbots, my approach combines cutting-edge AI techniques with a deep focus on creating seamless and meaningful experiences for users.\n\nFor instance, in my article \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed,\u201d I emphasized building unified frameworks that deliver consistent, personalized customer interactions. Similarly, my work on marketing optimization involves leveraging predictive models to understand behavioral patterns, enabling hyper-targeted engagement that feels intuitive to the customer.\n\nAt the core, it\u2019s about using AI as a bridge\u2014not just to solve technical problems but to anticipate and enhance the customer journey. By embedding intelligence into every interaction, we not only drive business impact but also create solutions that resonate with people in real and tangible ways.\n\nWith increasing emphasis on data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, how do you ensure that your AI models remain compliant while delivering actionable insights?\n\nEnsuring compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA starts with embedding guardrails into the design and deployment of AI models. Guardrails ensure that privacy, security, and transparency are foundational, not an afterthought.\n\nIn my work, I advocate for privacy-by-design principles\u2014data minimization, anonymization, and secure pipelines are non-negotiables. For instance, when building models for personalized customer targeting or chatbots, we ensure that data used is aggregated and anonymized, aligning with both regulations and user trust.\n\nBalancing compliance with actionable insights requires robust governance frameworks. These frameworks monitor data usage and provide explainability, ensuring that while insights drive business value, they do so ethically and legally. In the age of AI, it\u2019s not just about what we can do with data, but what we should do, and that\u2019s where compliance meets innovation.\n\nAs an internationally recognized expert, what advice would you give aspiring data scientists looking to make a significant impact in the field of AI and machine learning?\n\nMy advice to aspiring data scientists is simple: focus on solving practical problems and always prioritize the user experience. AI and machine learning aren\u2019t just about building sophisticated models\u2014they\u2019re about creating solutions that make a tangible difference.\n\nStart by immersing yourself in real-world challenges. Learn how businesses operate, identify pain points, and think about how data and AI can address them. For instance, in my own journey, I\u2019ve worked on everything from predictive analytics to creating a unified chatbot framework. These experiences taught me that the best solutions are the ones that simplify complexity and put the user first.\n\nStay curious, keep experimenting, and don\u2019t shy away from asking questions like: \u201cHow does this impact the end user?\u201d and \u201cIs this scalable for enterprise needs?\u201d A data scientist\u2019s true power lies not just in technical expertise but in the ability to translate it into meaningful impact. Keep that as your north star, and you\u2019ll create solutions that truly transform industries."

            "article_content": "Airwars, a UK-based nonprofit that investigates civilian deaths in conflict zones, said on Thursday that the toll of destruction on civilians in Gaza is the largest it has documented in a decade.\n\n\u201cIt is by far the most intense, destructive, and fatal conflict for civilians that Airwars has ever documented\u201d since its establishment in 2014.\n\nAt least 5,139 civilians, including 1,900 children, were killed during the first three weeks of the ongoing Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip that began on Oct. 7, 2023, a new report published Thursday found, constituting what it described as the worst pattern of harm to civilians in modern warfare.\n\nAirwars said it recorded 606 incidents of civilian harm in the Gaza Strip between Oct. 7 and Oct. 31, 2023, representing a small percentage of the more than 7,000 incidents of civilian harm that the watchdog\u2019s researchers have monitored since the start of the war.\n\n\u201cThe harm to civilians from the first month of the Israeli campaign in Gaza is incomparable with any 21st century air campaign,\u201d Airwars said in its new report entitled \u201cPatterns of harm analysis.\u201d\n\nThe watchdog compared its findings with the civilian deaths it recorded during the US-led campaign against the Islamic State (ISIS) in its former Syrian stronghold of Raqqa in 2017. Airwars documented 2,556 civilian casualties at the hands of the US-led coalition during a four-month period at the time.\n\nIt also said the number of civilian deaths recorded in Gaza during the first three weeks of the war is nearly four times the number of civilians killed during the most lethal month Airwars previously documented, which was March 2017. At the time, Airwars recorded 1,470 civilian deaths during the US-led coalition\u2019s campaign against ISIS in Iraq\u2019s Mosul.\n\nThe Israeli army unleashed a relentless air and ground campaign on the besieged Gaza Strip Oct. 7, 2023, in reprisal for an unprecedented cross-border assault by Hamas militants into southern Israel, during which about 1,200 people were killed and over 250 others taken hostage.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Gaza-based Ministry of Health, the Israeli offensive has so far killed more than 44,835 Palestinians and wounded over 106,356 others.\n\nUN agencies and rights groups have accused Israel of committing war crimes and of violating international laws in Gaza by resorting to a disproportionate use of force, targeting of civilian infrastructure such as schools and hospitals and enacting collective punishment.\n\nIsrael denies these accusations and asserts that its military operations are a legitimate response to Hamas\u2019 actions and that it follows measures to avoid civilian casualties. The Israeli military argues that Hamas embeds itself in civilian areas, using civilians as shields and storing weapons in homes and schools, which it claims complicates its efforts to avoid civilian harm.\n\nAirwars warned that \u201cthe manner in which Israel has conducted the war in Gaza may signal the development of a concerning new norm: a way of conducting air campaigns with a greater frequency of strikes, a greater intensity of damage, and a higher threshold of acceptance for civilian harm than seen before.\u201d"

Even If a survivor has not received an estimate of damage determination, SBA can provide a low-interest disaster loan for the total loss, up to its loan limits. The survivor will simply need to agree to use the insurance settlement amount to reduce or repay the loan, according to the press release.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusinesses and private nonprofit organizations of any size may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace disaster-damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory, and other business assets, according to the press release.\n\nDisaster loans up to $500,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace disaster-damaged or destroyed real estate.

Eligible mitigation improvements may include a safe room or storm shelter, sump pump, French drain or retaining wall to help protect property and occupants from future damage, according to the press release.\n\nInterest rates are as low as 4% for businesses, 3.25% for nonprofit organizations, and 2.813% for homeowners and renters, with terms up to 30 years. Interest does not begin to accrue, and monthly payments are not due, until 12 months from the date of the initial disbursement. Loan amounts and terms are set by the SBA and are based on each applicant\u2019s financial condition, according to the press release.\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2024, it was announced that funds for the Disaster Loan Program have been fully expended. While no new loans can be issued until Congress appropriates additional funding, we remain committed to supporting disaster survivors. Applications will continue to be accepted and processed to ensure individuals and businesses are prepared to receive assistance once funding becomes available, according to the press release.\n\nApplicants are encouraged to submit their loan applications promptly for review in anticipation of future funding, according to the press release.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the changes to FEMA\u2019s Sequence of Delivery, survivors are now encouraged to simultaneously apply for FEMA grants and SBA low-interest disaster loan assistance to fully recover.

The new AOC AG326UD might not have the catchiest name, but it sports a decent set of specs with a $799 price tag.\n\nAOC takes up two spots on our best gaming monitor guide, thanks to their affordability and performance. The new AOC AGON Pro monitor appears to be following suit, as it undercuts some QD-OLED and regular OLED monitors by a fair margin in the 4K space.\n\nIn our tests, we\u2019ve found that Samsung\u2019s QD-OLED is generally superior to LG\u2019s competing WOLED tech, especially when it comes to viewing text on the Windows desktop, which can look fuzzier on the latter. AOC also says its new monitor supports TrueBlack HDR400, which will give games deep, rich blacks.\n\nThe monitor also looks set to carry on AOC\u2019s long line of excellent high-refresh rate monitors. While not the fastest, its 165Hz refresh rate is more than enough for most people and will be a massive boon for those deep in the waters of esports or twitch-heavy titles.\n\nThis lower refresh rate than the competition is probably a good reason why this monitor sits at $799 rather than over $1,000. Another bonus is that this new AOC screen is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible, meaning it can synchronize its refresh rate with the frame rate output from the best graphics card models, stopping irritating tearing issues.\n\nOLED tech \u2013 and its spin-offs \u2013 are currently going through a small price crash. On Amazon, large quantities of previously expensive 1440p and 1080p OLED gaming monitors are having hundreds of dollars slashed from their price tags.\n\nAOC\u2019s Agon Pro AG276QZD for, example, which has a 1440p resolution and 240Hz refresh rate, is sitting at a single cent under $500, for example, reduced from $600. Meanwhile, on the competing 4K front, the Asus ROG Swift PG32UCDM has had $300 cut from its price, leaving it at $999.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait for AOC\u2019s newest 4K QD-OLED to cross our desks before we make any real judgment. However, it is still cheaper than the best-known brands even with discounts. The AOC AG326UD also has a 32-inch screen, making it a little bigger than most OLED monitors in this price range.\n\nOLED looks like it is getting cheaper every year, and with CES 2025 coming, we\u2019re expecting to see much more. The sublime color reproduction and fast response times provided by these panels mean that any titles played on the best gaming PCs will almost always look infinitely better than on LCD. Even the best gaming handheld, the Steam Deck, has had an OLED refresh, putting it right at the top of our best gaming handheld guide."

If you want to write it out, it\u2019s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.\n\n\"This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.\"\n\nApparently, all these wires help to draw information from parallel universes (Google)\n\nAdvert\n\nProfessor Deutsch is a physicist at the University of Oxford, and is known for his work in quantum computing after putting in research during the 1990s, supporting Neven's claims.\n\nSkeptics cast doubts\n\nHowever, some doubters say that these claims about its performance are based on the company's own benchmark to measure quantum performance, and that it doesn't prove that people in parallel universes are getting our information for us.\n\nThe development of Willow and the scientific findings behind it have been published in the journal, Nature."

[View Related Entries]\n\nAbout\n\n\"Project Blue Beam\" is a conspiracy theory proposed by Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois conspiracy theorist Serge Monast in the 1990s. It claims NASA and the UN plan to stage a fake alien invasion or religious event using holograms to establish a new world order. Its 2024 resurgence ties to increased public interest in UFOs and aliens, as seen in the 2023 UFO Whistleblower Report, the unidentified aircraft shot down in Alaska in 2023 and other UAP-related phenomena in 2024.\n\nOrigin\n\nCanadian Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois conspiracy theorist Serge Monast first coined and propagated his \"Project Blue Beam\" conspiracy theory in his 1994 book Project Blue Beam (NASA). The book detailed the belief that NASA, alongside the United Nations, plans to create a new global totalitarian regime by technologically simulating an extraterrestrial encounter. \"Project Blue Beam\" is a visual representation of what this messianic symbol could look like, i.e. a blue beam coming from the sky as though from a spaceship.\n\nSpread\n\nIn the 2010s, the phrase \"Project Blue Beam\" came to be used as a buzzword to peddle similar conspiracy theories about governments faking a space invasion to consolidate global power.\n\nSeveral YouTube videos addressing the conspiracy theory cited Serge Monast directly, as seen in a November 7th, 2007 YouTube video by REQUIEMETERNAM, captioned, \"ILLUMINATI The Blue Beam Project Top Secret 1.\" The video gathered over 300,000 views in 17 years.\n\nOn April 14th, 2009, YouTuber AutoActionCam posted a similar video, detailing several NASA and military-related press conferences and releases from U.S. officials, piecing together a theory that implies that these institutions plan to come together and create a rapture hoax.\n\nA February 26th, 2013, Reddit post to the subreddit /r/todayilearned by Redditor /u/doc_daneeka alleged that the CIA once proposed a solution to remove Fidel Castro from power in Cuba by spreading \"rumours that he was the Antichrist, then fake the second coming; a US submarine would project an image of Jesus on some clouds near Havana while firing star-shells. A loudspeaker would be the voice of Jesus, urging them to renounce communism.\" The post gathered over 2,000 points in 10 years.\n\nThe linked article cited a November 20, 1975, document titled \"Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders,\" written by former CIA Assistant Deputy Director for National Intelligence Programs, Thomas A. Parrott. The document reportedly recounted how Major General Edward Geary Lansdale proposed the aforementioned Castro scheme.\n\n2020s Project Blue Beam Resurgence\n\nOn November 8th, 2022, Robert Duncan discussed Project Blue Beam on Danny Brown's podcast. The relevant clip was reposted to Twitter / X by @TheChiefNerd on February 13th, 2023, gathering over 6,000 likes in a year. The post came soon after the military shot down an unknown cylindrical object over Alaska, prompting UFO discussions nationwide.\n\nHarvard Scientist Robert Duncan Explains \u2018Project Blue Beam\u2019 \u201cYou can see it by the naked eye and it would leave a radar trace\u201d@KONCRETE pic.twitter.com/Vi4r1zuhcc \u2014 Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) February 14, 2023\n\nOn March 10th, 2024, MMA fighter Ryan Garcia mentioned the conspiracy theory in a TikTok live that was reposted to X by @ramberrto, gathering over 5,000 likes in nine months.\n\nRyan Garcia also known as KingRyan just went live on TikTok while hooked up onto a machine. He goes on to talk to about Project Blue Beam and goes onto say Disney could be apart of a huge trafficking problem.

            "article_content": "Iranian vessel, drone or UFO: Mystery over bizarre lights spotted in skies over New Jersey\n\nDrones of indeterminate origin have been buzzing New Jersey over the last month, prompting a mixed bag of responses from regional lawmakers. The state\u2019s governor has insisted the drones are safe, while a Congressman believes they\u2019re the vanguard of an Iranian \u201cmothership.\u201d\n\nHomeland security officials and regional lawmakers met on Wednesday to discuss the sightings further.\n\nDozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over president-elect Donald Trump\u2019sgolf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must also be FAA certified.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists, with reports claiming some are the size of an SUV,\n\nThe number of sightings has increased in recent days, though officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It\u2019s also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once.\n\nA drone of unknown origin was spotted flying over Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf club in New Jersey (TMX)\n\nGov. Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don\u2019t appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have.\n\nMany municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019re taking deadly seriously. I don\u2019t blame people for being frustrated,\" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said earlier this week.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew echoed Murphy's sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe have a serious problem with our aerospace,\u201d he said on Wednesday before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \u201cThe recent sightings of unidentified drones in the state of New Jersey, my home state, is justifiably causing tremendous public concern.\u201d\n\nUnlike Murphy, however, Van Drew blamed the drones on an \"Iranian mothership.\"\n\n\"I've learned, for real, that there is circumstantial evidence that there's an Iranian mothership off the East Coast of the United States, and that's launching these drone incursions,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh shot that theory down, assuring ABC News that there \"is not any truth to that \u2014 there is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there's no so called mothership launching drones towards the United States.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to monitor what is happening,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAt no point were our installations threatened when this activity was occurring.\u201d\n\nVan Drew did not buy the Pentagon's response, insisting during an ABC News interview that there is a \"real possibility that it is a foreign entity.\"\n\n\"[The Pentagon says] to us there's nothing to fear, but we have no idea who it is, where it comes from, what it's about, and what it can do,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetails about Wednesday's meeting were not immediately disclosed, and Murphy did not attend.\n\nRepublican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he and other legislators met with Homeland Security and state police officials for about 90 minutes at a state police facility in West Trenton.\n\nPeterson said DHS officials were generous with their time, but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones.\n\n\u201cSo who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? \u201cMy understanding is they have no clue,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA message seeking comment on Peterson\u2019s remarks was left with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMost of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states, including the New York City area, and over Pennsylvania\u2019s Delaware County and Philadelphia.\n\nJames Edwards, of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month.\n\n\u201cIt raises concern mainly because there's so much that's unknown,\u201d Edwards said Wednesday. \u201cThere are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press"

From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience.
