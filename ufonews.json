Lee said Andrews half expected her Majesty to get out of the car, only to find out it was actually her chief scientific advisor.\n\nRetired CID officer John Hanson, who is a UFO researcher and author said there was \u2018undoubtedly\u2019 a link between crop circles and UFOs.\n\nHe said: \u201cParticularly the early crop circles were just circular, burnt formations in the grass or in the fields. I think they described them as UFO nests back in the olden days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to witnesses who have more or less seen these things appear and then gone over and then ended up with some quite terrifying experiences.\u201d\n\nThe doc also claims that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were hugely interested in the Rendlesham UFO case from 1980 - which has been dubbed the British Roswell.\n\nThe case allegedly saw a UFO land in the forest at Rendlesham over Christmas weekend in 1980. Numerous airforce personnel, from nearby RAF Bentwaters, which was a US NATO base at the time, went to investigate and saw strange orbs and beams of light shining through the forest.\n\nThe film also investigates wild claims that, the then, Prince Charles piloted an experimental UFO type craft in 1975, and explores what he can do now as King to aid UFO disclosure.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhat I wanted to show in this film is how passionate and serious the senior royals were on the subject of UFOs. They had to keep this mostly a secret because of possible ridicule but if such high standing, balanced people, took them seriously why can\u2019t we?\n\n\u201cThere is something that pilots and police officers are seeing in the skies that can\u2019t be explained so why can\u2019t the British government take them seriously?\u201d\n\nJoin the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

He added: \u201cHere is somebody who could pick up the phone and say look here what\u2019s going on in the United States. He could ask for a full classified briefing.\u201d\n\nThe film includes footage from John Hanson, taken in 2000, of the alleged UFO sighting Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk.\n\nThe \u2018sighting\u2019 became known as the British Roswell - in reference to the 1947 crash of a United States Army Air Forces balloon near Roswell, New Mexico which birthed a conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nLee claims Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, was the first member of the Royal Family to have a UFO experience in around 1875. Lee said: \u201cHe wrote an entry in his journal saying he saw strange, dazzling lights in the sky, like orbs flying past and he couldn\u2019t describe them. It was powerful enough for him to make an entry in his diary and the basis of modern, royal UFOlogy.\u201d\n\nLee said Lord Mountbatten, Prince Phillip\u2019s uncle had a passion for UFO\u2019s. Nick Pope, a retired member of the Ministry of Defence, also claims the Royals have been interested in UFO\u2019s for decades.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut this was always a matter of extreme sensitivity because in some ways it was counter to the government\u2019s public position on this. Or if not directly counter to it, certainly difficult to gel with it.\n\n\u201cPrince Phillip was very much at the forefront of Royal interest in this, though arguably he was introduced to that subject by Lord Mountbatten.\u201d\n\nThe film also looks at the story that the the Prince Charles flew a prototype UFO in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1975. Lee said: \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t extra terrestrial, it was a saucer shaped craft. But the funny thing is it has some strange magnetic propulsion system which was unknown.\u201d\n\nThe craft was said to have emitted a blue ionic flame and was controlled magnetically by a larger craft behind it.\n\nBut the film does acknowledge Prince William is not known to have had any UFO experiences.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhoever is King is going to have an important role to play on the world stage with disclosure being imminent that we are not alone.\u201d\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

Find out more about our reviews policy.\n\nThose with their ears close to the ground will have heard the rumblings of Dan Da Dan, an adaptation of Yukinobu Tatsu's million-selling oddball manga.\n\nThankfully, the premiere episode of the new anime \u2013 heading to Crunchyroll and Netflix \u2013 doesn't disappoint, with studio Science Saru delivering an unapologetically weird, stylish, and anarchic opener that marks it out as one of anime's first must-watch shows in the Fall season.\n\nEven a cursory glance at the premise alone should clue you in to just how bizarre Dan Da Dan is. After violently breaking up with her first boyfriend, hotheaded Momo encounters the bookish Okarun (his real name is a brilliant full-circle moment that acts as the premiere's best punchline) being bullied.\n\nInevitably, he mistakes the basest of interactions for true love and, after a quick talk, each realizes they're into slightly 'out there' interests. Momo believes in ghosts, while Okarun is mad for alien conspiracies. The kicker? They're both completely dismissive of the other's beliefs. That delicious setup, when coupled with the opening credits overflowing with color and energy, makes an immediate impression \u2013 and it only snowballs from there.\n\nClose encounters\n\n(Image credit: \u00a9Yukinobu Tatsu/SHUEISHA, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nTo prove themselves right, they set a challenge: Momo is sent to an abandoned hospital known for UFO abductions and Okarun heads to a dark tunnel, a supposed hotspot for paranormal activity.\n\nIn a great twist, Momo is abducted by aliens and Okarun comes face to face with a deprecit, lewd, and crude spirit by the name of Turbo Granny.\n\nThe worlds of ghosts and aliens invariably then collide in the premiere's standout scene, an animation tour-de-force that sees Okarun (who has been cursed by Turbo Granny) crashing into the ship's interior via the medium of smartphone.\n\nThe Serpoians (from the planet Serpo, naturally) holding Momo captive are then quickly dispatched. A good thing, too. Their creepy stretched smiles combined with their emotionless stares and unhealthy obsession \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 for reproducing with women and extracting their 'banana' means these aren't the sort of happy-go-lucky characters you want to outstay their welcome.\n\nThey also offer a window into some of the episode's more unsavory elements, namely the uncomfortable sexual scenes. For such a fiery and layered character, (the schoolgirl-aged) Momo sure spends a lot of time trapped in chains and laying on her back in various states of undress. At least the conclusion means Momo gets her own back in satisfying fashion, as she escapes, awakening her latent telekinetic powers, and soundly defeats the Serpoians.\n\n(Image credit: \u00a9Yukinobu Tatsu/SHUEISHA, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nDan Da Dan's opening episode then sets up the story to come, for those who may still be on the fence after this paradoxical premiere of gleefully immature, yet charming, action: Momo is the only one who can stop Okarun's powers from controlling him (a clever narrative trick to keep the pair bound together), while Okarun is heading back to lift the curse from Turbo Granny. Most intriguingly of all, there are seeds of a love story planted amid the chaos.\n\nYes, despite a premiere packed with ghouls and UFOs, it's the sweet chemistry between the two leads that will have you coming back for more. It's a small moment, but it's best evidenced by the fact Momo quite quickly chooses to open up to her newfound companion, sharing that she doesn't have parents, but she's instead looked after by her grandma, herself a superstitious spirit medium.\n\nDeeply protective and unashamed of it, Momo stands out from the wave of more one-dimensional protagonists who are quick to anger and even quicker to lash out. If anything, it's a shame that the quieter moments are lost in a cacophony of sound and mayhem as the first episode hurtles towards its breakneck conclusion \u2013 and leaves me wondering whether Dan Da Dan has crammed a little too much in to ensure fans return next week.\n\nWith a relentless pace and the sort of LSD-infused imagery that demands to be watched on a big screen (indeed, Dan Da Dan first premiered in cinemas last month), Dan Da Dan is a joy from start to finish. While some of the medium's rougher edges in regards to sexuality and objectification still remain, this is a glittering debut that should prove to be a gateway drug for many into the weirder, wilder sides of anime.\n\nDan Da Dan is now streaming on Crunchyroll and Netflix.

        "category": "ufo",
        "date": "4h",
        "source": "Polygon",
        "article_content": "Polygon\u2019s Editor\u2019s Letter is a column from Editor-in-Chief Chris Plante that reflects on the video game and entertainment industries, their communities, and Polygon itself. New editions appear in the first week of each month.\n\nLast month, I wrote about how the endless stream of \u201ctoo many games\u201d has caused existential problems for game makers. This month, I\u2019ll focus on the other side of the equation: the audience. The people who play all of these new games. Or, as a recent survey tells us, the people who don\u2019t play them.\n\nAbundance should be a boon for the average video game fan. Unfettered competition pushes prices down, particularly on PC, where each month players can grab bundles containing dozens (sometimes hundreds) of games for less than $20. And even the fanciest, freshest games often get discounted within weeks of launch.\n\nBetter still, as creators seek untouched corners of the market, their target audiences can be more varied. Wish to build a cozy castle diorama? Want a hardcore SWAT simulator or an anime Stardew Valley-like? Crave an ode to Brazilian bootleg boomer shooters of the 1990s built on actual 1990s tech? If you have an itch, odds are it can be scratched.\n\nAnd yet, a diminutive portion of the overall gaming audience plays new games. According to a report from Newzoo, in 2023 players spent 77% of their playtime on games three years or older. Much of the time players spent on new games went to annualized franchises, like Call of Duty, Madden, and EA FC. A paltry 8% of overall playtime in 2023 went to new games not tied to big, yearly IP.\n\nIn 2024, when someone sits down to play a video game, they can either spend money on a promising but unknown new game, or they can choose from their massive backlog of owned games. Or, they might return to a live-service game like League of Legends or Fortnite that continues to provide a familiar dopamine surge week after week, year after year. To play a new game is to willingly take a risk in terms of one\u2019s money, time, and happiness.\n\nThus, we have 8% of total playtime going toward new games: a tiny slice of pie from which the thousands of developers each year fight for a bite. Ryan Rigney, gaming comms veteran and author of the illuminating Push to Talk newsletter, has been digging into this problem (and this unsettling data) for the past few weeks. I strongly recommend you read his piece \u201cAre Old Games Killing New Games?\u201d\n\nIn that newsletter, Rigney uses Arco, his personal favorite game of the year, which at the time of writing this piece has a modest 623 reviews on Steam, as an example of how a truly great game can fall through the cracks. The example hit me like a rock to the forehead. Despite Arco being one of my most anticipated games, despite receiving advance code from a publicist, despite having a weekly video game podcast that requires me to sample dozens of new games a year, I only now have gotten around to playing this game.\n\nAnd frankly, even with everything going for it, Arco could have just as easily collected dust indefinitely on my exponentially elongating to-do list.\n\nHow to enjoy new video games in the Age of Abundance\n\nSlackers - Carts of Glory is one of the many great games of 2024 that you\u2019ve likely never played. Image: Falling Saints\n\nWhat does this mean for you? As the headline promised (or threatened?), you too won\u2019t play many of 2024\u2019s best games. Time is against you. The number of hours can\u2019t fit the surplus of great new releases.\n\nAssuming we all accept that to be true, I thought it might help if I shared some strategies I\u2019ve learned over the years for making the most of my video game time. As someone professionally expected to have a grasp on the vast majority of video games released, plus the entirety of gaming history, I\u2019ve been wrestling with this challenge for some time.\n\nBe mindful of where your gaming time goes: This is my number one tip when people ask me how I play so many games. The answer is that I play the stuff I like, and I skip or bail on the stuff I don\u2019t. For the past decade, major video game publishers have worked tirelessly to create \u201cforever\u201d games that use habit-forming hooks to lock in players indefinitely. If you want to play the same game every day for years on end, that\u2019s fine and your prerogative! Alternatively, if you want to play new games more, then take a break from your \u201cforever\u201d game of choice. You might find, with some distance, it had become a chore rather than a treat.\n\nWatch streams and playthroughs: Ashley Bardhan recently argued that watching a video game isn\u2019t so different from playing it. I agree. This guidance won\u2019t surprise anyone under the age of 30. But many gamers in the millennial demographic (or older) have yet to make a habit of watching streams on Twitch or playthroughs on YouTube. If this is your first time, search for a playthrough of a new game that interests you on YouTube, skim the headlines and thumbnail images for a style that matches your own, and give it a try!\n\nFind communities that match your pace: Similar to watching games, reading about games is a great way to follow games. Just be sure to find a community that moves at your tempo. If you want a trillion messages and the latest info, a game\u2019s official or unofficial Discord can be great. Want the highlights, try a subreddit. And if you prefer to keep up to date on the games community as a whole, rather than one game, I recommend Polygon.com. Naturally.\n\nAccept that you can\u2019t know everything: For the first few decades of video game culture, the most hardcore gamers took pride in having an encyclopedic knowledge of the industry. Not only had they played every game, but they also knew its developer, publisher, and \u2014 if it came from Japan \u2014 the original title and release date. Because game developers of the \u201980s and \u201990s only released so many games, exhaustive knowledge could be cultivated. The NES had 1,377 games. But then the PS4 had 3,399 games. Steam laps both those numbers each year. In 2024, acquiring an all-encompassing knowledge of video games isn\u2019t possible. And the pursuit of it is like trying to catch every fish in the ocean.\n\nImage: Mossmouth via Polygon\n\nBefore I wrap, let\u2019s talk about one more game.\n\nLast month, developer Mossmouth published what Game File author Stephen Totilo wrote \u201cmight be the most 2024 game anyone can play this year.\u201d If you can even call it a game. UFO 50 is a package carrying 50 stand-alone, complete games from some of the most brilliant game designers alive.\n\nUFO 50\u2019s a masterpiece and the vast majority of gamers will never play it. A tiny fraction of those who do will manage to play all 50 games. And an infinitesimal percentage of the people on Earth will finish the game in its entirety.\n\nThe project is a microcosm of the problem that faces players. With so many good games in UFO 50, its players must approach the game as they would the entire video game ecosystem. Be mindful of your time and your priorities. Dabble! Don\u2019t like a game? Drop it! Be comfortable knowing you don\u2019t have to play all 50 games to completion to enjoy UFO 50. In fact, you don\u2019t have to play any of them.\n\nWeeks after its release, fans have come together to solve its mysteries and celebrate their favorite games within the game on Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube. They\u2019ve created lore explainers, role-played within its fictional history, and carried the experience of the game beyond the confines of the software."

Intel says that all AI computation, prompts, and output are done on your system, so you do not transfer any information to any third party. So, AI Playground offers its users full privacy, giving them complete control over all inputs and outputs of the AI app.\n\nThe AI Playground app could help introduce Intel\u2019s AI features to more users, especially as it\u2019s easy to install and does not require a subscription. This is an important move for Intel and the AI chip makers in general, especially as most consumers still do not see the utility of AI in their everyday tasks. In fact, reports say that the majority of AI PC sales are driven by the need to upgrade/replace existing systems, not because of AI.\n\nFurthermore, the AI Playground could one-up Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC features because of its local capabilities. For example, one of its most exciting features, Paint Cocreator, requires an internet connection, while its controversial Recall feature is a security nightmare. Hopefully, AI Playground would make Intel\u2019s AI features more accessible to the average user. Otherwise, all that AI hullabaloo would\u2019ve essentially been all for nothing for the consumer, at least at this early stage."

        "article_content": "Google promised its Gemini AI wouldn\u2019t be a mere chatbot replacement for Google Assistant. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll see if that pledge holds up. Gemini extensions will allow the AI to access users more Google apps rather than just Gmail or YouTube. If it works as intended, it could be the first true cross-phone AI integration.\n\nIn a blog post, Google offered a rough time frame for when we\u2019ll be able to integrate Gemini with different Workspace apps like Google Keep, Google Calendar, Tasks, and Utilities. Currently, Gemini can work with Gmail, Maps, and YouTube. The general concept is that, at users\u2019 request, the AI will be able to pull information from one app to the other without users needing to scroll to find the information they\u2019re looking for.\n\nAs an example, the Mountain View tech giant said users should be able to pull a recipe from Gmail and then add the ingredients into a note in Keep. It will also work with your phone\u2019s camera, and if users take a photo of a receipt or concert ticket, you should be able to set it as an event or reminder in Calendar.\n\nThese features should be dropping in the next few weeks, so we shouldn\u2019t have to wait too long before we try Google\u2019s Geminification of our phones for ourselves. The Gemini app has already taken over most of Assistant\u2019s former duties, and earlier this week, Google gave every Android phone access to Gemini Live. This feature lets you have a conversation with your phone in a more natural way than the base Gemini, which still works better with short and sweet commands.\n\nGoogle showcased some of these features at its big August showcase, revealing the new Pixel 9 series alongside new watches and Pixel Buds. Apple has promised very similar capabilities with its still-incoming Apple Intelligence. So far, we haven\u2019t had the chance to test either company\u2019s full mobile AI integrations. The idea seems sound, but knowing how finicky and inconsistent AI can be, we\u2019re not exactly holding our breath for a real mobile ecosystem sea change.\n\nI may have far less use for a conversational AI than I would for an assistant who can uproot the important emails from my flooded inbox. On Wednesday, Google said it was updating Gmail\u2019s \u201csummary cards\u201d and \u201cHappening soon\u201d features. Happening soon should show the most timely updates, such as deliveries or events happening, based on your emails.\n\nSummary cards now show more information right at the top of each email for purchases, events, bills, and travel registrations. You can add events to your calendar, just like before. But now you can also modify your bookings or get directions to an airport or venue.\n\nGoogle said Gemini was getting access to more than 40 languages other than English, eventually. First on the list are French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Hindi. The rest will come sometime in the future. Each phone\u2019s Gemini Live can support conversations with up to two languages at a time. Now even more people will be able to see their Android phone transform into an AI device. The cross-platform mobile AI does feel enticing, especially for those of us with too many things going on to remember where the hell you put that one email with the event registration. However, for those who prefer their phones to be AI-free and still get new features, you may need to bite the Gemini bullet."

However, the episode also acquaints them with various other professionals in the field of the paranormal and the unknown, such as Barry Fitzgerald. As he talks about his views on the subject, questions about his whereabouts arise in the minds of the viewers.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald\u2019s Expertise in the Field of Paranormal Has Allowed Him to Explore Other Avenues\n\nBorn in 1972 in the city of Lisburn in Northern Ireland, Barry Fitzgerald allegedly experienced supernatural occurrences in his early days, leading him to form an interest in the unknown. After completing his education, he reportedly worked at the Southern Education and Library Board as the warden. Given his affinity towards the paranormal, he got into the field of paranormal research and worked for a couple of paranormal groups in Northern Ireland. With more than thirty years of experience as a paranormal investigator, he has encountered all kinds of cases, including ancient tombs, myths, hidden spiritual doorways, and legends.\n\nMoreover, Barry has been featured on several TV shows over the years, including \u2018Destination Truth,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Hunters,\u2019 and SyFy\u2019s \u2018Ghost Hunters International.\u2019 In 2016, rumors about him disappearing during his search for a Neolithic doorway to another world were spread. However, he denied these to be true when he featured on the podcast \u2018Stirring the Cauldron.\u2019 Thanks to his expertise in the field, he started writing books based on the paranormal and the unknown, such as \u2018The Influence,\u2019 \u2018Banshee,\u2019 \u2018Searching the Sidhe,\u2019 and \u2018The Mist of Gods.\u2019 He has also co-authored a book with Brian Allan \u2014 \u2018The Deception Of Gods And Men.\u2019\n\nGiven his experience as a television personality, Barry co-hosts \u2018Project Doorway\u2019 with Steve Mera, another renowned paranormal investigator and a dear friend. When he is not busy with that, he spends his time researching new investigative techniques. In February 2024, he traveled to Albert Halls Bolton in Manchester to attend the Awakenings event, where the attendees discussed the dark side of ufology.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald and His Loving Wife Are Proud Dog Parents\n\nFrom what we can tell, Barry Fitzgerald knows how to strike a balance between his personal and professional life. He shares a great bond with his loving wife, Donna, and is committed to nurturing the fulfilling life they have built together in the quaint town of Sligo in the northern part of Ireland. The duo loves to venture on trips across the globe to feast their eyes on stunning landscapes and have amazing experiences. When they\u2019re back home, they often stop by their local pub to sip on a large glass of cold Guinness and share some laughs with friends. Even after so many years of being together, Donna and Barry still appear to be deeply in love with each other. They haven\u2019t welcomed any kids of their own into the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean their love for their furry babies isn\u2019t unconditional.\n\nAn avid animal lover and a dog dad, Barry went on multiple adventures with his snowy white baby, Max, for several years until his passing. The \u201cmystery legend seeker\u201d passed into the land of rainbows a few years ago, leaving a giant hole in the hearts of the pair. Though one can\u2019t truly move on from the loss of a dear one, in a post he shared in January 2024, Barry revealed that he has found a companion as precious as Max to accompany him on his adventures. Alongside an adorable picture of his furry baby, Barry wrote, \u201cMeena has crept into the hole left by Max, I\u2019ll be forever broken by his death but Meena is a ball of life and mischief to keep me distracted.\u201d The heartwarming caption is a testament to his love for Meena and how she has impacted his life.\n\nBarry\u2019s love for canines runs so deep that he doesn\u2019t hesitate to show up for them in any part of the world if needed. In fact, he flew to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in March 2024 to attend Pawtographs Parafest 5, a paranormal convention held by Pawtographs for Pooches to raise money for a local animal shelter. The paranormal investigator also has other hobbies, like cooking. Interestingly, exploring the realm of the paranormal to unearth new claims is not the only thing that sparks joy in Barry Fitzgerald\u2019s life. Aside from the purported elements of the unknown, nature\u2019s beautiful gifts also pique the interest of the paranormal investigator, and he regularly shares his findings with the world via his social media profiles. Joining him on his escapades in the peaceful embrace of nature is, of course, his baby, Meena.\n\nRead More: Steve Mera: Where is the Paranormal Specialist Now?"

In order to put his abilities to the test, Paranormal Specialist Steve Mera joined Don on numerous of his paranormal projects and claimed that he witnessed his conversations with the spirit on the recording device. Despite Don being the focal point of the majority of the episode, Steve still manages to invoke several questions in the minds of the viewers.\n\nSteve Mera Has Accomplished a Lot in the Field of UFOs and Paranormal\n\nThe subject of UFOs and the Paranormal has fascinated Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera from his early childhood, so much so that he ended up making a career out of it. However, before he made a name for himself in the community, he earned a degree in Electrical Engineering from North Trafford College and GEC Electrical after passing out from Wellington Boys Secondary School. Meanwhile, he ensured that he gave some time to his passion and carried out consistent research on UFOs and the Paranormal, which would prove to be vital in his future. By 1989, his efforts got him a job at NATO as a Telecommunications Officer before working at MAPIT (Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team) and BUFORA (British UFO Research Association).\n\nA few years later, Steve created the BITC (British Investigators Training Course) in Anomalous Phenomena, which turned out to be a huge success across the United Kingdom. The 1990s were quite productive in his professional career as he reformed MAPIT and helped in the launch of MARA (Merseyside Anomalies Research Association) and NUFORA (The National UFO Research Association). Around 1996, he also launched the SEP (Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology) and worked in the para-psychological departments. By 1998, he had completed the Pre-Degree Psychology at South Trafford College, Manchester, and the BSY Parapsychology Course. He has also worked with Parkway Green Housing Association and Zohar Entertainment Group as a UAP Geological Research and Paranormal Specialist.\n\nIn 2017, he also co-founded ONSTELLAR. Steve also earned his degree in Human Behavioral Psychology from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Steve has also been a part of more than 90 TV shows and radio stations throughout his career, thanks to his expertise in the field of UFOs and the Paranormal. Not only that, he has worked with more than 300 different publications across the world and written for numerous TV shows. Some of the shows he has worked on are \u2018Conspiracy Corner,\u2019 \u2018The X-Files,\u2019 \u2018The Late Night Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018The Scream Team,\u2019 \u2018The Great Unexplained Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018UFO Hunters,\u2019 The Afterlife,\u2019 and more. As for the magazines that have featured his articles, some of them are \u2018UFO Review,\u2019 \u2018UFO News UK,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Voices,\u2019 \u2018Naro Minded,\u2019 \u2018Fate,\u2019 \u2018UFO Magazine,\u2019 \u2018Alien Encounters,\u2019 \u2018Sightings,\u2019 and many more.\n\nWhile he is currently handling his responsibilities as the owner and editor of Phenomena Magazine, Steve also stays busy with running MAPIT and SEP. Having written three books \u2014 \u2018The A-Z of the Unknown,\u2019 \u2018Strange Happenings: Memoirs of a Paranormal Investigator,\u2019 and \u2018Paranormal Insight: A Concise Study of the Strange and Profound\u2019 \u2014 the Paranormal Specialist is also reportedly working on a couple of new books, which would revolve around the UFO Phenomena. On September 30, 2024, he conducted a Birmingham UFO Group meeting at the Hot Shots Snooker Club function room at 100 Crosswells Road in Oldbury, Birmingham. In the same month, Steve also featured as a guest in a podcast called \u2018Paranormal Pendle.\u2019\n\nSteve Mera is Also a Dedicated Partner and Friend\n\nOriginally from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, England, Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera leads a content life on the personal front. After all, he has been navigating life\u2019s ups and downs with his one true love, Jackie Heighway, for over a decade now. Though neither of the two has shared when they fell in love, we know that their paths crossed in 2011 in Bolton, and it was in the same year, on November 28, that they turned their fondness for each other into a full-fledged relationship. Together, the two have seemingly built a beautiful world of their own in Greater Manchester, UK, with trust, care, understanding, and loads of love. Jackie is a Salford native who has been self-employed since 2018. Steve has her biggest cheerleader in Jackie, who makes sure she has his back every step of the way.\n\nWhether it is accompanying Steve on his research trips or sharing details about his talks, Jackie does everything to showcase her support for her partner. From what we can tell, Steve seemingly has a daughter named Jenny from a previous relationship. However, not much is known about her. For the uninitiated, Steve is also a huge animal lover and got his first pet in 1997. Losing a pet leaves a huge void in the lives of pet parents and sadly, Steve and Jackie had to experience that pain and grief when their beloved cat, Lucy, crossed over the rainbow bridge in August 2024. \u201cWe will never forget you. You were a huge part of our family. We will meet again one day,\u201d wrote Jackie announcing Lucy\u2019s departure from this world. Though they\u2019ll always miss Lucy, Steve and Jackie are grateful they got to create so many beautiful memories with her.\n\nWhen Steve is not investing his time in furthering his passion, the paranormal specialist enjoys spending time with his family and friends. Even today, he continues to impart all the knowledge he has gathered from his decades of extensive research with the world by setting up meetings and talks every now and then. He also keeps his admirers updated and captivated by sharing his insights on a regular basis on his YouTube channel. Apart from spending time with the love of his life, Jackie, and embarking on trips with her, Steve also looks forward to hanging out with his friends.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

The vast majority of yachts rely on dirty energy for power and to supply the massive amounts of electricity they consume. Some superyachts, The Guardian reported, emit more planet-overheating air pollution per year by themselves than many small countries.\n\nSocial scientist Gregory Salle labeled superyachts a form of \"ecocide\" in his book, Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Superyachts, Salle wrote, display, \"the capacity of the wealthiest individuals to exonerate themselves from the social and environmental cost of their activities and behaviours.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the yacht that took Maroni to Svalbard was not a superyacht but a regular yacht, meaning that it merely creates a large amount of planet-overheating air pollution instead of a mind-boggling amount of planet-overheating air pollution.\n\nThe positive to take away from the story is that more ocean research can be used to better protect our oceans \u2014 largely from the threats caused by the very pollution that yachts create every day.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

But it\u2019s not every day that you get to stumble across a 70-million-year-old piece of history.\n\nThis happened around two years ago, not long after a recent landslide had occurred. The landslide had exposed the edge of a cliff where Boschetto, an amateur paleontologist, noticed large bones. His trained eye quickly allowed him to ascertain that these were dinosaur fossils.\n\nAfter a few days of excavation with experts from a local museum, the researchers realized that these were the remains of a Titanosaur, one of the largest dinosaurs to have ever walked on Earth.\n\nThe find of a lifetime\n\nDamien Boschetto (left) holding some of the dinosaur bones he found. Credit: Damien Boschetto.\n\nTo make matters even more intriguing, when the fossils were arranged and put together, they formed a nearly complete 30-foot-long skeleton. It\u2019s exceedingly rare to find a dinosaur skeleton so well preserved and complete.\n\nThe huge fossils had to be hauled with a crane. Credit: Damien Boschetto.\n\nBoschetto reported his findings to a local association dedicated to cultural, archaeological, and paleontological pursuits. Experts from the association determined the fossil to be approximately 70 million years old, offering a rare glimpse into the life of titanosaurs.\n\nThese plant-eating behemoths, famous for their elongated necks, roamed the earth from about 150 to 66 million years ago. Every continent was inhabited by their massive presence.\n\nAn artist\u2019s rendering of what Savannasaurus elliottorum, a species of titanosaur discovered in 2016 in Australia, may have looked like. Credit: Travis Tischler/Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History.\n\nDespite the many fossils and tens of thousands of excavations across the years, finding an almost intact dinosaur skeleton remains an extraordinary rarity. To put it into perspective, a previous study highlighted that, despite an estimated 1.7 billion Tyrannosaurus rex-es once living in the Cretaceous period, paleontologists have only uncovered fossils of fewer than 100 individuals. And most of these T. rexes are known from partial remains.\n\nResearchers excavated the titanosaur fossils over several 10-day digging sessions. Credit: Damien Boschetto.\n\nA find worth protecting\n\nThe most complete T. rex is a specimen called Sue at display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. About 90 percent of its skeleton has been preserved. The titanosaur discovered by Boschetto is about 70 percent complete.\n\nPresently, there\u2019s no word on which particular species of titanosaur we\u2019re talking about here. But we\u2019ll likely know more once the findings are formalized in a peer-reviewed scientific paper.\n\n\u201cThe recent discovery of a new deposit in the neighboring town of Montouliers provides us with an assemblage of dinosaur skeletons in almost complete anatomical connections (the bones of the animal are still articulated to each other). This is a very rare and exceptional discovery in France and Europe,\u201d Boschetto told Newsweek.\n\nThe discovery has remained a closely guarded secret until recently to protect the site from vandals. The dinosaur will soon be put on display at the Cruzy Museum. As for Boschetto, he said he recently quit his job in the energy sector to pursue a master\u2019s degree in paleontology. Looks like he won\u2019t be an \u2018amateur\u2019 for too long.\n\nThis article originally appeared in March, 2024 and was updated with new information."

Gulotta now focuses her work on the anxieties women in their 30s and 40s face around their fertility because she's been there \u2014 and feels like a lot of the burden falls on women to start conversations around kids.\n\nShe assumed her relationship would lead to marriage and kids\n\nGulotta started dating a close friend in her mid-20s. Due to their strong bond and long history, she thought the relationship would naturally lead to marriage and kids. \"We'd never gotten to a place where we were talking about timelines or rings, but we had definitely planned a life together,\" she said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut things unraveled when he needed to financially and emotionally support a family member. \"That was really the priority, and I didn't see where I was going to fit into that,\" she said. They broke up when she was 30.\n\nShe wishes she was more upfront about kids when dating\n\nAfter the breakup, Gulotta started dating again, but it took time to figure out what she was looking for \u2014 and how to ask for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe recalls trying to be a \"cool girl,\" worrying that she would sound too demanding if she brought up kids early into dating. As a result, she ended up dating emotionally unavailable people who weren't capable of discussing the future.\n\n\"If I were to go back and be dating in my 30s, I would get really clear on what I wanted,\" she said. From her work as a therapist, she said she's seen so many cases \"where you're even further into your 30s, and you end a six-year relationship, and then what? You're starting all over.\"\n\nBeing upfront, she said, makes it easier to avoid regret later on. When she met Rob, her current partner, she felt more urgency around her timeline for having kids. She was 34 and wanted certainty about her future. Rob wanted kids, too.\n\nBut there was a snag: Rob didn't want to start a family as soon as she did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was willing to break up over kids\n\nGulotta said it was difficult not to be aligned on when they wanted kids.\n\n\"I was 37, 38, having these conversations where he's not sure, and I'm like,' I don't have much more time for you to continue to be unsure,'\" she said. \"As much as I tried to explain it to him, I don't think he understood: I was up against a clock.\"\n\nShe froze her eggs at 37 to strengthen her sense of security. This decision also sparked \"a lot of really hard conversations\" about when to have kids.\n\nShe didn't want to walk away from the relationship. But she was also willing to break up, thinking about what she would need to do if she moved out of New York and had a baby on her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, she gave birth to her son at 40. Looking back, Gulotta said everything worked out.\n\n\"It's deeply emotional, but you have to have these conversations because it's your life,\" she said. \"It's the timeline that feels good for you.\"\n\nPlus, being able to broach these topics says a lot about your partner, she said. If your partner is avoidant, it signifies bigger issues.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it should be two adult mature people making life decisions,\" she said."
