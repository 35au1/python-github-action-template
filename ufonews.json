        "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nNewly-released files now reveal that law enforcement authorities in Canada did, in fact, collect wreckage after a UFO was shot down by a United States F-16 fighter jet over Lake Huron in Canada in 2023.\n\nLast February, the United States Air Force shot down four different UFOs that were either identified as a Chinese spy balloon or not given any real explanation by the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nWhat was unique about the UFO that was shot down over Lake Huron was that, one, the first Sidewinder missile that was shot at the UFO somehow missed, and two, government officials said they couldn\u2019t find the UFO wreckage after the F-16 shot it down. [Audio of the UFO being \u201cdecommissioned\u201d can be heard here.]\n\nNow, however, police in Canada say they did indeed recover debris from the UFO that was shot down over Lake Huron in 2023. At least that\u2019s what documents obtained through a freedom of information request to Canada\u2019s Department of National Defence by CTV News now reveal.\n\nAccording to those documents, \u201cwreckage\u201d was located on \u201cthe shoreline of Lake Huron\u201d in the weeks after search efforts were officially suspended by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). They just never bothered to tell the public.\n\nAccording to partially redacted emails obtained by CTVNews.ca through the information request, the RCMP collected \u201cboth material and a module\u201d when debris was discovered \u201calong the shores of Lake Huron\u201d in early March 2023, approximately three weeks after the object was shot down.\n\n\u201cThe RCMP confirms that debris was recovered from the shores of Lake Huron; and we continue to work in close collaboration with our domestic and international partners in furthering the investigation,\u201d an RCMP spokesperson said in a new statement on Friday. \u201cAs the investigation is ongoing, additional details cannot be provided at this time.\u201d\n\nWhy would no one, not the Canadian government or the United States government not let the public know that the UFO wreckage had been found?\n\n\u201cTo have expended significant military time and resources to shoot down benign objects does not look good, even though there may have been many factors we are still unaware of,\u201d Iain Boyd, professor of aerospace engineering and director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, speculated to CTV News. \u201cI am not surprised that the Canadian government did not share more information about the Lake Huron debris.\u201d\n\nThat, or the respective governments just don\u2019t want the public to truly know exactly what was shot down.\n\n\u201cFollowing reports of unidentified aerial objects observed in the Great Lakes area and elsewhere in North America, multiple searches were conducted by the RCMP with the support of the Canadian Armed Forces,\u201d an RCMP spokesperson said in a brief statement to CTVNews.ca. \u201cDebris has been recovered from the shores of Lake Huron but after careful analysis, it was determined not to be of national security concern.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Children are naturally gifted storytellers. Their vivid imaginations often surpass the boundaries of reality in adventures that grownups may only try with AI. Yet children dream up fantastical worlds as they play in their backyards, plot adventures looking up at the clouds, and think of characters while simply going about their day.\n\n\n\nMany of these young dreamers don\u2019t yet have the skills required to translate those visions into written stories or drawings. Enter AI: the tool that's helping young creatives bring their ideas to life like never before.\n\nAI-powered platforms designed for storytelling are transforming the way kids interact with their creativity. By offering intuitive tools to craft narratives and illustrations, these platforms nurture a love for reading and writing from an early age.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what happened when I put some of the most innovative storytelling apps designed to inspire the next generation of writers and artists to the test.\n\n1. Magic Story AI\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nMagic Story AI bridges the gap between imagination and visualization by allowing children to be the hero of their own story. You get started by uploading a photo of your child and then the AI gets to work using an illustrated image of the child in the story. I had a little trouble when I first uploaded a picture. The first image the AI shared looked nothing like my child. After a quick preview, the AI asked if I wanted to make changes, so I prompted it to make my child\u2019s eyes green. The AI responded that the eyes were already blue, which they weren\u2019t, they were brown. After a few more prompts the AI adjusted the eyes to the blue I requested. From there, children can choose from a variety of themes\u2014like fear of the dark, patience, emotions and more.\n\n\n\nThis platform uses AI to turn simple text into fully illustrated storybooks that can be viewed on the screen or printed into actual soft or hard cover books. There is not much of a preview of the book, but there is a free trial for users to explore.\n\n\n\nOverall, Magic Story is a fun way to give children an AI-powered opportunity to see themselves as the main character. The collaborative features let children get creative alongside their parents or teachers to refine their ideas, build meaningful stories, and maybe even spark a few new ones.\n\n2. StorySpark\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nStorySpark helps children craft their stories by guiding them through the creative process. The app acts as a personal mentor, offering prompts and suggestions to flesh out ideas. For example, I started with a simple concept of \u201ca robot saves the day,\u201d and StorySpark will ask if you want to include more details such as a moral of the story, character description, and reading level. I appreciate the reading level option as it is nice to have my fourth grader read to my preschooler. Keep in mind that if you don\u2019t add those details, you will end up with a simple picture book.\n\n\n\nI appreciate that StorySpark lets children add the details to the story rather than working from a template. This ensures that their book is uniquely their own. StorySpark even lets parents copyright their story, which is a pretty cool feature.\n\nBy engaging kids in the entire storytelling process, StorySpark teaches children the fundamentals of storytelling\u2014character development, conflict, and resolution. The AI\u2019s gentle guidance helps boost confidence in their storytelling abilities, laying the foundation for future creative projects.\n\n3. StoryBee\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nStoryBee is an AI-powered platform that enables users to create personalized stories with a simple hint or theme. I used the same \u201cRobot saves the day\u201d theme but didn\u2019t get very far because the platform then immediately asks for a paid subscription. A note at the top of the welcome page says they have discontinued free trials to reduce spam and enhance safety. As a parent, I can respect that, but it stinks that there isn\u2019t a free trial before diving in.\n\n\n\nHowever, for $5/month, children can create stories and hear them read. The concept is great overall, but the output is several paragraphs with only one image. My prompt about the robot did not yield an image of one, just adorable squirrels. I\u2019m not sure I could keep my three-year-old\u2019s attention with the wrong image and just one picture for the whole story.\n\n\n\nI do like how the stories can be written according to reading level, genre, and styles can be combined for a truly unique tale. This site is very easy to use and user-friendly, which is important for encouraging storytelling regardless of technical expertise.\n\n\n\nStoryBee is also a valuable tool for educators, inspiring creativity in the classroom through AI-assisted writing exercises.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

BedtimeStory.ai\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nBedtimeStory.ai lets users dive into storytelling with hyper-personalized stories tailored to the child\u2019s preferences. From the moment users logon, they are encouraged to start writing by first describing the characters in their story.\n\n\n\nParents can input details like their child\u2019s name, favorite animals, or a recent dream, and the AI weaves these elements into a bedtime story, complete with illustrations. By the way, the illustrations are really good, almost Disney-like, which is surely a kid-pleaser.\n\n\n\nAfter all the details for the stories and characters are entered, the AI gets to work creating your story. But, if you want to read it, you\u2019ll have to pay for it. It\u2019s $10/month for users to access more. Based on the finished product of story and illustrations, that price seems reasonable and within the same ballpark as other AI storytelling platforms.\n\nThe personalization from BedtimeStory.ai makes storytelling more engaging, as kids can truly be part of the narrative. It\u2019s a great way to boost imagination and to encourage reading as a cherished nightly ritual. As a bonus, BedtimeStory.ai\u2019s library of pre-made stories offers endless inspiration for parents who might need a little extra help at bedtime.\n\n5. OnceUponABot\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nOnceUponABot offers kids an easy way to generate creative stories with minimal effort. I have to say, this is hands down, the winner. I was able to create a story and see it immediately\u2014complete with illustrations in a storybook form, plus, have it read to me.\n\n\n\nBy inputting a few key details\u2014like a setting, main character, and a theme\u2014the AI generated a complete story in seconds. I stuck with the concept of \u201crobot saves the day\u201d and it created an impressive story. The one downside is that the images seemed a few on the pages, but it literally asked on the image to rate it, so I can tell the platform is working out the kinks.\n\n\n\nOnce users have created a story, they can have it re-read to them, they can download a PDF of it, share a link or create a new story. The free version allows users to create 3 books a month.\n\nThis AI platform is great for kids who already have ideas ready to go for their story and don\u2019t need much prompting. The free aspect is especially nice, particularly for those hesitant to make a purchase before they\u2019ve seen the product. Overall, OnceUponABot is a fun, AI-powered way for kids to get the structure they need to unleash their imagination, removing the pressure of perfection and allowing creativity to flow.\n\nThe future of storytelling\n\nBeyond the thrill of creating stories, these AI platforms give kids a new way to practice critical thinking, story structure, and language development through reading and writing. And because these tools adapt to individual skill levels, they\u2019re equally valuable for young readers just learning to form sentences and older kids refining their creative writing and reading skills.\n\nAI-powered storytelling is helping to break down barriers to creativity. Regardless of skill level, children can bring their ideas to life be it through vivid image generation or storytelling."

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, told BarrieToday the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford told BarrieToday, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, telling BarrieToday he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going. This thing would not stop with the motion-sensored cat balls and there were noises going on all in the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was standing there asking questions and we heard a little girl call out. We looked at each other like \u2018what the (heck) was that!?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoric said they went to explore where the sound came from, which is when he heard Maryk yelling from where she was in the building.\n\n\u201cWe started running back and she was where the doll was \u2026 and asked what all the banging was about,\u201d he said, adding neither he nor the employee\u2019s wife knew what his partner was talking about. \"We\u2019d just heard the kid\u2019s voice, which is where Shirley had heard disembodied voices in the area previously.\u201d\n\nBoric told BarrieToday it felt like a game of cat and mouse trying to track down the spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve encountered that a lot, and it sometimes gets a little annoying because you go thinking you\u2019re going to experience something and it just leads you around the building,\" he said. \u201cIt was a good experience and there was a plethora of (paranormal) activity.\"\n\nBoric ended up bringing the \u201chaunted doll\u201d home to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cI have her in the room with the other ones,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure her arm moved the other night, so I am setting up a security camera in the haunted room.\u201d\n\nSanford says she found the entire experience \u201cfascinating,\u201d adding she \"absolutely\" believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get scared over any of this stuff that happens. I am all for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen these guys came in, I saw it for myself. The white orbs and the one gentleman at the very end had forgotten something upstairs \u2026 When we got up there, one of the revolving showcases was on and (it) hadn\u2019t been on 15 minutes early when we\u2019d been up there.\u201d\n\nThe episode is expected to air on the Walking Among Us YouTube channel in January 2025."

BONK\n\n\n\nMany tokens valued under $10 have become attractive options as the crypto market picks steam, especially given the expected altcoin season. These affordable assets are ideal for those seeking large profits in the next months since they show great upside potential. In the next altcoin season, Rexas Finance (RXS), a token that leverages blockchain to reinvent investor interactions with real-world assets (RWA), will be crucial. Rexas Finance leads the list of potential tokens due to its comprehensive offers, ongoing developments, and fast-paced presale. Here are the seven best crypto coins under $10 to buy right now, each of which has the potential to generate up to 7000% gains during the approaching altcoin season.Rexas Finance is a unique blockchain venture that combines real-world asset tokenisation with decentralised financing (DeFi) to give investors fractionalised access to high-value assets, including real estate, art, and commodities. Rexas Finance opens up blockchain assets to normal and institutional investors, allowing them to diversify into previously exclusive areas. The platform's user-friendly ecosystem is especially appealing, allowing everyone, including those with little technical background, to engage in tokenisation and DeFi. Rexas Finance's Token Builder, a no-code tool that simplifies asset tokenisation for creators, project owners, and developers, is central to its solutions. Complementing this is the QuickMint Bot, which allows token management through mobile apps such as Telegram and Discord, putting token generation in the hands of regular users. In addition to token production, Rexas Finance's Treasury provides powerful yield optimisation by integrating multi-chain functionality to maximise returns on user investments across several blockchain networks. Rexas AI Shield, an AI-powered auditing tool, fixes vulnerabilities early on by providing constant real-time smart contract audit capability given that transparency and compliance are chief concerns for investors choosing a crypto investment.Rexas Finance's presale reached Stage 5 within two months of its launch in September. In Stage 5, each RXS token costs $0.070, with the next stage expected to raise the price to $0.080. The current presale stage is already 83.09% complete, raising $6.76 million and selling around 128 million tokens as of writing. This rapid progression demonstrates the project's high demand and investor trust. Rexas Finance's decision to forego venture capital funding in favour of a public presale has allowed for increased community involvement, resulting in a decentralised ownership model that is consistent with the platform\u2019s dedication to accessibility and justice. Investors gain from avoiding the influence of venture capitalists, who frequently seek immediate returns, resulting in a more steady, long-term growth trajectory.Meanwhile, Rexas Finance just completed a security audit with Certik, which specialises in blockchain audits. The audit is a vote of confidence, demonstrating Rexas Finance's policy of creating a secure and trustworthy platform for its users. Rexas Finance is holding an interesting $1 million contest whereby 20 winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, engaging the community even more. Set to boost community engagement, this offer encourages early investment.Looking ahead, Rexas Finance intends to list on at least three of the tier-1 exchanges. This strategic move will greatly increase RXS liquidity and accessibility, paving the way for rapid growth. With its creative ecosystem, strong presale momentum, and unwavering dedication to security, Rexas Finance is a worthy investment for anyone hoping to profit from the next altcoin season.Shiba Inu remains a top meme coin, with rising prices and investor interest. The meme-like SHIB token has grown beyond its community-driven roots. It combines the DeFi ecosystem with the ShibaSwap distributed exchange (DEX), which lets users stake, yield farm, and swap tokens. High whale accumulation in Shiba Inu in recent months indicates growing trust in its successes. SHIB trades at $0.000029, up 181% year-on-year, and has a $14.1 billion market capitalisation as of this writing. Analysts are optimistic about SHIB's ability to climb, particularly when the market attitude shows \"greed.\" This confidence is bolstered by technical signs that show Shiba Inu is poised for a breakout.Cardano blockchain gives sustainability, scalability, and interoperability top importance. Once Cardano adopted Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution to speed up transactions and cut fees, developers and users were growingly fascinated with Cardano. According to peer-reviewed studies, Cardano's scientific blockchain development technique has a loyal fanbase and considerable institutional backing. ADA has shown a huge price comeback, with a price of $0.5876, a market capitalisation of $21 billion, and a 52.7% year-on-year increase at the time of writing. New alliances and continuous network improvements drive the Cardano ecosystem's expected growth, suggesting ADA's potential for major increases. Cardano's continuous development and solid community basis make it a great alternative for investors looking for a dependable, low-cost asset as we head toward the next altcoin season.Goatseus Maximus, with its GOAT token, is reinventing the meme-coin industry by combining online culture and AI-powered marketing. GOAT was launched on October 14 at an initial price of $0.1041, and it has since grown rapidly, reaching an all-time high of $0.9574. Its marketing arm, Truth Terminal, engages a large audience with humour and meme-based material, capitalising on the crypto space's extensive meme culture. This novel technique has established GOAT as a distinct player among meme coins. At the time of writing, GOAT is trading at $0.9075, with a market capitalisation of $802 million, up over 480% since launch. Analysts expect GOAT to continue its upward trend, potentially offering large returns. The mix of AI-driven marketing and a solid community makes GOAT an appealing investment option for those wishing to diversify their meme-coin portfolio.Grass has gained headlines for its decentralised platform, which uses spare internet bandwidth from node operators to collect and process web data for AI training purposes. This novel application of blockchain technology has sparked interest, particularly following a successful airdrop on the Solana network, which enhanced the token's prominence. The recent listing of GRASS on major exchanges such as BYDFi has boosted its popularity, increasing trading volumes. At the time of writing, Grass is trading at $2.64 with a market capitalisation of $629.6 million and has increased over 200% since its launch earlier this month. GRASS is well-positioned for substantial increases throughout the forthcoming crypto season, particularly as demand for AI-driven solutions grows.XRP has recently received media attention, owing mostly to its continuing legal struggle with the SEC. Positive developments, in this case, have relieved regulatory pressure on Ripple, strengthening investor confidence in XRP, which has shown great recovery possibilities with fresh alliances in the cross-border payments business and a strong network. With a market value of $37 billion and trading at $0.654, XRP shows an 8% annual year-on-year increase. Analysts think that the legal issues of Ripple will be resolved, acting as a trigger for a significant price rise. XRP's future seems bright as whale accumulation and social media discussions rise; this makes it an interesting choice for those seeking coins under $10 with significant expansion potential.Bonk is a Solana-based meme coin that has swiftly acquired popularity in the cryptocurrency community. Bonk's new inclusion on Binance US has considerably enhanced its trading volume and visibility. Bonk, one of the few meme coins linked to Solana, stands out by using the Solana blockchain's efficiency to provide low-cost, high-speed transactions, a unique advantage in the meme currency market. Bonk's market capitalisation is fast expanding as a result of its new listing and incorporation into the Solana ecosystem, valued at $2.48 billion, with a price of $0.000034 at the time of writing. Analysts believe Bonk's increasing trend will continue, particularly since Bitcoin's bull run is predicted to boost meme coins. Investors interested in meme coins may find Bonk appealing due to its affiliation with the Solana network and its popularity.With the altcoin season approaching, these coins under $10 offer diversified, high-growth options. Their current trajectory and recent revisions make them poised for significant returns, with potential gains of up to 7000%. For investors looking to join the next crypto wave, Rexas Finance's presale is an excellent chance with a low entrance price, of just $0.07, and a high-growth ecosystem supported by a $1 million giveaway to early entrants.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:"
