        "article_content": "UFOs came to Washington again last week.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. at 11:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday, Nov. 13. Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) is a relatively new catch-all term that includes sightings of unexplained objects or events that take place in the air, underwater, in space, or that travel between those domains.\n\nLike previous congressional UFO hearings, the event featured testimony from current U.S. military personnel who claim the American government has for decades hidden evidence of advanced technologies and otherworldly visitors from the public. A multitude of anecdotes were presented about flying orbs coming out of the ocean, disc-shaped objects, and craft \"exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal.\" While such claims are nothing new, what is noteworthy about the hearing are the pedigrees of some of the whistleblowers who testified, including a former U.S. counterintelligence officer, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former NASA associate administrator. All of them stressed the need for more government transparency, less stigma about the UFO topic and new policies to bring UAP data out of the \"black\" classified world and into the public domain.\n\nA still from a video titled \"Go Fast\" recorded by a U.S. Navy aircraft reportedly showing a UAP that was discussed in the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" on Wednesday (Nov. 13). (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nThis isn't the U.S. government's first attempt to investigate the recent wave of UFO claims that began in 2017. A similar hearing was held last year, in which a whistleblower told Congress the U.S. government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence.'\n\nThe Pentagon also created the All-Doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAP reports and government data about UFOs, but critics, including some government officials, are skeptical of the office's aims and methods.\n\nRelated: SETI searches for alien life in over 1,000 galaxies using unexplored radio frequencies\n\n\"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\"\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOther representatives stressed the need for transparency and data analysis, a common theme of other recent UAP studies. \"We have evidence that what we are detecting things, and we know that we don't understand them, and this is worth investigating,\" Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said. \"I believe we can always be more transparent. To me, this hearing and others are simply about the truth and getting to the facts of what these UAPs actually are.\"\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former U.S. counterintelligence officer who has been vocal about such claims in recent years, told the assembled representatives at the hearing that \"excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public \u2014 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" Elizondo stated during his testimony.\n\nElizondo, who claims to have previously investigated UFOs as part of a secret Pentagon program, suggested that the U.S. government create a \"whole-of-government\" approach to studying UAP, create a national UAP strategy and offer protections so that whistleblowers who are \"desperate to do the right thing can come forward without fear.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Elizondo was asked if some of the \"advanced technologies\" that have been seen monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe could be operated by aliens or private companies. \"Maybe both,\" Elizondo replied.\n\nElizondo also stated point-blank to Rep. Mace's questioning that the U.S. government has programs to retrieve crashed UAP and reverse-engineer them, but avoided giving any specifics in an unclassified public setting such as the hearing.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) then questioned Elizondo, asking the former counterintelligence agent about a document he signed that limits him from speaking publicly about crash retrieval programs. \"The document said you can't talk about crash retrieval. Well, you know, you can't talk about Fight Club if there's no Fight Club, correct?\"\n\nLike other witnesses, Elizondo stated that the alleged excessive government secrecy around UFOs harms national security. In response to questioning from Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Elizondo stated that, if UAP sightings turned out to be technologies operated by adversarial nations, it would be \"an intelligence failure eclipsing 9/11 in order of magnitude.\"\n\nA still from footage shot by an MQ-9 reaper drone showing an unidentified spherical object soaring through the air shown to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services during an April 2023 hearing. (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nRetired U.S. Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet offered similar testimony as Elizondo. \"We know from last year's UAP hearing and recent statements and publications by credible whistleblowers that UAP, NHI [non-human intelligence], and their technology of unknown origin (TUO) represent a new realization that we are not the only advanced intelligence in the universe,\" Gallaudet said on Wednesday, according to his published remarks.\n\n\"Unelected officials in the U.S. government do not have an exclusive right to this knowledge about the nature of reality. The American people have a right to that knowledge,\" Gallaudet said. The retired rear admiral also stressed the national security and airspace safety concerns related with UAP sightings, calling them \"extensive.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Garcia asked Gallaudet and other witnesses what UAP might represent, the retired rear admiral said he believes they are evidence of a \"non-human higher intelligence.\"\n\nFormer NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold also testified at the hearing, and previously served on NASA's UAP study team. Gold's testimony was more grounded; for example, he stressed the need for NASA to contribute its authority and expertise toward analyzing what UAP data it might already possess and helping dispel the stigma associated with the UFO topic.\n\n\"Our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science, but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA search team elicits such a vitriolic response,\" Gold said during the hearing. \"Therefore, one of the most important actions that can be taken, relative to exposing the truth of UAP, is to combat the stigma, and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful.\"\n\nGold added that NASA has a massive archive of data that could possibly contain evidence of UAP, and suggested that artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms could help sort through the agency's trove of data to help shine light on the UFO phenomenon. In addition, the former NASA associate administrator said the agency should develop specialized instruments that might be able to gather useful data about UAP.\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger also testified, telling the representatives that there's a \"growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly called UFOs, and that elements within the military and IC [intelligence community] are in violation of their Constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.\"\n\nShellenberger stated that there is a secret program within the U.S. government known as \"Immaculate Constellation\" whose sole purpose is to collect UFO and UAP reports from military personnel and sensor data and quarantine them away from the rest of the government and military. While he noted that a Pentagon spokesperson has stated no such program exists, Shellenberger recounted prior examples in which the Department of Defense has initially denied knowledge of UAP-related information only to later change its stance and either admit the information exists or release it to the public.\n\n\"The U.S. government appears to know significantly more about UAPs than it is revealing,\" Shellenberger said at the hearing. \"But even those who believe the U.S. government has revealed all that it knows should have no objection to Congressional demands for greater transparency.\"\n\nTo conclude the meeting, Rep. Mace asked each of the witnesses to define what non-human biologics or non-human intelligence mean to each of them.\n\n\"I don't think it's a stretch, when you look at the diversity of life on this planet and the size of this universe, to think that there will be more diverse, higher-order, non-human intelligence throughout the universe, and that's probably what's visiting us,\" Gallaudet said.\n\nElizondo stated he would take a scientific approach: \"The definition would be the ability to react to a stimulus in a manner that requires an intellectual thought process.\"\n\nGold, meanwhile, questioned whether non-human intelligence necessarily implies life, suggesting sophisticated artificial intelligence might be responsible for some UAP encounters. Shellenberger simply stated he did not know what they might be.\n\nIn the hearing, as in other UFO hearings, there was a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. One of the core tenets of these whistleblower testimonies is that much of the credible UFO data is classified and can't be revealed to the public based on the military capabilities that some of that data could reveal.\n\nWhistleblowers have attested for years that, because advanced or classified sensors and satellites sometimes capture footage or photos of unexplained phenomena or advanced craft, those photos or videos are likewise classified by the U.S. government in order to not reveal America's full surveillance or sensing capabilities.\n\nSuch was the case in 2023 when U.S. military aircraft shot down a mysterious object off the coast of Alaska. The American government has yet to release any imagery from the event, but a Canadian freedom of information request unveiled a photograph earlier this year of a balloon-like object.\n\nThose incidents and others like it, such as a weeks-long drone incursion above Langley Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., were discussed in the hearing. \"The origin of these drones and their operators remains a mystery,\" Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said. \"This incident and other sightings near sensitive military installations highlights the complexity of the UAP challenge facing our intelligence, defense and homeland security committees.\"\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."

        "article_content": "The Pentagon announced they solved one of the most famous UFO videos that sparked a wave of national interest and speculation when it was first released in 2017.\n\nAn official from the Pentagon testified to Congress Tuesday about the wildly popular \u201cGOFAST\u201d video, saying that the attention was unwarranted for the footage once considered to be some of the best evidence of the reality of unidentified flying objects.\n\nDr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said the object captured off the Florida coast by a Navy fighter jet appears to be moving so fast because of the perspectival phenomenon of a parallax.\n\nA screengrab from the famous \u201cGOFAST\u201d video, which shows an infrared radar depiction of an\n\nobject that remains unidentified by the Pentagon, but which is no longer considered anomalous. AARO / SWNS\n\n\u201cThrough a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,\u201d Kosloski testified during an oversight hearing.\n\nDr. Jon Kosloski heads up AARO, the agency tasked with finding explanations for anomalous activity of presumed UAPs. C-SPAN\n\nKosloski did not, however, identify the object in the \u201cGOFAST\u201d video. He says AARO will make the report on their parallax claims public on their official website.\n\nThe \u201cGOFAST\u201d video shows a radar recording of an object that appeared to be moving at an incredibly high speed, not far above the water.\n\nForward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology was used by fighter jet pilots operating off of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nA radar operator in a jet is forced to manually lock onto the target which was evading the automatic\n\nsystems that usually function without human input. AARO / SWNS\n\nThe FLIR radar shows a small blip on the screen moving so quickly that the operating officer was forced to lock onto the target manually.\n\nWhen the radar operator is finally able to lock onto the moving target, he yells, \u201cWhoa! Got him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the f\u2013k is that?,\u201d someone is heard saying over the radio in the video.\n\n\u201cWow, what is that man? Look at it fly!,\u201d another is heard saying.\n\nDr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. DOD\n\nDespite dashing some hopes of UFO and UAP enthusiasts, Kosloski testified to Congress that there are 21 cases that are still unsolvable.\n\nOne such case involved a law enforcement officer \u201cout West\u201d who saw a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the round.\n\nThe officer reports approaching the \u201cblacker than black object\u201d that was about the size of a Toyota Prius.\n\nWhen the officer got within 100 feet of the object, it shot up into the sky at a 45 degree angle at an improbably fast pace, according to Kosloski\u2019s testimony.\n\nA radar image from another famous UAP incident, commonly referred to as the \u201cGIMBAL\u201d video,\n\nwhich was also recorded of the east coast of the United States by operators working off air craft\n\ncarriers USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt. AARO / SWNS\n\nIn yet another inexplicable event, two government contractors in the Southeast reported seeing a \u201clarge metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane\u201d hovering in the air motionless for 15-20 seconds, according to the testimony Tuesday.\n\n\u201cObviously an object that large and stationary \u2014 unless it\u2019s a blimp \u2014 is unusual but then disappearing, we can\u2019t explain how that would happen,\u201d Kosloski told Congress.\n\nAt a hearing last week, UAP and UFO community whistleblowers testified to congress that they were aware of secret research programs conducted by the US government that included crash recoveries and highly secretive back-engineering programs."

And exactly that colour.\n\n\"Appeared and disappeared like alternating.\"\n\n\"Alien invasion before January 20,\" another said, noting the date of Donald Trump's inauguration into the White House.\n\nOne just simply posted an alien emoji.\n\nBut, others, including UFO experts, have started doubting this theory.\n\nAvi Loeb, a theoretical physician, cosmologist and Harvard professor believes the so-called flying orb is part of the camera.\n\nMoment UFOs appear in sky above Spain next to rainbow - before floods hit\n\nHe told the New York Post: \"This is most likely an optical artefact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera.\n\n\"Namely a bright spot from the reflection of sunlight as the camera gradually changes its orientation relative to the sun and the ground.\n\n\"But even if it was a real object, the apparent speed is of an order the speed of sound and not extraordinary.\"\n\nThis is a theory many other viewers of the video came up with.\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\n\"A helicopter with blue water, blue sky and glass buildings reflecting off of it,\" one wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"Lens flare zooming past NYC accidentally caught on film by local news chopper,\" another said on X.\n\nOthers claimed it could have been a drone or a balloon.\n\n\"Maybe somebody\u2019s private drone was made to look like something else,\" one viewer suggested.\n\n\"That makes the most sense if it\u2019s not a balloon.\"\n\nA representative from the local news channel that filmed the clip told the Post that they do not know when the footage was recorded but confirmed it had not been edited.\n\nAnother source from the news outlet claimed that it was a drone that appeared to be moving at high speeds due to that of the chopper.\n\nEarlier this month, Congress heard a Pentagon whistleblower's bombshell testimony at a major hearing about UFO cases."

        "article_content": "Alden Ehrenreich is known for playing a Young Han Solo but got his start playing a small role in the paranormal drama Supernatural.\n\nActor Alden Ehrenreich is best known for playing the role of Young Han Solo in the ill-fated 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. He also had an important supporting role in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer. However, before establishing himself as one of the most promising talents in Hollywood, Ehrenreich got his start in a rather small role.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich played Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story (Credit: Lucasfilm).\n\nEhrenreich made his acting debut appearing in an episode of the hit paranormal drama series Supernatural, starring Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Moreover, given the show\u2019s fifteen-season run, the episode Ehrenreich featured in is easy to forget despite being an extremely underrated outing for the Winchester brothers, and here is everything you need to know in that regard.\n\nSolo Star Alden Ehrenreich Got His Start on Supernatural With Jensen Ackles\n\nAlden Ehrenreich\u2018s first acting credit was on the second episode of Supernatural. The actor was only fifteen years old when appeared in the role of Billy Collins in the episode Wendigo. In the episode, the Winchester brothers help siblings Haley and Ben find their missing older brother Tommy.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich made his debut on Supernatural (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nThe episode marks the first instance in the series where Sam and Dean, played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki encounter a monster instead of a spirit or a demon. It sees Ackles and Padalecki teaming up with Ehrenreich\u2019s character, leading to some intense and some outright goofy moments.\n\nThe episode\u2019s tonal inconsistencies can be chalked up to the fact that it was the show\u2019s second episode, with most of its lore and character dynamics yet to be set up. Nonetheless, the entire cast, including a young Ehrenreich delivered commendable performances, earning the episode a modest 7.8/10 rating on IMDB.\n\nEhrenreich was later cast in the role of Han Solo for the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story, taking over the iconic role from Harrison Ford. Despite the film\u2019s mixed reception, Ehrenreich\u2019s performance was largely praised. He is next slated to appear in the MCU series Ironheart.\n\nSupernatural Has a Long-Standing Connection to the Star Wars Franchise\n\nAside from Ehrenreich, actress Emily Swallow has also appeared in both Supernatural and the Star Wars universe. She played Amara in the former before appearing as The Armorer in The Mandalorian. However, the connection between the two brands does not end there.\n\nSupernatural has many Star Wars easter eggs (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nOne of the biggest links between the two lies in the lead characters\u2019 names. According to creator Eric Kripke, the brothers\u2019 last name was originally supposed to be Harrison, as an ode to Harrison Ford. However, the name had to be changed because of legal reasons.\n\nRelated The Supernatural Episode Everyone Forgets Freddy Krueger Star Robert Englund Was in\n\nAn easter egg referencing the names was dropped in the show with Sam and Dean using fake U.S. Wildlife Service badges. In an episode, the duo used these fake badges with the names Agent Ford and Agent Hamill. Kripke later confirmed that Sam and Dean were loosely inspired by Luke & Han.\n\nSupernatural is streaming on Netflix."

        "article_content": "Horror comedy is a genre that hasn\u2019t been explored much in Malayalam cinema. However, when attempted, some films like 'Romancham' and 'Adi Kapyare Kootamani' have struck a chord with audiences. Joining this league is debutant Vaishakh Elans\u2019s 'Hello Mummy,' featuring Sharafudheen and Aishwarya Lekshmi in lead roles.\n\nFor starters, the movie introduces a fresh concept. The story revolves around Boney (Sharafudheen), who falls in love with Steffy (Aishwarya Lekshmi). However, their love story comes with a spooky twist\u2014a ghostly presence in Steffy\u2019s life prevents her from leading a peaceful existence with Boney. To uncover the mystery behind this paranormal interference, you\u2019ll have to catch 'Hello Mummy' in theatres.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the film\u2019s strengths lies in how it utilises Sharafudheen\u2019s comedic talent. His portrayal of Boney, a quirky, fun-loving character, adds charm and humour to the narrative. Watching Sharaf bring this role to life makes for an entertaining experience.\n\nHis combination scenes with Aishwarya Lekshmi are delightful to watch. Writer Sanjo Joseph has infused the story with several humorous moments, though it does feel somewhat incomplete in parts. Aishwarya shines as Steffy, bringing a playful energy to her character. Supporting actors like Jagadish and Johny Antony also contribute to the lively banter, adding to the overall entertainment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs for the horror aspect, the film successfully introduces a mystical and fantastical vibe.\n\nVaishakh leans heavily on slapstick comedy for most of the film, and it works for the most part. Sharaf delivers a solid performance, holding his own as Boney, a character trying to navigate the chaos and make sense of the paranormal activities surrounding him.\n\nThe second half of the film shifts slightly from the light-hearted, fun tone of the first half, exploring more serious and emotional aspects. It also focuses on providing explanations for the events that unfolded earlier in the story. For those looking for a lighthearted and enjoyable experience, this film is a great pick. With its blend of horror, fantasy, and comedy, it\u2019s sure to appeal to younger audiences."

The star, WOH G64 , is located 160,000 light years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy orbiting the Milky Way. This massive red supergiant is about 2,000 times the size of the Sun and is undergoing a dramatic transformation. For the first time, scientists have observed an egg-shaped cocoon of gas and dust surrounding the star, hinting at significant changes taking place.The cocoon may be a result of the star shedding its outer layers, potentially signaling its imminent death and the onset of a supernova explosion. Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), astronomers were able to observe this distant giant in extraordinary detail, offering a rare glimpse into the life cycle of a star at the brink of its explosive end.Dr. Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist at Andr\u00e9s Bello National University in Chile, described the discovery as exciting, stating that the egg-shaped cocoon surrounding the star could be linked to the star shedding material before potentially exploding as a supernova.The star in question, WOH G64, resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy orbiting the Milky Way about 160,000 light years away. This red supergiant is thought to be one of the largest stars in the galaxy, measuring approximately 2,000 times the diameter of our Sun. Despite its immense size, observing this star in such detail required exceptional resolution, akin to spotting an astronaut walking on the Moon from Earth.Dr. Jacco van Loon, a co-author of the study, explained that typical telescopes cannot provide this level of detail. The images reveal that the star has undergone significant changes in the last decade, shedding its outer layers and leaving behind the cocoon of gas and dust that now surrounds it. The star's elongated shape may be the result of its rotation or the presence of an unseen companion star, influencing its structure. This transformation suggests that WOH G64 could be nearing the end of its life and may soon explode as a supernova. Dr. Van Loon compared the energy released by a supernova to the Sun shining for all its 10 billion years. While astronomers have observed supernovae in the past, they have never before witnessed a star changing in a way that signals its imminent death.Stars are known to expel their outer layers shortly before a supernova explosion, a phenomenon that can happen in just a few years or decades. However, tracking these changes in real-time is rare. Van Loon noted that while it may still take tens of thousands of years for WOH G64 to reach its supernova stage, for astronomers, this is considered a relatively short timespan since stars live for millions or even billions of years."

Astronomers have just discovered a new planet, and yes, it\u2019s one more name to add to those already tricky lists of planets. This one\u2019s called IRAS 04125+2902 b, and it\u2019s a baby planet- 3 million years old. While that sounds pretty old in planet years, it\u2019s actually still in the early stages of life. But what\u2019s even cooler is how astronomers found it: they got lucky with a rare chance to see it in action as it passed in front of its star, a phenomenon known as a transit.\n\nAlso Read NASA brings AI to space science, these areas to get biggest boost\n\nNormally, when planets are still babies, they\u2019re hidden behind thick clouds of space dust and debris. But this planet is special. Its surrounding debris disk has been warped in a way that allows telescopes, like TESS (the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), to see it from Earth.\n\nLocated about 430 light-years away in a region called the Taurus Molecular Cloud, IRAS 04125+2902 b is in a stellar nursery, where new stars and planets are being born. The planet itself is still hot from the heat of its formation, and while it\u2019s smaller than Jupiter, it\u2019s still big enough to be seen as it passes across the face of its star. This is an incredible discovery because it helps scientists learn more about how planets form and what happens to them in the first few million years of their life.\n\nAlso Read Warning!

It could turn into a \u201cmini-Neptune\u201d or even a \u201csuper-Earth\u201d\u2014types of planets that are actually pretty common in our galaxy, but not in our own solar system.\n\nFor now, scientists are still figuring out what caused the planet\u2019s surrounding debris disk to warp. Some theories suggest the planet might have moved closer to its star, or maybe a hidden companion star could be pulling on the disk. Regardless of the cause, this discovery is giving us an exciting look at the early stages of planetary life."

        "article_content": "Tesla battery supplier Panasonic has revamped a plant in Wakayama, Japan, as part of the effort to mass produce what it calls a \"breakthrough\" in the battery and electric vehicle industries, according to a company news release.\n\nThe 4680 cylindrical cell is much bigger and thus \"these new cells possess five times the capacity of the 2170 cell,\" the release said, for starters. The 4680 moniker is in reference to its size of 46 millimeters in diameter by 80 millimeters long (1.8 inches by 3.1 inches), per Bloomberg.\n\nPanasonic bills the 4680 as a clear improvement on its 2170 cells, which are used in the Tesla Model Y and Model 3. The new pack is expected to decrease production costs along with EV prices, according to the Panasonic news release and Electrek.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to New Atlas, the new cells \"do require less supporting material, so they're both lighter and more compact for a given energy capacity,\" referencing a 2020 prediction by Tesla that a cell of the same size could produce a 16% increase in effective range when used in production.\n\nIt's part of a growing list of battery innovations from labs around the planet that involve unique materials, some including potassium and sodium. Researchers at work on those projects share Panasonic's goal of lowering production costs and boosting performance.\n\nThe Wakayama plant is innovative in its own right. Panasonic reports that it will be a \"mother\" plant for 4680 production while also serving as a proving ground for other products. About 400 employees are expected to be working there by March, per the news release.\n\n\"This milestone is the result of years of expertise in cylindrical lithium-ion battery manufacturing,\" Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe plant will use solar and wind power to help make operations cleaner. The goal is to eventually reach \"virtually\" zero carbon dioxide emissions, per Panasonic. Cutting heat-trapping gas production is a win for public health, as medical experts link the fumes to a variety of lung, heart, and other health problems.\n\nBetter batteries can help with the effort to clear the air, as well as improve EV performance and pricing.\n\n\"As we add the 4680 cell to our lineup, we'll cater to a broader range of needs, further promoting the use of EVs and advancing our mission of fostering a sustainable society,\" Tadanobu said.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nThe expansion is coming at a good time, as EV sales neared 14 million worldwide last year. That's up from more than 10 million in 2022, according to International Energy Agency statistics. Stateside, robust tax breaks worth up to $7,500 are still available, making the cleaner rides even more affordable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf everything goes according to Panasonic's plan, the 4680 cells should soon be a part of some of those EVs.\n\n\"I'm confident it will significantly revolutionize the battery and EV industry,\" Tadanobu said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."
