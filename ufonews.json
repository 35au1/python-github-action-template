            "article_content": "If 2024 is going to be remembered for anything, it likely will be remembered as the first year that generative AI took hold of the cultural zeitgeist. It seemed everywhere you looked, you saw something about AI. At Google, the company went all-in on AI, injecting its Gemini systems into pretty much every product and service it offers.\n\nAs it turns out, this also applies to its security teams. The Google Play security team, for example, just released its annual report on what\u2019s been happening behind the scenes as they protect us all from harmful apps, bad developers, malware, and other issues. In 2024, this team stopped more bad apps than any other year prior \u2014 2.36 million apps, to be precise, which is wild to even think about. Google says that AI played a considerable role here.\n\nAccording to Google, human app reviewers on the Google Play security team used AI in their work in 92% of cases. That\u2019s a massive amount. Google claims AI tools help the team act more quickly and take more accurate action against developers who are trying to sneak bad apps onto the Play Store.\n\nThe Google Play security team is not the only way we are protected from bad apps, though. In 2024, Google also introduced a bunch of new security features to its Play Protect service that prevent attackers that do get through its defenses from doing any significant harm to you. Here are three examples:\n\nReminder to turn on Play Protect: The Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks. Sometimes, user turn this feature off so that they can install something they know to be safe. To help prevent attacks during this Play Protect downtime, Chrome now reminds users to turn Play Protect back on if it has been turned off.\n\nThe Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks. Sometimes, user turn this feature off so that they can install something they know to be safe. To help prevent attacks during this Play Protect downtime, Chrome now reminds users to turn Play Protect back on if it has been turned off. Disabling Play Protect toggle during calls: One method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call. To combat this, Android now disables the Play Protect toggle during both regular calls as well as voice calls through popular chat apps. In order to toggle Play Protect off, you would need to end the call first, which will hopefully be enough time for the user to figure out that that\u2019s not a great idea.\n\nOne method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call.

Automatic permissions revoking: When you install and use an app, you sometimes need to grant it permissions. Sometimes, the app you\u2019ve installed is malicious, and the permissions you\u2019ve granted it put you in danger. Now, Play Protect automatically revokes permissions for apps like these. The user can still manually restore those permissions if they want to, but once again, this will give that malicious app less of an opening to do any damage.\n\nConsidering how many Android devices are out there (over two billion) and how open the Android ecosystem is compared to other operating systems, it\u2019s a wonder it isn\u2019t completely overrun with bad actors. Many people reading this have likely never faced a significant security problem on their Android device, which is a direct result of what the Google Play security team does every day."

So, that's the coolest part about this building specifically.\"\n\nThe crew even attempts to contact one specific prisoner \u2014 Glenn \u2014 at the very spot he was murdered. \"Can you make this ball of light turn on?\" Bernstein asks, immediately resulting in a strange array of lights.\n\nWatch it all in Episode 11 directly below.\n\nREAD MORE: Inkcarceration Festival 2025 Full Daily Lineups Revealed\n\nAbout Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents\n\nInkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nConstruction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.\n\nFans are already looking forward to the 2025 installment, which takes place July 18, 29 and 20 with headliners Falling in Reverse, Slipknot and Five Finger Death Punch.\n\nInkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals.

NASA\u2019s shocking asteroid findings raise big questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\u2019s asteroid discovery may prove life didn\u2019t start on Earth\u2014it came from space\n\n\n\nAre left-handed amino acids the key to life? NASA\u2019s Bennu asteroid sparks new mysteries\n\n\n\nAlso Read:\n\nFor decades, scientists have scoured the cosmos for signs of life beyond Earth\u2014but what if the answer has been hiding in plain sight? NASA's latest asteroid sample, retrieved from deep space, has left researchers stunned, igniting speculation that we may not be alone. The findings, shrouded in secrecy until now, could challenge everything we thought we knew about our place in the universe.Is this the breakthrough humanity has been waiting for? Or is there something NASA isn't telling us? As whispers of extraterrestrial evidence grow louder, experts are racing to uncover the truth. One thing is certain\u2014this discovery has the potential to change history. Stay tuned, because what NASA just found might be bigger than anyone imagined.For years, scientists have asked: Is there life beyond Earth? Now, NASA's latest revelation is sending shockwaves through the scientific community. In a groundbreaking discovery, asteroid Bennu, once thought to be just a floating space rock, has revealed something extraordinary. Samples brought back by NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft suggest that the very ingredients for life were scattered throughout the early solar system.Published in the journal Nature, and its offspring, Nature Astronomy, these research findings do not confirm extraterrestrial life; however, it does suggest that the building blocks necessary for this type of life were far more widespread than researchers previously believed. This raises an ominous question: If Earth was not unique in its conditions, could life have developed elsewhere-on a distant planet or a hidden moon?\"This is rewriting everything we know,\" said NASA's Nicky Fox. As scientists dig deeper, one thing is clear, this discovery could change our understanding of life itself, making us wonder if we are truly alone or not.NASA\u2019s latest asteroid discovery has sent shockwaves through the scientific world. The Bennu samples, delivered by the OSIRIS-REx mission , contain something astonishing, 14 of the 20 amino acids life on Earth uses to build proteins and all five nucleobases found in DNA and RNA. These are the very blueprints of life itself.Even more shocking, scientists detected high levels of ammonia and formaldehyde\u2014key ingredients that, under the right conditions, could spark the formation of complex molecules. Could these compounds have seeded life not just on Earth, but across the solar system?While traces of these building blocks have been found in meteorites before, never has such a pristine sample been studied directly from space. \u201cThe clues we\u2019re finding are incredibly fragile and could never survive Earth\u2019s contamination,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Danny Glavin. The question now looms larger than ever, was life\u2019s origin an Earthly miracle, or something far more cosmic?NASA's new discovery from the Bennu asteroid opens a new chapter in its search for life beyond Earth. The samples brought from the asteroid, rich in amino acids and other elements required to build life, indicate that the raw material for life is much more widely distributed in the solar system than we thought so far. There is, however, a curious anomaly that stumps scientists: the Bennu samples contain just the right proportion of left-handed and right-handed amino acids. It uses only the left-handed variety on Earth. Why does the universe prefer \"left\"?\"This adds major strokes to the picture of a solar system brimming with life potential,\" said NASA's Jason Dworkin. But the real question is far deeper\u2014if life could arise anywhere, why have we yet to find it elsewhere? The answers may lie in this baffling mystery, leaving us to wonder: Could life's origins be more universal\u2014and more complex\u2014than we ever imagined?"

Now a new study claims to have discovered a massive reserve of hydrogen beneath the earth surface which could power the planet for decades and centuries to come. The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

            "article_content": "SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $25 billion in OpenAI as part of a broader partnership that could see the Japanese conglomerate spend more than $40 billion on AI initiatives with the Microsoft-backed startup, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe potential investment would make SoftBank OpenAI\u2019s largest single backer, the report said, surpassing Microsoft, which first invested in the ChatGPT maker in 2019. The deal comes after both companies announced last week they would jointly invest $100 billion in Stargate, a U.S. data center project for OpenAI that could expand to $500 billion over four years.\n\nSoftBank plans to invest $15 billion to $25 billion directly into OpenAI in addition to its $15 billion Stargate commitment, the report said. OpenAI will invest around $15 billion in Stargate, with SoftBank\u2019s equity investment potentially covering OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure commitment.\n\nThe talks come at a time when Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s release of its R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model, which was built on a relatively modest budget, rattled public markets this week.\n\nThe chip giant Nvidia lost as much as $589 billion in a day before making a slight recovery, as investors worried that big investments in expensive AI hardware might not be necessary if companies could achieve similar results with fewer resources.\n\nOpenAI claimed earlier this week that it had found evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI\u2019s proprietary models to train R1 and other models through a technique called \u201cdistillation,\u201d which allows developers to achieve similar performance with smaller models at a much lower cost. The company says this would violate its terms of service, which prohibit using outputs to develop competing models.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s deal with SoftBank, which Financial Times says hasn\u2019t been finalized, represents SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s biggest bet since injecting $16 billion into WeWork. It would also reduce OpenAI\u2019s dependence on Microsoft for computing resources, with Microsoft recently agreeing to give up its position as OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud provider.\n\nAround 20% of Stargate\u2019s funding is expected to be equity, with the remainder financed through debt secured against assets and cash flow, the report said. OpenAI, which reached a $157 billion valuation last year, is also negotiating to become a for-profit company to facilitate additional fundraising."

            "article_content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Google has announced new features for Gemini in Google Sheets, aimed at making data analysis easier.\n\nGemini can now generate charts, analyze trends, and answer data-related questions, even running Python code for deeper insights.\n\nThese features are rolling out now and will be available to select Google Workspace and Google One AI Premium subscribers.\n\nIf spreadsheets have ever left you squinting at rows of data or scrambling to build charts, Gemini\u2019s latest update might be a welcome relief. The company announced today that its Gemini AI assistant, already embedded in Google Workspace apps, is learning some new tricks for Google Sheets.\n\nStarting today, Gemini in Sheets can process user queries to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within spreadsheet data. This means users can ask questions about their data and receive actionable insights without needing advanced technical skills. For example, a marketing analyst could request insights into their top-performing channels, while a financial analyst could use Gemini to detect anomalies in inventory levels.\n\nAnother major addition is Gemini\u2019s ability to generate charts based on spreadsheet data. These charts, inserted as static images, provide a visual representation of key insights but do not automatically update when the data changes.\n\nGemini in Sheets can now also translate user requests into Python code, execute that code, and analyze the results. This would allow for more complex data analysis, enabling users to identify trends and drill deeper into their findings \u2014 all without needing to write a single line of Python themselves. However, for simpler queries, Gemini may still rely on spreadsheet formulas instead of Python.\n\nTo ensure the best results, Google recommends that users maintain a clean and well-structured dataset, free of missing values, with clear headers. Additionally, Sheets with more than one million cells may experience performance limitations when using Gemini for complex analysis.\n\nThe new features are rolling out starting today, with a full rollout expected by February 20. For those eager to test out the new features, Gemini in Sheets can be accessed through the side panel in Google Sheets by clicking on the \u201cAsk Gemini\u201d button in the top-right corner.\n\nHowever, not all users will have immediate access. Gemini\u2019s expanded capabilities in Sheets will be available to subscribers of Google Workspace Business Standard and Plus, Enterprise Standard and Plus, as well as users with the Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium, or Google One AI Premium add-ons.\n\nGot a tip?

            "article_content": "Intentional gifts for the guests by Tyler Speier Events. | Credit: Courtesy\n\n\n\nWedding Trends\n\nWeekend Experiences, Bold Colors and Fabrics,\n\nDramatic Drapes, and More Trends for 2025\n\nBy Meaghan Clark Tiernan\n\nJanuary 30, 2025\n\nWhether you\u2019re newly engaged, almost nearly engaged, or just love weddings, this season\u2019s trends are all about elevating personality. We talked to local experts who mentioned everything from color to dining experiences as this season\u2019s trends, where couples revoke the traditional and instead prioritize the intentional.\n\nColor, Color, Color\n\nMinimalism is out, and bold, textured color that reflects a couple\u2019s personality is in. Textiles and fabrics can truly help liven up a space, and that\u2019s exactly what professionals in the wedding industry are expecting to see more of in 2025. Think less neutral, more personal, says Over the Moon Events & Experiences owner and creative director Krysta Stoddard. \u201cThere\u2019s so much freedom, design wise, when you start working with different elements and colors,\u201d she says. That can be anything from eccentric tablescapes covered in a dramatic textile to draping in uncommon colors and fabrics.\n\nDramatic Drapes\n\nAny space can be immediately transformed with draping, but a single sheath of chiffon isn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be steering away from the white and blushes, and instead people are getting adventurous and using more color,\u201d says Cristina Bentley, VP director of operations at Bella Vista Designs. \u201cAnd draping plays a huge part in that.\u201d Imagine an extra layer of elegance, where yards of deep green velvet or vibrant patterns help transform spaces into something lush and luxurious.\n\nBella Vista Designs, a premier production company that just celebrated 20 years in business, has been doing draping since day one. \u201cA trend that we\u2019re seeing with draping is a lot of asymmetries \u2014 so it\u2019s not just a flat wall \u2026 [but] very eclectic layers on top of layers,\u201d says Bentley.\n\nDrapery drama by Bella Vista Designs | Credit: James and Jess Photography\n\nIntentional Design\n\nThis year, with color playing a huge factor in design, there\u2019s a shift from traditional to personal. That\u2019s reflected in nontraditional color palettes, but also in every element throughout the event; people are not just going to offer gifts because they\u2019ve been told to. Instead, says Tyler Speier of Tyler Speier Events, couples are requesting \u201creally intentional pieces that tell a story.\u201d\n\nThose high-touch elements can appear in the form of elaborate lighting like huge lantern or globe installations, or custom dance floors that tie the whole space together. \u201cI think people are going to start getting really creative with their dance floors,\u201d says Stoddard. Vendors like RCD Dance Floors can incorporate a monogram or introduce a vinyl overlay that matches a color or floral scheme to transform the space.\n\nDress Codes\n\nGone are the days where guests just show up for the ceremony, a meal, and maybe a dance. Couples are planning weekend-long celebrations for everyone; think coordinated hikes, yoga retreats, and wine tastings. With fewer and fewer couples asking friends and family to be part of the \u201cofficial\u201d wedding party, says Stoddard, dress codes and color palettes for three days of activities means everyone is part of the wedding. \u201cNot only is the bride, groom, or anyone in the bridal party going to make some fashion statement, but I think people are going to start giving mood boards or dress codes to their guests,\u201d she says.\n\nInteractive Experiences\n\nFor much of the population getting hitched, they\u2019ve placed a particular emphasis on experience. Couples are vying for grabbing guests\u2019 attention in a world of ephemeral design, which translates to more interactive wedding experiences. \u201cThe focus is so much on the experience,\u201d says Speier, that everything down to the smells, sounds, and tastes is being curated.\n\nTraditionally, says Speier, the festivities centered around the dance floor at the reception. Today, weddings are steering more toward \u201csexier, elevated dinner parties,\u201d he says, which translates to separate rooms for cocktail hour, dancing, and dinner \u2014 each with its own \u201cwow moment.\u201d That experiential moment can come in the shape of a poet with a vintage typewriter coming to cocktail hour or custom scent bars or upscale taco bars like Nomada or oyster bars where chefs shuck.\n\nContent Creators\n\nAs we mentioned last year, industry experts expect the demand for content creators to rise. In line with the desire to create a \u201cfeeling,\u201d on-site content creators can give couples something others can\u2019t: real-time content. Capturing the real-life moments allows for everyone to put down their phones and be more present \u2014 a feeling that will enhance the overall guest experience."

NASA\u2019s shocking asteroid findings raise big questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\u2019s asteroid discovery may prove life didn\u2019t start on Earth\u2014it came from space\n\n\n\nAre left-handed amino acids the key to life? NASA\u2019s Bennu asteroid sparks new mysteries\n\n\n\nAlso Read:\n\nFor decades, scientists have scoured the cosmos for signs of life beyond Earth\u2014but what if the answer has been hiding in plain sight? NASA's latest asteroid sample, retrieved from deep space, has left researchers stunned, igniting speculation that we may not be alone. The findings, shrouded in secrecy until now, could challenge everything we thought we knew about our place in the universe.Is this the breakthrough humanity has been waiting for? Or is there something NASA isn't telling us? As whispers of extraterrestrial evidence grow louder, experts are racing to uncover the truth. One thing is certain\u2014this discovery has the potential to change history. Stay tuned, because what NASA just found might be bigger than anyone imagined.For years, scientists have asked: Is there life beyond Earth? Now, NASA's latest revelation is sending shockwaves through the scientific community. In a groundbreaking discovery, asteroid Bennu, once thought to be just a floating space rock, has revealed something extraordinary. Samples brought back by NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft suggest that the very ingredients for life were scattered throughout the early solar system.Published in the journal Nature, and its offspring, Nature Astronomy, these research findings do not confirm extraterrestrial life; however, it does suggest that the building blocks necessary for this type of life were far more widespread than researchers previously believed. This raises an ominous question: If Earth was not unique in its conditions, could life have developed elsewhere-on a distant planet or a hidden moon?\"This is rewriting everything we know,\" said NASA's Nicky Fox. As scientists dig deeper, one thing is clear, this discovery could change our understanding of life itself, making us wonder if we are truly alone or not.NASA\u2019s latest asteroid discovery has sent shockwaves through the scientific world. The Bennu samples, delivered by the OSIRIS-REx mission , contain something astonishing, 14 of the 20 amino acids life on Earth uses to build proteins and all five nucleobases found in DNA and RNA. These are the very blueprints of life itself.Even more shocking, scientists detected high levels of ammonia and formaldehyde\u2014key ingredients that, under the right conditions, could spark the formation of complex molecules. Could these compounds have seeded life not just on Earth, but across the solar system?While traces of these building blocks have been found in meteorites before, never has such a pristine sample been studied directly from space. \u201cThe clues we\u2019re finding are incredibly fragile and could never survive Earth\u2019s contamination,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Danny Glavin. The question now looms larger than ever, was life\u2019s origin an Earthly miracle, or something far more cosmic?NASA's new discovery from the Bennu asteroid opens a new chapter in its search for life beyond Earth. The samples brought from the asteroid, rich in amino acids and other elements required to build life, indicate that the raw material for life is much more widely distributed in the solar system than we thought so far. There is, however, a curious anomaly that stumps scientists: the Bennu samples contain just the right proportion of left-handed and right-handed amino acids. It uses only the left-handed variety on Earth. Why does the universe prefer \"left\"?\"This adds major strokes to the picture of a solar system brimming with life potential,\" said NASA's Jason Dworkin. But the real question is far deeper\u2014if life could arise anywhere, why have we yet to find it elsewhere? The answers may lie in this baffling mystery, leaving us to wonder: Could life's origins be more universal\u2014and more complex\u2014than we ever imagined?"

The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

            "article_content": "It took a while for scientists to gain access to the samples that NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission took from the asteroid Bennu, but the wait is proving to be worth it. A new study published January 29 in Nature describes an unexpected discovery in the material delivered by OSIRIS-REx: residues of compounds left over by the evaporation of liquid water.\n\nTim McCoy, the paper\u2019s lead author and the curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, tells Popular Science that the presence of these compounds was completely unexpected. \u201c[Finding them] was a complete surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectively, the team that wrote this paper has hundreds of years of experience examining meteorites and none of us\u2014in fact, nobody\u2014had ever seen some of these minerals.\u201d\n\nOREX-800044-101, the sample that was analysed by the Japanese members of the OSIRIS-REx sample analysis team. Credit: Yasuhiro Oba\n\nOne of the reasons that the discovery is so significant is that the compounds must have precipitated from the evaporation of brine solutions\u2013solutions of liquid water with high concentrations of dissolved salts. \u201cWe know this,\u201d McCoy explains, \u201cboth because some of these minerals \u2026 actually have water in their crystal structure, and because we know the most abundant fluid [in the universe] is water. There could have been a small component of other ices, like carbon dioxide, but it was mostly water.\u201d\n\n[ Related: This is what\u2019s inside NASA\u2019s previously stuck asteroid sampler ]\n\nThe presence of these compounds therefore implies the presence of liquid water at some point in Bennu\u2019s history\u2014or, more accurately, in the history of the ancient asteroid from which Bennu originated. That parent asteroid was a larger object that broke up into smaller pieces at some point during the last 65 million years. McCoy explains that the parent asteroid was formed partly of ice, and over the millennia, this ice was melted by heat from the decay of radioactive elements in the asteroid\u2019s regolith.\n\nMcCoy says that this water \u201clikely existed not on the surface, but as a vein or pocket under the surface of the asteroid.\u201d This prolonged its existence in a liquid state, most likely, as McCoy says, at \u201cabout room temperature.\u201d The dissolved minerals may also have allowed the solution to remain liquid for longer: brine solutions generally have lower freezing points than pure water. (This is why roads are salted during snowy weather.)\n\nIn any case, when the water did eventually evaporate, it left behind the concentrated precipitates that proved such a surprise to McCoy and his team\u2014and when the parent asteroid broke up, those compounds were passed onto its successors, including Bennu. The first compound the team discovered in the Bennu sample was sodium carbonate, which had never been observed before in any other asteroid or meteorite. As it incorporates water into its crystal structure, its presence prompted McCoy and other teams around the world to search samples of other water-soluble compounds. They found 11 such compounds in total, all of which had been concentrated in a brine solution and then precipitated as the water evaporated.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Brines of the sort that apparently formed in the pockets of liquid water on Bennu\u2019s ancestor provide a favorable environment for the development of complex organic compounds. In a statement accompanying the release of the paper, McCoy said, \u201cWe now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu\u2019s parent body.\u201d The paper also speculates that similar brines may exist today in the interior of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Mars\u2019s moon Ceres.\n\nA mosaic image of asteroid Bennu, composed of 12 PolyCam images collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from a range of 24 kilometers. Credit: NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona\n\nEither way, McCoy says the apparent presence of liquid water in Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid also tells us something important about that asteroid: \u201cThe fact Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid incorporated ice means it had to form beyond the Solar System\u2019s snow line.\u201d This line marks the distance from a star at which the temperature falls below water\u2019s freezing point. (In 2016, NASA captured an image of this phenomenon in a young solar system.)\n\nThe snow line is particularly important in the early days of a solar system, as the cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a nascent star begins to coalesce into the protoplanetary disk from which the system\u2019s planets and other orbiting bodies will eventually form. Beyond the snow line, water is solid and aggregates readily into nascent planets and asteroids, whereas within the line, water remains gaseous and is harder to capture.\n\n[ Related: 10 chaotic space-related mishaps of 2024 ]\n\nThis means that objects formed beyond the snow line are relatively rich in water, and one leading theory about the origin of the water on Earth is that it was acquired by the capture of such water-rich objects. And if those objects contained brine solutions rich in organic compounds, it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that life may have already been evolving in those environments before their arrival on Earth.\n\nSuch theoretical possibilities aside, McCoy says the discovery of brine compounds shows the value of OSIRIS-REx having been able to take direct physical samples from Bennu. \u201cThese are incredibly rare minerals, so they can\u2019t be detected from Earth.\u201d In addition, he says, \u201cMany of these minerals are unstable in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Without the controlled return by a spacecraft mission and very careful curation in nitrogen to isolate them from the atmosphere, we would have never found [them] in the first place.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In the grand narrative of artificial intelligence, there are few names that command as much respect and admiration as Fei-Fei Li. Known as the \"godmother of AI,\" her pioneering work in computer vision has transformed how machines understand the world. As the creator of ImageNet, she laid the groundwork for modern deep learning, fueling advancements in autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging, and generative AI.\n\nBut Fei-Fei Li\u2019s story is about more than just innovation. It\u2019s a tale of resilience, breaking barriers, and humanizing AI. In a male-dominated tech industry, she faced obstacles at every turn, yet she defied the odds, proving that intelligence\u2014both human and artificial\u2014thrives when given the right support.\n\nToday, AI is everywhere, from personal assistants to AI-powered drug discovery, and much of this revolution can be traced back to her work. This article dives deep into Fei-Fei Li\u2019s journey, her groundbreaking contributions, and the impact of AI on our everyday lives.\n\nEarly Life and Education: A Journey Across Continents\n\nFei-Fei Li was born in Chengdu, China, in 1976. Her early life was far from the elite Silicon Valley circles she would later influence. At the age of 15, she and her family immigrated to the United States, seeking new opportunities. However, life was anything but easy.\n\nSettling in Parsippany, New Jersey, she faced the struggles of learning a new language and adapting to a foreign culture. Despite financial difficulties\u2014her parents running a laundry business\u2014Li excelled academically. She worked tirelessly, balancing high school studies with helping at her family\u2019s shop.\n\nHer brilliance shone through, earning her a spot at Princeton University, where she pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Physics (1999), graduating with high honors. However, she soon realized that her true passion lay in artificial intelligence and computer vision. This realization led her to pursue a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Caltech, which she completed in 2005.\n\nHer Ph.D. work explored machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, and AI\u2019s potential to replicate human vision, setting the stage for the innovations that would soon follow.\n\nThe Birth of ImageNet: How AI Learned to See\n\nIn 2006, while working as an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Li identified a major gap in AI research. If AI was to truly understand the world visually, it needed data\u2014a lot of data.\n\nThe Problem: AI\u2019s Struggle with Visual Recognition\n\nAt the time, AI\u2019s ability to recognize images was rudimentary at best. Most datasets were too small, containing just a few thousand images. AI lacked the scale needed to recognize and categorize objects like the human brain.\n\nThe Solution: ImageNet \u2013 An AI Revolution\n\nLi's radical idea was simple but ambitious: create a massive dataset of labeled images. She envisioned a database that would help AI train itself on millions of real-world images, mimicking how humans learn to recognize patterns.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, she and her team built ImageNet, an unprecedented dataset of 14 million images across 20,000 categories. These images were labeled and categorized meticulously, allowing AI models to train on a scale never seen before.\n\nIn 2010, she launched the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), a competition that would change AI forever.\n\nThe ImageNet Moment: AI\u2019s Breakthrough in Deep Learning\n\nThe game-changing moment came in 2012 when researchers Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton entered the ILSVRC competition with a deep-learning model called AlexNet.\n\nUsing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on ImageNet, AlexNet achieved a top-5 error rate of 15.3%\u2014a dramatic improvement over previous models.\n\nThis breakthrough sparked the deep learning revolution, paving the way for today\u2019s AI-powered world.\n\nThe Aftermath: How ImageNet Changed AI\n\n2014: Google Brain and Microsoft Research further improved ImageNet models, reducing error rates to under 5%.\n\nGoogle Brain and Microsoft Research further improved ImageNet models, reducing error rates to under 5%. 2015: AI models outperformed human accuracy in object recognition.\n\nAI models outperformed human accuracy in object recognition. 2017-Present: ImageNet-powered AI led to advancements in autonomous driving, medical AI, and generative AI.\n\nToday, every major AI company\u2014from OpenAI to Tesla\u2014relies on deep learning techniques built on Fei-Fei Li\u2019s work.\n\nChampioning Human-Centered AI\n\nFei-Fei Li\u2019s work wasn\u2019t just about pushing AI forward\u2014it was about making AI work for humans.\n\nIn 2017, she became Google Cloud\u2019s Chief Scientist of AI and Machine Learning, advocating for ethical and human-centered AI. Her goal? Ensure AI remains an augmentation of human intelligence, not a replacement.\n\nShe later returned to Stanford University, where she co-founded the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). The institute focuses on:\n\nAI Ethics & Bias Prevention\n\nAI in Healthcare & Social Good\n\nEnsuring AI Augments, Not Replaces, Human Labor\n\nBreaking Barriers as a Woman in AI\n\nFei-Fei Li\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t just about technology\u2014it was about breaking stereotypes.\n\nAs a woman in AI, she faced gender bias, skepticism, and resistance in the male-dominated field. In 2017, emails leaked showing Google executives questioning her leadership. Instead of stepping back, she stood firm, proving that AI leadership should be as diverse as the world it aims to serve.\n\nHer resilience has inspired a new generation of women and minorities to enter AI, with initiatives like:\n\nAI4ALL is a nonprofit she co-founded to increase diversity in AI.\n\nis a nonprofit she co-founded to increase diversity in AI. Stanford Women in AI, is a mentorship program for women in STEM.\n\nFei-Fei Li\u2019s Recent Work & The Future of AI\n\nIn 2024, Fei-Fei Li co-founded World Labs, an AI startup focused on developing spatial intelligence\u2014allowing AI to understand 3D spaces like humans. Within four months, it secured $230 million in funding and a valuation exceeding $1 billion.\n\nHer current focus is:\n\nMaking AI more transparent and ethical. Advancing AI in healthcare, robotics, and education. Ensuring AI remains human-centric and inclusive.\n\nAs AI continues to reshape the world, Fei-Fei Li\u2019s work will remain at the core of its evolution.\n\nThe Legacy of Fei-Fei Li\n\nFrom a Chinese immigrant with big dreams to the architect of modern AI, Fei-Fei Li\u2019s story is one of vision, perseverance, and leadership.\n\nHer work laid the foundation for today\u2019s AI breakthroughs, but her real impact goes beyond technology\u2014it\u2019s about making AI ethical, diverse, and human-centered."

Ukraine\u2019s military acknowledged its withdrawal from most of the town but said that its troops maintained a foothold on the northern outskirts.\n\nAlthough this gain is modest compared with Russia\u2019s recent seizure of nearby Ukrainian strongholds like Vuhledar and Kurakhove, it underscores the effectiveness of a tactic that Moscow has been employing to take one town after another in eastern Ukraine: using its overwhelming personnel advantage to attack relentlessly, gradually trapping Ukrainian forces in a pincer movement and forcing them to retreat to avoid encirclement.\n\n\u201cFrom a tactical perspective, their approach was correct \u2014 they understood their capabilities and advantages and used them effectively,\u201d Maj.

He has since denied the charges and pleaded not guilty.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs was arrested on multiple charges last year (NBC via Getty Images)\n\nDiddy\u2019s Miami mansion was raided last year, with the unsettling discovery being made of large amounts of baby oil, lubricant, guns, and ammunition.\n\nThe lubricant and baby oil are thought to be linked to allegedly violent and drug-fuelled sex parties known as 'freak offs'.\n\nAdvert\n\nPines came forward and spoke about these parties which Combs would have him arrange for a 'laundry list' of paraphernalia.\n\nPines worked for the rapper and mogul from 2019 to 2021, and said he never personally attended the 'freak off' parties.\n\nThe former assistant did say, however, that other parties called Wild King Nights events would lead to him arranging the list of items Diddy required.\n\nPhil Pines opened up about working for the rapper in a new interview (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the interview, conducted by Investigation Discovery, he said: \"We usually had a laundry list of items that included lights, alcohol, marijuana, ketamine, Molly.\n\n\"You have mushrooms on the top there \u2026 baby oil and astroglide [lubricant] are very important; candles, incense, Apple TVs, electronics, computers, iPads. Obviously there was, you know, male libido supplements, stuff like that.\"\n\nPines added that 'young' girls would often attend these parties, describing them as women in their 20s. Diddy is 55.\n\nHe said: \"A lot of times, there were girls that were under the radar, didn\u2019t have a lot of influence. I think that speaks to the type of situations people were put in.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"A lot of times, you have [Diddy] with a young female, and there\u2019s a power dynamic there.\n\nDiddy awaits trial in Brooklyn, New York (Sharief Ziyadat via Getty Images)\n\n\"A more impressionable girl is easier to reel in, as opposed to somebody who might be a celebrity who\u2019s not going to do too much of that, or give some pushback.\"\n\nIn another portion of the interview, Pines was emotional as he described how the rapper 'ordered' him to have sex with a girl to 'prove his loyalty'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe claims that Diddy said to him: \"Prove your loyalty to me, King.\"\n\nThe rapper then began massaging his shoulders like a coach to a 'player that's about to enter the game', handed him a condom, and 'pushed' Pines onto the girl on the couch.\n\nHe went on to add: \"In the moment it felt like, 'What, is this fun for him? Is this a test for entertainment, does he know he's doing this? Is he that gone?' I didn't know what to do.\"\n\nHarrowing allegations have come out about the rapper and his 'freak off' parties (Samir Hussein via Getty Images)\n\nPines said the woman consented to the sex and 'performed' until Diddy was out of sight, at which point he ran away.\n\nHe claimed that he had 'never really recovered from' the incident.\n\nCombs currently awaits trial in Brooklyn, New York, and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article and wish to speak to someone in confidence, contact The Survivors Trust for free on 08088 010 818, available 10am-12.30pm, 1.30pm-3pm and 6pm-8pm Monday to Thursday, 10am-12.30pm and 1.30pm-3pm on Fridays, 10am-12.30pm on Saturdays and 6pm-8pm on Sundays."

I'll never forget that sight as long as I live,\" Ogden added.\n\nAsked whether he feared death while he was hanging out of the cockpit, Lancaster told reporters: \"It did cross my mind. For a moment or two.\"\n\nIn the 2005 documentary Mayday, he also explained: \"What I remember most clearly was the fact that I couldn't breathe because I was facing into the airflow.\"\n\nAn investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) later found that bolts belonging to the windshield had been replaced with slightly smaller ones, which proved to be a lot less secure.\n\nLancaster returned to work after less than five months, but left British Airways in 2003.\n\nHe went on to fly planes for EasyJet until 2008, when he retired from commercial piloting - as I'm sure he'd seen more than enough of the skies by that point."
