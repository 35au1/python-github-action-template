            "article_content": "Microsoft is known for making poor rebranding decisions, and its recent move is no exception. As Windows Latest recently reported, Microsoft has rebranded \u201cMicrosoft 365 Office\u201d as \u201cMicrosoft 365 Copilot,\u201d retiring the household name of the most popular productivity suite, Microsoft Office.\n\nWith this rebranding, Microsoft integrated Copilot chat into the Office apps along with making minor tweakings to the UI. But this rebranding effort has drawn more criticism than praise for various reasons.\n\nFor example, Windows 11 already has a Copilot app, and this rebranding has just left users wondering what\u2019s the difference between both apps.\n\nMicrosoft, in the support document that covers this rebranding information, has attempted to clarify the difference between both apps, stating.\n\n\u201cThe Microsoft 365 Copilot app is your everyday productivity app for work and life that helps you find and edit files, scan documents, and create content on the go with access to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat*, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDFs, and more all in one app,\u201d the company noted in a support document spotted by Windows Latest.\n\nOn the other hand, the dedicated Copilot app is for personal needs and offers more with the Pro subscription.\n\nWindows Latest has created a table comparing the two apps based on the documents we spotted\u201d\n\nFeature Microsoft 365 Copilot App Microsoft Copilot App Purpose Productivity app with tools like Word, Excel, and Copilot. AI chat app for personal learning and assistance. Key Features Combines productivity tools with Copilot Chat for tasks. Conversational AI for guidance and growth. Users Work, school, and personal accounts. Personal accounts only. Copilot Availability Yes (for Microsoft 365 subscribers). Not applicable. Platforms Web, mobile (iOS, Android), and Windows. Web and mobile. Focus Work and personal productivity. AI-driven personal assistance.\n\nMicrosoft is basically saying that the 365 Copilot app is aimed to help users with productivity tasks when using apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or other Microsoft 365 apps. Whereas Copilot is a conversational chatbot that uses LLMs, much like ChatGPT or Gemini.\n\nIt\u2019s quite understandable what Microsoft wants to clarify here. But there is a very big issue. There is already a standalone Copilot app on Windows 11. And after this rebranding, both Microsoft 365 and the standalone Copilot app now share nearly identical logos. This is quite confusing and frustrating at the same time.\n\nSee, how both the apps look very identical on the taskbar.\n\nSome users are also confused how come Microsoft added Copilot app to their PCs when they had removed it previously. However, later, users realized that it was not Copilot, but their favourite Office app, which had now been rebranded to Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\nInsane stuff, right? That\u2019s what happens when rebrandings are stupid and do not align with people\u2019s goals. It\u2019s quite obvious that Microsoft wants all of us to get used to Copilot branding, so Copilot could replace ChatGPT as a synonym for AI, and also position itself as the only AI productivity tool.\n\nThe worst part, the all-new Copilot Chat feature, which is the core of this rebranding, isn\u2019t currently available to most users. Microsoft has made it available for Microsoft 365 work accounts only at the moment.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s shift to 365 Copilot branding and integrating Copilot into the app feels premature. As shown in the above screenshot, Copilot Chat doesn\u2019t work for the majority of Microsoft 365 users.\n\nMicrosoft positioning Copilot as its AI Brand\n\nMicrosoft wants to make Copilot a household name. Microsoft has already added AI into MS Paint, PowerShell, and even Windows Search. Copilot is on every Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs via a dedicated keyboard shortcut.\n\nHowever, Microsoft needs to be careful with its rebranding efforts. This time, the company has renamed Office to Copilot 365, which is a big deal. That\u2019s because Office 365 was a well-established brand. In fact, Office 365 is a synonym for Word editor and other productivity apps, just like how ChatGPT is a synonym for AI.\n\nWith this rebranding, the two-decade-long legacy of Office is gone now, and we have a new name, \u201cMicrosoft 365 Copilot,\u201d which doesn\u2019t even make sense. Instead of rebranding stuff, Microsoft could have followed Google\u2019s approach and integrated AI into Office without turning Office into an AI product.\n\nWhat do you think about this rebranding? Let us know in the comments below."

            "article_content": "Azerbaijan is positioning itself at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) driven energy innovation, strongly focusing on integrating AI into its energy sector to improve efficiency, sustainability and grid optimization.\n\nAmid global climate goals and commitments made at the 2024 UN Climate Conference (COP29), the country is exploring key AI applications to enhance renewable energy adoption, optimize energy consumption and promote decarbonization. As well as opportunities, however, key challenges remain. Azerbaijan\u2019s energy innovation potential Azerbaijan\u2019s energy sector holds significant potential for innovation, driven by the strategic opportunities identified in a local stakeholder assessment run by the World Economic Forum\u2019s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) Azerbaijan. Support Unhyphenated Journalism Quality journalism you can trust, with exceptional ground reporting that gives you access to the story behind the story. Contribute Now Show Full Article\n\nOne of the key opportunities includes leveraging AI to optimize energy production and distribution, improving data management and infrastructure, and enhancing energy efficiency through smart grid technologies.\n\nCollaboration between public and private sectors and partnerships with research institutions can accelerate AI integration, fostering a more sustainable and efficient energy future for Azerbaijan. Additionally, the country\u2019s growing focus on renewable energy sources presents further avenues for AI-driven advancement.\n\nAzerbaijan could position itself as a regional leader in green energy export to Europe through cables under the Black Sea. For instance, the renewable energy company Masdar has developed the 230-megawatt-capacity Garadagh solar power plant in Azerbaijan. It has signed agreements to build a further 1 gigawatt of clean energy projects in the country.\n\nAzerbaijan benefits from favourable wind and sunlight conditions, offering significant potential for developing and deploying wind and solar energy solutions.\n\nGlobal innovations, local applications\n\nThe AI in Energy project, an initiative with C4IR Azerbaijan, has identified several promising use cases for AI technologies within Azerbaijan\u2019s energy sector. These include:\n\nOptimizing energy consumption through AI models\n\nEnhancing predictive maintenance for infrastructure\n\nImproving energy efficiency via AI-driven demand forecasting\n\nCOP29 and subsequent climate summits are pivotal in driving this process forward.\n\nTo effectively localize global solutions, these platforms allow Azerbaijan to showcase its AI-driven energy solutions, align with international sustainability goals and attract investment to accelerate green technology adoption and energy sector practices.\n\nDuring COP29, C4IR Azerbaijan hosted two side events on energy and sustainability. Through the centre\u2019s work, these events showcased the potential of globally applied solutions for local impact and offered valuable insights into the initiative and its implications for sustainable energy solutions.\n\nPlans are in place to pilot and test these innovations through multistakeholder collaboration, engaging public and private sector entities, universities and research institutions. The goal is to create scalable, locally applicable solutions that can serve as regional and global adoption models.\n\nAddressing challenges to AI adoption\n\nThe Azerbaijani energy industry is aware of barriers to realizing AI\u2019s full potential. Addressing the following shortcomings could help transform the energy landscape.\n\nCloud solutions and effective data sharing\n\nData availability and quality, hinging on strong data governance, regulation for cloud usage and accessibility\n\nRobust legislation and infrastructure to support AI development\n\nWithin this context, with the World Economic Forum\u2019s global AI Energy Impact Initiative, C4IR Azerbaijan has shortlisted several global solutions, which could be adapted as pilot projects and localized to the country context with scalability potential. One shortlisted project involves an AI-powered energy efficiency pilot for buildings in collaboration with BrainBox, which was found to reduce energy consumption by 30%, improve carbon emissions by 25-30% and deliver a 30% return on investment.\n\nAnother planned initiative is a renewable energy pilot leveraging the use case of Vestas\u2019 predictive maintenance solution for wind turbines, aiming to replicate its proven benefits, which include reliability, optimized maintenance processes and significantly enhancing the efficiency of renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nThe selected pilots will feed into broader national and global ambitions on energy sustainability, several of which were identified during COP29:\n\nRealistically, meeting these pledges will require leveraging existing and emerging technologies, including AI.\n\nFor instance, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said that energy and climate goals \u2013 including tripling global renewable power capacity this decade while strengthening energy security \u2013 require countries to rapidly increase energy storage and expand and upgrade their electricity grids.\n\nAchieving this goal requires scaling up generation and overcoming the challenges associated with integrating renewables into the grids, said Francesco La Camera, director general of the International Renewable Energy Agency.\n\nNet-zero carbon cities\n\nIn addition to the AI in Energy project, C4IR Azerbaijan has joined the Net Zero Carbon Cities programme of the World Economic Forum, focusing on urban development, sustainability and energy efficiency.\n\nThese initiatives are now integrated into a cohesive strategy to advance energy innovation and sustainable urban transformation, leveraging AI technologies to help decarbonize urban energy systems, optimize energy usage and enhance sustainability across city infrastructure.\n\nInterviews with key local stakeholders from the public and private sectors have been conducted to identify existing challenges, potential opportunities and actionable pathways for implementation.\n\nThese insights, plus outcomes from the Net Zero Carbon Cities initiative, will guide pilot implementations, with testing already underway through workshops. The Baku City Sprints, for instance, held in October 2024, brought key stakeholders from the public and private sectors together toward workably solving the urban challenges for Baku City, exploring innovative solutions and showing ways in which energy efficiency and sustainability could be advanced.\n\nThe key workshop phases included:\n\nOpportunity assessment\n\nSolution prioritization\n\nActions to take\n\nBy the end, stakeholders validated city profiles, prioritized solutions and developed actionable plans tailored to the city\u2019s context.\n\nOnce executed, the AI-powered solutions developed through the Net Zero Carbon Cities initiative will be added to the Net Zero Carbon Cities Solution Toolbox.\n\nThe initiative can provide valuable lessons for other countries to use AI for sustainability. It has enhanced Azerbaijan\u2019s local expertise in AI applications for energy and urban sustainability, filling knowledge gaps, fostering collaboration between diverse stakeholders and creating new opportunities for innovation.\n\nAzerbaijan is making strides in navigating the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven energy innovation to meet critical sustainability goals. Through national and global cross-sector collaboration and localized knowledge, it has created impactful solutions that advance energy transformation and decarbonization.

            "article_content": "Once self-described as a \u201crock journalist,\u201d Furek morphed into a paranormal author with his books \u201cCoal Region Hoodoo,\u201d \u201cFlying Saucer Esoteric,\u201d and his latest, \u201cTribes of Bigfoot,\u201d which is out now.\n\nMaxim Furek said his venture into the paranormal wasn\u2019t planned.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Sheppton Mythology\u2019 was published in 2016 and made the connection between The Buoys, \u2018Timothy\u2019 and the 1963 Sheppton mining disaster. I never went looking for the paranormal, it found me,\u201d he said.\n\nJust as his fascination with the Buoys and Timothy \u2014 he was the founder and publisher on the rock magazine Timothy which later became Pennsylvania Musician \u2014 led to the paranormal aspects of the Sheppton book \u201cCoal Region Hoodoo\u201d which led him to Bigfoot. The Bigfoot book evolved from two chapters in his \u201cCoal Region Hoodoo\u201d book.\n\nFurek, who splits his time between his hometown Mocanaqua and Hernando, Florida, said his Bigfoot research has struck a nerve within the believers\u2019 community.\n\nChapters in Coal Region Hoodoo \u2014\u201dThe Bigfoot Enigma\u201d and \u201cThe Bigfoot Hypothesis\u201d \u2014opened a few doors for him.\n\nHe was interviewed on Art Bell\u2019s \u201cMidnight in the Desert\u201d radio show and by George Noory on the \u201cCoast to Coast\u201d radio show which airs on over 600 affiliates and is considered the top paranormal show in the country by many in the paranormal community. York County\u2019s Fox TV 43 chose Coal Region Hoodoo as the Book of the Month in October 2023.\n\nThis year, interest in his paranormal research isn\u2019t slowing down. He\u2019s been invited for the second time to the the Central Pennsylvania Bigfoot and Cryptid Festival and conferences in Baltimore and Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s like an extended family. Everybody knows everybody else,\u201d he said of the paranormal community.\n\nIn 23 chapters over 197 pages, \u201cThe Lost Tribes of Bigfoot\u201d explores all the well-known Bigfoot sightings from the origin story to Chestnut Ridge, an area in the Laurel Highlands in Western Pennsylvania known as a hotbed for sightings. He also writes about hoaxes including The Piltdown Man and The Minnesota Iceman. He devotes a couple chapters to the hoaxers, a pet peeve.\n\nAsked why it was important for him to call out the hoaxers, he said, \u201cThey damage the reputation of legitimate paranormal research and need to be called out.\u201d\n\nAsked about interviewing Bigfoot witnesses, he said, \u201cOne guy from western Pennsylvania claimed that he has PTSD from seeing a Bigfoot at 15 feet. A neighbor of mine saw two Bigfoot creatures outside of Mocanaqua. I questioned him about it several times and all his responses seemed credible. An elderly guy from Catawissa told a police officer that he wasn\u2019t scared when he saw a Bigfoot because the creature had \u2018kind eyes.\u2019 The stories have a commonality, but they are all unique. Remember, too, that about three percent of anomalous sightings remain unexplained. People are seeing things.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s his own take on Bigfoot\u2019s existence? \u201cI\u2019m not a true believer or zealot. I\u2019m just fascinated with paranormal themes and looking for answers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only theory that makes sense is that an interdimensional pathway may link our reality to somewhere else. It\u2019s a theory explored by Einstein, Tesla, and others and may provide the key to understanding the universe\u2019s secrets.\u201d\n\nThe book is available in paperback and digital versions at amazon.com., hanger1publishing.com, and maximfurek.com."

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "A breakthrough discovery, the coins are worth around \u00a3258,000.\n\nThe discovery, made near the village of Holzthum in northern Luxembourg, includes 141 gold solidi, coins minted under the rule of nine Roman emperors between 364 and 408 AD. Found near the base of a burgus\u2014a fortified Roman watchtower used for military observation\u2014the coins are believed to have belonged to high-ranking military officers. \u201cThis is a major archaeological discovery, as it is extremely rare to study an intact ancient monetary deposit within its original archaeological context,\u201d announced Luxembourg's National Institute for Archaeological Research (INRA). The hoard\u2019s sheer size and exceptional condition have stunned researchers. Each solidus weighs around 4.5 grams of nearly pure gold, amounting to over 6 kilograms. Rebecca Usherwood, an Assistant Professor in Late Antique and Early Byzantine Studies at Trinity College Dublin, described the discovery as extraordinary.\n\nA Gallo-Roman site located in Echternach, Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cThis represents a huge amount of personal wealth for the individual or group who collected these coins,\u201d said Prof Usherwood. \u201cMost people in the Roman Empire would rarely, if ever, have seen a single gold coin. To find this many indicates the owner was of considerable social standing, likely a military officer rather than a common soldier.\u201d The coins, which were typically used for imperial gifts or military payments, are thought to reflect the site's strategic importance. The area where the hoard was found marked the edge of the Roman Empire, an area heavily fortified against external threats. Among the most notable coins are three bearing the image of Emperor Eugenius, who ruled for just two tumultuous years (392\u2013394 AD). Eugenius, supported by the Western Roman general Arbogast, attempted to revive pagan traditions but was defeated by the Christian Eastern Emperor Theodosius I at the Battle of Frigidus in 394 AD. Coins from Eugenius\u2019 brief reign are particularly rare, adding to the significance of the find. The solidi were uncovered during a series of excavations conducted between 2020 and 2024. Luxembourg\u2019s Army Mine Action Service was involved due to nearby unexploded ordnance from World War II. The discovery was kept secret for nearly four years to protect the site and its findings. Luxembourg law stipulates that the treasure\u2019s estimated value of $322,000 (\u00a3257,919) belongs to those with legal claims to the land.\n\nJust two of the hoard of Roman coins discovered.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Operator can act independently from you on your computer using a web browser doing pretty much anything that can be done in a web browser.\n\nSo, it can perform tasks like booking a restaurant table or buying groceries. You just tell it what you want it to do, and off it goes like a faithful Internet-enabled butler that potters away until the task is complete or it needs to come back to you with a question. Say, there\u2019s no table available at 7.00pm, would Sir or Madam mind a 7.45pm table instead?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Operator doesn\u2019t call you Sir or Madam, but it might as well. For all intents and purposes, this is the Internet butler that we were promised almost 30 years ago when Ask Jeeves was around.\n\nDo you remember Ask Jeeves? It was a search engine from 1997 that had an image of an actual butler who stood ready and willing to find things for you online. The character was named after Jeeves, Bertie Wooster's valet in the fictional works of P. G. Wodehouse. Instead of typing in search terms, Ask Jeeves encouraged you to search for things using natural language questions, like \u201cFind me the perfect accompaniment to a roast dinner.\u201d\n\nOf course, we all know that Google won the search engine war, and in 2006, Ask dropped the Jeeves persona and just became Ask.com. But somehow, we\u2019ve come full circle with AI, and thanks to technologies like ChatGPT search and Perplexity, searching using natural language requests is back in fashion. As our Internet butlers, except now we call them AI agents...\n\nThe Ask Jeeves search engine.\n\nAGI is the real goal\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Sam Altman and OpenAI are really interested in AGI, artificial general intelligence, also often referred to as superintelligence. This is the ultimate goal for OpenAI, and why it was founded. Chatbots like ChatGPT might have taken the world by storm, but their popularity is almost like an unintended consequence (a theme I\u2019ll return to later) of the race toward AGI.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a video to promote the release of Operator, one of the OpenAI employees sitting next to Sam Altman comes right out and says, [Operator is] \"about removing one more bottleneck in our path to AGI.\u201d\n\nWhile agents are clearly exciting, they\u2019re not the destination for OpenAI; they\u2019re just one more step along the path. AGI has the potential to change our world radically. Once we have created an artificial intelligence that\u2019s smarter than we are, logically it should be able to construct even smarter versions of itself, and the level of intelligence rises rapidly.\n\nWe\u2019ve just got to hope that it doesn\u2019t decide to wipe us out. Not to worry you, but Geoffory Hinton, often referred to as the \u2018Godfather of AI,\u2019 recently upped his odds of technology wiping out humanity to 20%.\n\nOpenAI's Operator in action. | Credit: OpenAI\n\nAnd this is where we return to the theme of unintended consequences. Many experts see AI agents as a threat. While speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, artificial intelligence pioneer Yoshua Bengio warned that AI agents could be catastrophic for humanity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, he said, \"All of the catastrophic scenarios with AGI or superintelligence happen if we have agents.\" Bengio would rather we continue towards building AGI without using agents, which allows them to do things autonomously. \"All of the AI for science and medicine, all the things people care about, is not agentic,\" Bengio said. \"And we can continue building more powerful systems that are non-agentic.\"\n\nHumanity's downfall\n\nSo, could it really be that something designed to act like an Internet butler and do menial tasks like help me buy my groceries accidentally gives AI the power to take over the world?\n\nFor now, it\u2019s hard to imagine how an automated program that slowly plods through the process of booking me a table at a restaurant using a web browser is going to end in humanity's downfall, but AI agents will live or die by one thing - if people actually use them \u2013 and I\u2019m not entirely convinced they will.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t feel ready to hand over my credit card details to a computer program that will buy things for me to save me time because I\u2019m just not sure I\u2019m ever going to trust it not to make a mistake. Would you?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps OpenAI needs to give its Operator a more human face if it wants me to trust it, and as it turns out, I believe that good old Jeeves might be looking for a job these days..."

Rajagopalachari to the first President of independent India Dr Rajendra Prasad; the President's oath-taking, and the ceremonial lowering of the Governor-General\u2019s flag and hoisting of the President\u2019s flag. The day's festivities culminated in a grand parade at New Delhi's Irwin Stadium, featuring military units, a fly-past, and the announcement of new military awards, symbolizing the birth of the Indian Republic."

Found near the base of a burgus\u2014a fortified Roman watchtower used for military observation\u2014the coins are believed to have belonged to high-ranking military officers. \u201cThis is a major archaeological discovery, as it is extremely rare to study an intact ancient monetary deposit within its original archaeological context,\u201d announced Luxembourg's National Institute for Archaeological Research (INRA). The hoard\u2019s sheer size and exceptional condition have stunned researchers. Each solidus weighs around 4.5 grams of nearly pure gold, amounting to over 6 kilograms. Rebecca Usherwood, an Assistant Professor in Late Antique and Early Byzantine Studies at Trinity College Dublin, described the discovery as extraordinary.\n\nA Gallo-Roman site located in Echternach, Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cThis represents a huge amount of personal wealth for the individual or group who collected these coins,\u201d said Prof Usherwood. \u201cMost people in the Roman Empire would rarely, if ever, have seen a single gold coin. To find this many indicates the owner was of considerable social standing, likely a military officer rather than a common soldier.\u201d The coins, which were typically used for imperial gifts or military payments, are thought to reflect the site's strategic importance. The area where the hoard was found marked the edge of the Roman Empire, an area heavily fortified against external threats. Among the most notable coins are three bearing the image of Emperor Eugenius, who ruled for just two tumultuous years (392\u2013394 AD). Eugenius, supported by the Western Roman general Arbogast, attempted to revive pagan traditions but was defeated by the Christian Eastern Emperor Theodosius I at the Battle of Frigidus in 394 AD. Coins from Eugenius\u2019 brief reign are particularly rare, adding to the significance of the find. The solidi were uncovered during a series of excavations conducted between 2020 and 2024. Luxembourg\u2019s Army Mine Action Service was involved due to nearby unexploded ordnance from World War II. The discovery was kept secret for nearly four years to protect the site and its findings. Luxembourg law stipulates that the treasure\u2019s estimated value of $322,000 (\u00a3257,919) belongs to those with legal claims to the land.\n\nJust two of the hoard of Roman coins discovered.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "For the first time, researchers have measured the shape of an electron as it moves through a solid. This achievement could open a new way of looking at how electrons behave inside different materials.\n\nTheir discovery highlights many effects that could be relevant to everything from quantum information science to electronics manufacturing.\n\nThose findings come from a team led by physicist Riccardo Comin, MIT\u2019s Class of 1947 Career Development Associate Professor of Physics and leader of the work, in collaboration with other institutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn\u2019t be obtained before,\u201d says Comin. His colleague and co-author, Mingu Kang, performed much of this research at MIT before continuing at Cornell University.\n\nNew angles on electron shape\n\nPhysicists have examined electrons for decades, but the wave-like aspect of these particles brings extra complexity. Electrons can be described not just as small points, but also as \u201cwave functions.\u201d\n\nThese wave functions look like shapes or surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces. Sometimes these shapes are relatively simple. Other times, they\u2019re tangled and tricky to measure.\n\nBy using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, or ARPES, the team recorded details about how electrons behaved as light hit them.\n\nARPES helped them pin down a previously elusive property of electrons that holds the key to better understanding their geometry.\n\nWhy electron shape matters\n\nIn usual settings, we talk about an electron\u2019s energy or velocity. Those are familiar concepts. Geometry, on the other hand, points to the patterns or forms that electron waves can take when arranged in a solid.\n\nQuantum geometry affects how these particles interact, pair up, and even give rise to unusual behaviors. One example is superconductivity, where electrons zip along a material without resistance.\n\nAnother is when electrons form orderly patterns, a bit like a collection of synchronized dancers. Observing geometry could help scientists design new materials with novel electronic traits.\n\nThe kagome connection\n\nThe team measured this geometric effect in a class of materials called kagome metals. Kagome metals are named for a repeating pattern of atoms that resembles a series of interlocking triangles. This lattice structure can influence how electrons navigate and share energy.\n\nPhysicists have long found kagome metals interesting because they host special behaviors that aren\u2019t common in many other materials.\n\nObserving the geometry inside them could explain why electrons in these metals sometimes align in peculiar ways that set off advanced superconductivity or other strange effects.\n\nARPES and quantum shapes\n\nDuring ARPES experiments, researchers shine a beam of photons on a crystal. The light pushes electrons out of the material, allowing scientists to measure those electrons\u2019 angles and spins.\n\nBy gathering that data, they reconstruct how electrons inside the crystal are moving and what shapes they form.\n\nThis method is demanding because it requires intricate equipment and specialized facilities. Yet it gives a unique window into what happens on distances smaller than a billionth of an inch.\n\nApplications and potential benefits\n\nA precise measurement of quantum geometry can lead to progress in areas that rely on electron control. Quantum computing, for instance, depends on maintaining stable electronic states while performing computations.\n\nResearchers want materials that can reliably keep these states without unwanted disruptions. If scientists understand and possibly design the geometry of electrons, they might improve superconductors or even develop electronic devices that lose very little energy through heat.\n\nWith energy efficiency becoming ever more critical, there\u2019s real value in controlling electron flow on such tiny scales.\n\nInsights from global teamwork\n\nThis study was a partnership among institutions spanning different parts of the world. Collaborators brought together theoretical and experimental backgrounds.\n\nTheir collective expertise made it possible to design, synthesize, and measure the electronic structure of a kagome metal.\n\nThe pandemic forced some members to work remotely, but it also enabled other team members to take on new roles in labs that were partially shut down.\n\nThat unexpected shift helped push the work forward and demonstrated how closely linked theory and experiment must be when tackling high-precision measurements.\n\nOne electron shape, many possibilities\n\nQuantum geometry is far richer than standard geometry we learn in everyday math. The shape of an electron\u2019s wave function isn\u2019t like a typical circle or a neat sphere. It can take on forms that twist and loop in higher dimensions.\n\nObserving that shape in a real material confirms predictions that theorists have pursued for a long time. It means those theoretical constructs describing wave functions have real, measurable consequences.\n\nAnd now, there is a proven route to measure them, so future studies might target exotic materials that exhibit other patterns or new behaviors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nScientists plan to refine techniques like ARPES and adapt them to explore a range of materials. They hope to see how quantum geometry influences conductivity, magnetism, and other conditions that matter for practical applications.\n\nPhysicists also see promise in discovering how manipulating geometry might encourage electrons to swap their usual habits for more synchronized, cooperative behavior.\n\nThat synchronization is important for technologies that rely on controlling multiple electrons at once, such as quantum sensors or memory elements.\n\nExperts say these findings will likely inspire more ambitious experiments to uncover aspects of quantum geometry we haven\u2019t been able to measure before.\n\nWith each new result, materials researchers step closer to engineering designs for the electronic components of tomorrow. The electron might be tiny, but it\u2019s revealing secrets about shaping the future of technology.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Physics.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "More startups shut down in 2024 than the year prior, according to multiple sources, and that\u2019s not really a surprise considering the insane number of companies that were funded in the crazy days of 2020 and 2021.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re not nearly done, and 2025 could be another brutal year of startups shutting down.\n\nTechCrunch gathered data from several sources and found similar trends. In 2024, 966 startups shut down, compared to 769 in 2023, according to Carta. That\u2019s a 25.6% increase. One note on methodology: Those numbers are for U.S.-based companies that were Carta customers and left Carta due to bankruptcy or dissolution. There are likely other shutdowns that wouldn\u2019t be accounted for through Carta, estimates Peter Walker, Carta\u2019s head of insights.\n\n\u201cYes, shutdowns increased from 2023 to 2024 in every stage. But there were more companies funded (with bigger rounds) in 2020 and 2021. So we would expect shutdowns to increase just by nature of VC naturally,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, Walker admitted that it\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d to estimate exactly how many more shutdowns there were, or will be.\n\n\u201cI bet we\u2019re missing a good chunk,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThere are a number of companies who leave Carta without telling us why they left.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, AngelList found that 2024 saw 364 startup winddowns, compared to 233 in 2023. That\u2019s a 56.2% jump. However, AngelList CEO Avlok Kohli has a fairly optimistic take, noting that winddowns \u201care still very low relative to the number of companies that were funded across both years.\u201d\n\nLayoffs.fyi found a contradicting trend: 85 tech companies shut down in 2024, compared to 109 in 2023 and 58 in 2022. But as founder Roger Lee acknowledges, that data only includes publicly reported shutdowns \u201cand therefore represents an underestimate.\u201d Of those 2024 tech shutdowns, 81% were startups, while the rest were either public companies or previously acquired companies that were later shut down by their parent organizations.\n\nVCs didn\u2019t pick \u201cwinners\u201d\n\nSo many companies got funded in 2020 and 2021 at heated valuations with famously thin diligence, that it\u2019s only logical that up to three years later, an increasing number couldn\u2019t raise more cash to fund their operations. Taking investment at too high of a valuation increases the risk such that investors won\u2019t want to invest more unless business is growing extremely well.\n\n\u201cThe working hypothesis is that VCs as an asset class did not get better at picking winners in 2021. In fact, the hit rate may end up being worse that year since everything was so frenzied,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd if the hit rate on good companies remains flat and we fund a lot more companies, then you should expect many more shutdowns after a few years. And that\u2019s where we are in 2024.\u201d\n\nDori Yona, CEO and co-founder of SimpleClosure, a startup that aims to automate the shutdown process, believes that in 2021, we saw a large number of startups receiving seed funding \u201cprobably before they were ready.\u201d\n\nMerely getting that money may have set them up for failure, Yona explained.\n\n\u201cThe rapid capital infusion sometimes encouraged high burn rates and growth-at-all-costs mentalities, leading to sustainability challenges as markets shifted post-pandemic,\u201d he noted. As such, \u201cin recent years, many high-profile companies ceased operations despite significant funding and early promise.\u201d\n\nThe primary impetus behind the shutdowns is an obvious one.\n\n\u201cRunning out of cash is typically the proximate cause,\u201d Walker surmises. \u201cBut the underlying reasons are likely some combination of lack of product-market fit, lack of ability to get to cash-flow positive, and overvaluation leading to an inability to continue fundraising.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Walker also expects we\u2019ll continue to see more shutdowns in the first half of 2025, and then a gradual decline for the rest of the year.\n\nThat projection is based mostly on a time-lag estimate from the peak of funding, which he estimates was the first quarter of 2022 in most stages. So by the first quarter of 2025, \u201cmost companies will have either found a new path forward or had to make this difficult choice.\u201d\n\nAngelList\u2019s Kohli agrees. \u201cThey\u2019re not all washed out,\u201d he said of the startups funded at unreasonably high valuations during those heady days. \u201cNot even close.\u201d\n\nAlready this year, we\u2019ve seen Pandion, a Washington-based delivery startup, announce it was shutting down. The company was founded during the pandemic and had raised about $125 million in equity over the last five years. And in December, proptech EasyKnock abruptly shut down. EasyKnock, a startup that billed itself as the first tech-enabled residential sale-leaseback provider, was founded in 2016 and had raised $455 million in funding from backers.\n\nStartups dying across industries, stages\n\nThe types of companies impacted last year were across a range of industries, and stages.\n\nCarta\u2019s data points to enterprise SaaS companies taking the biggest hit \u2014 making up 32% of shutdowns. Consumer followed at 11%; health tech at 9%; fintech at 8%, and biotech at 7%.\n\n\u201cThose percentages align pretty well with the initial funding to those sectors,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd essentially what this says is that every startup sector has seen shutdowns and none vastly outperformed, which gives support to the theory that the main cause of the increase is macro-economic, i.e. interest rate changes and the lack of available venture funding in 2023 and 2024.\u201d\n\nLayoffs.fyi\u2019s much smaller subset found that finance accounted for 15% of the shutdowns with food (12%) and healthcare (11%) coming in second and third.\n\nWhen it comes to stage, SimpleClosure\u2019s data found that 74% of all shutdowns since 2023 are either pre-seed or seed, with the plurality (41%) at the seed stage.\n\nMost startups tend to shut down when the coffers are completely dry, though some see the writing on the wall early enough to give a bit back to their investors.\n\n\u201cThe majority of startups (60%) that fail don\u2019t have enough capital left to return to investors,\u201d Yona said. \u201cFounders that do plan on returning funds have an average $630,000 of investments left \u2014 about 10% of total capital raised, on average.\u201d\n\nYona also predicts the rate of startup closures will not slow down anytime soon.\n\n\u201cTech zombies and a startup graveyard will continue to make headlines,\u201d Yona said. \u201cDespite the crop of new investments, there are a lot of companies that have raised at high valuations and without enough revenue.\u201d"

I\u2019m losing faith, and I\u2019m not alone AMD could still make the RX 9070 XT a success\n\nIt looks like I may have played myself again. I was genuinely excited about AMD\u2019s RX 9070 XT, but now, I\u2019m starting to worry about its future. I always knew that the new AMD flagship wouldn\u2019t be able to compete against some of Nvidia\u2019s best graphics cards, but I had a lot of hope that it\u2019d still be a great competitor for a number of other reasons.\n\nI\u2019m not doubting the performance of the RX 9070 XT. I have no reason to, as we don\u2019t know a thing about it \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m worried. Not only are the GPUs still a complete mystery, but they\u2019ve also reportedly been delayed. At this rate, I fear that AMD may have lost the war before it even started, and I\u2019m not alone.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with RDNA 4?\n\nI felt pretty excited for the RX 9070 XT, but so far, the launch of RDNA 4 has been a harsh lesson in managing your expectations.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nFirst, the GPUs barely got a mention during AMD\u2019s 45-minute-long CES 2025 keynote. Then, the few slides that AMD released to the press offered very little information; we basically only learned a little bit about the RDNA 4 architecture and AMD\u2019s performance goals. The information was vague, too \u2014 think \u201cimproved ray tracing performance\u201d and the like.\n\nThe GPUs themselves were spotted at CES, but only those made by AMD\u2019s partners, and they didn\u2019t come with any specifications. So, at this stage, it\u2019s been revealed that the RX 9070 XT comes with three fans in its Gigabyte design. That\u2019s\u2026 not a lot.\n\nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s hope, or so I thought. AMD told Digital Trends that RDNA 4 would be released \u201cin a matter of weeks,\u201d and that the company thought that the new RX 9000 series deserved its own event. But only silence has followed.\n\nThe first update came not from AMD itself, but from B&H. The retailer put the RX 9070 XT up for sale with a January 22 preorder date. The cards had been taken down, but then they reappeared with a release date of March 22. Finally, this tracks.\n\nRadeon 9000 series hardware and software are looking great and we are planning to have a wide assortment of cards available globally. Can\u2019t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March! \u2014 David McAfee (@McAfeeDavid_AMD) January 20, 2025\n\nDavid McAfee, AMD\u2019s vice president and general manager of the Ryzen CPU and Radeon graphics division, revealed on X (Twitter) that the cards will go on sale in March. McAfee later added that AMD is holding onto the GPUs a little while longer in order to optimize their software stack, including FSR 4.\n\nMeanwhile, various leakers and tipsters are having a field day with AMD\u2019s troubled RDNA 4 launch. Recent whispers point to AMD still holding off to see how Nvidia fares. At this rate, AMD will likely get to see the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5070 in their full glory before it launches the RX 9070 XT.\n\nAMD wanted to announce its new graphics cards alongside Nvidia, but it clearly didn\u2019t have a solid plan for actually releasing them. Now, we\u2019ve had to cobble together various ideas about the cards from leaks, board partners, and social media posts, which doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of confidence.\n\nI\u2019m losing faith, and I\u2019m not alone\n\nAs soon as I saw David McAfee announce that RDNA 4 wouldn\u2019t be here until March, I knew what was coming \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t wrong. PC gaming enthusiasts, including both AMD and Nvidia fans, weren\u2019t happy with the way it\u2019s all gone down.\n\nScrolling through the hundreds of comments under McAfee\u2019s post reveals just how badly the general public wants to know what\u2019s going on.\n\nNot even, a proper announcement with slides of performance, features. Could be even \"price will be reveled at, a later date\". This is so bad PR\u2026 i have no words. \u2014 Tomasz Gawro\u0144ski (@GawroskiT) January 20, 2025\n\nSitting at over 500 likes, a comment from GawroskiT on X makes a dig at AMD\u2019s PR team. \u201cNot even a proper announcement. [\u2026] This is [such] bad PR. I have no words.\u201d\n\nAnother user, PlaysRingle, promises to ditch AMD for Nvidia based on how things are going. \u201cAMD is going to make me upgrade my RX 7900 XTX to an RTX 5080. I can\u2019t keep defending AMD when it keeps doing these things.\u201d\n\nI know that I\u2019m being fairly critical of AMD here myself, but I can\u2019t help feeling bad when reading these comments and seeing the reactions. Some of it is really quite harsh, such as this comment from noremac258: \u201cDoes AMD ever not fail to capitalize on an opportunity? [\u2026] AMD\u2019s graphics division is a disaster.\u201d\n\nWhat ARE you guys doing? What sort of \"marketing\" is this \"stealth\" reveal??? Your CES presence was so uninformative you'd have been better off not showing up at all, and all we get since then is THIS? \u2014 DGBurns (@davidgburns) January 21, 2025\n\nI tried to find more supportive comments, but there are very few of those to be found. However, Hardware Unboxed made a separate post defending AMD, which is what prompted McAfee to clarify that the delayed launch comes down to software optimization.\n\nAMD delaying the launch of RDNA4 to March is the right move. The last thing they want is stuffing up the launch yet again, which they risk doing if they launch before Nvidia. And very few people would have bought a 9070 XT just because it launched a week or two before the 5070.\u2026 \u2014 Hardware Unboxed (@HardwareUnboxed) January 20, 2025\n\nI know that X is a tough crowd, so I decided to check Reddit for more reactions. Long story short \u2014 it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nThe comments under this post, sharing that RDNA 4 won\u2019t arrive until March, are still harsh. One commenter said: \u201cNvidia\u2019s release was looking rather underwhelming, so AMD had to pull out all the stops to make sure they miss the opportunity this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perceive this as having no confidence in your own product. [AMD] had the opportunity here to seize this midrange market segment by coming out first,\u201d said another user, pointing out that waiting for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 might backfire.\n\nIn search of people who are more in favor of AMD than Nvidia, I ventured into the r/AMD community. This post quickly showed me that people aren\u2019t willing to cut AMD any slack.\n\nOther than the top comment thread pictured above, all the other highly-rated comments criticize AMD. \u201cAbsolute incompetence from AMD\u2019s GPU division, again,\u201d says one poster. \u201cDoesn\u2019t a significant amount of retailers already have the cards in stock? What a fumble,\u201d adds another.\n\nI could go on, but you get the gist. It\u2019s clear that people aren\u2019t pleased, and while the internet at large is hardly ever satisfied, some of this might\u2019ve been avoided if AMD had been more forthcoming about the RX 9000 series. People are frustrated with the delay, but also with the lack of information.\n\nAMD could still make the RX 9070 XT a success\n\nThings are looking a little bleak for RDNA 4 right now, but the internet is quick to forget. It\u2019s still entirely possible for AMD to turn this around and make the launch of the RX 9000 series a success.\n\nMy opinion is that sharing some information would be better than sharing next to none; even a basic spec sheet would go a long way. Although McAfee plays a key role in AMD\u2019s GPU strategy, most fans don\u2019t check his X account on a daily basis. Those people are either kept in the dark or they\u2019re left to rely on third parties to tell them what\u2019s going on.\n\nLetting the general public figure out AMD\u2019s plans based on social media means that a lot of people who might have otherwise been happy to wait will now be influenced by people who are decidedly not happy. If there are hundreds of comments all saying that AMD is doing a bad job, it\u2019s easy to start believing it yourself if you don\u2019t have anyone telling you otherwise.\n\nUnfortunately, right now, AMD is really not doing much to dispel that notion. A quick X post, even when coming from an AMD executive, doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nAside from some marketing efforts to drive up the hype, I think it\u2019s now more important than ever for AMD to lean into that performance-per-dollar metric that makes GPUs like Intel\u2019s Arc B580 such a great deal. The fact is that the RX 9070 XT might still be an exceptional GPU even if it won\u2019t be able to beat all of its Nvidia rivals.\n\nMost people won\u2019t be spending $2,000 (or more) on an RTX 5090. The GPU market needs graphics cards that provide value while being able to run the latest games, and to that end, AMD\u2019s usually done a pretty good job. Strangely enough, some of its best GPUs are the ones that didn\u2019t get a lot of love from the marketing department, such as the RX 7900 GRE \u2014 but that\u2019s no reason for the RX 9070 XT to also be launched with so little fanfare.\n\nIn the consumer graphics market, AMD is a small fish; Nvidia is a massive shark. Following a troubled launch, AMD may therefore now face an uphill climb with the RX 9070 XT \u2014 but I\u2019m still hopeful.\n\nIf AMD gets the pricing right, the RX 9070 XT might still turn out to be an amazing card. On the other hand, if it\u2019s too expensive when compared to its Nvidia rivals, it might end up being overlooked regardless of AMD\u2019s marketing efforts. And let\u2019s hope that those efforts actually begin soon, because so far, Nvidia\u2019s winning the battle \u2014 but AMD could still walk away unscathed from the war."

            "article_content": "Demystifying Artificial Intelligence in Data Pipelines\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to integrate into various sectors, its capabilities in automating complex processes and driving innovation are unmatched. However, one of the challenges that come with AI is its \u201cblack box\u201d nature, wherein the inner workings of machine learning models remain opaque, even to those deploying them. This issue is especially critical in fields like data engineering, where large-scale pipelines manage massive amounts of data that fuel these AI models.\n\nDr. Mohan Raja Pulicharla addresses this concern in his recent study titled \u201cExplainable AI in the Context of Data Engineering: Unveiling the Black Box in the Pipeline.\u201d His research emphasizes the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) in ensuring transparency and trust in machine learning models, particularly within the intricate frameworks of data pipelines.\n\nExplainable AI: Enhancing Transparency in AI Systems\n\nExplainable AI (XAI) refers to a set of methods and techniques that allow human users to understand how AI systems make decisions. In the context of data engineering, where data must flow seamlessly through various stages of collection, transformation, and analysis, XAI has a significant role to play.\n\nDr. Pulicharla\u2019s research highlights how traditional AI systems, while effective, often lack transparency. Engineers, decision-makers, and even end-users find it difficult to comprehend why a model arrived at a specific conclusion. This is particularly problematic when AI is used in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, or governance, where decisions can have significant consequences. Without insight into these decisions, AI systems can remain underutilized or mistrusted.\n\nBy implementing XAI within data pipelines, engineers can inspect models at various stages of processing. XAI offers a way to verify their accuracy, fairness, and reliability, leading to more informed and confident decision-making.\n\nAI in Data Engineering: Bridging the Gap Between Models and Data\n\nData engineering involves designing, building, and managing the data infrastructure required for analysis and decision-making in AI systems. As data moves through the various stages of a pipeline\u2014whether it\u2019s being ingested, transformed, or analyzed\u2014AI models are often applied to make sense of that data. Dr. Pulicharla\u2019s research illustrates that these models are only as effective as the transparency they offer.\n\nBy integrating XAI into data pipelines, the study focuses on demystifying how machine learning models handle data at each stage. For instance, an AI model used to predict customer behavior may process raw transactional data, apply a series of transformations, and eventually make a prediction. XAI can help engineers and analysts track how the model arrives at its conclusion, ensuring the results are both explainable and reliable.\n\nDr. Pulicharla emphasizes that XAI can help identify potential biases or inconsistencies in models that may otherwise go unnoticed. Given that data engineering pipelines often handle sensitive data, such as personal information or financial records, explainability is crucial to maintaining ethical AI practices.\n\nThe Practicality of XAI in Data Pipelines\n\nOne of the key takeaways from Dr. Pulicharla\u2019s research is the practicality of implementing XAI in real-world data pipelines. While XAI is often discussed in theoretical terms, his study delves into the technical aspects of how it can be embedded within existing infrastructure. This involves selecting the right tools and methods for achieving explainability without disrupting the efficiency of data pipelines.\n\nThe research outlines how model-agnostic techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) can be applied at various points in a data pipeline to interpret and explain model predictions. These techniques can be used to continuously monitor AI systems and detect any anomalies or unexpected behaviors.\n\nIn addition to practical implementation, XAI\u2019s potential long-term benefits include fostering trust between AI systems and their users. Whether it\u2019s a business analyst relying on AI-generated insights or a data engineer tasked with managing the pipeline, XAI ensures that the rationale behind each decision is clear, traceable, and defensible.\n\nA Step Forward for Ethical AI:\n\nAs AI systems become more prevalent in decision-making processes, the need for transparency and trustworthiness cannot be overstated. Dr. Mohan Raja Pulicharla\u2019s research on Explainable AI within data pipelines contributes to the ongoing efforts to make AI systems more accountable and understandable.\n\nBy focusing on the implementation of XAI in data engineering, his work highlights the critical role transparency plays in ensuring AI\u2019s successful integration into industries that depend on reliable data insights. This research points to a future where AI is not just a tool for automation, but also a system that can be fully understood, trusted, and relied upon by its users.\n\nFor more details, read the full research article here: https://www.ijisrt.com/explainable-ai-in-the-context-of-data-engineering-unveiling-the-black-box-in-the-pipeline."

            "article_content": "I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a Mario and Zelda machine ever since. It\u2019s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch\u2019s best trick \u2014 pick-up-and-play portability \u2014 while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.\n\nBut the Nintendo Switch 2, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be the console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use its detachable Joy-Cons\u2019 many tricks, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC \u2014 or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.\n\nThe Switch 2\u2019s newly magnetic Joy-Con. Gif: Nintendo\n\nThe Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. If history\u2019s any indication, it should easily sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was almost nothing to play but Zelda, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip \u2014 but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the largest and most welcoming libraries of all time, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.\n\nSo: How can the budding handheld PC revolution escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won\u2019t say I know for sure, but I did just check the industry\u2019s temperature at CES 2025, the world\u2019s biggest tech show \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.\n\nHandheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck\u2019s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the 8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Lenovo Legion Go S, to the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2, and the giant 11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon, even the largest Windows handhelds didn\u2019t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.\n\nThere are four places I think the industry has to change \u2014 and maybe, band together \u2014 if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.\n\nA year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo\u2019s handhelds in particular. (The new one\u2019s on the left.) Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto\n\nOperating system\n\nBuyers need to know that their game will be ready to play when they press the power button on a handheld. That\u2019s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it\u2019s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded \u2014 but it\u2019s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.\n\nThat\u2019s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today\u2019s version of handheld Windows.\n\nFirst, Lenovo revealed it would produce the first authorized third-party handheld to ship with Valve\u2019s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows \u2014 something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds as soon as this April. Third, a Microsoft executive told The Verge that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining \u201cthe best of Xbox and Windows together.\u201d\n\nThese moves are heartening, as it\u2019s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn\u2019t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They\u2019re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too \u2014 to the point that today, a community-created fork of Valve\u2019s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience than Windows.\n\nIt\u2019s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we\u2019ve already seen the Deck can\u2019t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers don\u2019t see the raw sales numbers to bring big multiplayer games like Fortnite or Valorant to SteamOS. (They say cheaters are too big a risk.)\n\nBut, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet hard \u2014 not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won\u2019t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.\n\nNo other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, with a claim that was apparently false or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it\u2019d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.\n\nCES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they\u2019re not necessarily a bad idea! Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nScreen\n\nThis one\u2019s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should universally adopt a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.\n\nMany PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won\u2019t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld without a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate \u2014 VRR was the Asus ROG Ally\u2019s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals\u2019 chips offered the same FPS.\n\nLastly, HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s screen, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they\u2019re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It\u2019s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today\u2019s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.\n\nIs a screen like the one I\u2019m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.\n\nChips and battery\n\nUnless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom Aerith and Sephiroth parts for the Steam Deck feel like the only ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD\u2019s new Z2 line might not be all that different.\n\nAMD\u2019s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn\u2019t originally for handheld; they\u2019re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.\n\nThe Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it\u2019s looking at running its Legion Go S\u2019s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.\n\nAMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company\u2019s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC\u2019s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it\u2019s not a leap forward. That may require AMD\u2019s even newer RDNA 4 graphics, and it may require bespoke processors.\n\nThe MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath if you\u2019re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s why MSI hasn\u2019t fully launched the Claw as expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel certainly has bigger fish to fry right now than making custom handheld chips. \u201cIt\u2019s not a market that we\u2019re actively pursuing, but it\u2019s a market we\u2019re happy to enable,\u201d Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. \u201cIt is somewhat extracurricular,\u201d he added, explaining that it\u2019s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. \u201cWe\u2019re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.\u201d.\n\nSome manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today\u2019s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack \u2014 the Asus ROG Ally X doubled the size of its predecessor\u2019s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it\u2019s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can only be partially engineered away.\n\nWe need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.\n\nThe Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior. Photo by The Verge\n\nPrice\n\nThe PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo\u2019s lunch.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 \u2014 around $380 in today\u2019s money \u2014 and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve\u2019s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.\n\nOnly the least expensive model of Lenovo\u2019s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S will lower that bar to $499 this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it\u2019s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell said it was \u201cpainful\u201d but \u201ccritical\u201d to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the razor-and-blades business model where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that\u2019s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world\u2019s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.\n\nBut not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss less than a year after its debut. So it\u2019s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S\u2019s price, for example.\n\nTo compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of portable Xboxes or PlayStations or Steam Machines, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum."

Now it seems like a very bad idea.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Welshman watched on from the VIP box in the theatre with partner Anna Lundberg and her mum, Ingrid, as McIntyre took the plunge into his apps.\n\nBoth the live audience and viewers watched as the host uncovered Sheen\u2019s most recent search on IMDb.\n\nAnd turns out, it was himself. The Quiz actor explained: \u201cListen, sometimes...\n\n\u201cSometimes, I have to look myself up, alright? Because I forget what I've been in.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nHonestly, fair enough - I can\u2019t even remember what I had for tea last night.\n\nHis second most recent search was 'Gavin and Stacey' in a bit of a nod to the actor\u2019s Welsh pride.\n\nThen, McIntyre turned his attention to Sheen\u2019s notes app while asking: \u201cIs notes a bit personal?\u201d As the star advised him to avoid.\n\nBut obviously, this was ignored and the comedian dove straight in as he found an entire page dedicated to the actor\u2019s work history.\n\nAdvert\n\nMichael Sheen was roasted (BBC)\n\nThis turned out to be the write-up of a bio for one of his projects and of course, McIntyre found it absolutely hilariously as he joked Sheen was 'self-centred'.\n\nHaving read that out aloud, the presenter carried on with the embarrassment as he turned his attention to the photos app.\n\nHere he found plenty of selfies of the 55-year-old, including ones of him in disguise. And there was even a snap of his decapitated head from the infamous The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 scene.\n\nAdvert\n\nMcIntyre couldn\u2019t help but point out that pretty much all the photos were of Sheen himself as he continued to comically roast him for being a bit self-obsessed."

Tim Burchett has brought up his theory about underwater alien activity.\n\nTennessee Representative Tim Burchett has taken the trending extraterrestrial conversation to the depths of Earth\u2019s oceans.\n\nAccording to a report from WREG Memphis News Channel 3 (via The Hill), The Republican congressman has openly declared his belief that aliens might be operating secret underwater bases right here on our planet. Burchett\u2019s claims are now making waves in Washington and beyond due to the interesting intersection between religion and science that his beliefs clash on.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s One America News show, he clearly states that he arrived at this point base on his thought process of the unlimited power of the most high. \u201cI just think travelin\u2019 light years, I think it happens,\u201d Burchett said. Burchett also pondered the unimaginable distances aliens might travel to reach Earth.\n\n\u201cThe light from those stars that we see at night left there before the time of Christ,\u201d he added, mixing astronomy and theology in his explanation.\n\nBurchett\u2019s fascination with the unknown isn\u2019t new. Last year in April, following a classified briefing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), he hinted that the U.S. government is deliberately withholding information about these mysterious occurrences.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a cover-up,\u201d Burchett alleged. \u201cWe\u2019ve had departments tell us that they have recovery units, but they won\u2019t release full reports. Everything\u2019s covered up.\u201d\n\nThe congressman\u2019s interest in aliens gained momentum in the summer of 2023, when whistleblowers came forward during a series of UAP hearings. These insiders alleged that the government has long concealed evidence of advanced crafts of either foreign or extraterrestrial origin.\n\nBurchett took action by requesting the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general investigate these shocking claims. Burchett described one case that had him particularly spooked. \u201cWhen they tell me something\u2019s moving at hundreds of miles an hour underwater, and our capabilities\u2026and these things, this one was, it was large as a football field underwater,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this was a documented case, and\u2026and I have an admiral telling me this stuff.\u201d he said.\n\nBurchett has even led efforts to establish a UAP caucus in the House, joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers demanding greater transparency from the military on all things alien. With tens of millions spent on mysterious investigations, Burchett believes Americans deserve the full story\u2014even if it means unearthing secrets that sound straight out of a sci-fi movie.\n\nInterestingly, Burchett isn\u2019t the first U.S. lawmaker to explore the outer edges of plausibility. One prominent example of recent congressional conspiracy theories involves Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). In 2018, she speculated about a secretive \u201cspace laser\u201d potentially being used to start wildfires in California.\n\nThe theory, which linked wildfires to a powerful and shadowy elite, was widely debunked and criticized but highlighted her willingness to amplify far-fetched claims. Her comments about various conspiracy theories, including QAnon, have sparked national debates and raised concerns about the influence of such ideas within government institutions."

            "article_content": "For the first time, researchers have measured the shape of an electron as it moves through a solid. This achievement could open a new way of looking at how electrons behave inside different materials.\n\nTheir discovery highlights many effects that could be relevant to everything from quantum information science to electronics manufacturing.\n\nThose findings come from a team led by physicist Riccardo Comin, MIT\u2019s Class of 1947 Career Development Associate Professor of Physics and leader of the work, in collaboration with other institutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn\u2019t be obtained before,\u201d says Comin. His colleague and co-author, Mingu Kang, performed much of this research at MIT before continuing at Cornell University.\n\nNew angles on electron shape\n\nPhysicists have examined electrons for decades, but the wave-like aspect of these particles brings extra complexity. Electrons can be described not just as small points, but also as \u201cwave functions.\u201d\n\nThese wave functions look like shapes or surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces. Sometimes these shapes are relatively simple. Other times, they\u2019re tangled and tricky to measure.\n\nBy using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, or ARPES, the team recorded details about how electrons behaved as light hit them.\n\nARPES helped them pin down a previously elusive property of electrons that holds the key to better understanding their geometry.\n\nWhy electron shape matters\n\nIn usual settings, we talk about an electron\u2019s energy or velocity. Those are familiar concepts. Geometry, on the other hand, points to the patterns or forms that electron waves can take when arranged in a solid.\n\nQuantum geometry affects how these particles interact, pair up, and even give rise to unusual behaviors. One example is superconductivity, where electrons zip along a material without resistance.\n\nAnother is when electrons form orderly patterns, a bit like a collection of synchronized dancers. Observing geometry could help scientists design new materials with novel electronic traits.\n\nThe kagome connection\n\nThe team measured this geometric effect in a class of materials called kagome metals. Kagome metals are named for a repeating pattern of atoms that resembles a series of interlocking triangles. This lattice structure can influence how electrons navigate and share energy.\n\nPhysicists have long found kagome metals interesting because they host special behaviors that aren\u2019t common in many other materials.\n\nObserving the geometry inside them could explain why electrons in these metals sometimes align in peculiar ways that set off advanced superconductivity or other strange effects.\n\nARPES and quantum shapes\n\nDuring ARPES experiments, researchers shine a beam of photons on a crystal. The light pushes electrons out of the material, allowing scientists to measure those electrons\u2019 angles and spins.\n\nBy gathering that data, they reconstruct how electrons inside the crystal are moving and what shapes they form.\n\nThis method is demanding because it requires intricate equipment and specialized facilities. Yet it gives a unique window into what happens on distances smaller than a billionth of an inch.\n\nApplications and potential benefits\n\nA precise measurement of quantum geometry can lead to progress in areas that rely on electron control. Quantum computing, for instance, depends on maintaining stable electronic states while performing computations.\n\nResearchers want materials that can reliably keep these states without unwanted disruptions. If scientists understand and possibly design the geometry of electrons, they might improve superconductors or even develop electronic devices that lose very little energy through heat.\n\nWith energy efficiency becoming ever more critical, there\u2019s real value in controlling electron flow on such tiny scales.\n\nInsights from global teamwork\n\nThis study was a partnership among institutions spanning different parts of the world. Collaborators brought together theoretical and experimental backgrounds.\n\nTheir collective expertise made it possible to design, synthesize, and measure the electronic structure of a kagome metal.\n\nThe pandemic forced some members to work remotely, but it also enabled other team members to take on new roles in labs that were partially shut down.\n\nThat unexpected shift helped push the work forward and demonstrated how closely linked theory and experiment must be when tackling high-precision measurements.\n\nOne electron shape, many possibilities\n\nQuantum geometry is far richer than standard geometry we learn in everyday math. The shape of an electron\u2019s wave function isn\u2019t like a typical circle or a neat sphere. It can take on forms that twist and loop in higher dimensions.\n\nObserving that shape in a real material confirms predictions that theorists have pursued for a long time. It means those theoretical constructs describing wave functions have real, measurable consequences.\n\nAnd now, there is a proven route to measure them, so future studies might target exotic materials that exhibit other patterns or new behaviors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nScientists plan to refine techniques like ARPES and adapt them to explore a range of materials. They hope to see how quantum geometry influences conductivity, magnetism, and other conditions that matter for practical applications.\n\nPhysicists also see promise in discovering how manipulating geometry might encourage electrons to swap their usual habits for more synchronized, cooperative behavior.\n\nThat synchronization is important for technologies that rely on controlling multiple electrons at once, such as quantum sensors or memory elements.\n\nExperts say these findings will likely inspire more ambitious experiments to uncover aspects of quantum geometry we haven\u2019t been able to measure before.\n\nWith each new result, materials researchers step closer to engineering designs for the electronic components of tomorrow. The electron might be tiny, but it\u2019s revealing secrets about shaping the future of technology.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Physics.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered how certain problems are so complex that even the fastest computers struggle to solve them? These types of problems are often found in industries like transportation, finance, healthcare, and science. They\u2019re called \u201coptimization problems,\u201d where the goal is to find the best solution out of many possible options.\n\nWhile regular computers (called \u201cclassical computers\u201c) are great for many tasks, they can have a hard time handling these massive challenges. Enter quantum computers.\n\nQuantum computers are an exciting new kind of technology that could change the way we solve difficult problems, especially Quantum Computing Problems. Instead of using regular computer bits (which are like tiny on/off switches), quantum computers use something called \u201cquantum bits,\u201d or qubits.\n\nQubits are super special because they follow the rules of quantum physics, which means they can process information in ways that classical computers can\u2019t. This makes quantum computers much more powerful at solving certain types of puzzles.\n\nWhat Are Optimization Problems?\n\nOptimization problems sound fancy, but you deal with them every day without even realizing it. Imagine you\u2019re trying to pick the fastest route to school on a map, or you\u2019re deciding how to spend your pocket money to get the best value. These are simple examples of optimization problems\u2014finding the best option out of many choices.\n\nNow imagine you work at an airport and have to decide the best way to schedule hundreds of flights, manage thousands of bags, and make everything run smoothly without delays. Or maybe you work for a delivery company and you want to find the most efficient way to deliver millions of packages across the country. These problems are way too complicated to solve with just guesswork!\n\nRegular computers try to solve these tough problems by testing every possible solution one by one, which can take an enormous amount of time. Even supercomputers may need days, months, or even years to do the job, depending on how big the problem is.\n\nWhat Makes Quantum Computers Different?\n\nQuantum computers are special because they use principles from quantum mechanics, a branch of science that studies the tiniest building blocks of our universe\u2014like atoms and particles. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be in multiple states at once, thanks to something called \u201csuperposition.\u201d This allows quantum computers to look at many possible solutions simultaneously, instead of one by one.\n\nQuantum computers also use something called \u201centanglement,\u201d where qubits are connected in a way that lets them share information instantly. These features allow quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nFor optimization problems, this means quantum computers can solve puzzles with millions (or even billions!) of possibilities in a fraction of the time it would take a classical computer.\n\nThis breakthrough is particularly exciting for industries like logistics, where the rise of technology has revolutionized traditional operations. If you interested in exploring this further, can check out our blog, \u201cF2000s and the Rise of Technology in Logistics,\u201d to learn how advanced computing and innovation are shaping supply chains globally.\n\nReal-Life Benefits of Quantum Computing in Optimization\n\nNow that we understand how quantum computers work, let\u2019s explore some real-life benefits for solving optimization problems.\n\n1. Faster Deliveries and Better Logistics\n\nHave you ever ordered something online and tracked its delivery route? Companies like Amazon or FedEx need to figure out the fastest and cheapest way to deliver packages to millions of customers. Using quantum computers, these companies could create better delivery plans in real time, saving money and ensuring you get your package as quickly as possible.\n\n2. Smarter Traffic Management\n\nTraffic jams are another optimization challenge. Cities around the world face growing traffic problems as more and more cars hit the roads. Quantum computing can help plan better traffic flows, reduce congestion, and make public transportation more efficient. This could save time, lower fuel usage, and reduce pollution!\n\n3. Improved Healthcare Scheduling\n\nHospitals deal with optimization problems all the time, like scheduling surgeries, assigning doctors, and managing beds for patients. Quantum computers could help hospitals make better schedules that improve patient care and reduce waiting times. This means more lives saved and a smoother healthcare experience.\n\n4. More Accurate Financial Predictions\n\nBanks and investment companies often deal with risky decisions, like where to invest money or how to predict market changes. These are complex optimization problems that involve analyzing a huge amount of data. Quantum computers could help make faster and smarter financial decisions, which could stabilize markets and improve the global economy.\n\n5. Advancing Science and Research\n\nFrom designing new medicines to improving renewable energy systems, scientists rely on optimization to solve tough problems. Quantum computers can speed up this research and bring us closer to breakthroughs in important areas like curing diseases or fighting climate change.\n\nChallenges and the Future of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computers sound amazing, but they\u2019re not perfect yet. Building and maintaining them is incredibly hard. They need to be kept in extremely cold environments and are still in the early stages of development. Right now, only a few companies and research labs have working quantum computers.\n\nStill, progress is happening quickly. Scientists and engineers are working hard to make quantum computers more powerful and accessible. Many believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, we\u2019ll see quantum computing become a common tool for solving real-world problems.\n\nWhy Should You Care About Quantum Computing?\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a scientist or an engineer, quantum computing is something exciting to keep an eye on. The benefits it could bring, from better technologies to smarter ways of solving problems, have the potential to impact nearly every part of our lives. Quantum computing could lead to a better, more efficient, and more sustainable future.\n\nThink of quantum computers like the superheroes of the technology world. They take on the toughest challenges and uncover solutions that normal computers just can\u2019t handle. And who knows? Maybe one day you\u2019ll be working on quantum computing or benefiting from its amazing advancements!\n\nQuantum computing may still sound like science fiction to some, but it\u2019s quickly becoming a reality. Its ability to solve advanced optimization problems could transform industries and improve the world in countless ways.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless, and we\u2019re just getting started!

The Guidance Patrol - aka the morality police - are in charge of arresting women who violate the conservative dress code. Tasked with ensuring Islamic morals are respected, they spend their days patrolling public spaces in vans to crack down on \"improper\" behaviour and clothing. Women detained by cops are either given a warning or bundled into a van and whisked away to a \"correctional facility\" or a police station. They are then lectured on how to dress before being released to their male relatives. Since the 1980s, many women have been beaten to death by the callous morality police, or tortured into given false confessions. Various clips this year have shown their increased presence as the country ramps up its violent crackdowns on women. One disturbing video shows the moment Iran's twisted morality police hurl a woman in the back of one of their patrol vans. Before this a woman was filmed tackling a girl to the ground and attacking her as she screamed - seemingly because she hadn't covered her hair. Video has shown the morality police snatching women off the streets and bundling them into vans for wearing jeans in public. Tehran announced a fresh crackdown on \"anomalies\" to its religious rules under the \"Nour Project\" in April. The Jerusalem Post reports suggest crackdowns on behaviour have been violent. Sexual harassment, beatings, arrests and the use of tasers have been reported around the country.\n\nHer clothes and headscarf were both torn during the alleged assault at the Azad University of Science and Research in Tehran, Iran International reports.\n\nFootage shows the woman sat near-nude outside a university before being bundled violently into a car by police.\n\nShe was also reportedly accused of being mentally ill and taken to a nearby hospital.\n\nThis \"headscarf revolution\" was all fuelled by the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022.\n\nAmini died in the custody of Tehran's \"morality police\" after being arrested for violating Iran's hijab rules.\n\nShe was beaten to death for wearing an \"improper\" hijab on September 16.\n\nWomen of all ages ripped off their compulsory hijabs at public demonstrations in defiance of the nation\u2019s feared morality police.\n\nHundreds of people were killed, including dozens of security personnel, in a brutal crackdown and thousands of protesters were arrested.\n\nReports of torture and death at the hands of officials have also surfaced.\n\n5 The girls had their hair uncovered and some skin on show during the dance despite wearing jeans and jumpers Credit: X/FSeifikaran"
