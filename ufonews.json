Slay the Princess \u2013 The Pristine Cut\n\n5 Slay the Princess blends romance with horror Credit: Black Tabby Games\n\nSlay the Princess was first released last year, but The Pristine Cut adds more routes, expanded dialogue, and extra endings.\n\nEvery decision reflects back at you in this romantic horror game where you try to slay and save each other over and over.\n\nWith more choices than any other game I\u2019ve played, it raises the bar for the genre.\n\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out our Slay the Princess review.\n\n4. UFO 50\n\n5 UFO 50 has so many games you have to love at least one of them Credit: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 is a collection of more than 50 retro-inspired games that span the gamut of genres.\n\nIt has everything from puzzle games to deck builders, RPGs, 2D platformers, and metroidvanias.\n\nThere\u2019s also an overarching meta-narrative that connects all of the games together, and secrets within each game to discover.\n\nIt was even nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards if you need more proof.\n\n3. Tactical Breach Wizards\n\n5 Tactical Breach Wizards blends strategy and puzzle solving Credit: Suspicious Developments\n\nIf you like XCOM but wish it had more puzzle-solving, then Tactical Breach Wizards is for you.\n\nIt has the squad-based tactics gameplay of XCOM but changes it so you are solving puzzles in the heat of the moment and on the fly.\n\nEach teammate's abilities are unique and yet they can synergise in some way with every other character in the game.\n\nIt\u2019s all topped off by hilarious writing, to make a funny and satisfying experience.\n\n2. Balatro\n\n5 Balatro mixes Poker hands with a high score multiplyer deck building Credit: Apple / Balatro\n\nIt\u2019s rare that an indie game gets nominated for Game of the Year, let alone one developed by just one person.\n\nBalatro is a Poker-inspired deck builder, where you use different Jokers to multiply the score of each hand you play.\n\nWith various difficulties, decks, Jokers, and other cards to collect, you\u2019ll keep picking Balatro up for just one more run.\n\nIf you want to read more about it, check out our Balatro review.\n\n1. Indika\n\n5 Indika is the most unique game we played this year Credit: Odd Meter\n\nThere are very few games that ask you to play as a Russian nun during the 19th century, in fact, Indika is the only one we\u2019ve played.\n\nIt makes for a beautifully surreal story of self-discovery and genre-blending where third-person action gives way to pixel-art 2D platforming.\n\nIndika has a unique perspective in direction, cinematography, and storytelling, making it nothing else we\u2019ve played quite like it.\n\nIt was everything unique and special about Indika that has left it as our favourite indie game of 2024."

Many film fans have declared it one of Spielberg's 'best', while others said the film left them 'mesmerised'.\n\nImage: REX/Shutterstock) REX/Shutterstock)\n\nOne bowled over fan penned: \"Certainly one of the best films ever made on the subject matter. A lot of very real things are on display, including some of the he government's best security devices at the time (Identimat hand scanner). The depiction of the creatures themselves at the end is very accurate.\"\n\nMeanwhile another viewer gushed: \"In my opinion, one of Spielberg's best movies. A feeling of wonder grips you from the beginning to end. Serious wonder, not kid wonder as in E.T. I find it amazing how this movie still works without character development. The awe is enough.\"\n\nImage: EMI Films/Columbia Pictures) EMI Films/Columbia Pictures)\n\nOne fan said after watching it for the first time at the cinema, \"every single one of the audience looked up at the stars in the night sky as they were walking to their cars,\" before declaring it: \"One of the best sci-fi films ever.\" Another said: \"This is the movie that got people watching the skies.\"\n\nThe film will be broadcast on Channel 4 at 11.25am on Christmas Eve.

            "article_content": "LLMs. Co-pilots. Agents. Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the hype behind artificial Intelligence remains palpable. Major tech companies are pouring billions into sparkling new infrastructure for AI workloads. Utility companies in areas with dense data centers are seeing revenues and power consumption soar. Yet, outside of semiconductor and infrastructure players, few companies have seen significant revenue from AI products. Investors are increasingly left asking: When will these massive capital investments start benefiting software companies? What\u2019s causing the delay?\n\nWhere AI is showing up in our world today\n\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear: AI has been around in many industries for years, including financial services. Quantitative traders long ago embraced techniques that are now classified as \"AI\" including non-linear regressions and advanced optimization techniques. What excites us now are the rapid advancements in new areas like Generative AI, pattern recognition and deep learning. You\u2019ve likely noticed early use cases of GenAI like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot or Adobe\u2019s AI Assistant. These tools are being integrated into software platforms across industries with new use cases emerging at a rapid clip.\n\n\n\nAcross other industries, anecdotal datapoints of GenAI value creation are starting to stack up. Walmart recently shared that large language models helped them to \u201ccreate or improve more than 850 million pieces of data across its product catalog,\u201d completing the project with just 1% of the typical headcount. Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar datapoint when he disclosed that the use of Amazon\u2019s GenAI assistant saved 7,500 \u201cdeveloper-years\u201d of programming time in a recent major software update.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most salient example of AI generating value is hiding under our collective noses in social media, where algorithmic matching on posts like Instagram and TikTok optimizes the content and ads we see. This area has seen tremendous gains in recent years and has helped leading AI adopters in social media improve ad returns and gain market share.\n\n\n\nAt our firm, we\u2019ve adopted AI with care, led initially by eager adoption of various AI copilots and coding assistants. We have also explored alpha-generating use cases like pattern recognition and sentiment analysis. Looking further out, we are excited about developing custom assistants to superpower our investment and client teams. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more is yet to come.\n\nThe delay in benefits of AI for software investors\n\n\n\nSo, if AI is being leveraged across industries, why hasn\u2019t the software sector seen the uptick in growth that investors expected? New revenue streams for software firms haven\u2019t met the hype, leading to stark underperformance for the software industry with a few notable exceptions. We believe this partly reflects Amara\u2019s law: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The rapid adoption of ChatGPT, and the sense of magic many of us experienced when first using it, may have exacerbated elevated expectations.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that product development and adoption take time. AI development and testing alone can take months, if not years, before a project is ready for deployment. This timeline is further elongated by data governance challenges. As anyone who has worked at a massive conglomerate can likely attest, many large firms have poorly structured and poorly governed data policies, rife with operational silos and inconsistent rules. This complicates development. Compliance and cybersecurity can further stretch timelines. While many firms are seeing real and tangible benefits from AI, getting these projects into production is taking longer than anticipated, creating a mismatch between investor expectations and reality.\n\n\n\nWhile this delay has certainly led to disappointment among software investors, it has not been the only issue. The rapid pace of breakthrough innovation in AI has also sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the room for other technology projects. Some companies have paused major technology initiatives, hesitating to commit to multi\\year contracts while still developing their AI strategy. All of this has elongated sales cycles and created a temporary slowdown in software demand.\n\nA window of opportunity for longer-term investors\n\nSurveys have shown that corporations are seeing real, tangible value creation from AI, especially in cost reduction. But AI isn\u2019t just about optimizing existing business models \u2014 it\u2019s driving innovation in areas like autonomous cars, healthcare, clean energy, and even entertainment and media. These advancements have the potential to reshape industries and open up new markets. For long-term investors, this makes AI more than a short-term play \u2014 it\u2019s a foundation for future growth. Again, like many transformative technologies, AI\u2019s impact may have been overestimated in the short term, but its long-term potential will likely have been underestimated.\n\n\n\nWe believe the current market anxiety in software creates an opportunity for long-term investors. The project delays are largely temporary in nature and should be resolved as firms update their technological road map and set AI priorities. Recently, we\u2019ve noticed renewed enthusiasm in the software demand environment. As demand normalizes, we expect industry growth to re-accelerate, which should remove the wet blanket from valuations.\n\nBottom line\n\n\n\nA Gartner survey earlier this year found that 90% of CFOs expected increased AI budgets in 2024, with none planning cuts. Yet, it has been clear that many projects have faced delays due to complexity, data governance issues, security concerns, and a scarcity of talent. This has created an air pocket in an industry that is usually known more for \"eating the world\" than for booms and busts. Just as the internet didn\u2019t take off overnight, AI still has some development before it starts to deliver significant results for investors. We believe those returns are coming, and the impact is on the horizon if investors can remain patient. Now is the time for investors to position themselves for the shift from hype to impact. As AI projects move from development to deployment, those who stay the course or increase their exposure to the right opportunities are likely to see meaningful returns ahead.\n\nDave Smith is head of technology investing at Bailard.

            "article_content": "A study on wound healing, led by researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK and COMSATS University in Pakistan, earlier this year made a remarkable discovery that can prove to be a potential new treatment for hereditary-patterned baldness-a disorder that has affected millions across the world.\n\nThe breakthrough centres on deoxyribose, a sugar that occurs naturally in the human body, forming part of DNA's structure. In the first place, researchers were studying the sugar as related to the healing process in mice for skin wounds. To their surprise, they noticed accelerated fur growth around treated lesions compared with their untreated counterparts.\n\nMotivated by this unforeseen discovery, the research group widened their exploration to seek the possibility of deoxyribose's ability in promoting hair growth. While future studies are required for confirmation, the discovery still brings forth hopes for new therapeutic treatments in the fight against inherited baldness among both sexes. The findings of this discovery represent a long-awaited advance in addressing the most common cause of hair loss throughout the globe.\n\nIn a study published in June, it was shown that the deoxyribose sugar is as effective at regrowing hair as Minoxidil-an existing drug used to treat hair loss. However, the research offers a potential alternative approach to stimulating hair growth through a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar.\n\nProfessor Sheila MacNeil, Emeritus Professor of Tissue Engineering at the University of Sheffield, said: \"Male pattern baldness is such a common condition, affecting men all over the world, but at the moment there are only two FDA-licensed drugs to treat it. Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth.\"\n\n\"The research we have done is very much in early stages, but the results are promising and warrant further investigation. This could offer another approach to treating this condition, which can affect men's self-image and confidence.\"\n\nProfessor (Associate) Muhammed Yar (TI) of IRCBM, COMSATS University Pakistan, said: \"This pro-angiogenic deoxyribose sugar is naturally occurring, inexpensive, and stable, and we have shown it can be delivered from a variety of carrier gels or dressings. This makes it an attractive candidate to explore further for treatment of hair loss in men.\""

            "article_content": "Nestle Vietnam has set its sights to capitalise on rising demand for convenient beverage options in the country to drive the growth of its Nescafe a ready-to-serve liquid concentrate.\n\nAccording to the firm, Nescafe stepped up its format and product innovation to keep up with the latest trends and consumer demands.\n\n\u201cVietnam, in particular, is a country with a very rich coffee culture, and there have also been some novel popular trends emerging over the past few years,\u201d Nestle Vietnam Business Executive Officer Mostafa Youssef told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\n\u201cCold coffee tends to be more popular here, and interestingly there has also been a movement towards liquid coffees \u2013 which is why we have recently launched a new innovation in the form of a coffee concentrate in a stick.\n\n\u201cThe convenience factor is strong with these as all consumers need to do is open up the coffee stick, pour over ice \u2013 and that\u2019s all done, they can enjoy a very quick cup of coffee with no need to source hot water to dissolve powder or dilute the coffee unless they want to.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia has asked experts in India to weigh in with recommendations for India\u2019s spice sector bounce back from two high profile contamination scandals this year.\n\nCarcinogenic ethylene oxide is a pesticide that was found in spice powders from major Indian brands Everest and MDH, putting the country\u2019s spice industry under intense scrutiny.\n\nThis has led to bans in Hong Kong and the Maldives, product recalls in Singapore, and stricter checks on India\u2019s spices in Australia and the US.\n\nDespite the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) emphasising its stringent regulations, overseas bans and domestic concerns raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong ban on 5 April, FSSAI issued a statement on 8 April that raised the maximum residue limits (MRL) of pesticides by 10 times from 0.01mg/kg to 0.1mg/kg.\n\nAlthough FSSAI clarified that these only applies to pesticides not registered with the Indian authorities, and that the international Codex standards were adhered to, it sparked criticism and confusion.\n\n\u201cIt does seem counterintuitive for the FSSAI to increase the MRL for pesticides not registered with authorities, especially considering the potential health implications,\u201d Equinox Labs CEO Ashwin Bhadri said.\n\n\u201cThe implications of such a decision could be significant, as it may lead to increased pesticide residues in food products, potentially impacting consumer health in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt may also raise doubts about the effectiveness of regulatory measures in ensuring food safety and quality.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian government has revised food packaging regulations in response to consumer and academic concerns over the presence of dangerous chemicals entering the food supply chain.\n\nAs of 2023, Indonesia had no specific regulations in place regarding certain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), more commonly known as the \u2018Forever Chemicals\u2019 due to their slow degradation rate.\n\nA great deal of scientific evidence already linked PFAS exposure to an array of health issues from cancer, cardiovascular disease, infertility, elevated blood pressure and more.\n\n\u201cIndonesia currently has no regulations on PFAS in food packaging [but] the troubling findings from our study indicate that we need stronger regulations to protect our children and families from exposures to toxic PFAS chemicals especially in daily products,\u201d Nexus3 Senior Advisor Yuyun Ismawati said whilst announcing the study findings.\n\n\u201cPFAS can also be released when people wear clothing, during washing, and when used synthetic textile wastes are disposed \u2013 [this] can contaminate waterways, leading to PFAS exposures from contaminated drinking water or food.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia took a closer look at five of the top trends affecting the Asia Pacific food and beverage industry in 2024.\n\nThese included the \u2018premium affordability\u2019 trend surfaced by many food firms, as well as the evolution of plant-based protein to moving away from mimicry in innovation.\n\nOther significant trends included the rise of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages driven by convenience and relatability, the continuous rise of low-to-no alcohol, and major factors behind the growth of the snacking industry.\n\nThe European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced major pushback from ministers and trade organisations within Europe, as well as alongside continued pressure from palm oil producer nations in Asia this year.\n\nOn March 28 2024, an industry-wide cross-commodity letter was addressed to EC President of the Council for Environment and Minister for the Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and the Green Deal of Belgium Zakia Khattabi, calling for \u2018urgent clarifications and workable solutions\u2019 on EUDR implementation.\n\nThis was signed by a coalition of more than 20 European industry organisations spanning many areas of trade, including representatives on food trade in cereals, oils, rice, livestock, meat and more \u2013 all highlighting concerns over the supposed enforcement in December 2024.\n\n\u201cConsidering the significant adjustments that are needed from suppliers, operators and traders, we would like to express serious concerns regarding the pace of preparation of EUDR-related legislative acts, the mandatory systems and the guidance and clarifications required for implementation,\u201d the coalition said in the letter, which FoodNavigator-Asia has viewed.\n\n\u201cOperators and traders are working hard to prepare their supply chains and adapt their systems and due diligence processes for compliance with the EUDR [and] try to develop workable solutions compatible with the EUDR provisions.\n\n\u201cHowever, these efforts are impeded by large gaps in information, lack of appropriate technical solutions and by misconceptions as to the functioning of our complex chains.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government has planned to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over the next two years.\n\nSouth Korea committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThis year\u2019s developments saw the ministry calling for public comment on an initiative to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cFrom January 1 2026, all individual types of drinking water bottles such as mineral waters that are manufactured in Korea will be subject to this change.\n\n\u201cAs the label-free QR code display method is mandated for target audiences, we aim to start with a smooth trial operation and early conversion [in order to] reflect any industry difficulties regarding displaying any necessary sales information via the QR code, as well as to determine the scope for product promotion and advertising.\u201d\n\nGlobal food corporation Cargill has leveraged its cocoa-sourcing networks in Asia and other business units to support customers in overcoming the cocoa supply shortage, and ensure consumers continue to have access to chocolate products.\n\nAccording to the International Cocoa Organization, global cocoa supply is projected to decline by nearly 11% to 4.449m tonnes in the 2023-2024 season, compared with 2022-23.\n\nThis is primarily caused by \u201ccatastrophic harvests\u201d in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which are responsible for over 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa supply.\n\nIn the face of this crisis, Cargill has drawn on its extensive cocoa sourcing networks and innovation expertise to help customers address current challenges, and ensure consumers still get to enjoy chocolate products.\n\n\u201cCocoa supply is indeed a pressing issue for the industry. Cargill is a bean-to-bar solutions provider, which means that we have the capabilities to innovate along every step of the value chain, from sourcing of raw materials to product customisation and solutions provision. For example, we are able to provide Asian-sourced cocoa products as we source globally.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are actively reaching out to our customers to see if they need support in managing this situation, such as sourcing, alternative recipes and product trials. We are able to tailor-make cocoa powder for a certain flavour and colour, and combine different ingredients to create new solutions or replacements,\u201d Xiaoling Liu, Indulgence Leader, Food Solutions Asia Pacific at Cargill, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nThe EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced pressure from within its own Parliament to postpone implementation as an \u2018urgent\u2019 matter this year, with concerns over key trade commodities such as palm oil and cocoa.\n\nThe EUDR received much criticism particularly from palm oil industry experts and countries producing key commodities likely to be affected such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee, and came under fire from within the EU parliament as well.\n\nThis dissent was led by European Peoples\u2019 Party (EPP) environmental spokesperson Peter Liese, who pushed for an \u2018urgent\u2019 postponement and \u2018far less bureaucratic\u2019 implementation of the EUDR.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the EUDR is correct, but its implementation is far too bureaucratic [and] the European Commission absolutely must postpone the entry into force of the deforestation regulation, then use the transitional period to reduce bureaucracy in the text,\u201d he said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe must do something about deforestation worldwide and take our responsibility seriously, [however] the regulation has been turned into a bureaucratic monster - Many small farmers around the world and even small forest owners in the European Union cannot work with the text.\n\n\u201cThe preparatory work that the Commission should have carried out has not been done [and many] countries are complaining massively about the legislation, including countries that are pursuing the same goal as we are, namely to stop deforestation.\n\nAs of time of writing, the EUDR implementation has been postponed to the end of 2025.\n\nResearchers in India have highlighted that the misuse of antibiotics in food animal production in Asia could pose a serious danger to public health in the region.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a significant global threat, causing substantial economic losses and an estimated annual loss of 700,000 lives.\n\nResearchers at the Veterinary and Animal Sciences University in Punjab noted the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance and its potential transmission to humans through the food chain.\n\nThey also shed light on the pervasive use of critically important antibiotics in food animal production across Asia as well as how limited surveillance and regulatory controls had amplified concerns over antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe study encompassed 11 WHO member countries \u2014 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.\n\nResults from the review of 108 selected publications revealed a staggering 1,126 scientific publications on antibiotic use in food animals, wherein the study identified a concerning trend of antibiotic misuse in livestock, poultry and aquaculture.\n\nChina\u2019s removal of tariffs on all dairy products from New Zealand has been posited to spell huge potential for brands with a strong focus on quality and sustainability.\n\nChina and New Zealand signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in 2008, but with regard to dairy it took 16 years to finally see all tariffs removed.\n\nAccording to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade data, New Zealand was the first developed country in the world to enter into an FTA with China.\n\nVarious New Zealand dairy products have seen export tariff decreases over the years, but although many of these hit zero in 2019, duties were still in place for liquid milk, butter and cheese until 2021; and for milk powder until Dec 31 2023.\n\nAs of Jan 1 this year, all tariffs were officially declared to have been removed by the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand via a formal statement, which was warmly welcomed by New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay.\n\n\u201cAll safeguard duties on milk powder [entering China] have been removed as of January 1 2024, which marks the final liberalisation of dairy access under the [China-New Zealand] FTA,\u201d McClay announced via a separate statement."

The crypto market might be dealing with bearish trends, but meme coins are charging ahead, capturing imaginations and wallets alike. As new projects emerge, investors are zeroing in on tokens with explosive potential\u2014and some are standing out as the best new meme coins with 1000X potential.\n\nLeading the charge is BTFD Coin (BTFD), which is redefining what it means to be a meme coin in 2024.

While it\u2019s still early days for Popcat, its ability to blend humour with utility makes it a standout.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Popcat\u2019s viral appeal and commitment to community engagement make it one of the best new meme coins with 1000X potential. Its ability to turn a meme into a movement is exactly what the crypto world needs right now.\n\n3. Brett: The Wildcard with Big Dreams\n\nBrett is the ultimate wildcard in the meme coin arena. Named after the internet\u2019s favourite \u201caverage guy\u201d meme, this token has embraced its role as the everyman\u2019s cryptocurrency. But don\u2019t let its lighthearted branding fool you\u2014Brett has serious ambitions.\n\nThe Brett ecosystem is centred around inclusivity and accessibility.

Its ability to adapt and evolve ensures it will remain a key player in the meme coin market.\n\nWhy Buying the Dip Matters\n\nEconomic downturns have always been a breeding ground for opportunity. Take the 1973 financial crisis, for example. While the world panicked over inflation and market crashes, savvy investors scooped up undervalued assets and reaped massive rewards when the market rebounded. The lesson? Buy the dips and hold on tight.\n\nThe current bearish trend in the crypto market mirrors this scenario. Meme coins like BTFD Coin, Popcat, Brett, and Turbo offer the perfect chance to invest in low-cost, high-potential assets. Among these, BTFD Coin stands out as a beacon for those looking to turn turbulent times into exponential gains.\n\nHow to Buy BTFD Coin with the BIG50 Discount\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to join the BTFD Coin movement, here\u2019s how to do it.

            "article_content": "The recent market shifts reveal contrasting trends \u2014 Solana price forecast suggests further dips, as the coin drops from $263.83 to $185, with predictions pointing to a bearish trend. Meanwhile, Binance coin (BNB) security remains a focal point for investors, emphasizing advanced protection mechanisms amidst increasing scrutiny.\n\nOn the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers a compelling edge with its recent dashboard upgrade that comes with a limited-time 5-tier bonus system. Starting with an impressive 150% bonus on the first purchase, the rewards grow even bigger as buyers proceed. This utility-focused project has also exceeded expectations by raising over $171 million in its presale, firmly establishing itself as one of the crypto coins to watch right now.\n\nSolana Price Forecast: Will It Recover After 18% Drop to $185?\n\nSolana recently achieved an all-time high of $263.83 but quickly dropped by 16%, trading at $224.92. Market predictions suggest further declines, with a low of $215 anticipated this week. It has struggled to maintain its upward momentum, raising concerns among its community.\n\nDespite its large market cap of $107.94 billion, short-term forecasts paint a bearish picture, and recovery to its peak may take time. While optimism persists among long-term supporters, the Solana price forecast reflects ongoing challenges that cast uncertainty over its immediate performance.\n\nExamining Binance Coin (BNB) Security Features\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is widely recognized for its robust security features, including advanced encryption and Proof of Stake mechanisms. Binance coin (BNB) security is further reinforced by two-factor authentication (2FA), offering an additional layer of user protection.\n\nHowever, concerns about regulatory scrutiny and centralized dependencies weigh heavily on BNB. Recent legal challenges, including investigations by major authorities, have heightened uncertainty about its long-term prospects. Moreover, analysts argue that its reliance on the Binance ecosystem raises questions about decentralization.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s 5-Tier Gamified Bonuses to End on January 8!\n\nCrypto enthusiasts often seek opportunities where their investments yield more than expected, and BlockDAG\u2019s latest dashboard upgrade delivers exactly that. By introducing an innovative 5-tier bonus system, BlockDAG has created a unique reward structure that turns every purchase into a step toward greater returns, redefining the way buyers engage with their holdings.\n\nUsing the BDAG250 code, buyers can start with a 150% bonus on their first purchase, followed by an even bigger 170% bonus on the second. But the excitement doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014\u201dmystery boxes\u201d reveal hidden bonuses as users make additional purchases. Each step unlocks higher rewards, making the process both thrilling and highly rewarding.\n\nThis gamified bonus structure has quickly become one of the most talked-about features in the crypto market, giving participants a unique incentive to grow their portfolios. But here\u2019s the catch: the bonus offer is set to end on January 8, making now the perfect time to take advantage of these incredible rewards.\n\nMoreover, BlockDAG\u2019s presale success underscores its growing dominance in the market, with over $168.5 million raised by selling more than 17.4 billion BDAG coins. Early BDAG holders have already seen their stakes multiply, as the price has surged 2,240% from its starting point of $0.001 to $0.0234 in batch 26.\n\nFor those looking to become a part of this rising crypto star, now could be the ideal time, as the BDAG coins are still available at affordable prices of a mere $0.0234. Yet, this low-entry price won\u2019t be around for long, as the current batch is nearing its close, setting the stage for a significant price increase in the next batch.\n\nCrypto Coins to Watch Now in the Market\n\nWhile Solana price forecast suggests further dips to $215 and Binance coin (BNB) security faces regulatory scrutiny, BlockDAG is charting a different course. With its innovative 5-tier bonus system and the use of the BDAG250 code, BlockDAG offers up to 170% bonuses, transforming user engagement and rewards.\n\nThe project has already raised $168.5 million in its presale, with prices surging 2,240% in just a couple of months. As the current batch nears completion, prices are set to rise in the next round. For those seeking crypto coins to watch now for massive gains, BlockDAG\u2019s record-breaking momentum and unique incentives make it a standout choice.\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

On November 21, the SEC announced that Chair Gary Gensler would be leaving the position on January 20, 2025, ending a nearly four-year tenure as its lead administrator. The SEC\u2019s press release acknowledged a legacy of enforcement actions, including for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct. Data from the Blockchain Association quantifies that legacy at 104 enforcement actions through 2023. In remarks to the Practising Law Institute\u2019s 56th Annual Institute on Securities Regulation, shortly before the announcement of his departure, Chair Gensler defended his enforcement record, stating, \u201cCourt after court has agreed with our actions to protect investors\u201d while simultaneously recognizing that \u201c[n]ot every [digital] asset is a security,\u201d citing bitcoin, Ether, and stablecoins as examples. Gensler\u2019s announcement came less than a month after SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal announced his own departure on October 2. Like Gensler, Grewal oversaw more than 100 enforcement actions addressing what the SEC called \u201cwidespread noncompliance in the quickly growing crypto space.\u201d\n\nOn November 21, the SEC announced that Chair Gary Gensler would be leaving the position on January 20, 2025, ending a nearly four-year tenure as its lead administrator.

In her remarks at the Wharton FinTech Lecture Series, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce spoke of the delicate balance between regulation and innovation, particularly in the context of financial technology and crypto assets. She illustrated the complexities of excessive regulation using the analogy of a potholder she had recently purchased that came with a 20-page disclosure document, making the point that excessive regulation could stifle the innovation of even relatively innocuous products. Peirce then addressed the SEC\u2019s inconsistent approach to crypto regulation, which has often been characterized by legal uncertainty and a focus on enforcement rather than collaboration, which, in her view, has pushed much of the innovation overseas. Peirce advocated for a more open and predictable regulatory framework that would allow for experimentation and innovation, including the creation of a \u201cmicro-innovation sandbox\u201d to facilitate cross-border experimentation. Peirce also pointed out the potential benefits of asset tokenization and the need for clear guidance to foster its development.\n\nIn her remarks at the Wharton FinTech Lecture Series, SEC Commissioner Hester M.

SEC Commissioner Uyeda praises regulatory leadership of Indo-Pacific countries on crypto regulation. On October 24, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda delivered remarks at the 2024 AIMA APAC Annual Forum in Hong Kong, highlighting the significance of the Indo-Pacific region in global financial markets, the regulation of private funds in the US, and the importance of international regulatory engagement. Uyeda expressed concerns about government criticisms of alternative investments and the role of \u201cshadow banking\u201d in financial stability. He emphasized the importance of alternative investments in providing nontraditional funding to companies, which is crucial for innovation and economic growth. Uyeda also discussed the recent court ruling that vacated the SEC\u2019s prescriptive rule on private fund advisers, which he opposed, and the ongoing regulatory proposals that could impact private fund managers, such as the re-proposed custody rule and pending cybersecurity regulations. Uyeda claimed that the SEC\u2019s current regulatory approach to crypto is less advanced compared to that of the Indo-Pacific region. He highlighted the leadership of jurisdictions in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and Australia in facilitating crypto and fintech innovation while promoting investor protection. Uyeda pointed out the lack of sufficient guidance from the SEC on key issues, such as when a crypto offering needs to be regulated as a security. He emphasized the need for the SEC to engage more transparently with market participants. Uyeda also mentioned the challenges faced by private fund managers in the US regarding the custody and auditing of crypto assets and called for the US to learn from the regulatory approaches of other countries to better facilitate innovation, capital formation, and investor protection in the crypto space.\n\nCongress\n\nHouse Committee on Financial Services holds hearing on technological innovations in financial services. On December 4, the House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled, \u201cInnovation Revolution: How Technology is Shaping the Future of Finance.\u201d In a memorandum published before the hearing, committee staff previewed that a significant portion of the hearing focused on blockchain technology and digital assets, which the committee sees as potential building blocks for the next generation of internet technology. During the hearing, committee members recognized that blockchain enables the creation of decentralized networks that offer new ways to provide services, such as financial products and social networks, with greater user autonomy and privacy. The hearing further acknowledged that the market capitalization of digital assets is approximately $3 trillion, with stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) providing price stability. Speakers also discussed the potential of tokenization, which involves creating digital representations of real-world assets on the blockchain in order to increase liquidity, transparency, and access. The memorandum did, however, note that innovators will need to address challenges such as interoperability and systemic risks.\n\nOn December 4, the House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled, \u201cInnovation Revolution: How Technology is Shaping the Future of Finance.\u201d In a memorandum published before the hearing, committee staff previewed that a significant portion of the hearing focused on blockchain technology and digital assets, which the committee sees as potential building blocks for the next generation of internet technology.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency comments on crypto volatility in remarks before Committee on Financial Services. On November 20, Michael J. Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, provided an update on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety and soundness of national banks and federal savings associations. He discussed the state of the federal banking system, highlighting that the overall condition remains sound with strong levels of regulatory capital and sufficient liquidity buffers. Hsu emphasized the importance of safeguarding trust in the banking system and outlined four priorities: guarding against complacency, elevating fairness, adapting to digitalization, and managing climate-related financial risks. He noted that the OCC\u2019s focus on strong risk management has helped banks navigate challenges such as the crypto market downturn, rising interest rates, and commercial real estate concerns. The OCC has also been working on enhancing fairness in banking, modernizing the Community Reinvestment Act, reforming overdraft practices, and expanding financial inclusion through initiatives like Project REACh. Regarding cryptocurrency and digital assets specifically, Hsu highlighted the significant impact of the crypto market\u2019s volatility, noting that crypto lost over $2 trillion in value, leading to the failure of many players in the industry. He stressed the importance of strong risk management in preventing complacency and ensuring stability in the banking system amid such volatility. Hsu also discussed the challenges posed by the digitalization of banking, in which nonbank financial technology companies (fintechs) offer banking services, creating confusion and diffused accountability. He mentioned the bankruptcy of Synapse, a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) middleware firm that affected many consumers when they were not able to access their money. Hsu voiced support for the Department of the Treasury\u2019s push for federal payments regulation and a chartering regime for nonbanks to close regulatory gaps and promote responsible innovation and competition.\n\nTreasury\n\n2024 FSOC report identifies digital currencies as source of financial instability risk. In December, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) published its annual report providing a comprehensive assessment of risks to US financial stability. The FSOC comprises heads of the Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and OCC, among others. The report highlights vulnerabilities in various sectors including commercial real estate, residential real estate, corporate credit, and digital assets. The report outlines the Council\u2019s activities, recommendations for enhancing market integrity, and responses to emerging threats. The report places significant emphasis on the growing market of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. As of July 2024, the global market value of crypto assets was just under $2 trillion. The FSOC highlights the risks associated with stablecoins, particularly their vulnerability to runs and the lack of a comprehensive federal prudential framework. The FSOC recommends that Congress pass legislation to address these risks, including regulatory requirements for reserves, capital, and reporting. The report also discusses the launch of new crypto asset exchange traded products (ETPs) and their potential to increase interconnections between the traditional financial system and the crypto asset ecosystem. Additionally, the FSOC notes the importance of monitoring the use of tokenized products and the potential financial stability risks they pose. Overall, it continues to advocate for enhanced regulatory oversight and data collection to better understand and mitigate the risks associated with digital assets.\n\nIn December, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) published its annual report providing a comprehensive assessment of risks to US financial stability.

IRS memorandum advises reporting assets frozen in bankrupt digital asset platforms as income. On November 1, in response to a taxpayer\u2019s request for advice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a memorandum providing advice \u201cregarding the proper year of inclusion of frozen digital asset rewards in gross income.\u201d According to the memorandum, a taxpayer who receives rewards, such as staking rewards, from a digital asset trading platform that files for bankruptcy in the same year, must still report those awards in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income even though the taxpayer has no access to those rewards while they remain locked in bankruptcy proceedings. The IRS justified this position on the basis that the rewards are credited to the customer\u2019s account as soon as they are distributed. Thus, the IRS acknowledged that rewards that are not distributed to a taxpayer before the company files for bankruptcy, or credit to the taxpayer subject to a lockup period, do not need to be reported until the taxpayer takes \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the rewards.\n\nOn November 1, in response to a taxpayer\u2019s request for advice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a memorandum providing advice \u201cregarding the proper year of inclusion of frozen digital asset rewards in gross income.\u201d According to the memorandum, a taxpayer who receives rewards, such as staking rewards, from a digital asset trading platform that files for bankruptcy in the same year, must still report those awards in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income even though the taxpayer has no access to those rewards while they remain locked in bankruptcy proceedings.

The Guidance Plan outlines 231 guidance projects that are priorities for the allocation of resources from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. It suggests the development of specific guidance related to digital assets \u2013 including regulations under Sections 6045A and 6050I \u2013 regarding information reporting of transactions involving digital assets between \u201cbrokers.\u201d Additionally, the Guidance Plan further suggests developing guidance under Sections 1001 and 1012 involving token wrapping.\n\nFDIC\n\nFDIC reports 4.8 percent of US households use or hold digital currency. On November 12, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published the results of its 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households. According to the FDIC\u2019s press release, the nation\u2019s overall rate of households without a bank or credit union account hit a record low of 4.2 percent, representing 5.6 million households. The survey also included questions about the use of crypto or digital assets to store and transfer money. The survey found that in 2023, 4.8 percent of US households owned or used crypto or digital assets in the previous 12 months. 92.6 percent of these households held crypto or digital assets as an investment, while only 4.4 percent used digital assets as a form of payment.\n\nOn November 12, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published the results of its 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.

OCC meets with SIFMA to discuss FDIC proposal to restrict brokered deposits. On November 18, representatives from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) met with the FDIC and the OCC to discuss the FDIC\u2019s proposed rule on brokered deposits. According to the OCC\u2019s memorandum documenting the meeting, SIFMA representatives expressed concerns about the lack of supporting data for the proposed changes and recommended either withdrawing or significantly revising the proposal. They highlighted that the 2021 Final Rule had modernized restrictions on brokered deposits and created exceptions for broker-dealers providing sweep deposit services, which had resulted in a substantial reduction in reported brokered deposits. The new proposal, however, seeks to eliminate or narrow these exceptions without providing new data or studies to justify the changes, potentially reclassifying a significant portion of deposits and impacting institutions' capital and liquidity requirements. In response, the FDIC pointed to the failure of crypto company Voyager Digital to justify its plan to restrict insured depository institutions (IDIs) from accepting brokered deposits. Voyager was not considered a deposit broker due to its exclusive relationship with a single IDI, and the funds placed at Voyager were unsafely kept resulting in customer confusion about FDIC insurance coverage. Despite Voyager\u2019s failure, SIFMA representatives noted that Voyager\u2019s former IDI partner continues to operate without adverse impacts, indicating that the proposed changes may not address the actual risks associated with digital assets and related entities. The representatives argued that the proposal lacks a comprehensive cost and benefit analysis and does not sufficiently consider the implications for consumers and institutions involved with digital assets.\n\nOn November 18, representatives from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) met with the FDIC and the OCC to discuss the FDIC\u2019s proposed rule on brokered deposits.

Committee on Capital Markets Regulation weighs in on FDIC\u2019s proposed brokered deposits rule. On November 13, the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, an independent research organization formed from leaders in several disciplines related to capital markets, submitted comments regarding the FDIC\u2019s proposed rule on brokered deposits. The Committee argued that the proposal\u2019s expanded definition of brokered deposits would increase banks\u2019 capital and liquidity requirements and deposit insurance premiums for many types of deposit arrangements. The Committee expressed that the proposal is fundamentally flawed, stating that it fails to consider relevant evidence; reverses a prior agency action without a rational basis; and does not acknowledge the costs it would impose on the banking system, financial intermediaries, and their customers. As a result, the Committee recommended that the FDIC withdraw the proposal and maintain the existing regulations established in 2020. In particular, the Committee\u2019s comments mention the failure of Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which held the deposits of customers of the crypto company Voyager Digital, which failed in 2022. The FDIC\u2019s proposal acknowledges that Metropolitan Commercial Bank was put at risk because it held deposits of Voyager customers, indicating that such arrangements create legal, operational, and liquidity risks for the bank if the broker fails. However, the Committee argues that the bankruptcy of Voyager does not support the conclusion that these depository arrangements create these risks, as Metropolitan Commercial Bank did not experience distress as a result of Voyager\u2019s failure. Instead, the bank has apparently enjoyed increased profitability and improved capital ratios since Voyager\u2019s failure in 2021. The Committee\u2019s comments join similar arguments from industry representatives such as the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), Better Markets, and Charles Schwab.\n\nCFTC\n\nCFTC\u2019s Global Markets Advisory Committee advances recommendation on tokenized non-cash collateral. On November 21, the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) of the CFTC advanced a recommendation to expand the use of non-cash collateral through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT). The recommendation provides a legal and regulatory framework for how market participants can apply their existing policies, procedures, practices, and processes to support the use of DLT for non-cash collateral in a manner consistent with margin requirements for both cleared and non-cleared derivatives, subject to specified conditions and limitations designed to mitigate credit, market, and liquidity risks. The recommendation was approved without objection.\n\nOn November 21, the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) of the CFTC advanced a recommendation to expand the use of non-cash collateral through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT).

CFTC issues advisory related to clearing of options on spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. On November 15, the CFTC announced issuance of a staff advisory addressing the clearing of options on spot commodity-based exchange traded fund (ETF) products. The advisory notes that spot commodity ETF shares based on bitcoin have been listed and traded on national securities exchanges, and the SEC approved spot commodity ETF shares of Ethereum. CFTC staff states that \u201c[b]ecause \u2026 it is substantially likely that spot commodity ETF shares would be held to be securities, we believe that these shares listed on SEC registered national securities exchanges do not implicate the [CFTC\u2019s] jurisdiction, and therefore, the clearing of these options\u2026would be\u2026subject to SEC oversight.\u201d The advisory asserts that the CFTC \u201cdoes not have any more role regarding the clearing of these options.\u201d\n\nFINRA\n\nFINRA report addresses implications of the metaverse on the securities industry. In October, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) released a report entitled, \u201cThe Metaverse and the Implications for the Securities Industry,\u201d which explores the potential applications, challenges, and regulatory considerations of the metaverse for the securities industry. The report describes the metaverse as an immersive and interactive virtual world that blends digital and physical experiences and observes that financial institutions are increasingly interested in leveraging metaverse technologies for various purposes, including customer engagement, training, and data visualization. The report highlights the significant revenue opportunities in the metaverse, with projections of it contributing over $3 trillion to global GDP by 2031. The document also discusses the potential for the metaverse to transform business models and processes within the securities industry, emphasizing the importance of addressing privacy, cybersecurity, and compliance challenges. The report explores the role of digital assets within the metaverse, noting that the metaverse offers a lucrative environment for commerce, with users holding a total of $163 billion in digital payments, with assets like bitcoin, Ether, and Robux enjoying a strong preference among metaverse users. The document also highlights the regulatory scrutiny surrounding native tokens of decentralized platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland. Additionally, the report mentions the potential for metaverse payments to accelerate the shift towards digital commerce, influencing how investors interact with financial market professionals. The integration of wearable devices in the metaverse, for example, could lead to the collection of extensive user data, which financial services firms might use for customer acquisition and market research.\n\nFederal Reserve\n\nFederal Reserve issues annual Financial Stability Report. In November, the Federal Reserve published its annual Financial Stability Report, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the stability of the US financial system. The report focuses on vulnerabilities related to asset valuations, borrowing by businesses and households, leverage in the financial sector, and funding risks. It highlights that valuation pressures remain elevated in various markets, including equity, corporate debt, and residential real estate. The report specifically addresses the growth and risks associated with digital assets, particularly stablecoins. Stablecoins have grown substantially since last year\u2019s report. By the beginning of November 2024, the total market capitalization of stablecoins exceeded $170 billion, nearing the record high observed in April 2022. Despite their growth, the report emphasizes that stablecoins are structurally vulnerable to runs and lack a comprehensive federal prudential regulatory framework. The report suggests that while stablecoins currently have a relatively small footprint in the US economy, their rapid growth and potential to scale quickly pose significant risks to financial stability. The report calls for the Federal Reserve and other US government agencies to take steps to address these risks and enhance the resilience of the financial system against potential shocks from digital assets.\n\nIn November, the Federal Reserve published its annual Financial Stability Report, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the stability of the US financial system.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York issues report on risks of digital assets to financial stability. In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published an Economic Policy Review entitled, \u201cFinancial Stability Implications of Digital Assets.\u201d The review provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial stability risks associated with the digital asset ecosystem. It adapts the Federal Reserve\u2019s framework for assessing systemic risk in the traditional financial system to the digital asset ecosystem, focusing on vulnerabilities such as valuation pressures, leverage, funding risk, and interconnectedness. The review hypothesizes that fragility in the digital asset space could destabilize the broader financial system. The analysis covers various sectors within the digital ecosystem, including crypto assets, stablecoins, centralized crypto lenders, centralized crypto exchanges, and decentralized finance (DeFi). In addition, it discusses how stress in these areas could potentially spill over into the traditional financial system. The review notes that crypto assets, such as bitcoin and Ether, are prone to significant price declines, which can be amplified by the use of leverage and interconnectedness within the digital ecosystem. The document also discusses the risks associated with stablecoins, pointing to the collapse of TerraUSD (an algorithmic stablecoin) as an example. Centralized crypto lenders and exchanges are highlighted as additional sources of leverage and funding risk, with their failures potentially leading to broader financial instability. Additionally, the document explores the role of DeFi protocols in creating interconnectedness and leverage within the digital asset ecosystem. Despite these risks, the document concludes that the overall contribution of digital assets to systemic risk remains limited, though this could change as the digital ecosystem grows and becomes more integrated with traditional financial markets.\n\nIn November, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published an Economic Policy Review entitled, \u201cFinancial Stability Implications of Digital Assets.\u201d The review provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial stability risks associated with the digital asset ecosystem.

Governor Waller questions role of central bank digital currencies in public remarks. On November 12, Christopher J. Waller, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, delivered a speech at The Clearing House Annual Conference in which he discussed the roles of the private sector and the Federal Reserve in the payments ecosystem. Waller emphasized the importance of private sector innovation in providing goods and services efficiently, including in the payments system. He argued that government intervention should only occur to address market inefficiencies that cannot be resolved by the private sector alone. Waller provided a historical overview of the US payments system, highlighting the evolution from state-chartered banks to the establishment of the Federal Reserve, which was created to address coordination problems and enhance the resilience of the payments system. He noted that the Federal Reserve\u2019s role includes providing core clearing and settlement infrastructure, which supports private sector innovation. Waller then addressed ongoing public discussion about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He questioned the necessity of a CBDC, asking what specific market inefficiency it would address. Despite his interest in new payment technologies, Waller expressed skepticism about the need for a CBDC, stating he had not yet heard a satisfactory answer to justify its implementation. He highlighted the private sector\u2019s role in developing and deploying new technologies, including digital assets, due to their ability to take on innovation risks and efficiently allocate resources. Waller also referenced the Federal Reserve\u2019s engagement with the private sector and other central banks through initiatives like the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Project Agor\u00e1, which explores the use of tokenization technology to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments.\n\nOn November 12, Christopher J.

Governor Waller suggests blockchain technology could improve efficiency and reduce costs. On October 18, Federal Reserve System Governor Christopher J. Waller delivered remarks at The Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop. Waller discussed the roles of centralized finance and DeFi, including his views on whether they are substitutes or complements. He highlighted the historical context of centralized finance, emphasizing the role of intermediaries or middlemen in facilitating financial trades and the associated costs and benefits. Waller explained that centralized finance has provided significant value through efficient matching of buyers and sellers, risk assessment, and legal enforcement, but it also comes with transaction costs and the need for trust in intermediaries. He noted that technological innovations, such as the telegraph, telephone, and internet, have historically advanced financial trading, and that the next wave of innovations could address some drawbacks of centralized finance. Waller then focused on the emergence of crypto assets and their impact on DeFi. He described the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts: crypto assets, the technology facilitating their trade (including smart contracts and tokenization), and the blockchain for recording trades and ownership. He explained that the earliest digital asset, bitcoin, was designed to function without intermediaries, relying on cryptographic technology for privacy and control. Waller discussed how technologies like DLT, tokenization, and smart contracts could complement centralized finance by improving efficiency and reducing costs. He also mentioned stablecoins, which aim to provide a stable value for trading and reduce the need for payment intermediaries. He cautioned, however, that stablecoins face risks similar to other substitutes for genuine US dollars. Ultimately, Waller concluded that while some services emerging through DeFi cannot be provided by centralized finance, the technological innovations from DeFi are largely complementary and have the potential to enhance centralized finance.\n\nOn October 18, Federal Reserve System Governor Christopher J. Waller delivered remarks at The Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop. Waller discussed the roles of centralized finance and DeFi, including his views on whether they are substitutes or complements. He highlighted the historical context of centralized finance, emphasizing the role of intermediaries or middlemen in facilitating financial trades and the associated costs and benefits. Waller explained that centralized finance has provided significant value through efficient matching of buyers and sellers, risk assessment, and legal enforcement, but it also comes with transaction costs and the need for trust in intermediaries. He noted that technological innovations, such as the telegraph, telephone, and internet, have historically advanced financial trading, and that the next wave of innovations could address some drawbacks of centralized finance. Waller then focused on the emergence of crypto assets and their impact on DeFi. He described the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts: crypto assets, the technology facilitating their trade (including smart contracts and tokenization), and the blockchain for recording trades and ownership. He explained that the earliest digital asset, bitcoin, was designed to function without intermediaries, relying on cryptographic technology for privacy and control. Waller discussed how technologies like DLT, tokenization, and smart contracts could complement centralized finance by improving efficiency and reducing costs. He also mentioned stablecoins, which aim to provide a stable value for trading and reduce the need for payment intermediaries. He cautioned, however, that stablecoins face risks similar to other substitutes for genuine US dollars. Ultimately, Waller concluded that while some services emerging through DeFi cannot be provided by centralized finance, the technological innovations from DeFi are largely complementary and have the potential to enhance centralized finance. Federal Reserve Governor Bowman encourages community banks to experiment with crypto assets ecosystem. On October 2, Michelle W. Bowman, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, delivered a speech at the 2024 Community Banking Research Conference, emphasizing the importance of community banks and proposing a tailored regulatory and supervisory framework for their future. Bowman discussed the challenges of current regulatory thresholds, which often fail to account for economic growth and inflation, leading to unintended regulatory burdens on smaller banks. She also stressed the importance of innovation within the banking sector, including partnerships with fintech companies and the use of digital ledger technology, while cautioning against regulatory frameworks that might stifle such innovation by pushing smaller banks into higher compliance tiers. Bowman acknowledged the evolving financial landscape and the role of innovation, including the provision of traditional banking services to entities involved in the crypto asset ecosystem. She noted that innovation, such as engaging in bank-fintech partnerships and considering the use of digital ledger technology, presents challenges for both regulators and banks, but emphasized that regulatory thresholds should not discourage investment in innovation among community banks. She also highlighted the need for clear and actionable guidance to help community banks navigate the complexities of third-party risk management, including those related to digital assets.\n\nSTATE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nDigital assets\n\nCalifornia passes law imposing new requirements for sellers of \u201cdigital goods.\u201d On September 24, California Governor Gavin Newsom approved Assembly Bill 2426 (AB 2426), which addresses situations in which digital media sellers, such as game publishers, revoke consumer access to purchased digital goods without recourse. The law mandates that sellers of digital goods (including movies, apps, games, books, and music) must clearly communicate what consumers are actually receiving when they \u201cpurchase\u201d these items. Under the new law, sellers must either obtain an affirmative acknowledgment from buyers that they are only receiving a license, including all applicable restrictions, or provide a clear and conspicuous statement that the purchase is only a license, with access to full details of the license. The law excludes subscription-based services, free digital content, and digital goods that cannot be revoked after the transaction. Though AB 2426 does not explicitly address non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other blockchain-based digital assets, NFTs could fall under the law\u2019s scope if the digital asset is considered a \u201cdigital good\u201d ownership, which could be revoked by the seller. Sellers must ensure compliance with the new requirements by January 1, 2025 to avoid regulatory penalties or false advertising claims.\n\nOn September 24, California Governor Gavin Newsom approved Assembly Bill 2426 (AB 2426), which addresses situations in which digital media sellers, such as game publishers, revoke consumer access to purchased digital goods without recourse.

California amends and delays implementation of the Digital Financial Assets Law. On September 29, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1934 which amends the previously-passed Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL). The amendment extends the deadline for digital asset companies operating in California to obtain a license to operate in the state for an additional year until July 2026. The amendment also imposes new requirements for digital asset companies to maintain monthly compliance records and clarifies provisions related to stablecoins.\n\nOn September 29, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1934 which amends the previously-passed Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL).

Pennsylvania House advances bill to endorse framework for use and custody of digital assets. On October 28, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill entitled, \u201cThe Digital Assets Authorization Act,\u201d which establishes a legal framework for the use and custody of digital assets within the state. The act defines key terms such as \u201cblockchain,\u201d \u201cblockchain protocol,\u201d \u201cdigital asset,\u201d and \u201chardware wallet.\u201d A digital asset is characterized as a decentralized virtual currency, cryptocurrency, or native electronic asset (including decentralized stablecoins or NFTs), but explicitly excludes central bank digital currencies or any other government-controlled digital-only assets. The act prohibits the state or any municipality from restricting or impairing the ability of individuals or businesses to accept digital assets as payment for legal goods and services, or to maintain self-custody of digital assets using self-hosted or hardware wallets. Additionally, it prevents the imposition of additional taxes or charges on digital assets solely based on their use as a payment method. The act also authorizes the operation of nodes for connecting to blockchain protocols and transferring digital assets on these protocols. It ensures that the provisions of the act do not override existing laws related to commercial code, fiduciary access to digital assets, licensing and regulation of virtual currency businesses, and the reporting and disclosure of financial exploitation or fraud. The act aims to create a supportive environment for the use and development of digital assets and blockchain technology in Pennsylvania, promoting innovation while ensuring compliance with existing legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND LITIGATION\n\nFEDERAL\n\nSecurities\n\nSEC charges entities operating Mango Markets crypto trading platform.

On October 10, Bitnomial Exchange LLC filed a complaint against the SEC in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Bitnomial challenges the SEC\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over its planned listing of XRP Futures, a futures contract based on the digital asset XRP. Bitnomial argues that the SEC is incorrect to take the position that XRP is a security that would require it to comply with additional SEC regulations, including registering as a national securities exchange. Instead, the complaint alleges that XRP Futures should be regulated solely by the CFTC, under whose jurisdiction Bitnomial has already self-certified the product. Bitnomial argues that precedent from the Southern District of New York establishes that XRP is not inherently a security when traded on secondary markets, which is the context for XRP Futures. The company alleges that the SEC\u2019s position imposes unnecessary regulatory burdens and hinders its ability to list XRP Futures, despite compliance with CFTC requirements. Therefore, it seeks a court declaration that XRP Futures are not security futures and an injunction to prevent the SEC from bringing an enforcement action.\n\nOn October 10, Bitnomial Exchange LLC filed a complaint against the SEC in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

In both cases, federal investigators managed to trace the funds and executed a seizure warrant in July 2024, freezing the USDT in a law enforcement-controlled wallet. Northern District of California finds DAO members can be held liable for securities violations. On November 18, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued a ruling that certain token holders of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are considered general partners under California law. This ruling means that these token holders can be held liable for securities law violations, such as the failure to register DAO governance tokens token as a securities with the SEC. The court denied a motion to dismiss in Samuels v. Lido DAO, affirming that DAOs can be held accountable for unregistered securities sales. The plaintiff, Andrew Samuels, had alleged that Lido DAO and its key investors violated Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 by selling unregistered securities. The court found that entities like Paradigm Operations, Andreessen Horowitz, and Dragonfly Digital Management acted as general partners by holding large voting blocks of Lido DAO tokens LDO and participating in the DAO\u2019s governance. This participation included influencing the development and operational decisions of Lido DAO. The court also highlighted that DAOs might be liable for soliciting token purchases on secondary markets, as seen in the Houghton v. Leshner case, decided in September 2023, where the same court ruled that members of Compound DAO could be held liable for failing to register COMP tokens as securities and for soliciting public investment. These rulings collectively emphasize that DAOs, despite their decentralized nature, are not immune from legal liability, and key investors who influence DAO governance can be held responsible for its actions.\n\nNFTs\n\nFederal judge approves $4 million settlement in Dapper Labs\u2019 NFT case. On October 18, Judge Victor Marrero of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York approved the final settlement between Dapper Labs, Inc. and a class of plaintiffs, which included NBA Top Shot Moments, between June 15, 2020 and December 27, 2021.

Second Circuit Court of Appeals hears arguments in MetaBirkins appeal. On October 23, a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard arguments on whether Mason Rothschild, who goes by the name Sonny Estival, infringed Herm\u00e8s International's trademarks with his \u201cMetaBirkins\u201d NFTs. The case, which has been ongoing for years, centers around the artistic intent and trademark use of Rothschild\u2019s digital assets. A jury previously found Rothschild liable for trademark infringement, influenced by his statements that the NFTs were \u201cdigital commodities\u201d and a \u201cgold mine.\u201d Questioning from Judges Denny Chin and Raymond J. Lohier Jr. appeared sympathetic to Herm\u00e8s, probing whether Rothschild was leveraging Herm\u00e8s\u2019 goodwill for his own benefit. Rothschild\u2019s attorneys compared his work to Andy Warhol\u2019s Campbell's Soup Cans, arguing that his NFTs blur the line between art and business. The judges appeared to grapple with application of Rogers v. Grimaldi, which protects artists\u2019 First Amendment rights, and its relevance in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 ruling in Jack Daniel\u2019s Properties v. VIP Products LLC, which suggests that Rogers does not apply if a trademark is used as a \u201cdesignation of source\u201d for goods. Judge Chin questioned whether Rothschild\u2019s use of the Birkin mark served as a source identifier, while Judge Lohier expressed skepticism about accommodating First Amendment interests under the Jack Daniel\u2019s framework. Judge Pierre N. Leval, however, appeared persuaded that Rothschild was acting as an artist rather than a merchant, suggesting that his statements were more about homage than deception.\n\nIllicit finance\n\nDOJ disrupts billion-dollar money laundering network.

On November 26, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash, a popular cryptocurrency mixer. The court concluded that immutable smart contracts, which Tornado Cash uses to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions, do not qualify as \u201cproperty\u201d under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Fifth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, which eliminated broad Chevron deference to agency interpretations of statutory text. The Fifth Circuit emphasized that immutable smart contracts cannot be owned or controlled, and thus, do not meet the statutory definition of property. The case arose after OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging it was used to launder over $7 billion in cryptocurrency, including funds stolen by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group. The sanctions included adding Tornado Cash and its immutable smart contracts to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, effectively banning US persons from engaging with the service. The Fifth Circuit, however, found that these immutable smart contracts, being unchangeable and unremovable, do not constitute property as they cannot be owned or controlled by any party. The court also observed that these smart contracts do not qualify as \u201ccontracts\u201d or \u201cservices\u201d under OFAC\u2019s regulatory definitions. This decisi"

            "article_content": "Since the term hit three years ago, the media has grabbed on, and in 1986, just about anyone can describe *** yuppie. Somebody who makes over $30,000 *** year, lives in Hyde Park and drives *** BMW, *** person that drives *** BMW and eats out every night, to be *** yuppie and to be *** true yuppie, you have to go along and do things that someone else says is important for you to do. So what is *** yuppie really? Well, the proper definition. She is *** young urban professional of either sex who meets the following criteria resides in *** major city, claims to be *** baby boomer between 25 and 45, lives on aspirations of glory, prestige, social status, and money. Anyone who brunches on the weekend or works out after work. *** yuppie thinks World War II was fought over Volkswagen Rabbits and Toyotas. Variations of yuppies include buppies, black urban professionals, puppies, Hispanic urban professionals, guppies, gay urban professionals, yuppies, Japanese urban professionals, and puppies, pregnant urban professionals. Some of the yuppies' favorite words are mesquite. Disc as in floppy or digital or K as in floors, not margarine, sports medicine, and of course user friendly. Now *** sure way to spot *** yuppie is by the cars they drive and the food they eat. Let's just call it yuppy chow. It includes anything on *** menu you can't pronounce or anything raw like broccoli or or raw fish. You see, the yuppie theory is to eat the food raw and then immediately jump in the jacuzzi. That way it cooks inside your body. What about you? Are you one? Well, here's *** test to see. Question number one. Have you ever ordered tofu substitute instead of ice cream, even though you knew deep down the tofu had just as many calories? Question 2. Have you ever bought *** product solely because it had *** brand name you couldn't pronounce? Question number 3. Have you ever gone out of your way to find Linguini or vermicelli, even though you knew it was the same thing as spaghetti? And question number 4, have you ever spent hours agonizing over why Jane Fonda married Tom Hayden, even though Woody Allen is still available? Well, if you answered yes to any of these, you're *** hopelessly addicted yuppie, which, by the way, is *** thing of the past for two reasons. The first is purely economic. Consider this While only 4% of all baby boomers make over $45,000 *** year, The demand for luxury goods and services is at an all-time high. So too is consumer debt, up 18% in the last year alone. When the ad said by, the yuppies said yup, and now they're out of cash. The second reason is the fact that the yuppie is *** trend, *** trend that has gone the way of all trends. As *** trend moves across the country and it finds its way into the local high schools, for instance. The trendsetter is off somewhere else. So what trend is around the corner? What I detect is *** much more conservative kind of trend running through this country. It's *** trend that says home values are more important, religious values are more important. The profit line is not as important as it used to be. There is *** trend in the country right now. Maybe away from some of the pain connected with buying and buying and buying and maybe the low level of pleasure that comes out of that. No matter what the current trend is, one day the pendulum will swing toward consumerism again, and when the baby boomers are called senior citizens, the chances are when the TV says bye, they'll say it right now. Michael Collins, news tonight.\n\nAdvertisement How the English language has changed in 2024 Share Copy Link Copy\n\nEach year, new words find their way into the general American English lexicon. Even if we try to avoid them, these new slang terms are spreading and being used all around us.Related video above: RETRO SLANG: Do you know what a yuppie is?While it used to be that language mostly evolved through watching TV programs, listening to the radio and slowly adopting terms through conversation, now language is evolving through the reception of viral, one-minute videos. And as more and more people spend time on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, more and more videos are gaining levels of popularity that used to be rare to achieve. Through this increased interaction with others, language is changing faster than many can track.The impact of social media on languageSocial media has transformed much of how we communicate in 2024. According to Statista, 5.22 billion people (63.8% of the world\u2019s population) use social media. That\u2019s up from 4.7 billion in 2020 and a far cry from the 2.79 billion in 2014, according to statistics gathered by Our World in Data.While social media used to be a niche method of communication, it is now a fully integrated function in everyday life \u2014 and its effect on how we interact with each other is vast.\u201cUnlike traditional media, where language change often trickled down from elite cultural centers, social media allows users from diverse backgrounds to participate in and influence linguistic trends,\u201d Tony Dembe wrote in \u201cThe Impact of Social Media on Language Evolution.\u201dThese diverse backgrounds can be based on age, location, hobbies or which social media platform one regularly uses. For instance, the term \u201cskibidi\u201d was popularized in large part by younger consumers who watched the immensely popular YouTube series \u201cSkibidi Toilet.\u201d\u201cRizz,\u201d on the other hand, gained traction through its use by viewers of the Twitch streamer Kai Cenat, who Dictionary.com credits with inventing the term.The trending word \u201cdemure\u201d is attributed to Jools Lebron, who redefined the term in a series of viral TikTok videos this year.While social media is a common thread in the rise of popularity for these terms, the specific platforms they originated from vary. But with the increased use of social media, these consumer subdivisions can easily overlap through just the click of a button, providing a quick and effective way for slang to spread and influence the general population.New language adopted in 2024While some may have been able to avoid adopting the new terms popping up around the country, their usage is becoming more normalized as the world attempts to keep up with how fast these words are being rolled out.The redefined \u201cdemure\u201d hit new heights of fame after being popularized by Lebron this summer, becoming Dictionary.com\u2019s 2024 Word of the Year with only a few months to achieve the title. \u201cDemure\u201d saw a \u201c1200% increase in usage in digital web media alone\u201d after Lebron redefined the term from its original meaning \u2014 reserved or modest \u2014 to refined and sophisticated. While oftentimes these new words and phrases can remain niche or specific to certain communities, \u201cdemure\u201d was able to quickly break out and enter the general English lexicon.The term has been used by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Penn Badgley. It was also employed by the White House in a post on X regarding the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s efforts to cancel many people\u2019s student debt. Its popularity even sent Lebron to the big screen, opening the door for the TikTok star to make an appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d The term\u2019s expansive reach has certainly made its new definition widely known, if not cemented in history.Similarly, the term \u201cunalive\u201d has grown out of its original corner of the internet. The term is a common example of \u201calgospeak,\u201d which refers to words and phrases used to avoid the censorship levied on some social media platforms. \u201cUnalive\u201d became code for \u201cdead\u201d and was often used in discussions of homicides, mental health and suicide.While the word could have stayed platform-specific, depending on which moderation systems flagged the more standard terms referring to death, \u201cunalive\u201d quickly became used in general conversations. Even more surprising, the term created controversy when \u201cunalive\u201d was reportedly used on a placard describing Kurt Cobain\u2019s death at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. The placard read, \u201cKurt Cobain un-alived himself at 27,\u201d a phrasing that many found disrespectful of the former lead singer of Nirvana. While the museum seemingly revised the placard to use the phrase \u201cdied by suicide\u201d instead of the slang term, according to a report by CNN, the initial use of the term in such a formal setting may suggest that social media-based slang is in the process of being less stigmatized as it\u2019s adopted by the general population. However, there is clearly still a long road ahead before it is officially welcomed into the English language.The social media generationsFor insight into how language is changing and how it may evolve in the future, look no further than Generation Alpha.While Generation Z grew up alongside the evolution of the internet, smartphones and the beginning of social media, Gen Alpha is growing up with more advanced social media systems already integrated into regular life.\u201cI think that their generation right now is social media natives,\u201d Payton Miller, a member of Gen Z and an eighth-grade English teacher, said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m noticing a difference between the 12th graders that I had, who would use words that I recognized from social media and especially TikTok, but it seemed to not come as naturally to them. But these kids are 13. \u2026 They consistently use social media as, like, a way to communicate and have for a really long time.\u201dBecause of their exposure to social media, you may have heard many members of Gen Alpha use terms that used to be alien to most English speakers, such as \u201cskibidi,\u201d \u201cglizzy\u201d and \u201csigma.\u201dWhile some of these new terms seem to have no meaning, such as \u201cskibidi\u201d and \u201csigma,\u201d which appear to have shed their original definitions, others are simply replacements for words or concepts that are already known.\u201cEvery 15 seconds, something that already exists has a new name,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cEvery day, there are new things happening, and because kids are sponges, they can change with it.\u201dWith social media\u2019s tendency to promote quick, short-form content, videos using new slang terms are being consumed at higher rates, causing their audiences to learn new words faster than with traditional media like TV and theater.And this audience is, in large part, composed of Gen Alpha. According to the Pew Research Center, across the platforms of YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook, \u201cone-third of teens use at least one of these sites almost constantly.\u201d\u201cNow, more than before, there is, like, such a quick evolution of language, and it happens almost instantaneously,\u201d Miller added. \u201cAnd language has always been, like, a living, breathing thing, but it happens so fast now.\u201dWith this common consumption of social media, a sense of community appears to have grown out of the shared understanding of these new terms \u2014 and with it, a clear distinction between those in the know and those who are not.\u201cThey all seem to, like, have it instantly. If one kid is saying something, they all know what that person means, even if I\u2019ve never heard it in my life,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey can say stuff that to me, as, like, a Gen Z person, is completely, like, incomprehensible. But they know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201dThis is similar to when Gen Z and Millennials used terms and phrases like \u201cOK, boomer\u201d to draw a line between them and the baby boomer generation. Language can be a unifying tool as much as it can provide a sense of independence from those who can\u2019t understand it. In this context, not much has changed.But the quantity of new words entering circulation and the speed with which they spread can be confounding, and, unsurprisingly, the slang is being met with resistance. Social media\u2019s influence on language is often attributed to the newly popularized term \u201cbrain rot,\u201d Oxford\u2019s 2024 Word of the Year, which commonly refers to the negative impacts of overconsuming online content. Through this lens, many believe language is deteriorating, being too easily influenced by unintelligent sources.It\u2019s hard to determine how language will continue to evolve from here as social media continues to grow and technology advances, but for now, it seems keeping up with its changes is difficult to manage without a constant online presence or a personal Gen Alpha tutor.The constant we can rely on, however, is that language will always be subject to the creativity of those who use it, even if it can be difficult to keep up with.If you want to do more research, here are some new, redefined or resurfacing words and phrases that you can look further into:BrainrotBrat Fanum taxFeltGlazingGlizzy GyattI'm going to crash outMewingMoggingOhioRizzStood on businessYapping"

            "article_content": "A study on wound healing, led by researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK and COMSATS University in Pakistan, earlier this year made a remarkable discovery that can prove to be a potential new treatment for hereditary-patterned baldness-a disorder that has affected millions across the world.\n\nThe breakthrough centres on deoxyribose, a sugar that occurs naturally in the human body, forming part of DNA's structure. In the first place, researchers were studying the sugar as related to the healing process in mice for skin wounds. To their surprise, they noticed accelerated fur growth around treated lesions compared with their untreated counterparts.\n\nMotivated by this unforeseen discovery, the research group widened their exploration to seek the possibility of deoxyribose's ability in promoting hair growth. While future studies are required for confirmation, the discovery still brings forth hopes for new therapeutic treatments in the fight against inherited baldness among both sexes. The findings of this discovery represent a long-awaited advance in addressing the most common cause of hair loss throughout the globe.\n\nIn a study published in June, it was shown that the deoxyribose sugar is as effective at regrowing hair as Minoxidil-an existing drug used to treat hair loss. However, the research offers a potential alternative approach to stimulating hair growth through a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar.\n\nProfessor Sheila MacNeil, Emeritus Professor of Tissue Engineering at the University of Sheffield, said: \"Male pattern baldness is such a common condition, affecting men all over the world, but at the moment there are only two FDA-licensed drugs to treat it. Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth.\"\n\n\"The research we have done is very much in early stages, but the results are promising and warrant further investigation. This could offer another approach to treating this condition, which can affect men's self-image and confidence.\"\n\nProfessor (Associate) Muhammed Yar (TI) of IRCBM, COMSATS University Pakistan, said: \"This pro-angiogenic deoxyribose sugar is naturally occurring, inexpensive, and stable, and we have shown it can be delivered from a variety of carrier gels or dressings. This makes it an attractive candidate to explore further for treatment of hair loss in men.\""

Over 830 million XRP coins were accumulated in the last 24 hours, indicating substantial demand from institutional investors. This accumulation has increased XRP\u2019s one-day trading volume to $18.67 billion, a 170% increase, and brought its one-month gains to a remarkable 141%. Technical analysts, including Ali Martinez, note XRP\u2019s bullish flag pattern, implying that a breach over $2.60 might spark a rapid rise above $4. According to prominent analyst Dark Defender, XRP will rise to $13 if it maintains crucial support levels at $2.52 and surpasses successive resistance points at $2.72, $5.85, and $8.76. The larger market boost from Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high and Ripple\u2019s enhanced market confidence following positive political and regulatory events support XRP\u2019s bullish thesis. With the upcoming introduction of stablecoin RLUSD and increased institutional interest, XRP remains a potential contender for major upward growth.\n\nPEPE: Whale Accumulation Indicates Breakout Potential\n\nPEPE, the popular meme coin, has seen massive whale accumulation this week, with large players investing $11.36 million in under 13 hours. A renowned trader named \u201cThe Old Man\u201d withdrew 375 billion PEPE tokens worth $8.98 million from Binance. The tokens were reallocated across various wallets, indicating intentional positioning for a possible price breakout. Further accumulation from two major whale wallets has increased buying pressure. One wallet purchased 230.1 billion PEPE tokens for $5.65 million at an average price of $0.00002455, while another added $5.71 million at $0.00002379. This activity reflects growing confidence among large investors, implying that PEPE is poised for a significant price increase. Market sentiment toward PEPE has shifted bullishly. Experts expect the coin to be 10x and delete a zero from its current price of $0.00002153 before the current bull cycle ends. The meme coin\u2019s increasing popularity and capacity to attract significant capital make it an essential player in the current market cycle.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe large accumulation of PEPE, XRP, and RXS tokens reflects increased investor optimism and indicates the possibility of 10x to 15x gains soon. Whale activity, bullish technical patterns, and key project developments have created the conditions for big gains in these assets. Rexas Finance remains the most promising potential, thanks to its revolutionary RWA tokenization platform, successful presale milestones, and significant market momentum. With the Tier-1 exchange launch approaching and investor confidence at an all-time high, RXS is poised to provide excellent returns to early adopters.\n\nFor more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:\n\nWebsite: https://rexas.com\n\nWin $1 Million Giveaway: https://bit.ly/Rexas1M\n\nWhitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf\n\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance\n\nThePrint BrandStand content is a paid-for, sponsored article.

            "article_content": "Ukraine's Zelenskyy says 3,000 North Koreans killed or wounded in Russia fighting\n\nLONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers are believed to have been killed or wounded fighting for Moscow in Russia's western Kursk region.\n\nZelenskyy posted to Telegram on Monday following a briefing by Kyiv's top commander -- Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi -- on the ongoing battle in Kursk, underway since Ukrainian troops launched a surprise cross-border incursion there in August.\n\n\"There are risks of sending additional soldiers and military equipment to the Russian army from North Korea,\" Zelenskyy said, vowing \"tangible responses\" to any such move. \"According to preliminary data, the number of killed and wounded North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region already exceeds 3,000 people.\"\n\nUkrainian special forces claimed on Monday to have inflicted more than 100 casualties among North Korean forces over three days of operations.\n\nKorean People's Army soldiers are pictured at Mansu Hill in Pyongyang, North Korea on Dec. 17, 2019. Kim Won Jin/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUkraine's Special Operations Forces branch claimed in a post to its official Telegram channel that 77 North Koreans were killed and 40 wounded in recent fighting.\n\nOn Sunday, the SSO posted photos of what it said were North Korean troops killed in Russia's western Kursk region. The SSO also uploaded photos of purportedly fabricated Russian military identity cards. ABC News was not immediately able to independently verify the images.\n\n\"Russia is trying to hide the presence of military personnel from North Korea by issuing them with fake documents,\" the SSO wrote.\n\nIt added that the documents \"do not have all the seals, photographs, the patronymics are given in the Russian manner and the place of birth is signed as the Republic of Tuva,\" the home region of Sergei Shoigu -- formerly Russia's defense minister and now the secretary of the Security Council.\n\nThe SSO said the signatures of the document owners were written in Korean, which it said \"indicates the real origin of these soldiers.\"\n\nU.S., South Korean and Ukrainian officials have said there are currently up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers inside Russia, deployed there primarily to help push Kyiv's forces out of positions taken in Kursk.\n\nUkrainian military sources told ABC News in November that North Koreans were expected to be among the 50,000 troops arrayed for a major counter-offensive in Kursk.\n\nThe deployment of troops marks a new milestone in North Korean support for Russia's war, Pyongyang already having supplied Moscow with ammunition and weapons -- including ballistic missiles -- since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that Kyiv has \"preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults -- a significant number of them.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence, meanwhile, has reported \"significant casualties\" among North Korean troops deployed on the front lines alongside Russian units.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends a ceremony in North Pyongan Province, North Korea, on Dec. 21, 2024 in this photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency. Kcna/via Reuters\n\nSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Monday that Seoul expects Pyongyang to send more troops and equipment to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea is preparing to rotate or increase the deployment of troops [in Russia], while currently supplying 240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery,\" said South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, as quoted by Yonhap.\n\n\"There are also some signs of [the North] moving to manufacture and supply suicide drones,\" the JCS said.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a drone production and test facility in November. Then, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Kim \"underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production.\""

            "article_content": "US Navy submarines are key to countering China's naval expansion in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nChina's military expansion includes a large navy, posing a threat to US naval dominance.\n\nUS submarines, despite challenges, maintain an edge with advanced capabilities and strategic roles.\n\nThe threat of a conflict with China has risen tremendously over the years. Beijing is undergoing some of the largest military expansion and modernization efforts since World War II, building a formidable arsenal of missiles able to threaten surface ships and massive naval force, but the US Navy still has the means to sink Beijing's dreams of supremacy in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US is looking to solutions like anti-ship missiles, but a key answer to China's expanding surface and logistics fleet that could number over 700 ships in a conflict is submarines.\n\nA Chinese Type 055 destroyer Photo by Artyom Ivanov\\TASS via Getty Images\n\nHunt and Sink\n\nThe US Navy would play a leading role in a potential conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. This region's vast maritime domain is ideal for naval and air operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina understands that, and Beijing has been investing heavily in its navy, the largest in the world according to the Pentagon. China has built three aircraft carriers with plans for more, possibly nuclear-capable flattops, new amphibious assault ships, and increasingly capable destroyers.\n\nWhere there are surface warships, there is an opportunity for submarines, and undersea capabilities are an area where the US maintains a clear edge over China, even as it strengthens its force and invests in anti-submarine warfare solutions.\n\nAn important role for the US submarine force in a conflict would be to hunt and sink Chinese warships and logistical vessels. Sailing routes around Taiwan and in the South China Sea would potentially be ideal hunting grounds for stealthy submarines like those operated by the US Navy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a war game conducted last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies simulating an intense fight over Taiwan, the think tank found that \"submarines were able to enter the Chinese defensive zone and wreak havoc with the Chinese fleet,\" but it also found the number of subs available was insufficient, indicating a need to prioritize these capabilities.\n\nA Chinese dual-carrier exercise in the South China Sea. People's Liberation Army\n\nAttack submarines can be deadly for enemy shipping and change the course of a war. The Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982 is a perfect recent example of the potential of submarines in a state-on-state conflict.\n\nDuring the war, the Argentine Navy transported men and weapon systems to the islands, creating a lifeline with mainland Argentina about 400 miles away. The Royal Navy went to war 8,000 miles away with six submarines leading the way, and they enforced an exclusion zone around the islands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the need arose, HMS Conqueror, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, sunk the ARA General Belgrano battlecruiser, one of the largest warships in the Argentine fleet. The shock of the sinking and the potential for further attacks forced the Argentine Navy to withdraw from the area, thus allowing the British ground forces to land unopposed.\n\nThe attack submarine USS Virginia departing Naval Submarine Base New London en route to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. US Navy photo/Petty Officer 1st Class Steven Myers\n\nSimilarly, US submarines could help disrupt or destroy a Chinese amphibious force heading to Taiwan and limit the movements of the Chinese navy across the theater of operations.\n\nSubmarines aren't unstoppable, though. Advances in anti-submarine warfare have made submarines increasingly vulnerable. For China's navy, ASW has been a growing priority to counter the American sub threat. Additionally, uncrewed undersea vehicles can also pose a threat and help detect prowling subs, as can underwater sensor systems like the US operates and China has looked to as added security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey can't stay under indefinitely without support. Munitions resupply \u2014 US subs are powered by nuclear force, meaning they don't have to refuel \u2014 is another challenge, especially in a high-intensity battlefield.\n\nAnd the US faces challenges maintaining its undersea advantage. A key priority in the Navy's fiscal year 2025 budget proposal was investment in the submarine industrial base.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSubmarine Fleet\n\nThe US Navy has the largest and most advanced submarine force in the world, with 71 vessels and a lot of variety. And given the challenges from China, much of that capability is in the Pacific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Navy's submarine fleet is comprised of attack, guided-missile, and ballistic-missile subs.\n\nThe Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Helena transiting the Atlantic Ocean. US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Rafael Martie/Released\n\nAttack subs are the staple of any submarine fleet. Their job is to find and sink enemy ships. The three classes of attack subs in the US fleet (Virginia, Los Angeles, and Seawolf) can do this by sailing stealthily underwater and firing torpedoes and cruise missiles. The Navy has 53 attack subs.\n\nGuided-missile submarines support ground and naval forces by firing long-range munitions, but they can also sink enemy shipping via torpedoes. Each of the four Ohio-class guided-missile subs on the active fleet can pack over 150 Tomahawk cruise missiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, ballistic-missile submarines make up America's maritime arm of the nuclear triad. The 14 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines carry 20 Trident II ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads each. Although the subs also pack torpedoes like their attack and guided-missile siblings, the main mission of ballistic-missile subs is to rain down destruction in the event of a nuclear conflict.\n\n\n\n"

Our top priority for 2025 is to continue building and delivering high quality mixed tenure new homes for our partners and private customers, and to do our part in addressing the country's acute housing shortage,\u201d said Greg Fitzgerald, executive chairman and chief executive at Vistry in a statement."

            "article_content": "As part of a temporary stopgap government funding measure passed last week, Congress also approved a one-year extension of the Farm Bill.\n\nWhile the Farm Bill is seen as-must pass legislation by all sides in Congress, Congressional leaders still struggled to reach a compromise over the last two years, leaving farmers relying on outdated provisions approved in 2018, well before the COVID pandemic, the increases in operating costs, and a number of natural disasters.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo, the only Coloradan on the House Agriculture Committee, was disappointed that the 118th Congress was not able to \u201ccraft a farm bill that meets the moment for Colorado\u2019s farmers, rangers and agriculture industry.\u201d\n\nStill, Caraveo stressed what this latest continuing resolution does have: $10 billion in market relief for farmers and $21 billion in agricultural disaster aid. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the work we\u2019ve done in this area and that we were able to secure key wins for farmers and ranchers across the Front Range and Northern Colorado,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nColorado\u2019s farm and agriculture advocates see the extension as a short reprieve for their industry.\n\n\u201cFor many farmers, the corresponding disaster package will be the difference for planting for another year, and [the Colorado Farm Bureau] was pleased to see excessive heat included as a qualifying disaster,\u201d said Ashley House, Vice President of Strategy and Advocacy for the Colorado Farm Bureau. She also pointed out that $2 billion has been set aside for livestock producers who suffered losses in 2023-24.\n\nAs for the economic aid, the House estimated that around $170 million would go to help Colorado corn, wheat and barley growers.\n\nRocky Mountain Farmers Union President Chad Franke said the aid is welcome.\n\n\u201cBetween pricing, the natural disasters, and just the overall cost of everything nowadays, this past year has been really rough on most of our family farmers,\u201d Franke explained. \u201cI\u2019ve got some members \u2026 they really wonder if their bankers are gonna give them a line of credit to farm again next year. That\u2019s how serious it is. It\u2019s not, \u2018We\u2019re not making enough money.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018we may be done farming.\u2019\u201d\n\nThroughout 2024, farmers in Colorado and across the country were urging Congress to complete work on the bill that sets national agriculture and food policy for the next five years. The 2018 version expired in 2023 and is now starting its second one-year extension.\n\nTalking about the lack of a bill this summer, Marc Arnusch of Arnusch Farms in Weld County said much has changed since 2018. \u201cThere's very little within my farm today that was the same as in 2018. Whether it was the cost of production, input prices, commodity prices, even the way we manage our farm has changed significantly since 2018. National ag policy needs to evolve with our evolving farms.\u201d\n\nWhile all of Colorado\u2019s Democrats voted for the CR with the Farm Bill aid and extension, Colorado GOP Reps. Lauren Boebert and Greg Lopez were among the 34 House members who voted no, while outgoing Rep. Doug Lamborn did not vote.\n\n\u201cWhile I support doing everything we can to help farmers and aid those impacted by recent hurricanes, I cannot accept a bill that does nothing to address our $36 trillion debt,\u201d Lopez said in a statement about his last vote of his short tenure as a congressman.\n\nAdvocates are already looking to the next Congress with the hopes that a full five-year Farm Bill can pass before the end of 2025.\n\nFranke said it\u2019s been \u201creally disappointing that we\u2019ve gone two years now with nothing but extensions on the Farm Bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like [Congress has] been taking their job seriously,\u201d Franke said. He added it\u2019s frustrating for those in agriculture. There were new programs debuted in the 2018 farm bill that need fixes and baseline pricing for farmers also need to be updated. \u201cIt\u2019s not an adequate safety net for those who produce our food.\u201d\n\nStill, he acknowledged the challenges in coming up with a compromise measure. It\u2019s not just farm policy, and the regional differences, that make the bill tricky to negotiate; it also covers food policy, research, conservation and more.\n\nThe Colorado Farm Bureau\u2019s House said one of the group\u2019s goals is to get greater attention \u201cto our specialty crop growers and their place in future economic aid packages\u201d so they remain in business.\n\nMore importantly, the House hopes the 119th Congress is able to provide \u201cthe modernized, five-year farm bill we truly need.\u201d\n\nFranke also hopes Congress gets a quick start on the issue in the new session to \u201cget us a good farm bill.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2024 Feeding the Economy report, Colorado\u2019s agriculture industry generated $178 billion in economic output and supported over 925,000 jobs.\n\nWhile the House Agriculture Committee passed its version of the Farm Bill out of committee, largely along party lines, the bill was never brought to the floor for a vote, in a tacit acknowledgment that it didn\u2019t have the votes to pass. Meanwhile, the Senate was not able to get a bill out of committee, let alone bring one to the floor.\n\nFor the first time, the Farm Bill was expected to top more than a trillion dollars. Among the major sticking points was how to pay for it and what changes it should make to SNAP, formerly known as food stamps."

The company recently updated its lineup of Cirrus7 Incus models to support AMD Ryzen 9000 series CPUs [h/t FanlessTech].\n\nSince our original coverage, the lineup has also been upgraded with Intel 14th Gen support, though the Ryzen 9000 series will likely be the more compelling choice for most users. Cirrus7 Incus' designs are all based directly on the ASRock DeskMini mini-PC designs, which use a custom Mini-STX motherboard and case\u2014though Cirrus7 is using a highly overhauled design for its passive cooling aims with Incus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCirrus7 highlights in its official documentation that the three distinct cooling designs (Standard Edition, Extended Cooling Edition, and Extreme Cooling Edition) are passive cooling solutions with thermal mass and case dimensions corresponding to intended workloads. The Extreme Cooling design is intended for full-time, high-wattage use with CPUs like the Ryzen 7 9700X, while the other designs are more appropriate for lower-power APUs. However, Extended Cooling or better is likely best for chips with a Radeon 780M iGPU or better.\n\n*Technically based on but considerably changed from various models of ASRock DeskMini mini-PCs, ranging from DeskMini X300 and DeskMini X600, which use AMD CPUs, and DeskMini B760, based on an Intel platform.\n\n**Any \"Cooling Edition\" can be used with any platform\u2014this distinction is made to illustrate dimension and I/O differences between otherwise identical PCs more clearly.\n\nThe cheapest starting configuration, including the full-fat Ryzen 9700X and Extreme Cooling Edition design, starts at 1076\u20ac Euros and includes 8GB of DDR5-4800 RAM and a 250GB Samsung 980 NVMe 3.0 drive. While the starting memory and storage specs are relatively humble, these specifications can be configured much higher, with plenty of storage configuration options available thanks to 4 total SSD connectors (2 SATA, 2 NVMe M.2).\n\nFor those who are fans of passive cooling and mini-PC designs, the Cirrus7 Incus may be a winner for its cooling capacity, compact size, and reasonably balanced aesthetics. The acceptable pricing will, of course, vary depending on the buyer. However, we recommend that those interested in PC gaming opt for an AM5 APU with an onboard Radeon 780M rather than a Radeon 7 9700X configuration with a weaker iGPU. Unfortunately, eGPU options don't look great with this mini PC, so be extra wary of the balance between CPU and iGPU you're picking at checkout."

If you tap an app icon on your phone, it should open. When you boot up your laptop, it should start in a reasonable amount of time. But that\u2019s not always how it goes. As your device ages, it often develops inefficiencies and quirks that make it slower and less reliable.\n\nNo device is immune to this kind of decline, yet certain brands have a reputation for building tech that performs reliably\u2014without crashes, slowdowns, or other glitches\u2014for longer periods. Others\u2026not so much. So, which brands should you buy from if you want tech you can depend on for the longest time?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a definitive answer to this question, we asked thousands of our readers to share their experiences and rate the products they depend on in our Readers\u2019 Choice surveys about , , and . In those surveys, conducted over the past year, our audience rated electronics manufacturers on a scale from 1 to 10 for reliability. Here\u2019s which brands come out on top.\n\nThe Best PC, Tablet, and Phone Brands for Reliability\n\nLaptops: MacBooks Are the Most Trusted\n\nIf you need a laptop you can count on, you\u2019d be wise to pick up a MacBook. Apple\u2019s laptops score nearly half a point higher than competing machines from any other brand. Apple\u2019s MacBooks are known for their longevity and seamless updates, making them favorites for students, creatives, and professionals.\n\nMSI comes in second for laptops, with Lenovo and Asus rounding out the top tier. All have respectable reliability scores, but nevertheless pale in comparison to Apple. MSI, however, excels in the gaming and performance space. If you prefer Windows, MSI is the way to go, but whether you\u2019re after a powerhouse for gaming or a workhorse for productivity, these brands won\u2019t let you down.\n\nFor more, read .\n\nApple Aces Laptops for Work\n\nWhile Windows-based machines have a reputation for being more business-oriented, PCMag readers suggest that Apple computers are the most reliable work machines.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\u2019s MacBook line scores well ahead of the big three PC manufacturers (Dell, HP, and Lenovo) here, with Dell in last place. Couple that with Apple\u2019s excellent scores for and in our companion stories, and it\u2019s obvious that office workers with Apple laptops are happier\u2014and with this level of reliability, they\u2019ll be using them for a long time.\n\nIT-Managed Laptops: HP Is the MVP in the Office\n\nWhat do the people who purchase and maintain laptops for big offices think? Well, they didn\u2019t think of Apple enough to rate them in our results\u2014they stick with the big three manufacturers. Of them, HP and Lenovo are deadlocked for the best reliability, according to IT managers. But thanks to the tie-breaker from the overall score earned in the same survey, the award goes to HP.\n\nBut when things are so close, anything could change in the future.

Apple desktop systems are a half point ahead of the nearest competitor in this category.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep in mind that if you're a Windows aficionado, the \u201creal\u201d winner after Apple is a PC you buy locally or build yourself. These DIY rigs score even higher than the next best PC vendor (Dell, in this case).\n\nApple system soundness stands out specifically in all-in-one computers as well. Dell and HP both score respectably, but the Apple iMac continues to set the standard. If you\u2019re looking for a sleek, space-saving machine that handles everything from work to creative projects, the trustworthy is a fantastic choice. It\u2019s a little pricier, but the build quality and reliability make it worth the investment.\n\nGamers Give the Nod to HP Desktops\n\nWhen it comes to non-portable PCs built for games, HP tops the reliability charts with a score of 9.4. Alienware and MSI aren\u2019t far behind, but self-built rigs once again shine the brightest with a 9.5.\n\nIf you\u2019re handy and want the best bang for your buck, building your own gaming PC is tough to beat. But if you're not into DIY, HP delivers an excellent mix of reliability and performance.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more, read .\n\nMacs Earn Workplace Trust in Desktops\n\nWhile Windows-based machines are know for being better-suited for most business applications, PCMag readers suggest that Apple computers are the most reliable work machines.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting (and somewhat surprising) that self-built computers are the real winner here, scoring even higher than Apple when it comes to reliability for work-focused machines. Building your own PC gives you full control over the components, which means you can prioritize quality and tailor everything to your exact needs. But if you don\u2019t want to mess with screwdrivers and thermal paste, Apple\u2019s prebuilt systems are a solid choice for reliability and performance.\n\nIT-Managed Desktops: Managers Prefer Lenovo\n\nDell, HP, and Lenovo are the biggest sellers of PCs in the US, especially because they sell in bulk to businesses. They might seem evenly matched in many ways, but when it comes to longevity, IT managers in our surveys specifically peg Lenovo as a bit more dependable. And that kind of thing on a fleet of desktop units can make all the difference.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat said, the Dell and HP numbers are respectable among IT professionals. There\u2019s a reason these brands are top sellers, after all. They make PCs that last, even when abused by staffers.\n\nFor more, read .\n\nPhones: Samsung Is the Most Reliable Brand for Home and Work\n\nApple, Google, and Samsung top our charts in phone reliability with a score of 9.1, tying for the lead. To break the tie and determine a single winner, we look at overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend scores, which means Samsung grabs the win.\n\nSo, what does that mean for you? If you\u2019re deep in the Apple ecosystem\u2014or just want a phone you can depend on\u2014iPhones are the way to go. That said, Google and Samsung phones are just as solid, according to our readership. As long as you buy from one of the Big Three mobile device manufacturers, you can rest assured that your phone will work well for a long time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor phones in the workplace, Samsung edges out Apple. It\u2019s not by a huge gap, but it\u2019s worth noting if you\u2019re buying for a business. Samsung\u2019s enterprise features and IT-friendly tools give it the edge. If you\u2019re looking to keep your team connected and productive, Samsung is the best bet.\n\nFor more, read our .\n\nTablets: Reliability Is Apple's Hallmark\n\nApple dominates the tablet scores with a 9.4. Samsung and Microsoft round out the top three, both with excellent reliability numbers, but not better than Apple\u2019s.\n\nIf you want a dependable tablet that will work well for years to come, the iPad is your best bet. Apple\u2019s seamless ecosystem, hardware quality, and regular software updates make it a no-brainer.

            "article_content": "Focusing on providing the Army with advanced intelligence, electronic warfare and sensor capabilities through agile acquisition is core to the PEO IEW&S mission. Processing, dissemination and exploitation of data and intel requires advanced sensors and systems, not to mention a robust and future-focused command and control environment.\n\nNext Generation Command and Control (NGC2) is the Army\u2019s new approach to develop a data-centric architecture for the commander to make more, faster, and better decisions, and ultimately reduce sensor to effector/shooter timelines.\n\nNGC2 is a fundamentally different approach to C2, not just in the capability itself, but also in how the Army is organizing to deliver and rapidly scale using cloud-native, trainable, open architecture design characteristics.\n\nPEO IEW&S\u2019 systems and programs are already designed around many of the NGC2 design principles, which should allow our systems to plug in and operate in the NGC2 environment.\n\nCloud native and Trainability\n\nOperating in the cloud environment isn\u2019t something new to the Intelligence community. As early adopters of cloud, seeing the value of it for storing and disseminating intelligence data, put them out in front. NGC2 aims to leverage the cloud environment to ensure command and control can be done to the edge.\n\nPEO IEW&S supports Next Gen C2 through military intelligence, Integrated Sensor Architecture and electromagnetic warfare capabilities. As the Army develops NGC2, the experiences of PEO IEW&S will serve as a model for the Army network enterprise, allowing for better data transfer, more accessibility for units with cloud service, and seamless integration of systems thanks to common architecture standards and design. (Photo Credit: (Image courtesy of PEO IEW&S) ) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nArmy Intelligence Data Platform (AIDP), managed by Project Manager Intelligence Systems and Analytics (PM IS&A), enables intelligence soldiers the ability to gather, analyze and distribute information to units faster and more accurately than ever before through its many features, ease of use and housing in the military intelligence cloud environment.\n\n\u201cWith all the intelligence data in the cloud, we\u2019re able to funnel it into one common spot,\u201d Col. Chris Anderson, PM IS&A said. \u201cAIDP in the cloud means you have a global common intel picture instead of just a regional one.\u201d\n\nThe Army\u2019s expansion into cloud environments is critical to enable modern, data-driven operations.\n\nAs NGC2 develops, the Army will begin integrating existing intelligence software applications as well as custom analytical capabilities to further enhance situational awareness and provide enhanced target data across all Mission Command applications.\n\nTraining soldiers on AIDP has been faster and easier than with past intelligence systems thanks to the cloud and because soldiers can access AIDP from anywhere and train anytime, anywhere.\n\nOpen Architecture\n\nPEO IEW&S project managers are no stranger to open architecture principles. They have been employing them along with open architecture best practices for years, working open architecture language into contracts to ensure the systems designed today will be able to plug and play with future systems and systems proliferated throughout the military branches.\n\n\u201cWe do a good job with contract language that encourages and enforces (Modular Open System Architecture) MOSA,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cOur HYDRA API in one of several API standards the Army is considering, and we\u2019re closely partnered with the Integrated Sensor Architecture (ISA) team to make sure all of our current and future platforms all talk to each other seamlessly.\n\nThe HYDRA API is a government-owned application programming interface, created to address data exchange across the PEO IEW&S portfolio. It enables developers\u2019 easier integration of new software onto the Army network while maintaining core capabilities. The Army expects to use several API standards to ensure flexibility as it conducts prototyping.\n\nISA is the connective tissue allowing sensors across domains and echelons to connect and communicate with each other. With ISA enabled sensors, Commanders have the ability to know what sensors they have access to and what each one can do for them. ISA is integrating into Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT-X) and Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN).\n\nSimplifying the complexity of military C2 through standard architecture and frameworks is a priority for the development of all systems moving forward.\n\nProject Manager Electronic Warfare and Cyber (PM EW&C) was an early adopter of C5ISR Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS) which informs EW systems. All PM EW&C programs are now designed with open systems architecture in mind, making plugging into a widely adopted framework like Tactical Assault Kit (TAK), seamless.\n\n\u201cUsing an underlying software architecture gives us a number of advantages,\u201d Ken Strayer, PM EW&C said. \u201cIt allows us to rapidly develop new capability on a mature framework that already has built in joint and coalition interoperability.\u201d\n\nEWPMT-X, PM EW&C\u2019s most direct contribution to NGC2 according to Strayer, is the C2 tool for the EW officer, supporting mission planning, situational awareness and processing sensor data.\n\n\u201cEWPMT-X will converge with the TAK framework allowing the system to be more widely used due to the widespread use of TAK across the Army,\u201d Strayer said.\n\nTAK serves as a versatile, field-proven framework for enhancing situational awareness, communication and decision making, all key elements for NGC2.\n\nProtection and NGC2\n\nPM EW&C, who specializes in all things electronic warfare and cyber, sees their role with NGC2 as one of providing protection. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) has become a key domain the Army wants to dominate. Controlling, dominating and understanding the spectrum will be critical for command and control to occur.\n\n\u201cAnother key contribution to NGC2 is the ability to see yourself in the spectrum,\u201d Strayer explained. \u201cSeeing ourselves is part of the equation, but our systems also provide the ability to identify threats that are going to keep units from being able to communicate.\u201d\n\nTwo EW systems critical to enable NGC2 and enhancement of commanders\u2019 decision making by means of the EMS are Terrestrial Layer Systems (TLS) BCT Manpack and Spectrum Situational Awareness System (S2AS).\n\nTLS BCT Manpack, which has entered into rapid fielding and is currently being equipped to brigade combat teams, enables brigades to understand their EMS environment, identify threats and ultimately communicate more effectively.\n\nS2AS is designed for commanders to see themselves in the spectrum and is planned for a start in FY25.\n\n\u201cCommanders will be able to see how they look in the spectrum and allow them to reposition or mask their own capabilities or limit their EMS signature,\u201d Strayer explained. \u201cThey can maintain the ability to communicate while also picking up any unknown things going on in the environment that may be impacting the Army\u2019s ability to communicate.\u201d\n\nThe lessons learned over the last few years by PEO IEW&S apply closely to what the Army is aiming to do with NGC2.\n\nThe expertise and experience at PEO IEW&S in applying these NGC2 characteristics across the intel, EW and sensor enterprise serves as a model/example for the entire Army network enterprise, allowing for better data transfer, more accessibility for units with cloud service, and seamless integration of systems thanks to common architecture standards and design. These cross-cutting solutions ultimately enable more robust and capable C2."

With it, every component is pluggable, scalable, replaceable, and can be continuously improved through agile development.\n\nIt is designed for seamless integration, so these modular solutions let businesses detach from legacy tools and freely choose the best-in-class technologies available. This composable, swappable architecture empowers companies to continuously evolve their digital ecosystems, piece by piece, without the need for disruptive, risky, and costly re-platforming projects.\n\nAccording to the MACH Alliance, a MACH approach enables businesses to stay agile and responsive within the fast-paced digital landscape. It not only provides the technical flexibility modern brands need to innovate but also cultivates an organizational culture that values experimentation.\n\nMACH began as a way to define technical architecture. It now enables organizations to transform their technology to future-proof their business, align their mindset and organizational culture, and further outpace competitors in an already digitally accelerated world, offered Casper Rasmussen, president of the MACH Alliance.\n\n\u201cMACH is designed to promote a business-first mindset. It offers adaptability, scalability, and agility, as this approach effectively \u2018composes\u2019 a digital ecosystem from small independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually, with a focus on realizing business outcomes,\u201d he told the E-Commerce Times.\n\nMACH\u2019s Edge Over Monolithic Platforms\n\nRasmussen noted that MACH\u2019s architecture differs from other technology stacks. It relies on an architecture mindset where all components are tightly integrated.\n\n\u201cThis inflexibility challenges adaptation, scaling, connection, and optimization of the digital experience,\u201d he cautioned.\n\nIn addition, organizations often need to limit their ambition and digital strategies to match the functions and limitations of a cumbersome, standardized technology mindset. Instead, technology has to be a core strategic asset of the business, a key differentiator and enabler.\n\n\u201cIf not, technology forces the business and brand to join the race to parity,\u201d said Rasmussen.\n\nDeep Dive Discovers Details\n\nWe asked Rasmussen to help us understand more of MACH\u2019s intricacies. He offered three primary benefits of adopting its principles.\n\nComposability: Empowering businesses to be more innovative and responsive to the needs of the business and market demands.\n\nEmpowering businesses to be more innovative and responsive to the needs of the business and market demands. Freedom to innovate and experiment: Modular designs and iterative execution allow teams to test different configurations without disrupting the entire architecture.\n\nModular designs and iterative execution allow teams to test different configurations without disrupting the entire architecture. Better interoperability: The Alliance rallies around standards to enable simplicity, brand adoption, and speed to market across the ecosystem.\n\nQ&A on Meeting Opportunities and Challenges in 2025\n\nTo further understand how MACH principles deliver measurable value, we asked Rasmussen to share his insights on their real-world impact and potential to address future challenges.\n\nE-Commerce Times: Although membership costs are not publicly disclosed, how should businesses value the ROI of adopting the MACH architecture?\n\nCasper Rasmussen: In the MACH Alliance 2024 Global Annual Research report, we observed that MACH adoption saw stable growth despite economic volatility. This is further evidenced by 85% of the respondents achieving ROI on their MACH investment.\n\nMACH enables an incremental approach that prioritizes outcomes over output. This mindset impacts how businesses quantify cost and investment in MACH, which thereby has to consider opportunity cost, efficiency gains in digital execution and activation, and technology investments.\n\nHow does MACH enhance the e-commerce experience and set companies up for success?\n\nRasmussen: MACH and composable approaches are business critical for modern e-commerce organizations to ensure they have the flexibility to innovate rapidly. The technology allows them to respond to market changes and customer demands while internally harnessing operational agility and efficiency.\n\nHow beneficial is the MACH stack to cross-industry adoption?\n\nRasmussen: The benefits of MACH and a composable approach extend far beyond e-commerce and retail. We see a wide range of successful use cases across diverse industries, including financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, travel and tourism, and high-tech. We have several case studies from brands such as Volkswagen in automotive, Unobravo in health care, Pllay in entertainment, and easyJet in travel and tourism.\n\nThese companies are looking to innovate, enhance customer experiences, and stay competitive in the digital landscape. The MACH stack\u2019s modular, flexible, and integrated approach makes it an appealing choice for businesses across diverse industries.\n\nThe growing adoption of the MACH stack across various sectors signals a strong market shift towards more agile and responsive systems that can accommodate a wide range of business needs and use cases.\n\nWhat obstacles did the Alliance solve along the way?\n\nRasmussen: MACH\u2019s initial use cases were limited to e-commerce and retail, but through the launch of our Industry Advisory Board earlier this year, the Alliance was able to leverage the experience and insights of knowledgeable industry leaders to develop the best path for expansion to wider industries and geographic markets.\n\nThis ongoing effort to broaden the MACH market and diversify the Alliance\u2019s focus has attracted several new member organizations outside of e-commerce. One such member is J.P. Morgan.\n\nWhat lies ahead for the Alliance?\n\nRasmussen: In July 2024, the Alliance established a Community Council of volunteers from its member organizations to champion collaboration, innovation, and diversity. It will work to expand the organization\u2019s membership and diversify it by forging alliances with industry associations, technology vendors, and consultancies.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, we want to expand Alliance membership into new and adjacent technology categories. The focus remains on ensuring MACH-certified vendors uphold our core criteria and commitment to the market.\n\nIn January, we will release our 5th Global Annual Research Report that speaks to over 500 brands across North America, the U.K./Europe, and APAC to better understand the evolving landscape of technology infrastructures. It looks at key topics and challenges for these leading brands to help understand the trends and insights related to adopting a MACH/Composable approach and achieving competitive advantages.\n\nAll this comes together at The Composable Conference by the MACH Alliance in Chicago in April 2025. This conference will provide tailored insights for attendees at any stage of their MACH journey."

            "article_content": "After Blake Lively\u2019s public filling against Justin Baldoni on Friday (20 December) which has shocked the Hollywood world this past few days, the complaint was later released showing shocking texts from Baldoni and his PR team.\n\nLively\u2019s filing accused Baldoni of sexual harassment, as well as supposedly starting a \u2018smear campaign\u2019 to attempt to 'destroy' her reputation after what she claimed is a feud borne out of alleged poor on set behaviour from her It Ends with Us co-star.\n\nBaldoni's lawyer has called the claims 'categorically false', and accused Lively of planting false stories about the actor and Wayfarer Studios, which he co-owns, in a 'another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe also denied the accusations of a smear campaign, adding: \"The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\"\n\nLively, however, denied the claim that she or her representatives had spread negative information about Baldoni or Wayfarer Studios, telling The New York Times: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d\n\nThe pair starred together in It Ends with Us, which Baldoni also directed (Sony)\n\nWhat are the accusations\n\nAccording to Lively's complaint, as shared by The New York Times, the Gossip Girl star alleged that Baldoni, who also directed It Ends With Us, and Jamey Heath, the film's lead producer, had changed the script following her commitment to the movie to include 'improvised gratuitous sexual content', as well as having a 'lack of boundaries', with Lively also accusing Baldoni of asking her 'intrusive questions' about her and her husband, Ryan Reynold's, sex life.\n\nAdvert\n\nOther allegations include comments about Lively's weight and her deceased father, Ernie Lively.\n\nLively also accused Baldoni and his team of allegedly instigating a 'social manipulation' campaign against her, with the complaint featuring messages between the producer and his team.\n\nBaldoni has been accused of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against Lively (Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)\n\nWhat did the text messages say\n\nAccording to the complaint, these texts seemed to show Baldoni\u2019s publicist, Jennifer Abel, allegedly discussing a strategy for a smear campaign against Lively with Crisis management specialist, Melissa Nathan.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe texts also include Abel claiming to Nathan that Baldoni wants to feel \u2018to feel like she can be buried\u2019 in an alleged reference to Lively.\n\nMeanwhile, another message from 5 August supposedly shows Baldoni sending Abel a Twitter thread about bullying accusations made towards Hailey Bieber, writing: \"This is what we would need.\"\n\nAnd Bieber isn't the only celebrity named in the complaint, as Taylor Swift also being named an alleged email from Baldoni's team in a 'scenario planning' document.\n\nHow they got the texts\n\nAs per Variety, the filing by Lively\u2019s team claim that the texts were acquired \u2018through legal process, including a civil subpoena\u2019 but didn\u2019t identify the specific source - before later clarifying that it was a subpoena issued by Jonesworks LLC.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey said via The Hollywood Reporter: \"The internal documents referred to in the complaint were produced subject to that subpoena. We expect that further details regarding the subpoena process will be disclosed during discovery.\"\n\nHowever, lawyer Bryan Freedman, who is representing Abel, Baldoni, Melissa Nathan, and Wayfarer Studios, has said that none of his clients received a subpoena.\n\nLively alongside her husband Ryan Reynolds (Cindy Ord/Getty Images)\n\nBaldoni's lawyer's response\n\nFreedman said that they planned to sue Abel's former boss, Stephanie Jones, telling Variety: \u201cIf all of the text messages were produced in that \u2018subpoena,\u2019 then Lively\u2019s team knows the true facts of what actually happened and did not happen.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe truth is completely different than what has been portrayed in the complaint and they know that.\n\n\u201cThe complete set of text messages unequivocally show that there was no smear campaign initiated at all which is why certain texts are incomplete and other texts, which tell the truth, are purposefully excluded.\u201d\n\nAn attorney hired by Jones, Kristin Tahler, also responded to this, claiming that her client was being used as a 'scapegoat' for having just responded to the subpoena.\n\n\u201cDesperate to shift attention away from their disgraceful sliming of Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni\u2019s team is doubling down on their smears by going after someone who had nothing whatsoever to do with this ugly campaign.\" Tahler told Variety.\n\n\u201cHaving pushed Steph Jones out of her long-standing business with Baldoni, Jen Abel and Melissa Nathan are now looking to scapegoat Steph for having the temerity to respond to a court-ordered subpoena. Unfortunately for them.\n\n\u201cSteph won\u2019t be bullied \u2013 even by paternalistic threats of being sued into oblivion.\n\n\u201cTo quote Nathan herself, \u2018it just shows you \u2026 people really want to hate on women.\u201d"
