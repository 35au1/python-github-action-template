Credit: James Fox\n\nThe report says 118 of the more than 700 cases were resolved during the reporting period. They were oftentimes attributed to being birds, balloons and other aircrafts. Many of the cases that weren\u2019t resolved may be due to a lack of photo evidence.\n\nNo reporters suffered any adverse health affects due to the spotted UFO\u2019s.\n\nAccording to the AARO, there is a geographical trend that shows many sightings are located near military bases.\n\nUtah study reveals the \u2018best\u2019 place for UFO sightings\n\nAbout 65% of reporters said they saw strange lights in the sky. Other reporters said they saw objects such as orbs, cylinders and triangles.\n\nOther reporters, who said the objects didn\u2019t fit into the aforementioned categories, said they saw things like a \u201cgreen fire ball,\u201d \u201ca jelly fish with [multicolored] flashing lights,\u201d and a \u201csilver rocket approximately six feet long.\u201d\n\nTo date, the reports states, none of the reports have produced \u201cevidence of extraterrestrial\n\nbeings, activity, or technology.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed the app's availability on X.\n\nThe Gemini app now gives iPhone users direct access to Google's AI chatbot through text, voice, or camera input. The best part is that it all happens without installing the main Google app.\n\nOne of the main features of Gemini is Gemini Live, which lets you chat naturally. That means it makes you feel like you're having a conversation with another human being on a call. You can pick from 10 AI voices and chat in languages like English, Spanish, French, German, or Hindi. I believe Gemini Live is Google's response to OpenAI's GPT4o. But I prefer the latter; it's more fluid than Gemini Live.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe app also offers extras such as AI image creation with Imagen 3, study help tools, and photo analysis features. It integrates with other Google apps through extensions, including YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Calendar. A Live Activity feature allows users to continue conversations while using other apps or when their iPhone is locked.\n\nThe Gemini has its limits on iOS. Unlike Siri, it can't tweak your settings or directly manage other apps, which was expected. Its functionality is limited to interactions within Google's ecosystem of apps and services."

        "article_content": "With the number of smartphone owners who use GenAI apps on at least a weekly basis expected to increase 2.5-fold in the next five years, the rapidly growing category joins existing differentiated connectivity use cases such as video calling, streaming, and online payments that smartphone users say they are willing to pay a premium for.\n\nPhoto: Ericsson\n\nDifferentiated connectivity and consumers\u2019 willingness to pay communications service providers (CSPs) for the guaranteed higher performance for essential apps is the subject of the latest global report from Ericsson ConsumerLab, called \"Elevating 5G with Differentiated Connectivity\".\n\nAlmost one-in-four GenAI users say they are already willing to pay up to 35 per cent more for guaranteed fast and secure connectivity for high-capacity applications.\n\nThe research shows that 35 per cent of 5G smartphone users surveyed say they would be interested in paying for differentiated connectivity for essential applications.\n\nThe CSP-focused report also addresses revenue generation opportunities for service providers based on the survey.\n\nPhoto: Ericsson\n\nJasmeet Sethi, head of ConsumerLab, said, \u201cThe latest comprehensive Ericsson ConsumerLab research indicates that as AI-powered applications become more prevalent, users\u2019 expectations for enhanced connectivity are rising. This reflects consumers' expectations for AI apps' future capabilities, perhaps relating to image, audio or video generation, and their willingness to pay for those capabilities to perform in a speedy and high-quality way. This signals an opportunity for CSPs globally to meet this demand through tailored connectivity experiences.\u201d\n\nSethi added the differentiated connectivity revenue generation potential for CSPs will increase as they transition to performance-based business models, offering tailored subscriptions and plans with assured performance for different consumer segments in the market.\n\nPhoto: Ericsson\n\n\u201cThis shift could drive a 5-12 per cent uplift in 5G average revenue per user as people seek guaranteed reliable performance for specific applications,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, there is an opportunity to unlock new revenue pools from the significant demand among 5G users for high-performance apps, with one in three 5G smartphone users willing to reallocate 10 per cent of their current mobile app spend to purchase apps with in-built elevated connectivity. \u201c\n\nRita Mokbel, president and CEO of Ericsson Vietnam stated,\u201d Once the 5G networks in Vietnam are fully deployed, CSPs in Vietnam can expose quality-on-demand network APIs to developers and can thereby tap into the consumer demand for high-performance apps. They can thus enable developers to offer premium, high-performance experiences and unlock new revenue streams in the process. This is one example of network API CSPs can expose.\u201d\n\nKey research takeaways Assurance seekers\u2019 segment: Contrary to the belief that users will not pay extra for connectivity, the survey identified 20 per cent of users, known as \u2018assurance seekers\u2019, actively seeking elevated connectivity for critical applications they are willing to pay for. Generative AI app demand: The number of smartphone users using GenAI apps weekly is expected to rise 2.5-fold in the next five years. One in four current AI users are already willing to pay 35 per cent more for differentiated connectivity to ensure fast and responsive performance of AI-driven apps. Regional interest: Markets such as India, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia have doubled the share of smartphone users interested in differentiated connectivity compared to markets such as France and Spain. Five-stage journey for CSPs: The study outlines a pathway for CSPs from non-differentiated mobile broadband to performance-driven and platform-based models, where network APIs empower developers to create customised app experiences. More than 23,000 smartphone users between the ages of 15 and 69 were surveyed online for the research, and more than 17,000 were 5G smartphone users from 16 key markets with a global spread. Ericsson researchers say the survey is representative of 1.1 billion people, including 750 million 5G smartphone users. Surveyed 5G users came from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mainland China, France, Hong Kong, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, UAE, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nEricsson launches project to develop young telecom talent Ericsson, a global leader in telecommunications, on October 8 announced the launch of the EricssonEdge Academia Programme that aims to revolutionise early career talent development in the telecommunications sector across Southeast Asia, Oceania, and India.\n\nEricsson and VNPT collaborate on 5G in Vietnam Ericsson and VNPT, one of Vietnam's leading telecommunications operators, officially announced on October 10 their partnership to deploy 5G technology."

The app combines voice, text, and camera inputs for a highly versatile experience, according to GSM Arena.\n\nIn an exciting development for iOS users, Google has launched its Gemini app, a versatile AI assistant that expands the functionality of its existing Gemini platform.\n\nAvailable now on the Apple App Store, the app allows users to interact with Google's AI via voice, text, or even the iPhone's camera, providing a more engaging and dynamic way to access information and assistance.\n\nThe new Gemini app offers users the same core features found in the Gemini section of the Google app, including advanced AI-powered searches and conversational capabilities.\n\nHowever, one standout feature is the introduction of 'Gemini Live', a real-time voice chat experience with Google's AI assistant.\n\nThis feature aims to deliver an even more natural and fluid interaction with the assistant, elevating the user experience with live voice-based communication, as per GSM Arena.\n\nAdditionally, the app is designed to integrate seamlessly with Google's suite of services.\n\nWhile it doesn't have control over iPhone settings or third-party apps like Apple's own Siri or other competitors' AI systems, Gemini can access and interact with various Google apps such as Maps, Gmail, Drive, and YouTube.\n\nThis ensures that users can quickly retrieve information and perform tasks like checking emails, finding locations, or managing files directly through the AI assistant, as per GSM Arena.\n\nFor users of the latest iPhone models, including the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series, the Gemini app comes with an additional convenience: direct integration with the iPhone's 'Action Button'.\n\nThis allows users to quickly activate the Gemini app for instant searches, conversations, or AI-driven tasks directly from the physical button, making it easier to access Google's AI when needed most.\n\nWhile the Gemini app is packed with impressive features, it does have some limitations.\n\nAs with other AI assistants on iOS, such as Siri or Amazon's Alexa, Google Gemini cannot control system settings or third-party apps installed on the iPhone.\n\nAs per GSM Arena, this restriction is due to Apple's privacy and security policies, which limit external apps from modifying system-wide settings.\n\nDespite this limitation, the Gemini app's ability to interact with Google's ecosystem of apps and services gives it a distinct advantage for users heavily invested in Google's suite of productivity tools.\n\nWith the launch of the Gemini app on iOS, Google is positioning itself as a strong contender in the AI assistant space for Apple users.\n\nThe app's ability to perform intelligent searches, facilitate live voice conversations, and seamlessly integrate with Google's services makes it a compelling tool for anyone looking to enhance their productivity or simply explore the possibilities of conversational AI.\n\nAs Google continues to refine its AI capabilities, iPhone users can expect even more sophisticated features in future updates."

We saw Google introduce its AI Overviews in Search earlier this year, and while we\u2019re sure many of you were scrambling to find ways to turn AI Overviews off, Google\u2019s definitely been working to make the case for their utility. Today we\u2019re checking out a new way to interact with AI Overviews that Google seems to be currently testing, letting you double-down on the AI analysis.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else.\n\nWe\u2019re checking out a tip from Eli_Blau on Telegram who shared with AA contributor Assemble Debug some interesting new behavior they spotted in version 15.45.33 beta of the Google app on a Pixel 7a. While getting an AI Overview at the top of your results is nothing new, Blau noticed that the app now lets you select a portion of that Overview to get further information on it \u2014 essentially, it\u2019s pulling up a new AI Overview from within an existing one.\n\nThe functionality only seems to work with text in the Overview itself \u2014 you can\u2019t just highlight any text on the results screen and run a second Overview this way. And before you get it into your head to follow this rabbit hole down to infinity with some Inception-style nested Overviews, the implement that we\u2019ve checked out only supports one level deep of this re-querying.\n\nAdding a feature like this makes enough sense, and we can appreciate the way the new results appear in a resizable card so that you can still read the original Overview. The one-level-deep limitation is also easy enough to understand, and if you still need more clarification at that point, you\u2019re probably better off starting a new search.\n\nWill you be giving this a try if Google ever gets around to making it available on your device?

The free app is now available in 35 languages and can be downloaded from the App Store. Unlike with Google Assistant through the Google app, a web browser, and so on, users can install the Gemini app to communicate with the chatbot via text, voice, or even camera.\n\nOne of the flagship features of this app is Gemini Live, which provides an advanced voice conversation experience. It is for natural and continuous conversations; users can shift from one topic or speak over another in the middle of a word, a milestone towards achieving interaction-realism. A choice of ten AI voices is available to users, making personalization possible for greater user satisfaction.\n\nBesides the chatbot, Gemini AI app is connected to Google\u2019s giant list of services so it is not simply an application. Extensions allow users to use other applications affiliated to Google Workspace such as YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Calendar within the app. This integration is expected to cut across tasks, like pulling information from emails or through planning in Maps without having to open another application.\n\nBeyond standard text and voice functions, Gemini AI offers specialized features, like AI image generation through Google\u2019s Imagen 3 technology. This tool enables users to create images based on descriptions, adding a creative dimension to the AI\u2019s capabilities. Additionally, study assistance tools make the app suitable for educational purposes, and it can analyze photos to provide insights or extract information, a feature that adds practicality for tasks like reading receipts or identifying objects in images.\n\nAnother key functionality is the Live Activity feature, which lets users keep conversations active even while using other apps or when their iPhone is locked, making multitasking more convenient.\n\nWhile the Gemini AI app doesn\u2019t offer system-level control, as Siri does, its integration with Google\u2019s ecosystem enhances functionality. Users can access Google\u2019s AI ecosystem with a streamlined, standalone experience and direct home screen access, positioning Gemini AI as a competitor to Siri and other popular AI assistants on iPhone."

That's certainly the case of Poinsett Bridge, the oldest bridge in the state which also happens to be visually stunning. You'll find it in the northern mountains of Greenville County, near Landrum. It's a bit off the beaten path but it's well worth the adventure to witness this stunning slice of history.\n\nThe Poinsett Bridge was built in the 1820s and is therefore not only the oldest bridge of its kind in South Carolina; it's also among the oldest in the entire southeast. The bridge's design is attributed to Robert Mills, a dedicated South Carolina resident credited with other iconic landmarks including the U.S. Treasury Building and even the Washington Monument. He also designed the Greenville Courthouse, whose Gothic windows mirror the stone bridge's iconic archway.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo why was the Poinsett Bridge built? It was a crucial part of the State Road, which connected South Carolina to the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee. There were three bridges constructed at the time. Poinsett Bridge was built over Little Gap Creek and the other two were built over North Saluda River and Hodge\u2019s Creek. Today, Poinsett Bridge is the only one that remains.\n\nThe bridge was named for Joel Poinsett, who was the president of South Carolina's Board of Public Works at the time. Poinsett is also significant for his role as the first U.S. ambassador to Mexico and was responsible for bringing a certain flowering plant to the U.S., now known as the Poinsettia.\n\nToday, the bridge is visited by history enthusiasts and even some paranormal investigators. Those who have visited the bridge after sunset report some eerie, unexplainable phenomena. Local legend tells the tale of a local worker who contracted malaria while working on the bridge. His body is believed to be buried under the bridge\u2014though this claim has never been proven. Another more lighthearted story is that the ghosts of two Irishmen frequently visit the bridge because they are so pleased with their handiwork.\n\nParanormal or not, there's no denying the allure of this landmark. Standing at the bridge, you can imagine what it must have been like to travel over two centuries ago. Today, the bridge is owned by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.

My partner and I receive printed publications on a monthly basis and also follow curated newsletters.\n\nVideos by TravelAwaits\n\nNew Scientist, which has been around since 1956, is a well-known publication in our household.\n\nI read New Scientist articles and studies to stay updated on a wide range of topics, from AI to rising temperatures to bathroom tiles that mathematicians love. The latter is a great example of the type of casual, science-centric content the publication focuses on.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not all dry and boring.\n\nIn fact, New Scientist wants to do a lot more than educate you on the latest innovations and discoveries. The company also wants to transport you and other like-minded travelers even closer to the frontiers of our world\u2019s most impactful scientific research.\n\nAnd how is it doing that? One of the latest ways that New Scientist engages with its readers is through its highly tailored Discovery Tours programs.\n\nLike the title suggests, these curated trips zero in on science and research projects happening around the globe.\n\nBest of all, science buffs like you (and me) can join them easily. Caught your interest? Here\u2019s what you need to know about New Scientist Discovery Tours.\n\nInside New Scientist Discovery Tours\n\nThe premise here is simple. Science nerds (I say that lovingly) with an overlapping interest in travel can shop around for highly specialized and expertly organized trips.\n\nYou can shop around for tours that run a massive gamut\u2014from solar eclipses to polar bear expeditions to monarch butterfly migrations.\n\nSeriously, you can get lost looking into the dozens and dozens of tours available.\n\nEach is headed by a group of experts who have ample experience in scientific fields and research. That means that you\u2019re not just getting up close to science-adjacent regions and sites\u2014you\u2019re also getting a first-class education along the way.\n\nAlong with the elevated scientific angles, travelers can also relax knowing that New Scientist goes above and beyond to work with sustainability-focused tour providers. (However, the publication recommends that all travelers look to offset their carbon footprints by traveling mindfully to the tour and paying to cover their emissions.)\n\nWhat\u2019s included in the tours?\n\nEvery Discovery Tour is different\u2014and I strongly encourage you to read the fine print on every tour that you\u2019re considering. From lodging type to trip duration to fitness levels, there\u2019s a lot you need to think about before signing up.\n\nGenerally speaking, tours include:\n\nProfessional guides\n\nCultural and scientific presentations\n\nTickets, entrance fees, etc.\n\nTaxes and permit fees\n\nLodging (usually shared)\n\n24-hour support\n\nAirport transfers, if relevant\n\nGenerally speaking, tours don\u2019t include:\n\nTransportation to and from the meeting spot\n\nTravel protection & medical evacuation insurance\n\nAlcoholic beverages\n\nPrivate lodging (most deals include shared rooms)\n\nHow can you follow the latest New Scientist Discovery Tours?\n\nThe easiest way to follow the latest tours available from New Scientist is to sign up for its weekly newsletter or to join the Discovery Tour mailing list.\n\nTours are categorized into:"

        "article_content": "Tavrius/Getty Images\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (gen AI) is paving the way for everyone to become their own software developers. But at the same time, AI may render many extraordinary skills unnecessary.\n\nThat's the word from Thomas Davenport of Babson College and Ian Barkin, a venture capitalist, in their latest book, All Hands on Tech: The AI-Powered Citizen Revolution. For starters, they point out that with low-code and no-code tools, robotic process automation, and now AI, the gates of software development are open to all.\n\nAlso: Your dream programming job demands this language, every site agrees\n\n\"Technology is no longer owned by any one department of function,\" they explain. \"Data and its analyses are no longer the property of only the PhDs and the hard-core number crunchers. From now on, all employees have the ability to be system designers, data analysts, coders, and creators.\"\n\nDavenport and Barkin note that generative AI will take citizen development to a whole new level. \"First is through conversational user interfaces,\" they write. \"Virtually every vendor of software today has announced or is soon to introduce a generative AI interface.\"\n\n\"Now or in the very near future, someone interested in programming or accessing/analyzing data need only make a request to an AI system in regular language for a program containing a set of particular functions, an automation workflow with key steps and decisions, or a machine-learning analysis involving particular variables or features.\"\n\nAs the authors mention, part of this future -- not quite formed yet -- are specialized bots designed to perform specific types of work. \"There are digital workers from RPA vendors and other start-ups that claim to perform an entire job, although our investigations thus far suggest that they really perform just a few tasks and are certainly less flexible than human workers.\"\n\nAlso: Google survey says more than 75% of developers rely on AI. But there's a catch\n\nThis includes nascent software development bots, which vendors claim are \"able to write software programs from start to finish,\" Davenport and Barkin state. \"Our guess is that for the next several years, these bots will be capable of making human citizens more productive but won't replace them.\"\n\nGen AI will feel like the ultimate research assistant or programmer, they added, \"because it is generating code to this analysis. It will elicit what you want, work very quickly, and allow you to change your mind infinite times in specifying your app, automation, or model.\"\n\n\"Gen AI will also make it easier to find existing models, features, or software components that you can use to begin your citizen project,\" they conclude.\n\nAlso: How ChatGPT scanned 170k lines of code in seconds, saving me hours of work\n\nLooking beyond these early starts, with the growth of AI, RPA, and other tools, \"some citizen developers are likely to no longer be necessary, and every citizen will need to change how they do their work,\" Davenport and Barkin speculate. Gen AI will assume much of this work, including generating application code, automations, and data science analyses.\n\nDominic Ligot, CEO and CTO of CirroLytix, echoes Davenport and Barkin's observations in a recent HackerNoon article, noting how he enabled semi-technical individuals in a class to leverage data science tools:\n\n\"The participants, primarily CISOs who typically don't code, found the exercises, crafted with AI's assistance, to be intuitive and hands-on. My goal was to immerse them in working directly with data and code. They especially appreciated the chance to explore manually what modern cyberthreat surveillance and SIEM platforms typically automate, gaining insights into the processes happening 'under the hood.'\"\n\nAt the same time, Ligot also suggests citizen developers and data scientists may not necessarily need technical skills, as AI takes on much of this work. \"My key takeaway from the class was surprisingly counterintuitive: data science, as we know it, will eventually be replaced by AI,\" he said.\n\nAlso: Technologist Bruce Schneier on security, society, and why we need 'public AI' models\n\n\"The rise of AI-driven tools capable of handling data analysis, modeling, and insight generation could force a shift in how we view the role and future of data science itself,\" said Ligot. \"Tasks like data preparation, cleansing, and even basic qualitative analysis -- activities that consume much of a data scientist's time -- are now easily automated by AI systems.\"\n\n\"What's worse (or better, depending on where you stand) is that AI is faster, more accurate, and less prone to human error or fatigue.\"\n\nStill, getting to the point where development and data science are delivered seamlessly via AI will take time, Davenport and Barkin clarify. \"It seems likely in the future that gen AI and conversational AI broadly will be the front end to all citizen applications,\" they say. \"That's possible today with many tools, but it takes at least a modicum of sophistication to create prompts that will get you the first cut at an app, a data analysis, or an automation workflow that you want. That's also true with code generations, and it's one reason why experienced coders tend to have better luck than inexperienced ones.\"\n\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2024 (and what not to use)\n\nHowever, they continued, \"within a year or two, it will be possible to have an iterative discussion with a gen AI interface about a machine-learning analysis.\""

        "article_content": "Everyone is talking about e-readers again, and it\u2019s because Amazon recently released a whole new bunch of Kindles. Of the new releases, one stands apart as something new for Amazon: The Kindle Colorsoft is the company\u2019s first attempt at a color e-ink display, and it replaces the long-forgotten Kindle Oasis as Amazon\u2019s new flagship e-reader device. At $280, it\u2019s certainly an expensive piece of kit \u2014 especially if you consider the basic Kindle costs almost a third of that. But it\u2019s quite simply the most advanced Kindle that Amazon has ever made.\n\nSo, does that mean you should buy it immediately? Absolutely not; I want you to buy something else instead.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAmazon was late to the party. Other manufacturers have been doing this whole \u201ccolor e-ink\u201d thing for a lot longer, and frankly, they\u2019re doing it better. Don\u2019t buy the Kindle Colorsoft; buy the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 instead.\n\nWhat makes the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 so special\n\nWe\u2019re no strangers to the Boox Go Color 7. In fact, our own Nadeem Sarwar took the original black version out for a spin in July. He loved it, pronouncing it the best Kindle alternative he\u2019d ever used. I have to admit, after using the fetching new white variant, he\u2019s absolutely on the money.\n\nThe key to the e-reader\u2019s success in his eyes, and increasingly in mine too, is the operating system. Unlike a Kindle, which uses a \u201cforked\u201d version of Android that basically just runs Amazon\u2019s software and nothing else, the Boox Go Color 7 runs a full Android 12 install. That means it has more in common with an Android tablet than an Amazon e-reader, with access to not only Onyx\u2019s e-reading platform, but the Google Play Store too. Yes, that same Google Play Store you\u2019ll find on your Android smartphone or tablet is available here, and it means you can download the same apps you use on your other devices.\n\nYou might assume that means it doesn\u2019t run much other than the most basic of apps, but you\u2019d be wrong. While traditional benchmarking software seems to be beyond its modest capabilities, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 nestled inside the plastic shell is actually surprisingly powerful. It ran Balatro just fine, without the processor struggling or giving any indication it wasn\u2019t up to the task.\n\nDoes that mean it\u2019s basically a tablet, then? Well, no. It ran Balatro, sure \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t great. While the processor was up to the task, the screen\u2019s refresh rate really wasn\u2019t, and the game looked a little bit like it was trudging through mud. Even with the card\u2019s gentle swaying motion turned off, it wasn\u2019t always easy to see what was going on while the game was in motion, and while it was playable, it wasn\u2019t a game I revisited on the Go Color 7.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter, because the Go Color 7 isn\u2019t meant to play Balatro. No, it\u2019s meant to read pretty much anything.\n\nYou can read anything\n\nThe Boox Go Color 7 has its own reader app and its own store for buying e-books, and by most accounts, it functions pretty well. I can\u2019t tell you from firsthand experience because, well, I didn\u2019t use it very much. And that\u2019s because I had access to the Google Play Store.\n\nAccess to the Google Play Store is a big deal for any e-reader. Amazon\u2019s walled garden means the Kindle is sleek and fast \u2014 but walls are still walls. The Go Color 7 has no such barriers.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you have e-books spread all over the place. You\u2019ve bought e-books from Amazon, there\u2019s that Humble Bundle you bought, that free e-book on Google Play Books \u2014 not to mention your dalliance with Barnes & Noble, back from your very first Nook e-reader.\n\nSo unless you\u2019re way more loyal to a single brand than me, you\u2019ve probably got a treasure trove of e-books spread around. I\u2019m an old hand at this now, so I know you can send books to the Amazon Kindle \u2014 but doing so can be a bit of a pain. Not so on the Go Color 7. Install the app, sign in, and you\u2019re ready to go.\n\nI\u2019ve been merrily book-hopping between apps for the better part of the last few weeks, and it has been delightful. No longer tethered to Amazon, I\u2019m free to explore where I want.\n\nThis extends over to other apps as well. I\u2019m a longtime manga reader, and the Go Color 7 is perfect for reading in the Shonen Jump app. I\u2019m not much of a comic guy, but I loaded a few up through the Kindle app, and they look great. The limitations of the e-ink display mean it\u2019s not as clear or crisp as it might be on my phone, but there\u2019s a beauty to the slightly washed-out colors and delicate grain. It\u2019s more like reading an actual comic than any other digital method, and that means I actually prefer it.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but that\u2019s why I love it\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, there are two types of smart devices; polished and refined ones, and buggy but charismatic ones. In Star Wars terms \u2014 because I can\u2019t do anything without relating it back to Star Wars \u2014 it\u2019s the difference between an Imperial Star Destroyer and the Millennium Falcon.\n\nThe Amazon Kindle is an Imperial Star Destroyer. It\u2019s backed by a massive organization, it\u2019s sleek and no-nonsense, and it\u2019s incredibly good at what it does. That\u2019s a good thing, obviously, but one Star Destroyer is much like another, and that also applies to Kindles. My Kindle Paperwhite is fantastic, but it\u2019s very much a plastic slab with no personality. I\u2019ve had it for years, but I\u2019m not particularly attached to it because it lacks charisma.\n\nBut the Boox Go Color 7 has charisma. It has it in spades \u2014 and it\u2019s because it\u2019s flawed.\n\nThat sounds strange, but I promise you it makes sense. Consider my example from earlier. What is it you remember most about the Millennium Falcon? It\u2019s certainly not that it worked flawlessly. No, it\u2019s that it had problems. The hyperdrive was peerlessly fast, but it was wonky. Sometimes she needed a bonk on the control panel to start up, but when she got going, she could outfly any Imperial bucket.\n\nThe Falcon\u2019s character was strong \u2014 so strong that I slipped into calling it a \u201cshe\u201d without thinking. And that\u2019s because charisma can be created by lovable flaws. Because the Kindle is so good, it doesn\u2019t leave much of an impression. It just works, to borrow a phrase, and that\u2019s sometimes a detriment.\n\nThe Boox Go Color 7 is an incredibly capable machine. But it has more than its share of problems. It\u2019s prone to ghosting. A lot of ghosting; certainly more than you\u2019re used to if you\u2019ve used Kindles. You can fine-tune how the display works to lessen this, but it never really fully goes away. The screen rotation also isn\u2019t great, and the color is a little washed-out. While it has a built-in speaker, it\u2019s difficult to use apps like Audible, because the speaker won\u2019t continue playing with the screen off. You can keep the screen open, but eventually it\u2019ll time out and playback will stop.\n\nIt\u2019s flawed in a way that I\u2019ve never found a Kindle to be, but I find myself loving it all the same. So, while those flaws are definitely present, they aren\u2019t bad enough to ruin the device. Instead, they bring my attention back to the Boox Go Color 7 in a way that\u2019s slowly increased my affection for it. It\u2019s an odd thing to admit, but I actually like the e-reader because it isn\u2019t as flawless as a Kindle.\n\nI might not feel this way if it only offered as much as a Kindle did \u2014 but because it offers way more than Amazon\u2019s e-reader ever has, I love it despite its flaws. In the same way Han Solo felt a connection to the Millennium Falcon because of the struggles they\u2019d been through together, I feel a stronger connection to this e-reader.\n\nIs the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 a Kindle killer?\n\nIt\u2019s time for the big question: Should the Boox Go Color 7 replace your Kindle? Well, that\u2019s a complicated question. The basic Kindle has a big edge in pricing, and I\u2019m not about to argue that anyone looking to buy a $100 Kindle should instead spend almost three-times that amount for the Go Color 7. The same applies to the Kindle Paperwhite, which also includes waterproofing for a much lower price.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what I came here to argue; at the price of $250, the Go Color 7 is a full $30 cheaper than the Kindle Colorsoft. And sure, it doesn\u2019t have waterproofing, and it doesn\u2019t have the casual slickness of Amazon\u2019s software \u2014 but it has everything else, and it\u2019s a darn good e-reader in its own right. Access to the Google Play Store is a major game changer, as it means the Go Color 7 is a universal e-reader in a way the Kindle simply isn\u2019t. If you only own e-books through Amazon, and don\u2019t read comics or manga through their own apps, then the Kindle Colorsoft is definitely still a good option.\n\nBut at $30 less, with access to all the e-reading apps you could ever need, and its own store and reader besides, the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 is a hard prospect to pass up. Even if you do have to live with some bugs, it\u2019s simply one of the best value propositions around."

        "article_content": "The Linxura Smart Controller is a powerful way to control your smart home. Instead of relying on mobile companion apps, you can toggle smart lights, change your thermostat, or open smart blinds at the press of a button. It\u2019s a unique device, but like all electronic gadgets, it\u2019s bound to run into some issues. And if you\u2019re encountering serious ones that can\u2019t be fixed by other troubleshooting methods, it might be time to reset your Linxura Smart Controller. This wipes all your data from the device, giving you a chance to start anew. It\u2019s also a great option if you\u2019re selling the smart controller to another user or giving it away to a family member, ensuring they don\u2019t have access to your data.\n\nHere's a look at how to reset your Linxura Smart Controller, along with other troubleshooting tips to try before opting for a full reset.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDifficulty Easy Duration 5 minutes What You Need Linxura Smart Controller\n\nPin\n\nHow to troubleshoot your Linxura Smart Controller\n\nSince performing a reset is a \u201clast resort\u201d type of solution, it\u2019s worth exploring other ways to fix your Linxura Smart Controller. Here\u2019s a quick look at common issues and how to fix them:\n\nPoor Wi-Fi connection: Consider checking the Wi-Fi Settings in your Linxura mobile app. If needed, disconnect and reconnect to your network.\n\nPoor battery life: Open your Linxura mobile app and see if you\u2019re running the latest software. Running older software sometimes results in poor battery life. You could also check your Wi-Fi Settings, as an unstable network could quickly drain your battery.\n\nSlow to toggle: If it takes a very long time for a Linxura button press to translate to a smart home action, you may want to check your Wi-Fi Settings in the mobile app. Some actions simply take longer to toggle than others, and depending on your specific network speeds and which companion apps you\u2019re using, it may take multiple seconds for an event to register.\n\nAt the very least, it\u2019s highly recommended you restart your Linxura before performing a reset. Restarting requires you to hold down the button on the back of the device for a few seconds to power it off. Release the button, then hold the button down again. After a few seconds, it should reboot. This will not delete any of your data, as you\u2019re essentially turning the device off and on. If you\u2019re running into minor issues, this can sometimes resolve the problem.\n\nHow to reset the Linxura Smart Controller\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to perform a reset, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to do. Keep in mind that this will delete all your stored data and connections.\n\nStep 1: Turn over the Linxura Smart Controller.\n\nStep 2: Locate the tiny pinhole, which can be found across from the power button.\n\nStep 3: Insert a pin into this pinhole and press down for 1 second.\n\nStep 4: This will begin the reset process for the Linxura Smart Controller."
