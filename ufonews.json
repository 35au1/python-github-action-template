        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Investigation Alien\u2019 delves into worldwide accounts of alleged UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters. Among these is a report from Council Bluffs, Iowa, dating back to December 1997. Locals claimed mysterious metal had fallen from the sky, with many suspecting it came from another world. However, Darrell Livengood offers a different perspective. He makes the argument that these claims are a hoax and presents a credible, logical explanation for what others believe to be genuine.\n\nDarrell Livengood Claimed He Could Explain the 1977 Sighting in Iowa\n\nIn December 1977, residents of Council Bluffs, Iowa, reported mysterious metal objects falling from the sky, sparking intrigue and speculation. Many witnesses described seeing a lava-like substance that solidified rapidly, embedded with blue shards. Resident Mike Moore explained that the blue fragments resembled glass from a 1950s-1960s camera but noted they didn\u2019t melt with the rest of the material. However, another resident, Darrell Livengood, shared a different perspective, recalling how he\u2019d returned from college for the holidays and gone out with three friends on December 17, 1977. Two of these worked for Union Pacific, and together, they decided to engage in some playful mischief.\n\nDarrell recounted that his friends had two tools they called \u201cchargers,\u201d which were actually similar to thermal welding devices. They decided to ignite them, and the resulting flame shot about 30 feet into the air, forming a smoke cloud that might have resembled a floating disc to onlookers. He added that the upward flame could have appeared to some as if it were moving downward. At the time, when people were collecting residue from the site, he and his friends remained silent, but over the years, he felt compelled to debunk the claims.\n\nDarrell insisted that the residue found at the site was nothing more than phosphorus and powder, supporting his claim that there was no mysterious or otherworldly explanation. Yet, when UFO journalist George Knapp took samples of the material for testing, an explosives chemist reported that the composition didn\u2019t match Darrell\u2019s account. According to the chemist, the substance couldn\u2019t have come from a thermal welding tool, as Darrell suggested. Despite the test results, Darrell remains firm in his version of events, convinced that nothing unusual occurred that day and that the incident was simply a misunderstanding rather than a supernatural encounter.\n\nDarrell Livengood is Leading a Fulfilling Life With His Wife Today\n\nDarrell Livengood is now happily settled in Surprise, Arizona, where he has crafted a fulfilling life surrounded by music, love, and a deep sense of gratitude. Darrell graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and later pursued higher education at the University of Iowa. After finishing college, Darrell embarked on a steady, dedicated career as a rural letter carrier for the USPS, a position he held for many years. His job took him across rural landscapes, connecting him to countless communities. When he eventually retired from the USPS, he was not quite ready to slow down. Seeking a new challenge, Darrell decided to take up work operating forklifts, finding fulfillment in staying active and continuing to work with his hands. He remained in this role for some time, easing into retirement at his own pace.\n\nDarrell\u2019s journey brought him back together with Marlo Keifer, the love of his life. After living together for ten years, they parted ways, and each went on a separate path. Nineteen years later, they reconnected, rekindled their love, and got married on February 18, 2014. Marlo brought two daughters into their relationship, adding to the joy in their life together, and the couple now enjoys a peaceful, contented life. Though Darrell is retired, his passion for music remains unwavering. In 2014, he proudly released his first album, \u2018Erie Canal,\u2019 a collection that reflects his lifelong love for storytelling through song. Today, Darrell and Marlo savor the simple pleasures\u2014Darrell, with his guitar in hand, is grateful for the family, friends, and moments that have shaped his journey.\n\nRead More: Donald Schmitt: Where is the UFOlogist Now?"

But a little town in northeast Pennsylvania also fits the bill.\n\nPeople fascinated with life beyond earth, like alien and UFO researcher Bill Weber, know that the city of Carbondale, Pennsylvania, is legendary in extraterrestrial lore, so much so that he wrote a chapter in his book about Carbondale.\n\nExactly 50 years ago, a strange glowing object was reported to have hovered over this old coal mine pond behind Russell Park in Carbondale before plunging into the water.\n\nMayor of Carbondale, Michele Bannon, said that she has a friend who saw the unidentified flying object \"hover over the pond for 5-7 seconds and then went down in.\"\n\nThe tale garnered international headlines and drew tens of thousands of spectators from across the country, as well as a large police and military presence.\n\nAlthough a railroad lantern was retrieved from the pond, the military was extremely discreet during the investigation, and many reported to see a separate covered object carted away in a flatbed truck in the middle of the night.\n\nChana Manarchuck of Carbondale was 26 years old when the suspicious sighting took place, and she lived in Carbondale back then, too. \"I heard little tales of people that actually were there, and they were saying like a Russian satellite. The secrecy is what created all that excitement. Like, 'Oh yeah, what was it?'\" she said.\n\nAmber Viola traveled from Scranton with her daughter to enjoy the festival. She was convinced that aliens had touched down in Carbondale. \"I believe, 100% its real, it crashed 50 years ago. I don't care what anybody says,\" she declared.\n\nTo celebrate the alien anniversary of this peculiar phenomenon, the city of Carbondale hosted the \"Carbondalien Festival\" in the heart of downtown.\n\nMayor Bannon also lived in Carbondale when the famous incident happened. She smiled, \"I grew up right down the street from where it happened, and I remember the day that it happened, so now, 50 years later, being able to celebrate it and bring people out to enjoy the story\u2014I love every bit of that.\"\n\n150 people boarded the \u201cExtraterrestrial Express\u201d train from Steamtown Marketplace to the festival.\n\nOthers looked as though they had arrived by UFO, donning alien costumes, headbands, and makeup. Even a baby was dressed in an alien onesie.\n\nIn addition to all the other festivities, local artist JFo painted more than 50 wooden aliens to take over the town of Carbondale. It took her more than 9 months to complete her arsenal of aliens.\n\nBack at Russell Park, the actual site of the landing, there were even more festivities. A recreated, partially-concealed UFO was paraded around on a flatbed truck, just like the locals remembered it 50 years ago. There was a \"Landing Site Experience,\" where actors walked festivalgoers through a reenactment.\n\nAnd for those interested in a little bit of a thrill, the adventurous could board a tethered, alien-shaped, hot air balloon ride, to be able to view the UFO crash site from a very unique perspective.\n\nThe truth of the alien incident will forever be cloaked in mystery, but it is clear what a strong grasp the event will always have on the city of Carbondale.\n\nMayor Bannon reflected, \"You know, rather than a legacy, I think it's more of our tapestry, you know, it's a piece of the tapestry. You know, we have such a rich history otherwise, you know, the birthplace of underground mining; we [have] the first million-dollar corporation in the United States. We're just an exceptional city, and this just adds to the great tapestry that we are.\""

The early 20th century\u2019s foremost believer that the truth was out there was Charles Fort, a writer who wrote about what Wikipedia calls \u201cscientific anomalies,\u201d starting with his first book in 1919, the scientifically titled The Book Of The Damned. 1970s occult magazine The Fortean Times cemented Fort as the first name in strange phenomena.\n\nBiggest controversy: It\u2019s hard to tell how earnest Fort actually was. He once said \u201cI believe nothing of my own that I have ever written,\u201d and UFO writer Jerome Clark called him \u201cessentially a satirist.\u201d At the same time, his curiosity was genuine, and some of his writing had real merit. While he was interested in poltergeists, teleportation (he\u2019s believed to have coined the term), and may have been the first person ever to write about alien abduction, Fort was also fascinated by legitimate scientific phenomena that science had no explanation for\u2014ball lightning, phantom cats (big cats found well outside their natural geographic range), and unexplained disappearances.\n\nThe simplest explanation seems to be not that Fort was a crank or a fraud, but that he questioned everything unexplained, real or not.\n\nStrangest fact: Fort\u2019s friends started a Fortean society and had to trick him into joining. A group of writers including Ben Hecht, Theodore Dreiser, Alexander Woollcott, and Fort\u2019s editor Tiffany Thayer, organized a Fortean Society in 1931, full of writers who admired his ideas. But Fort himself was \u201clured to its inaugural meeting by false telegrams.\u201d Fort objected to the group, surmising that it would quickly fill up with true believers in the occult, and not questioners and skeptics as he was. He refused the presidency of his own fan club, and Dreiser had to step in in his place.\n\nThe Society petered out when Thayer died in 1959, but much of their materials passed to the International Fortean Organization (INFO), which started in the early \u201960s and still exists. The Fortean Times magazine began publishing monthly in 1973, and is still in circulation in the U.K.\n\nThing we were happiest to learn: While Fort is hardly a household name, he casts a long shadow. Sci-fi writers, including Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, and Robert Anton Wilson, have all noted him as an influence. Alfred Bester\u2019s novel The Stars My Destination names the first teleporter after Ford. And Stephen King mentions Fort in several books (the parents of the child at the center of Firestarter are advised to read Fort instead of Dr. Spock). Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 1999 film Magnolia is full of unexplained events drawn from Fort, (among other things, Fort was fascinated by animals falling from the sky without explanation), and a scene set in a library has one of Fort\u2019s books on display.\n\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: It was likely trauma that pushed Fort into Forteana. His father, a Dutch-born grocer, was authoritarian and abusive, so young Charles escaped as best he could, into books and nature. While he wasn\u2019t a good student, he was a voracious reader, and collected shells, minerals, and birds, with an eye towards being a naturalist. He escaped in a larger sense as soon as he turned 18, traveling around the western U.S., the U.K., and southern Africa, where he fell ill. (He was nursed back to health by a childhood friend, Anna Filing, who he soon married). But then another cruel fate befell Fort\u2014he became a freelance writer. He likely would have struggled on working odd jobs and publishing the odd piece in newspapers and magazines, except a wealthy uncle left him an inheritance large enough to let him quit his job and focus on writing about the truly odd.\n\nBest link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: One of the oldest strange phenomena Fort wrote about was spontaneous human combustion. Scientific debate still rages on whether the phenomena is real, but no one can deny that in rare instances, human remains have been found destroyed by an explosion with no apparent cause. Reports go back as far as 1731, when Italian Countess Cornelia Zangari Bandi was found dead one morning\u2014rather, her lower legs, three fingers, and part of her skull were found amidst a heap of ash in her bedroom. The case was famous enough that Dickens mentions the Countess in Bleak House, and the \u201cpossibility of what is called spontaneous combustion.\u201d\n\nScience\u2019s best guess at an explanation is that these incidents are not spontaneous, but caused by an external source like a cigarette, which ignites alcohol on the victim\u2019s clothes, and their body fat adds fuel to the fire. (Heavy drinking and low mobility that would prevent an escape do seem to be common factors in many spontaneous combustion cases).\n\nFurther down the Wormhole: Usually we take a few twists and turns to get to our next topic, but it\u2019s hard to resist going straight for List of Reportedly Haunted Locations. (Oddly enough, one of the Haunted Locations is named Charles Fort, but it\u2019s a fort in Ireland built for English King Charles II during Britain\u2019s long occupation of Ireland.) We\u2019ll find out whether we are or ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of no ghost next month."

The second vehicle will be operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's National Deep Submergence Facility in Massachusetts. The institution is building the ROVs.\n\nThe vehicles are designed to work on a wider range of oceanographic ships, giving broader access and scope to researchers.\n\n\"Anything that creates a barrier to technology access can potentially be a barrier to discovery,\" said Leila Hamdan, USM associate vice president for research. \"The decision to fund and build these ROVs shows a commitment by NSF and NOAA to lift barriers and create increased access for the ocean science workforce of the future.\"\n\nStudents and faculty are learning more about the sea floor in the Gulf of Mexico with the mROV, in partnership with NOAA.\n\nThe vehicles are expected to generate new growth in the ocean-based blue economy workforce, Hamdan said.\n\n\"To operate these vehicles successfully, we will need skilled staff to maintain and operate them,\" she said. \"What better place to seek such skills than from our students in the Ocean Engineering program at USM.\"\n\nUSM\u2019s School of Ocean Science and Engineering offers a bachelor's degree in ocean engineering and a joint Ocean Enterprise Engineering Pathway program. The program also offers the opportunity for students to stay an additional year to earn a master\u2019s degree in business administration.\n\nUSM\u2019s Roger F. Wicker Center for Ocean Enterprise\n\nWhen the vehicles are operational, the USM ROV will be used in the Gulf of Mexico to help with NOAA's Mesophotic and Deep Benthic Communities restoration project for seafloor habitats damaged by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nThe USM-based ROV will complement the university's fleet of research vessels and other uncrewed vehicles and operate from USM\u2019s Roger F. Wicker Center for Ocean Enterprise at the Port of Gulfport, Hamdan said.\n\nNASA: This aircraft can fly without a pilot.

They suggest that flooding of the Utopia Planitia occurred around 3.68 billion years ago, reaching the foreshore unit.\n\nThe shallow and deep marine units formed subsequently, with the process completing by about 3.42 billion years ago in the Early Hesperian period.\n\nThis discovery adds to the growing body of evidence supporting Mars' watery past and could have significant implications for understanding the planet's potential for past habitability.\n\nAs space agencies continue to explore Mars, these findings may help guide future missions in the search for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet.\n\nPublished By: Sibu Kumar Tripathi Published On: Nov 11, 2024"

Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation.\n\nmonday.com believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to monday.com\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. monday.com management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare monday.com performance to that of prior periods, for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes. monday.com believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing monday.com financial results to the results of other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nManagement does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in monday.com financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nReconciliation tables of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. monday.com urges investors to review these reconciliation tables and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the monday.com business. Management is not able to forecast GAAP operating income (loss) on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting share-based compensation expense, the amounts of which may be significant in future periods. Management is not able to forecast GAAP net cash provided by operating activities on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting property and equipment purchases and capitalized software costs, the amounts of which may be significant in future periods.\n\nDefinitions of Business Key Performance Indicators\n\nNet Dollar Retention Rate\n\nWe calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end (\"Prior Period ARR\"). We then calculate the ARR from these customers as of the current period end (\"Current Period ARR\"). The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any upsells, contraction and attrition. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the Net Dollar Retention Rate. For the trailing 12-month calculation, we take a weighted average of this calculation of our quarterly Net Dollar Retention Rate for the four quarters ending with the most recent quarter.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\")\n\nIs defined to mean, as of the measurement date, the annualized value of our customer subscription plans assuming that any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms.\n\nForward-Looking Statements:\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook and market positioning.

(2) The tax benefits generated from the exercise of the disqualifying disposition of incentive share options were excluded in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share.

(3) The effect of these dilutive shares was not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and nine months ended September 30, 2023, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nMONDAY.COM LTD\n\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (U.S. dollars in thousands) Three months ended\n\nSeptember 30, Nine months ended\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (unaudited) (unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 86,605 $ 66,579 $ 234,354 $ 156,896 Purchase of property and equipment (3,800 ) (779 ) (9,764 ) (5,463 ) Capitalized software development costs (393 ) (910 ) (1,463 ) (1,929 ) Free cash flow $ 82,412 $ 64,890 $ 223,127 $ 149,504 Free cash flow margin 33 % 34 % 32 % 28 %\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241111684023/en/\n\nContacts\n\nInvestor Relations:\n\nByron Stephen\n\nbyron@monday.com\n\nMedia Relations:\n\nJulie Case\n\njulieca@monday.com"

        "article_content": "Women online have taken to filming ghoulish murder-fantasy videos in which they romanticize lacing men\u2019s beverages with deadly poison as a justifiable response to fears about abortion rights under a second Trump presidency.\n\nMany of the videos have been viewed millions of times on X or TikTok and feature young women fiendishly grinning as they adulterate a cup of tea or other drink with an unknown substance.\n\nSome of the women have dubbed the videos part of a \u201cMake Aqua Tofana Great Again\u201d \u2014 or \u201cMATGA\u201d \u2014 movement, a nod both to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA campaign slogan and ancient killer Giulia Tofana, who has been adopted as the disturbed group\u2019s heroine.\n\nTofana was a 17th century Italian woman who sold poison to wives who wished to dispatch their abusive husbands \u2014 resulting in the deaths of more than 600 men.\n\nTofana\u2019s signature brew was a mish-mash of deadly ingredients such as arsenic and belladonna known as \u201cAqua Tofana,\u201d a concoction that was so effective, she is considered by many today as one of the most prolific serial killers of all time.\n\nThe poison \u2014 believed to be flavorless and completely undetectable after death \u2014 was typically stored in ordinary cosmetics bottles, ensuring that a husband who was about to get whacked would be none-the-wiser to his impending fate.\n\nOne of the online clips shows a young lady with green hair, a backwards camo hat and a large, spiked septum ring with the text \u201cAqua Tofana isn\u2019t that hard to make\u201d superimposed over footage of her making the throat-slitting gesture with her thumb.\n\n3 Some women upset about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election win have posted murder-fantasy videos about poisoning men. X/ImMeme0\n\nMany of the videos include a portion of the Eminem song \u201cVenom\u201d in the background featuring the lyrics, \u201cThis f\u2013king world better prepare to get laced because they\u2019re gonna taste my venom.\u201d\n\nSome of the women don\u2019t mention Aqua Tofana specifically but instead show off their \u201cpoison rings,\u201d wearable baubles with a hidden compartment supposedly made to hold a lethal dose of a toxin.\n\n\u201cMy advice for American women,\u201d reads the text in video of a woman standing in a body-length mirror.\n\n\u201cI know you will understand this. They asked for it,\u201d the text reads before she flips open her poison ring and gives the camera a sinister smile.\n\nIn a plea for common sense, a woman posted a TikTok video urging people participating in \u201cMATGA\u201d to think long and hard about what they were doing.\n\n\u201cYou do know those videos can be used against you, right? It\u2019s giving off premeditated vibes. The internet is FOREVER. Also.. the 1600s were A LOT different than 2024 advancements in detecting POISON,\u201d reads the text positioned over a video of her scrunching her face in disbelief.\n\nLiberal women have been registering their dismay at the outcome of the election through the \u201cMATGA\u201d movement and a number of other ways, meticulously documenting everything online.\n\n3 The videos are part of the \u201cMake Aqua Tofana Great Again.\u201d 3 The videos reference Giulia Tofana, who allegedly killed over 600 abusive men with poison in the 17th century.\n\nSome have started shaving their heads, while others are engaging in sex strikes against men or committing to not getting pregnant or giving birth for the duration of Trump\u2019s second term, to protest what they see as potential draconian abortion measures to come under him.\n\nTrump helped pave the way in his first term for the conservative US Supreme Court that in 2022 overturned the Roe v. Wade decision ensuring abortion rights at the federal level. States now have the power to determine their own abortion laws instead.\n\nThe incoming president has stated repeatedly that he would veto a federal abortion ban. The number of abortions in America also has actually increased since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, according to the New York Times, even in states that have enacted new restrictions on the procedure."

        "article_content": "By Subrata Nag Choudhary\n\nKOLKATA (Reuters) - A court in the eastern state of West Bengal began the trial on Monday of a police volunteer accused of raping and murdering a doctor at a government hospital in August, a case that has sparked outrage over the lack of safety for women in India.\n\nThe woman's body was found in a classroom at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in the state capital Kolkata on Aug. 9, federal police said. They also said they had arrested a police volunteer, Sanjay Roy, for the crime.\n\nCharges were drawn up last week, while Roy said he was \"completely innocent\" and was being framed, local media reported.\n\nThe legal case has reignited criticism of India's poor record on women's safety despite the introduction of tougher laws following the 2012 gang rape and murder of a woman on a moving bus in New Delhi.\n\nIt also shines a light on the poor infrastructure and security at government hospitals in India, many of which lack basic facilities including CCTV cameras and security personnel.\n\nAround 128 witnesses will be examined during the trial, court sources told Reuters, with hearings taking place on a daily basis as authorities look to fast-track the high-profile case. They will not be open to the public.\n\nOne source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the father of the woman doctor, the alleged victim, gave evidence on Monday.\n\nIn addition to the defendant Roy, India's federal police said they arrested the officer in charge of the local police station and the superintendent of the hospital for allegedly tampering with evidence and financial irregularities.\n\nWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met protesters last month and accepted most of their demands, doctors seeking reforms said, but they added they would track progress on her assurances and maintain pressure for change.\n\n(Writing by Sakshi Dayal; editing by Barbara Lewis)"

        "article_content": "Widely-liked open source group OpenUK this week detailed more of its State of Open: The UK In 2024 analysis.\n\nAs the non-profit organisation representing the UK\u2019s open technology sector, OpenUK says that it has looked at the factors in any given industry market that shape the success of open source. It has also concentrated on analysing what enables community development around open source public sector releases and the role of procurement in successful development work.\n\nThe report covers the UK\u2019s current position in the global open source marketplace \u2013 after many years leading the European contribution to open source software in general, that position is now under threat.\n\nWhy so?\n\nBecause governments in France and Germany have expanded their investment and support for open source software development and contributions in recent times.\n\n\u201cThe UK has contributed a huge amount to the technologies and infrastructure that underpin today\u2019s economy. But markets do not stand still \u2013 other countries in Europe have increased their level of investment and incentives, putting the UK\u2019s leadership position in jeopardy in future,\u201d explained Amanda Brock, CEO at OpenUK.\n\nBrock says that in this year\u2019s report, the organisations details the considerations to be dealt with for the new UK government to support open source more effectively generating better returns on investment from any new projects, whether those are public sector organisations using open source or releasing new software as open source for others to use and importantly ensuring its adoption and maintenance.\n\nThis, she says, is particularly vital for public sector AI developments that aim to deliver on digital public good goals.\u201d\n\nGovernance & regulatory understanding Dr. Jennifer Barth, research director at OpenUK and founder of Symmetry thinks that as open source software reshapes industries, it also presents challenges that require careful governance and regulatory understanding. \u201cUnlike proprietary software, open source software operates through open licensing, decentralised contribution and community-driven management, which can create complexity in legal and operational standards,\u201d said Barth. \u201cSuccessful open source software adoption is contingent on comprehending the interplay of governance, technology, and community. For legislators and market participants alike, a nuanced understanding of open source software is essential, as this ecosystem relies on transparency, the protection of intellectual property, and an ethos of equitable use.\u201d"
