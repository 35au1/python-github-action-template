        "article_content": "If I had to recommend a single indie release this year, it'd probably be Mossmouth's UFO 50, mainly because it's a retro game anthology that actually feels like it could've been made back in the NES era (for the most part) while offering a fresh package.\n\nAmidst the usual onslaught of huge releases towards the end of the year, it's hard to find time for smaller titles if you're in this line of work. Hell, I spend like half of my work hours consuming and writing about other stuff, yet video games are the medium that requires more time and attention. It's easy to get burned out, which is why smaller and breezier games are almost as important as the big ones to stay healthy.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nFor the last few weeks, UFO 50 (only available on Steam for now) has been my 'game to play while having something on in the background' and I couldn't be more impressed with what Derek Yu and the talented developers behind Downwell, Air Land & Sea, Skorpulac, Catacomb Kids, and Madhouse have put together over nine flippin' years (check out this report on the collection that VG247 published... back in 2017).\n\nOf course, almost everyone has had more projects in the works meanwhile. Chief among them was Spelunky 2, which Yu finally unleashed in 2020. Meanwhile, UFO 50 continued to evolve in silence, and this last September it dropped without making much noise until the press got on top of it. After spending some time (less than I'd like) with it myself, I'm happy to report folks were not exaggerating. This thing whips and should be in the GOTY conversations coming up.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nSure, plenty of solo developers and indie studios have totally nailed the NES-era aesthetic and overarching design philosophies over the years (I just won't stop here to name countless examples), yet a recurring feeling I have is that most of those either feel a tad too modern despite everything else or just old in the worst possible way (rusty and not very fun to play). UFO 50, meanwhile, while not a complete home run (I mean, it literally packs 50 fully-featured, old-ass titles), completely feels like one of those bootleg cartridges full of whatever.\n\nI'm not gonna lie: I noped the f**k out of a handful of the games I've played so far, mainly because I wasn't in the mood to figure out obtuse mechanics or perfect timings, but almost no title in this fictional collection has felt bland or uninspired. There's a clear intent and vision behind all of them, and even if many don't click with me, I can see someone else enjoying the crap outta them. After all, they cover all sorts of genres and even try to replicate the 'evolution' of a fictional game company during the 1980s. Of course, this has led players to discover a meta layer that only makes the package even nuttier.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nControls are kept pretty simple in most cases too, which definitely helps the accessibility factor that permeates the whole thing. I'd consider most of the games included 'hard' by today's standards, but in most cases, it all comes down to the unique game design and the developers going 'look, you gotta master this s**t like back in the day, no excuses' (which rocks). This also applies to titles that include a multiplayer option or are straight-up designed as local party games; they're meant to be easy to pick up and just play in quick sessions.\n\nThis ain't a review, so I won't pretend to have played the full collection nor I'll get into specifics. This is a super juicy bundle of joy that I'll be playing for a long time, and I'm taking my time with it. It shines brighter when played between larger gaming sessions or during lunch breaks, and I strongly believe it doesn't benefit from brain-rotting, sweaty marathons better suited for modern video games. This is the message I'm trying to get across; I want you to discover what it has to offer for yourself.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nThis also means it's sort of the perfect game to play on your Steam Deck; I'd be surprised if it doesn't reach the Switch sooner rather than later. Instead of \"one more round,\" you'll be saying \"one more game,\" as you never know what you'll come across next. It's okay if you never beat them, as the experience alone of booting them up and fumbling around is magical and enriching enough. In a way, UFO 50 brings back that magic of ancient games you booted up over and over again but rarely managed to beat. Achievements await true sickos though.\n\nOkay, maybe I'll let you have some of my personal recommendations so far before I leave: Mortol, Velgress, Attactics, Bushido Ball, Camouflage, Campanella, Warptank (this one is genuinely fantastic), and Porgy. Try not to look them up before jumping in, trust me. This wild ride shouldn't be spoiled by our modern model of consumption. Your list of favorites might look very different, and that's the entire point of this trip down a memory lane that doesn't quite exist."

Apple Intelligence is also available for iPad and Mac models that support iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, the company is implementing its first set of generative AI tools that aim to change how people use their iPhones and cement Apple\u2019s stake in the AI race against competitors like Microsoft and Google. Generative AI is the technology that produces unique text and images in response to user-prompts \u2014 from obscure images to relentlessly catchy music.\n\nThe release of Apple Intelligence comes on the heels of the iPhone 16 release in September, which is equipped with chip hardware designed to support Apple\u2019s AI-powered features.\n\nA pivot to AI has been a focus for Apple since it first unveiled the suite of Apple Intelligence features at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June.

Apple sold just an estimated 37 million units in the first weekend of iPhone 16 pre-sales, down more than 12% compared to the same period last year, according to a blog post from Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with TF International Securities.\n\nAdditionally, Apple recently cut orders for iPhone 16s by about 10 million units through the end of 2024 and into 2025, according to another blog post by Kuo. That cut will result in less production of iPhones, he noted. According to Kuo, iPhone production for the fourth quarter of 2024 is now forecast at around 80 million, down year-over-year from 84 million.\n\nKuo noted that he did not think Apple Intelligence would immediately boost Apple\u2019s prospects for better sales.\n\n\u201cSome market participants are optimistic that Apple Intelligence could dramatically boost iPhone shipments soon,\u201d Kuo said in the blog post. \u201cHowever, Apple\u2019s recent order cuts suggest this optimistic expectation may not materialize in the short term.\u201d\n\nThe first rollout of Apple Intelligence features are available on devices with language settings set to American English.

        "source": "The Eagle",
        "article_content": "While the paranormal might be a cause for fear to many, an intrepid group of Aggies prefer exploring the most haunted locations in Texas to find proof of lingering spirits.\n\nIn 2023, Forbes ranked Texas as the most haunted state in America with over 13,710 cemeteries, 7,517 ghost sightings, 925 haunted locations and 158 paranormal investigators. The Brazos Valley is no stranger to ghost stories and haunted locations, including the LaSalle Hotel in Downtown Bryan and the Animal Industries Building on the Texas A&M University campus.\n\nThe Texas A&M Paranormal Society (TAPS) brings believers and skeptics alike to haunted locations across Texas along with professional-level ghost hunting gear to test for paranormal activity and, hopefully, find evidence to one of life's greatest mysteries.\n\nIsa Rodriguez, TAPS president, recently led a paranormal investigation at the Queen Theatre in Downtown Bryan, which was rumored to be haunted after someone died from suicide in a nearby building years ago.\n\n\u201cWe also went to the Queen Theatre last semester and had a great time. I think that was one of the most active places I had ever been to back when I was vice president,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cLuckily, we have a really good relationship with the owner. They love to hear what we find and they trust us. \u2026 There\u2019s this pit in the back, behind the screen, and we got a lot of vocal evidence with the spirit box.\u201d\n\nParanormal investigators use a variety of tools to find evidence of the paranormal. A spirit box, also known as a ghost box, is a radio with a frequency scan that jumps from station to station, occasionally giving the listener words or phrases as it is believed that spirits communicate over different radio frequencies. Similarly, investigators may use an EMF (electromagnetic field radiation) reader, thermometer or motion detector in their hunts.\n\nRodriguez said she\u2019s had her own paranormal encounter on campus at Francis Hall which has been rumored to be haunted since 2003, especially in the early morning hours.\n\n\u201cWe investigated Francis Hall on campus and that was one of the first places that I\u2019d genuinely had a paranormal encounter and something that was inexplicable, because we were up on the third floor and I heard a child\u2019s laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cEver since then, I thank God I\u2019m not a construction science major, because I do not step foot in there by myself.\u201d\n\nOne of the other supposedly haunted locations on campus is the Animal Industries building where it is rumored, in 1965, the meat laboratory manager accidentally sliced through his femoral artery when trying to cut meat. The man bled to death and has allegedly been haunting the building ever since with some saying they have heard screams in the hallways late at night.\n\nAs a senior soon to graduate from A&M, Rodriguez hopes TAPS continues to grow and welcome both believers and non-believers.\n\n\u201cI think the paranormal is definitely something to explore and to accept, regardless of if you\u2019re a skeptic or not. There\u2019s skeptics in our organization,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a joy to lead this group and cultivate a space for them to be themselves and explore things that are still unknown.\u201d\n\nRhett England, public relations officer for TAPS, has been in the group for nearly four years since freshman year and has seen his fair share of haunts and paranormal encounters.\n\n\u201cWe went to a location called Tejas Barbecue in Tomball. At that investigation, I was touched on my side. I thought it was one of the members who was standing by me, and I asked him if he was touching me. He said no,\u201d England recalled. \u201cAnd we got this on video, but I had a drawstring bag and one of the strings kept moving side to side while I was standing still.\u201d\n\nMultiple types of hauntings exist, England said, which could influence the evidence the group is able to find.\n\n\u201cResidual haunting is just repetitive and triggered by something, like a certain day of the year,\" England said. \"For example, if you died on Oct. 31, you\u2019re more likely to reappear on that day, or like Gettysburg where you'll hear the sounds of screaming soldiers.\u201d\n\nEngland said one of the biggest misconceptions people may have about TAPS is that they deny scientific knowledge.\n\n\u201cI think people should approach the paranormal with an open mind because I do believe in science, but I think science is a developing field, so it can only explain so many things,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that we\u2019re about to actually go and investigate places with actual equipment because I\u2019ve never had the opportunity before in my life to do something like that.\u201d\n\nAngelina Garcia, vice president of TAPS, is currently a sophomore sociology student at A&M and has a deep appreciation for learning about how cultures around the world discuss the paranormal.\n\n\u201cI think where I grew up in San Antonio and being Hispanic, there\u2019s obviously a very big connection to the dead and what happens after you die,\" she said. \"So maybe, subconsciously, my Hispanic heritage and my family really pushed me to go into both my degree and TAPS.\u201d\n\nParanormal investigations often have been portrayed on TV shows and video games but their level of accuracy is not always accurate, Garcia said.\n\n\u201cEspecially now that I've done my own investigations, and I've used a decent amount of the equipment, everything that you watch is obviously very dramatized, and a lot of it is faked,\u201d she said. \u201cI think at the core of a lot of shows, it is true to how investigations are conducted, especially for the more realistic shows like the earlier seasons of 'Ghost Adventures.'\u201d\n\nGarcia said, in her experience, people can have a pessimistic view on the afterlife while TAPS gives A&M students the opportunity to explore the unknown with friends.\n\n\u201cI feel like TAPS is a very good club, for lack of a better word, for the misfits, the ones who believe in spirits and those who may be a little alternative. There\u2019s not a lot of spaces for us on campus and I really want us to stay and expand so we can be a space for the kids that may not fit in with the general student population,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to think it\u2019s worth investigating into spirits. It\u2019s good to know there\u2019s more than just us on Earth or out there.\u201d\n\nAlas, no reports of paranormal activity was experienced in the group's latest trip to the Queen Theatre."

        "article_content": "Timed with Halloween, a group of thrill-seekers gathered at Oak Park\u2019s historic Pleasant Home on Friday to learn more about the 19th century mansion\u2019s alleged supernatural occurrences from experts.\n\nParticipants explored the historic Pleasant Home alongside a team of paranormal investigators from The Other Side Investigations, roaming the eerie rooms and corridors of Pleasant Home using ghost-hunting equipment to uncover the mysteries behind its storied past and reported supernatural phenomena.\n\nIn small groups, attendees explored different areas of the house. Equipped with devices provided by The Other Side Investigations team, they searched for signs of paranormal activity. The Other Side Investigations team guided them through the experience explaining the equipment used to detect paranormal activity, such as the REM Pod, ghost box, and K2 meters. They also shared personal stories and insights from their own ghost hunting experiences.\n\nAnd indeed, after the event, some claimed to have experienced some paranormal activity.\n\nOak Park resident Elli Wade, visiting Pleasant Home for the first time, said the group encountered some paranormal activity in the billiard room. Wade was holding the K2 Meter while in a circle with other attendees sitting down and the reading of the K2 meter went from a 0.1 to a 0.4 reading. The Other Side Investigations told the room that because of the change of that meter, there was paranormal activity going on.\n\n\u201cIt was very cool to actually see it happen in front of my eyes,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThis is such a beautiful house and it\u2019s fun to do something like this. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I love Halloween. We joke that Halloween is my Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nPhoto provided\n\n\u201cThis was a little sample bite and appetizer of ghost hunting. We love to help people. Sometimes the unknown is very scary for some people,\u201d said Lesley Tuton, an investigation coordinator from the team.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations acquisitioner David Amesquita shared his hopes for the event, saying he wanted attendees to experience the beauty of Pleasant Home firsthand. For those who hadn\u2019t visited before, he felt it was a perfect opportunity to appreciate the mansion\u2019s charm up close.\n\n\u201cI go out and try to find different locations for us to visit, whether it\u2019s through various park districts or libraries. I try to get our name out there and secure more places to explore. I also look for different haunted houses and people often reach out to me so we can set something up,\u201d Amesquita said.\n\nNoelle Combs, historic properties and special events coordinator for the Park District of Oak Park, started her work with the park district in March and has had her fair share of eerie experiences at Pleasant Home.\n\nCombs told the group that she recently saw a figure in a top hat walk by in the mirror that can be seen when heading up to the second floor and when she looked up, there was nothing.\n\nCombs said she has seen unexplained door slammings and that Susan Crane, the historic properties and special events manager, smelled tobacco when nobody would be smoking.\n\n\u201cI never feel scared in this house. I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about those things. You guys are experts, but like you said, you only get to come at night. I\u2019m here sometimes from nine in the morning until eleven at night and things do happen,\u201d Combs said.\n\nEvent attendees also heard about the rich history of Pleasant Home from Paula Fenza, a docent for the mansion for more than nine years. Fenza said that Pleasant Home was built in 1897 by architect George Washington Maher for John Farson, his wife, Mamie, and their two sons, John Jr. and William. The family moved into the house in 1899.\n\n\u201cJohn and Mamie had wonderful, lavish parties. They would be so happy to see all of you here, because this is what they loved to do, welcome people into their home,\u201d Fenza said.\n\nPhoto provided\n\nAfter John Farson died in 1910, Mamie sold Pleasant Home, along with its custom furnishings, to inventor Herbert Mills, known for creating the slot machine and the railroad crossing gate. Mills lived in the house with his wife Leonie and their eight children until his death in 1929, followed by Leonie\u2019s passing in 1930.\n\nIn 1939, the children sold the house and its four-acre estate to the Park District, stipulating two conditions: the grounds were to be opened as a public park named Mills Park in honor of their father; and the home was to be preserved and used as a gathering space for the community. Today, Pleasant Home serves as a historic landmark and venue for guided tours and local events.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations team is expected to return to Oak Park this spring for another public investigation, this time at the historic Cheney Mansion.\n\nRelated"

        "article_content": "Researchers have uncovered a rare and intelligent fungus. The fungus is called Phanerochaete velutina, and while it isn\u2019t overly intelligent\u2014it won\u2019t be taking over the world anytime soon like the fungus in The Last of Us\u2014it still shows signs of recognizing shapes and even being able to communicate about its surroundings with the rest of its fungal network.\n\nThe researchers who made the discovery highlight their findings in a paper published in the journal Funal Ecology. In the paper, they discuss how they conducted various experiments, including one where they arranged small wood blocks in several different shapes and allowed the fungi to spread within the shapes.\n\nAs the rare and intelligent fungus spread, they found that it was able to make different decisions based on the type of arrangement the blocks had been set up in. Instead of just spreading out from a central point, they were able to change how they spread out to fit the shape more effectively. This suggests a rudimentary level of intelligence is found within P. velutina.\n\nAccording to the paper, when the fungi were placed in a circle arrangement of blocks, they were able to figure out where the blocks were and then pass that information to the rest of the network, as they never moved to the center of the circle. They seemed to realize that no blocks would be found there. The researchers say this means that the fungal mycelium can \u201crecognize\u201d the difference in the spatial arrangement of wooden blocks.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.
