        "article_content": "DONALD Trump has been challenged to \"change history forever\" and come clean about UFO intel if he makes a stunning return to the White House this week.\n\nArizona-based expert Nick Pope says there is growing hope within the global UFO community that if Trump returns for a second term, he will push through an executive order to have several classified files released.\n\n5 Donald Trump, pictured on his golf course in Scotland in 2013, has been challenged to release any UFO secrets the government has Credit: Getty\n\n5 Recent whistleblower revelations suggested the White House created a special program to track UFO sightings called the Immaculate Constellation Credit: Getty\n\n5 UFO expert Nick Pope spoke about his hopes of finally seeing revelatory documents released that he believes could change history forever Credit: News Nation Now/On Balance with Leland Vittert\n\nHe also believes the recent whistleblower revelation that the US Government has created an \"active and highly secretive\" tracking program called the Immaculate Constellation could spark Trump's divulgation of critical information about the potential presence of other lifeforms.\n\nSECRET REVELATIONS\n\nQuizzed about his views on UFOs during his recent interview on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump said he was told \"a lot.\"\n\nPope, who used to work for a British Government department investigating the mysterious phenomenon that has enthralled believers for decades, is adamant the former president has been fully briefed and \"is being cautious about what to disclose.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a strong belief that the US government knows something concrete and might release it, particularly if Trump regains office,\" Pope excitedly told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Many see Trump as a disruptor and a populist, less beholden to the deep state or career bureaucrats. Unlike other politicians, he could potentially push for full disclosure.\"\n\nTrump has previously revealed, during an interview with his son, Donald Jr., that \"he knows a few things\" but had to be careful with the information.\n\nPope believes Trump is also determined to release the JFK files, which have similarly been shrouded in secrecy as the conspiracy theories over the infamous 1963 assassination continue to swirl.\n\n\"He\u2019s already promised total transparency on JFK if re-elected, so it\u2019s reasonable to think he might do the same with UFOs,\" the expert continued.\n\n\"SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS\"\n\nA whistleblower linked to the Immaculate Constellation case, described as \"a current or former US government official,\" has allegedly written a report with significant claims.\n\nIt alleges that the US executive branch has been addressing issues related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and non-human intelligence (NHI) without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization.\n\nWill Trump or Harris FINALLY reveal the truth about America\u2019s alien secrets? UFO expert says one candidate will tell all\n\nThis situation, the report claims, may have persisted for decades.\n\nThere are also detailed descriptions of several UFO encounters logged in a government database.\n\nOne incident involved an F-22 fighter jet being \"intercepted and boxed in\" by a group of three to six spherical objects, which ultimately forced the jet to leave its mission area.\n\nIn another reported encounter, the crew aboard a Navy aircraft carrier observed a sphere glowing orange-red with a surface that seemed to be \u201croiling like the sun.\u201d\n\nThis object descended rapidly from a high altitude, stopping to hover approximately 100-200 yards (90-180 meters) above the flight deck.\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger claimed he had communicated with the alleged whistleblower.\n\nHowever, identifying information, such as the exact role and gender, was being withheld to protect them from retaliation.\n\nFRESH HOPES\n\nIf Trump does indeed defeat Kamala Harris and return to the Washington DC hot seat, Pope is hoping access will be granted for \"clearer, longer videos of UFO sightings\" as well as underwater tracking data, which insiders believe is also present.\n\nFootage from military surveillance systems could also be released.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot we haven\u2019t seen from the military\u2019s surveillance systems,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"For example, the recent Chinese spy balloon was followed by other ambiguous shoot-downs, yet the government cited national security concerns as reasons for not releasing clear images.\n\n\"But soon after, they released clear photos of a Russian aircraft near a U.S. drone. This kind of inconsistency frustrates the UFO community, and we expect that a new administration might change this stance.\"\n\nAllan Lichtman's 2024 presidential election prediction Renowned historian Allan Lichtman has accurately predicted the outcomes of presidential elections since 1984 using his 13 Keys to the White House algorithm. In 2016, he was one of the few scholars who correctly predicted a Trump win. This year, has revealed who he thinks will be inaugurated as the 47th president in January next year based on his system of true and false statements. If six or more statements go against the White House party, they are projected to lose the presidential election. Midterm elections: The Democrats suffered losses in the 2022 House elections, meaning the key turns false. (Harris 0-1 Trump) There is no primary contest: This key turns in favor of Harris because the Democrats got \"smart\" and rallied behind the vice president after Joe Biden ended his campaign, according to Lichtman. (Harris 1-1 Trump) The sitting president is seeking another term: This turns false because Biden suspended his re-election campaign. (Harris 1-2 Trump) There is no third-party challenger: This statement is true because third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. needed to poll at 10% nationally, according to Lichtman. (Harris 2-2 Trump) The short-term economy is strong: This key goes in favor of the White House Party. (Harris 3-2 Trump) The long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms: This key also swings toward Harris. (Harris 4-2 Trump) The White House Party has made major national policy changes: This key is also true, according to Lichtman's theory. (Harris 5-2 Trump) There is sustained social unrest during the term: College campus demonstrations have erupted in reaction to the Gaza conflict, but no protests have broken out that threaten the fabric of society. This means the key goes in Harris' column. (Harris 6-2 Trump) The White House is untainted by scandal: Despite House Republican efforts to impeach Joe Biden, they have been unable to pin a scandal on him. (Harris 7-2 Trump) The incumbent is charismatic: Harris is not considered a Ronald Reagan or Franklin D. Roosevelt-like figure so the key is false. (Harris 7-3 Trump) The challenger is uncharismatic: This key goes in favor of the White House party - even though Trump is a showman. (Harris 8-3 Trump) Lichtman warned that the two foreign policy keys - whether there has been a major success or no failure - could flip either way. But, even if both statements flipped against Harris, Trump would not have enough keys in his column to win the election.\n\nInterest in possible extraterrestrial activity from political parties isn't new.\n\nMarco Rubio and Tim Burchett have pushed for transparency in the past, while Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Coretz and Kirsten Gillibrand have also voiced interest.\n\nUFO fanatic Robert Bigelow has donated millions to Republican campaigns over the years.\n\nHISTORY CHANGER\n\nPope, however, believes a maverick like Trump \"could make a real change\" and push ahead with some seriously stunning revelations.\n\n\"Some feel he\u2019s polarizing, but still hope he might follow through on disclosure promises,\" the expert admitted.\n\n\"People would remember where they were when it happened, much like they remember moments associated with JFK,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"And if there\u2019s a backstory, such as humanity\u2019s origins being linked to extraterrestrials, it could fundamentally alter worldviews, even presenting darker possibilities\u2014that Earth might be a science experiment, prison, or farm, theories that would undoubtedly provoke significant shifts in understanding.\n\n\"The President who discloses alien existence would change history forever.\"\n\n5 UFO expert Nick Pope told The U.S. Sun he believes Trump is a \"disruptor\" who will come clean about what the government knows about UFOs Credit: Getty"

        "article_content": "NSF NOIRLab Astronomers Discover the Fastest-Feeding Black Hole in the Early Universe \u2014 Observations from JWST and Chandra reveal a low-mass supermassive black hole that appears to be consuming matter at over 40 times the theoretical limit\n\nSupermassive black holes exist at the center of most galaxies, and modern telescopes continue to observe them at surprisingly early times in the Universe\u2019s evolution. It\u2019s difficult to understand how these black holes were able to grow so big so rapidly. But with the discovery of a low-mass supermassive black hole feasting on material at an extreme rate, seen just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, astronomers now have valuable new insights into the mechanisms of rapidly growing black holes in the early Universe.\n\nLID-568 was discovered by a cross-institutional team of astronomers led by International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer Hyewon Suh. They used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe a sample of galaxies from the Chandra X-ray Observatory\u2019s COSMOS legacy survey. This population of galaxies is very bright in the X-ray part of the spectrum, but are invisible in the optical and near-infrared. JWST\u2019s unique infrared sensitivity allows it to detect these faint counterpart emissions.\n\nLID-568 stood out within the sample for its intense X-ray emission, but its exact position could not be determined from the X-ray observations alone, raising concerns about properly centering the target in JWST\u2019s field of view. So, rather than using traditional slit spectroscopy, JWST\u2019s instrumentation support scientists suggested that Suh\u2019s team use the integral field spectrograph on JWST\u2019s NIRSpec. This instrument can get a spectrum for each pixel in the instrument\u2019s field of view rather than being limited to a narrow slice.\n\n\u201cOwing to its faint nature, the detection of LID-568 would be impossible without JWST. Using the integral field spectrograph was innovative and necessary for getting our observation,\u201d says Emanuele Farina, International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer and co-author of the paper appearing in Nature Astronomy.\n\nJWST\u2019s NIRSpec allowed the team to get a full view of their target and its surrounding region, leading to the unexpected discovery of powerful outflows of gas around the central black hole. The speed and size of these outflows led the team to infer that a substantial fraction of the mass growth of LID-568 may have occurred in a single episode of rapid accretion. \u201cThis serendipitous result added a new dimension to our understanding of the system and opened up exciting avenues for investigation,\u201d says Suh.\n\nIn a stunning discovery, Suh and her team found that LID-568 appears to be feeding on matter at a rate 40 times its Eddington limit. This limit relates to the maximum luminosity that a black hole can achieve, as well as how fast it can absorb matter, such that its inward gravitational force and outward pressure generated from the heat of the compressed, infalling matter remain in balance. When LID-568\u2019s luminosity was calculated to be so much higher than theoretically possible, the team knew they had something remarkable in their data.\n\n\u201cThis black hole is having a feast,\u201d says International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer and co-author Julia Scharw\u00e4chter. \u201cThis extreme case shows that a fast-feeding mechanism above the Eddington limit is one of the possible explanations for why we see these very heavy black holes so early in the Universe.\u201d\n\nThese results provide new insights into the formation of supermassive black holes from smaller black hole \u2018seeds\u2019, which current theories suggest arise either from the death of the Universe\u2019s first stars (light seeds) or the direct collapse of gas clouds (heavy seeds). Until now, these theories lacked observational confirmation. \u201cThe discovery of a super-Eddington accreting black hole suggests that a significant portion of mass growth can occur during a single episode of rapid feeding, regardless of whether the black hole originated from a light or heavy seed,\u201d says Suh.\n\nThe discovery of LID-568 also shows that it\u2019s possible for a black hole to exceed its Eddington limit, and provides the first opportunity for astronomers to study how this happens. It\u2019s possible that the powerful outflows observed in LID-568 may be acting as a release valve for the excess energy generated by the extreme accretion, preventing the system from becoming too unstable. To further investigate the mechanisms at play, the team is planning follow-up observations with JWST.\n\nMore information\n\nThis research was presented in a paper entitled \u201cA super-Eddington-accreting black hole ~1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang observed with JWST\u201d to appear in Nature Astronomy.

        "article_content": "A handful of microbes have put global health on the ropes. They are the superbugs, considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one of the 10 main threats to public health and responsible for 1.27 million deaths a year. The WHO is specifically targeting 15 microorganisms considered \u201chighly dangerous\u201d due to their resistance to the arsenal of available antibiotics and their ability to spread or transmit resistance to other bacteria. Sworn enemies include, for example, resistant Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, among others. Regarding the latter, research published on Thursday in the journal Science has delved into their mechanisms for escaping antimicrobials and has discovered that, in order to be highly resistant, these microbes adopt a double defense.\n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) alone causes around 120,000 deaths a year worldwide. It is \u201ca serious global threat,\u201d explains Simon Foster, a researcher at the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom) and author of the study, which reveals a new defense mechanism for this bacteria. Methicillin was the antibiotic traditionally used against this microbe, but due to the appearance of MRSA and the toxicity of the drug itself, Foster explains, it was no longer being used. The problem is that methicillin belongs to a broader family of antibiotics, beta-lactams, and MRSA has become resistant to almost all of them. \u201cMRSA can sometimes be treated with other antibiotics, such as linezolid or tetracycline. However, for serious infections, such as bacteremia or endocarditis, daptomycin or vancomycin must be used. The problem is that resistance has developed against each of them,\u201d explains the expert.\n\nThe scientific community has long since discovered that MRSA had a peculiarity: it had acquired a gene that encodes a component called MecA, which helps form the bacteria\u2019s cell walls so that it can grow and divide. This genomic peculiarity makes it resistant, but researchers knew that this characteristic alone was not enough to be highly resistant. \u201cIt was also known that there are other small changes that occur in bacteria that allow a big jump in the level of resistance,\u201d Foster adds in an email response. Scientists thought that these small genetic changes, called \u201cenhancers\u201d in scientific jargon, allowed MecA to work better.\n\nHowever, the University of Sheffield researcher explains, his new discovery has turned the initial assumptions on its head and has revealed that these enhancers \u201care not related to the activity of MecA, but are part of another mechanism necessary for high-level resistance.\u201d Specifically, the authors discovered that MRSA adopts an alternative mode of cell division in the presence of antimicrobials to ensure its survival. \u201cBy using the newly discovered mechanism, bacteria divide in a different way that does not require a key activity that is normally needed for them to divide and multiply,\u201d says the researcher.\n\nThese two defense mechanisms are synergistic: \u201cBoth are necessary for high-level methicillin resistance. MecA needs to be resistant at a low level, about 10 times more than a sensitive strain, and potentiation needs to be resistant at a high level, about 1,000 times more than a sensitive strain. Potentiation alone does not make them resistant,\u201d says Foster.\n\nAccording to the authors, their discovery opens the door to finding new therapeutic strategies to fight antibiotic resistance. Foster argues that the discovery of this new division mechanism, hitherto unknown, is important on two levels: \u201cFirstly, it has been shown that these bacteria have the ability to divide in a way that was previously unknown, which sheds light on the mechanisms that sustain the life of this organism. Secondly, it shows that the development of resistance is more complex than we had previously imagined and uses the newly discovered pathway, which has important ramifications for the development of new treatments to control MRSA.\u201d The scientist assures that there are already compounds to which this resistant bacteria is vulnerable, and the activity in each of its two defense systems could be mapped to find other new treatments.\n\nA worrying pathogen\n\nBruno Gonz\u00e1lez-Zorn, director of the Antimicrobial Resistance Unit at the Complutense University of Madrid and advisor to the WHO in this field, stresses that MRSA is one of the pathogens \u201cthat causes the most mortality and the most concern at the hospital level\u201d and any advance in the knowledge of the biology of the resistance it generates, such as this research, is important: \u201cIt is an article on fundamental biology where it describes that MRSA acquires a gene that confers resistance. But one in every 10,000 of these manages to have a very high resistance and, until now, it was not known what made it highly resistant because that gene alone was insufficient. The new discovery will not have an immediate clinical implication, but it does open the door to designing molecules to inhibit that high level of resistance,\u201d reflects the microbiologist, who has not participated in this research.\n\nMar\u00eda del Mar Tom\u00e1s, a microbiologist at the A Coru\u00f1a University Hospital Complex and spokesperson for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), has a similar opinion: \u201cIt is extremely interesting. Many investigations have focused on the classic resistance mechanisms, those that act on antibiotics, but this study looks at the tolerance and stress mechanisms of the bacteria, which can also influence resistance.\u201d Tom\u00e1s points out that Foster\u2019s research, in which she did not participate, finds \u201cthe perfect link\u201d to explain the high resistance of MRSA to antibiotics: \u201cIt is a mechanism that combines the union of MecA with a mutation in enhancer genes related to cell division: the bacteria grows in a different, abnormal and disordered way, but it manages to stop the antibiotic from acting.\u201d\n\nThe research published in Science also raises new questions, Foster admits. For example, whether MRSA may have other hidden mechanisms to evade antibiotics: \u201cOur discovery of this new mechanism using an alternative division strategy demonstrates how little we know. We are currently working to elucidate the basis of the alternative division mode and how enhancers actually work to promote resistance. This allows us to discover a whole range of cellular capabilities that we can now explore. There is always more to discover and understand,\u201d the scientist says.\n\nAnother question is whether these same defense pathways are replicated in other resistant bacteria. For now, Foster says, enhancers are associated with resistance to other types of antibiotics and have been found in other bacteria. \u201cWe are working to determine whether there is a common thread between bacteria and whether this mechanism is more frequent than we had previously suggested,\u201d he says.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

In the late 20th century, universities like MIT and Harvard became incubators for groundbreaking ideas. Their research spurred technological advancements, laying a solid foundation for entrepreneurship.\n\nThe dot-com boom in the 1990s marked a pivotal moment. It drew attention and investment to Boston\u2019s burgeoning tech sector.

The growth continues as new generations push boundaries and redefine what\u2019s possible in business.\n\nKey Elements of Boston\u2019s Startup Culture\n\nBoston\u2019s startup culture thrives on a few key elements that set it apart.\n\nAccess to funding is vital.

These hubs encourage networking and partnerships among diverse startups. Here, connections are made over coffee or during brainstorming sessions.\n\nMeetups and events happen regularly. They provide platforms for founders to showcase their work while learning from others in similar journeys. This culture of openness fosters a sense of community that feels unique to Boston.\n\nMentorship also plays a key role. Seasoned entrepreneurs willingly offer guidance to newcomers, helping them navigate challenges in an ever-evolving market landscape.\n\nThis collaborative spirit not only drives innovation but also strengthens relationships within the ecosystem. As startups support one another, they cultivate a climate rich with opportunity and growth potential.\n\n\u2013 Proximity to Top Universities and Talent Pool\n\nBoston boasts some of the world\u2019s leading universities, creating a vibrant ecosystem for startups. Institutions like Harvard, MIT, and Boston University are not just academic powerhouses; they produce a steady stream of skilled graduates eager to innovate.\n\nThese schools foster an entrepreneurial spirit through programs that encourage students to explore their ideas. Incubators and accelerators affiliated with these universities often provide crucial support for budding entrepreneurs.\n\nAdditionally, many professors engage in research that leads to startup formations.

Companies like HubSpot, founded in 2006, transformed the marketing landscape with its innovative inbound marketing software. Its success showcases the potential of Boston\u2019s unique ecosystem.\n\nAnother notable example is Drift, a conversational marketing platform that emerged from the city\u2019s tech scene. Their approach to customer engagement is now an industry standard.\n\nThe life sciences sector also shines here. Moderna, known for its groundbreaking mRNA technology used in vaccines, has put Boston at the forefront of biotech innovation.\n\nThese stories reflect not just individual successes but a collective spirit driving entrepreneurship forward in Boston\u2019s vibrant startup culture. Each company adds to a narrative rich with creativity and resilience while inspiring future founders to pursue their dreams amidst challenges.\n\nChallenges Faced by the Startup Community in Boston\n\nThe startup community in Boston, while thriving, faces notable challenges. One significant hurdle is the high cost of living. Founders and employees often grapple with steep housing prices, making it difficult to attract and retain talent.\n\nDiversity remains another pressing issue. The lack of inclusivity can stifle innovation and limit perspectives within startups. Many entrepreneurs feel that a richer mix of backgrounds could lead to more groundbreaking ideas.\n\nBoston also competes fiercely with Silicon Valley for resources and attention. This rivalry creates pressure on local startups to perform at an exceptionally high level just to stay relevant.\n\nNavigating these challenges requires resilience from the entrepreneurial ecosystem. As founders adapt, they may find innovative solutions that not only benefit their companies but also enhance the overall landscape of Boston\u2019s startup culture.\n\n\u2013 High Cost of Living\n\nBoston\u2019s high cost of living presents a significant hurdle for startups and their teams. Housing prices have soared, making it challenging for entrepreneurs to attract talent without offering competitive salaries.\n\nThe expense doesn\u2019t stop at rent or mortgages. Basic necessities like groceries, transportation, and utilities also come with hefty price tags. This financial strain can pressure budding companies that are still in their early stages.\n\nMany young professionals find themselves juggling multiple jobs just to make ends meet while pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams. The reality is that the vibrant startup culture can sometimes feel inaccessible due to these economic barriers.\n\nAs founders seek innovative solutions, they must navigate this landscape wisely. It\u2019s a balancing act between fostering growth and managing expenses in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Limited Diversity and Inclusivity\n\nDespite its vibrant ecosystem, Boston\u2019s startup culture faces challenges with diversity and inclusivity. The tech scene often mirrors the demographics of its surrounding areas, which can lead to a homogeneous environment.\n\nMany founders come from similar educational backgrounds and networks. This lack of varied perspectives can stifle creativity and innovation within startups.\n\nEfforts are being made to change this narrative, but progress is slow. Underrepresented groups still find it difficult to secure funding or mentorship opportunities in comparison to their counterparts.\n\nInitiatives aimed at fostering inclusivity exist, yet they need broader support from established businesses and investors. A shift towards embracing diverse talent could unlock new ideas and drive growth for all involved in the startup community.\n\n\u2013 Competition with Silicon Valley\n\nSilicon Valley often casts a long shadow over other startup ecosystems, and Boston is no exception. The tech giants of the West Coast have set high expectations for innovation and growth. This creates both inspiration and pressure for local startups.\n\nBoston\u2019s entrepreneurs frequently find themselves comparing their journeys to those in Silicon Valley. The allure of massive funding rounds and rapid scaling can be daunting. Yet, this competition drives Boston\u2019s startups to refine their ideas and focus on sustainable growth.\n\nWhile some may see it as a disadvantage, many embrace the challenge. It fosters creativity that differentiates Boston from its competitors. Startups here tend to emphasize quality over quantity, fostering deeper connections with customers.\n\nThis rivalry also encourages collaboration among local businesses looking to carve out their niche in the market. Instead of merely competing with Silicon Valley, Boston aims to complement it through unique innovations tailored for specific industries like healthcare and biotech.\n\nHow Boston\u2019s Startup Culture Impacts the City and its Economy\n\nBoston\u2019s startup culture significantly influences both the city and its economy. The influx of innovative companies fosters job creation, providing opportunities for residents across various skill levels.\n\nAs startups flourish, they attract talent from around the globe. This influx enriches the local workforce and stimulates diverse industries. A vibrant ecosystem emerges where established firms collaborate with newcomers, nurturing creativity and knowledge sharing.\n\nMoreover, successful startups often reinvest in their communities. They support local schools, nonprofits, and infrastructure projects through philanthropic efforts.\n\nThe economic ripple effect is undeniable; increased business activity enhances tax revenues that fund crucial public services and community development initiatives.\n\nThis dynamic also draws significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on Boston\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, further fueling growth in technology sectors like biotech and software development.\n\nThe Future of Boston\u2019s Startup Scene\n\nBoston\u2019s startup scene is poised for exciting growth. The blend of innovation, education, and investment creates fertile ground for new ideas. As technology continues to evolve, so will the opportunities.\n\nEmerging sectors like biotech and artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role. Local firms are already at the forefront of these developments. Collaborations between startups and established companies can drive significant breakthroughs in various industries.\n\nThe city\u2019s commitment to sustainability also sets it apart. Many startups focus on green technologies, aiming to address climate challenges while fostering economic growth.\n\nMoreover, an increasing number of incubators and accelerators are emerging across Boston. These programs provide invaluable mentorship and resources for budding entrepreneurs.\n\nAs more diverse voices enter the ecosystem, fresh perspectives will shape innovative solutions. This evolution promises a vibrant future where creativity thrives alongside technological advancement.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe startup culture in Boston is thriving and unique, with a combination of factors that make it stand out from other cities. From its prestigious universities to its supportive infrastructure and collaborative community, Boston provides a promising environment for startups to grow and succeed. As more entrepreneurs flock to this innovative city, we can expect to see even more growth and success stories in the future. Whether you\u2019re an aspiring entrepreneur or simply curious about the startup scene, Boston\u2019s vibrant culture is definitely worth exploring."

        "article_content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. \u2014 A 4-4 record itself is no reason for the Chicago Bears to be alarmed midway through the season.\n\nThe trend is the problem for coach Matt Eberflus and his staff, and unless it changes soon, the season and future of the team could become a more prominent question.\n\nThe Bears are coming off two devastating losses, one on a last-second Hail Mary pass at Washington and then Sunday\u2019s 29-9 blowout at Arizona. And Eberflus thinks he knows what the biggest problem is for his struggling team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on exactly what we need to improve on and that, to me, starts with the run game on offense and then defense, and to me, everything falls off of that,\u201d Eberflus said Monday. \u201cWe have to do a really good job of establishing that and that\u2019s where you get your play-action passes and that\u2019s where you get your play-action screens and putting yourselves in a good position to execute on third down if you get to that.\u201d\n\nBears quarterback Caleb Williams has struggled in road games with a 67.2 passer rating, compared to 105.1 at home, and the passing game ranks 28th overall in passing yards. The lack of a consistent rushing attack to help set up Williams' passing game has led to poor starts. The Bears have 10 first-quarter points.\n\n\u201cWe need to get ready to play and ready to score points from drive one, from play one, and I think we have gotten ourselves into some negative plays, scenarios in those instances,\u201d rookie wide receiver Rome Odunze said. \u201cAnd we had flashes of great success on the first drive, too.\n\n\"So, we need to sustain that all the way into the end zone, so you know we can start fast. Set the tempo for the game.\u201d\n\nChicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams (18) greets Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray after an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. Credit: AP/Ross D. Franklin\n\nWhile the offense has been hampered by inconsistency, Chicago's defense had been solid \u2014 until Sunday. The Cardinals rushed for 213 yards in the victory. It was the most rushing yards allowed by the Bears since Jan. 1, 2023, against Detroit.\n\nChicago played without defensive lineman Montez Sweat because of a shin injury. It also lost defensive lineman Andrew Billings in the second half because of a pectoral injury. Eberflus didn\u2019t have an update on Billings on Monday.\n\nThe team will take no drastic coaching actions, like giving offensive play-calling duties to someone besides offensive coordinator Shane Waldron, Eberflus said.\n\n\u201cThe changes we\u2019re going to make is we\u2019re going to look inward and make sure we do a good job of utilizing our talents and our skill and really just general, basic execution of our plan,\u201d Eberflus said.\n\nChicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams (18) scrambles against the Arizona Cardinals during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. Credit: AP/Ross D. Franklin\n\nUltimately, the Bears say they\u2019re 4-4 and it doesn\u2019t seem like the worst record. Playing in an NFC North where every other team is ahead of them with at least six wins will make the rest of the season difficult. They still have all six NFC North games to play.\n\nWhat\u2019s working\n\nPass defense. Even without starting safety Jaquan Brisker for three games due to a concussion, slot cornerback Kyler Gordon for two games with a hamstring injury and the Hail Mary TD pass, the Bears are eighth against the pass and No. 3 in defensive passer rating and red zone defense.\n\nWhat needs help\n\nThe passing game. Williams has a 65.4 passer rating and 49.2% completion rate (32 of 65) in the last two games after he had been red hot. He had a 106.4 passer rating with nine TDs and three interceptions the previous four games against struggling defenses, but the Cardinals defense had struggled until Sunday.\n\nStock up\n\nOdunze had his second 100-yard game with 104 yards on five catches Sunday, but Williams had problems finding his other receivers.\n\nStock down\n\nTight end Cole Kmet was on a path toward his best season after six games and after Sunday it\u2019s as if he doesn\u2019t exist in the passing attack. He wasn\u2019t targeted once in Sunday\u2019s loss, one week after he wasn\u2019t targeted once against Washington.\n\nInjuries\n\nChicago came out of the eighth game with huge concerns. Right tackle Darnell Wright has a knee injury and Billings is dealing with the pectoral injury. Starting left tackle Braxton Jones missed Sunday\u2019s game with a knee injury, so keeping Williams protected could become a problem. They\u2019re still waiting for Brisker, Gordon and Sweat to return.\n\nKey numbers\n\n3 \u2014 The number of road wins by Eberflus\u2019 Bears teams in 21 tries.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Bears host New England on Sunday at Soldier Field, where they have won eight straight."

        "article_content": "Samsung Galaxy S24 users can now download a new software update. Although it\u2019s not the update people have been waiting for, it\u2019s still important.\n\nAccording to SamMobile, a new software update is being rolled out for the carrier-locked versions of the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra. The firmware version for this update is S92xUSQS4AXJA, and it includes the November 2024 security patch. This update addresses multiple security vulnerabilities, but does not introduce any new features. Instead, it resolves dozens of security issues identified in the previous software version.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLast week, Samsung released the same update for the Galaxy Tab S7 FE.\n\nAlthough the new security update is important, users have been patiently waiting for the next release, One UI 7. This update, based on Android 15, will offer a refreshed design and enhanced features for Galaxy devices. It includes several redesigned icons and a new camera user interface.\n\nOne UI 7 includes modifications such as a pill for system apps on the home screen, reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island. However, unlike Apple, which places its similar feature at the top center of the screen, Samsung\u2019s Dynamic Island will be located on the left side of the notification area.\n\nOnce expected to arrive earlier this year, One UI 7 might not launch until early next year. According to reliable tipster Ice Universe, Samsung is expected to release the first One UI 7 beta to testers in the coming weeks. Although many anticipated this launch in July, it has been delayed by several months.\n\nTo check for the new security update on your Galaxy S24 series device, go to Settings and then navigate to Software Update."
