            "article_content": "Illustration: Hulton Archive/GraphicaArtis/ Getty Images\n\nAt first glance, the story of the U.S. government grappling with evidence of unidentified flying objects has cooled off since last year, when a whistleblower claimed (without firsthand evidence) that the Pentagon had alien bodies and otherworldly spacecraft in its possession. But the past few weeks have seen a number of developments in the UFO story in Congress, where lawmakers like Chuck Schumer are trying to make the Department of Defense be more forward with their information on the unknown objects hovering over U.S. airspace. Meanwhile, the incoming Trump administration \u2014 and its UFO-curious intelligence staffers \u2014 could provide more clarity on a topic that has disappointed some alien hopefuls in the past couple years. To get an update on where things stand, I spoke with former Defense appointee and State Department staffer Marik von Rennenkampff, who has been following the story closely since leaving government.\n\nWhat are the most recent developments in the government\u2019s approach to UFOs?\n\nThere have been two House hearings within about a week. On one side, we have these whistleblowers or individuals who are claiming that there are unreported programs or activities that allegedly retrieve and reverse-engineer craft of nonhuman origin. There was also a hearing with Jon Kosloski, the new director of the government\u2019s UFO analysis office, called AARO. It was an astounding change in tone because for 80 years, the government had said there\u2019s nothing to this. \u201cIt\u2019s all nonsense.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve gone from that to the sitting head of the government\u2019s UFO analysis office saying, in essence, we have true anomalies. The direct quote is, \u201cThere are interesting cases that I \u2014 with my physics and engineering background and time in the [intelligence community] \u2014 I do not understand, and I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands.\u201d\n\nThe other big development seems to that lawmakers are still saying that they are not getting the full reports, and the Defense Department is still obscuring what they\u2019re supposed to be seeing. Last week at the House hearing, Nancy Mace said that \u201cthere are certain individuals who didn\u2019t want this hearing to happen because they feared what might be disclosed.\u201d What are those fears?\n\nIf the intelligence community and the military had their way, nothing would ever be released, period, ever, right? Because anything out there is a potential advantage for an adversary. But there\u2019s nothing inherently classified about the forward-looking infrared pods that are on U.S. aircraft. It\u2019s just infrared technology. You can scrub out any of the metadata and all the symbology. You can redact that stuff and you can put out what the actual object is. But if some of this is foreign intelligence-gathering operations, we don\u2019t want our adversaries knowing what we know about them and what we\u2019ve discovered. So it\u2019s challenging.\n\nUFO disclosure is a bipartisan concern, with senators Chuck Schumer and Mike Rounds proposing a bill for further transparency. What is in this bill?\n\nI think it is the most extraordinary legislation that has ever been proposed in the U.S. Congress. I mean, you literally have nonhuman intelligence defined and mentioned 24 times. It defines legacy program.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly what these whistleblowers are claiming. There\u2019s a provision for, you probably know this, but there\u2019s a provision for the U.S. government specifically inserted into this legislation to assert eminent domain over retrieved craft and biological evidence of nonhuman intelligence. I mean, that\u2019s just stunning to see in black-and-white, let alone that this isn\u2019t some random representative from who knows where. This is the Senate majority leader leading a bipartisan effort.\n\nDoes it have a chance at passing?\n\nI am a little pessimistic. After it failed in December of last year, Schumer went on the Senate floor and was furious. I mean, you could see it. He called out House Republicans for blocking this. I believe that\u2019s where he also said that we\u2019ve been informed by multiple credible sources that elements of the government are withholding information from Congress illegally. That\u2019s a pretty remarkable assertion on any topic, let alone on UFOs. But Senator Rounds is locked onto this. He wants to get, he said he\u2019s personally fairly confident that eventually some kind of review board will be approved.\n\nI\u2019m speaking very anecdotally here, but I feel like I\u2019ve known a good number of people who were really excited by the UFO developments, beginning with the New York Times story in 2017 about Harry Reid funding this research. Over time, that\u2019s become more skeptical. Some of that is due to terrestrial explanations, like balloons and camera issues. But I\u2019ve heard some frustration about whistleblowers like David Grusch, who presents his bombshell claims with multiple degrees of separation between him and the source. Wondering what you think about that skeptics\u2019 case of, Oh, it\u2019s all just balloons or something.\n\nThat\u2019s the mind-set we should all have. We should all be skeptical about this, right?\n\nI will say, let\u2019s talk about balloons, let\u2019s talk about GOFAST. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with the GOFAST. But according to former pilot Ryan Graves, GOFAST was part of a formation of four objects that were flying in a line- abreast formation. Balloons don\u2019t do that 300 miles off the coast of Florida.\n\nHow did you become interested in the UFO story?\n\nI\u2019ll be brutally honest with you, I didn\u2019t think about UFOs. I thought it was completely tinfoil, conspiracy territory, and I missed, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well familiar with the New York Times story that came out in December of 2017. I missed that completely, just as to prove the point here that I just did not think about this topic. I thought it was all nonsense. Then I stumbled upon a Joe Rogan episode with Navy commander Dave Fravor, the pilot who encountered the Tic Tac object in 2004. I knew the type, and he\u2019s a hundred percent the real deal. I mean, I think he\u2019s very, very well respected in the naval aviation community. So that was my ticket down the rabbit hole.\n\nAnd how is the second Trump administration going to push UFO disclosures forward?\n\nSome of the key nominees for national security positions have all made some remarkable statements about this topic in recent years. I go first and foremost to Senator Marco Rubio, who has over and over vouched for the credibility of the individuals coming forward. Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, has said he\u2019s interested. John Ratcliffe, the CIA nominee, has said perhaps the most eyebrow-raising quote, which is that UFOs exhibit technologies that we don\u2019t have and that we cannot defend against.\n\nSo from a transparency perspective, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic based on what we\u2019ve heard from these key individuals over the last few years.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

            "article_content": "For decades, the question of whether UFOs were \"real\" was considered the province of tinfoil-hat nutters and TV shows like Unsolved Mysteries. In recent years, we've seen the topic taken far more seriously, even at the highest levels of our government. So, we're rounding up some evidence to examine whether UFOs are real and what it might mean if they are.\n\nWe'll start with an overview of how we investigate UFO reports and then touch on the significant formative events that shaped American thought on UFOs. We'll also consider reports that turned out not to be aliens or UFOs and look back at modern American war history for insight into why UFOs are so hard to identify. Finally, we'll discuss an unsolved modern UAP* mystery.\n\n*Many professionals in the field have switched from calling them \"UFOs\" to \"UAPs\": Unexplained Aerial Phenomena. In this article, we'll use the more common term UFO.\n\nHow Do We Investigate UFOs?\n\nWe have a vast array of techniques to examine the evidence from UFO reports.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThroughout the 20th century, folks have used the newest technology available, trying to substantiate\u2014or dismiss\u2014reports of visitors from beyond. Scientists can use mass spectrometers and X-ray crystallography to explore exactly what a piece of debris is made of, right down to the isotope. High-powered microscopes can find and identify tool marks on things tampered with. We can use multi-spectral imaging to take snapshots of electromagnetic fields and radiation, from the radio band to X-rays. Sophisticated imaging programs can find the faintest traces in terrain and even on solid stone, like how we've discovered petroglyphs nearly undetectable to the naked eye. And with the growing global constellation of satellites, more and more of the Earth's surface is constantly under observation.\n\nAs our equipment improves, more UFO reports roll in\u2014along with the data we'll need to understand what's happening.\n\nIn another sense, our government takes UFO reports seriously enough that Congress funds an office to investigate them. From 1947-1969, the US Air Force monitored UFO reports under its Project Blue Book. In 2022, the Pentagon established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to nail down explanations for the \"weird shit,\" including UFOs or other strange phenomena reported by the military. Under that aegis are objects in the sea and sky and \"transmedium\" objects and phenomena.\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, director of the AARO, told NPR, \"We are structuring our analysis to be very thorough and rigorous. We will go through it all. And as a physicist, I have to adhere to the scientific method, and I will follow that data and science wherever it goes.\"\n\nAmazing Stories: A Brief History of UFO Reports\n\nAmericans report more UFOs than any other country, by orders of magnitude. This suggests that there's something unique to American culture, something that draws our attention to the idea of visitors from another world.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSci-fi luminaries like Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Hugo Gernsback, Robert Heinlein, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells cast a long and beautiful shadow across the American imagination. Gernsback founded Amazing Stories, the first magazine devoted to publishing science fiction, in 1926 and coined the term \"science fiction\" itself in 1929. And once the Golden Age of science fiction had begun, tropes from the genre spread throughout our culture and took on a life of their own.\n\nSince then, ideas from science fiction have become science facts. A real-life astronaut can play a Starfleet ensign on TV. The International Space Station has Wi-Fi. Wireless information transfer via invisible light waves has been powering this brave new world all along.\n\n'War of the Worlds' Radio Broadcast\n\nWhen Orson Welles signed up to do a radio reprise of H. G. Wells's War of the Worlds, he wasn't expecting to set off a nationwide wave of media hysteria, much less to spark an entire UFO enthusiast counterculture. Welles' CBS radio show, Mercury Theatre on the Air, was on a shoestring budget, so much that the show mainly broadcast readings of literary classics. But for Halloween 1938, Welles and his producers intended to air a two-segment, two-hour reading of War of the Worlds, dramatized to give listeners a bit of a spook. As written, the first part was fake news bulletins from Mars, and the second was to be a monologue delivered by Welles himself, in the persona of a survivor of the Mars attacks.\n\n\u201cI had conceived the idea of doing a radio broadcast in such a manner that a crisis would actually seem to be happening,\u201d Welles explained in a 1964 deposition, \u201cand would be broadcast in such a dramatized form as to appear to be a real event taking place at that time, rather than a mere radio play.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo compensate for their lack of funding, Welles' voice actors and sound effect artists injected emotion, trying to make their fear believable. The studio even cast Kenneth Delmar, who could do a perfect impression of Franklin D. Roosevelt. But by the end of October, deadlines and budget constraints had forced Welles to mostly abandon the monologue segment. Welles and the radio station were scrambling to get the program broadcasting correctly and on time, right up to the moment the ON AIR sign blinked on\u2014and in their haste, they neglected to run the station's usual call-sign break on the half-hour. The show was an \"unmitigated disaster,\" and Welles later commented, \"If I'd planned to wreck my career, I couldn't have gone about it better.\" His studio called the show insufferably dull, saying it would put listeners to sleep. After the show, Welles just walked home and went to bed.\n\nInstead of putting the audience to sleep, though, the radio show was believably spooky enough that police and emergency services began to receive calls from listeners who thought the invasion was real. Journalists caught wind of the calls, \"boosted the signal,\" and by the next morning, Welles found his face and name splashed across the front page of newspapers from coast to coast. Eventually, he ended up having to explain himself in front of Congress.\n\nRoswell and the 1947 Flying Disc Craze\n\nIn the summer of '47, less than ten years after the War of the Worlds debacle, debris from what appeared to be a \"flying saucer\" fell out of the sky onto the land of an unassuming rancher from New Mexico. As news of the incident spread, theories emerged about the debris's origin. It appeared to be of intelligent manufacture, but on a technological level far superior to anything we had at the time\u2014giving rise to the idea that it was the wreckage of a starship piloted by intelligent extraterrestrials.\n\nThe US military eventually explained that the \"bright wreckage, made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks\" came from a crashed surveillance device meant to listen in on Soviet atomic tests\u2014disguised as a weather balloon. Far from a visiting extraterrestrial, the Roswell incident exposed America's covert surveillance of the USSR during the Cold War. Little wonder military spokespeople and spin doctors were slow to respond and not forthcoming with details.\n\nMajor Jesse Marcel posing with debris, July 8, 1947.\n\nMajor Jesse Marcel posing with debris from Roswell, July 8, 1947.

In the following weeks, hundreds to thousands of \"copycat\" reports flooded newspaper offices and police stations, describing crashed spaceships, flying saucers, and alien abductions. An actual invasion would scarcely have produced more of a reaction. Naturally, tabloids like the Weekly World News had a field day. Eager to get in on the new gold rush, news outlets published ads for \"relics\" supposedly of aliens or crashed spaceships, and descriptions of alien abductions that the abductee could only remember during dodgy hypnosis treatments. The Roswell incident has been described as \"the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim.\"\n\nRoswell being debunked, however, didn't stop generations of entrepreneurs from using UFO reports and imagery to make a buck. For example, the Alien Autopsy film was initially broadcast in a Fox special hosted by none other than Star Trek: The Next Generation's Jonathan Frakes. (He also hosted Ripley's Believe it or Not.) Star power and a layer of post-processing polish lent the film an air of credibility. The 17-minute fauxtopsy was supposedly recovered in the aftermath of the 1947 Roswell alien crash, but the film's owner, Ray Santilli, eventually acknowledged that the work was a fraud. Santilli claimed that he had personally seen the real footage in 1992 but that it had decayed due to heat and humidity by 1996, when he actually bought it. The footage aired by Fox was a \"recreation\" of what Santilli initially saw. The mystery cameraman who supposedly filmed the footage during the original autopsy was an unknown homeless person.\n\nIf you remember anything about the original broadcast, this will probably come as no surprise. Even at the time, the alien on the table looked less like a being from another world and more like a dollar-store version of the little gray men first popularized by the Barney and Betty Hill abduction reports of the early 1960s. This type of hoax has a long history; a \"mermaid\" skeleton that startled and awed many sailors in the 1800s was a clever construction of clay, leather, and the skeleton of what appears to be a small primate.\n\n20th Century Stealth Tech\n\nSo why are UFOs so tough to identify or explain? One reason they might confound both the human eye and sophisticated radar imaging is that they're literally designed to baffle observers. In 2023, American pilots shot down several flying objects that turned out to be Chinese passive surveillance devices\u2014disguised as weather balloons. After some uncomfortable coughing and shuffling from Washington, military brass admitted that American intelligence does the same type of surveillance via cleverly designed flying objects.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEven before Roswell, this type of surveillance obfuscation had precedent. During World War I, the UK and the US adopted \"dazzle camouflage\" to confuse German U-boats. The goal was not to hide\u2014painting something with giant high-contrast stripes is generally a poor way of doing that\u2014but to make it more difficult for the Germans to accurately gauge an Allied vessel's heading, range, and speed. Dazzle camouflage was also used in a limited fashion during WW2, though improvements in rangefinding and the advent of radar made it less effective than it may have been 25 years earlier.\n\nAn artistic impression of dazzle camouflage, showing how it could confuse the viewer.\n\nAn artistic impression of dazzle camouflage, showing how it could confuse the viewer. Credit: Encyclopedia Britannica, 1922.\n\nSo-called \"stealth\" technology has replaced dazzle paint schemes in the modern era, but the emphasis on making it difficult for an enemy to tell precisely what they're looking at has never gone away. The Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyers use a tumblehome hull and a deckhouse made from composite materials to reduce the vessel's radar return. According to the US Navy, the Zumwalt class is 50x harder to spot via radar return than an older Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, with a signature more akin to a fishing boat than a 15,000+-ton warship.\n\nWhile most UFO reports rely on visual phenomena, there have been a handful of incidents in which radar returns corroborated the existence of something. Picking up an unknown signal on radar supports the idea of a \"real\" event, but it doesn't preclude a terrestrial origin. Stealth aircraft designs don't typically try to make an aircraft invisible to radar; instead, they try to drastically minimize what ground-based radar does detect. For example, the B-2 reportedly has the radar cross-section of a goose.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHumans can be remarkably ingenious when making one thing look like something else. One of the problems with trying to pin the tail on a particular alien donkey is that we can't be sure we aren't looking at a clever strategy from a known adversary. However, as in the case of HAARP and that infamous sky spiral, sometimes it turns out that we're unknowingly confusing ourselves.\n\nHAARP, SpaceX, and Spirals in the Sky\n\nEarly in the morning of December 10, 2009, observers in Norway were astonished to see a brilliant, spreading spiral in the night sky. Eventually, the spiral began to disappear from the inside out.\n\n2009 Norway spiral anomaly\n\nCredit: Jan Petter J\u00f8rgensen via Vaeret\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, Russian space agency Roscosmos explained that the expanding spiral resulted from a failed Bulava ICBM test. A malfunctioning third-stage nozzle left the rocket body spinning out of control, spraying a fuel cloud into the sky as it went.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen seen head-on, the fuel cloud looks like a gigantic spiral, slowly expanding in the sky. The blue streak is caused by the damaged nozzle, which was pointing out to the side of the rocket body, and the viewer's perspective.\n\nAs we launch more and more rockets, this phenomenon of spirals in the sky has become much better understood. SpaceX launches, in particular, often result in a plume of fuel ejected in a spiraling pattern as the rocket moves through the air. But the company conducts so many launches that sightings of these aerial spirals are becoming commonplace.\n\nAfter that spiral appeared in the Norwegian sky in 2009, a frisson of commentary spread across the Web, blaming HAARP for the spiral and an enormous list of other problems\u2014some much more plausible than others. HAARP (the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program) is a former US Air Force atmospheric research program in Alaska that catches a lot of conspiracy-theorist flak. Among other things, it has been suggested that HAARP can influence the weather, even at a distance\u2014so when the 2009 spiral showed up above the Arctic circle, questions started to fly. It wasn't responsible for the spiral, but HAARP can use \"spooky action at a distance\" to create aurorae and other effects in the atmosphere, which can be visible to the naked eye. Here, the truth is easily as cool as the conspiracy theory.\n\nHAARP uses a powerful radio antenna to bounce radio waves off the ionosphere. For comparison, the FCC requires a broadcasting license to use antennas greater than five watts. HAARP dumps a cool 3.6 megawatts off the end of its antenna. That much energy can drive a radio signal to the bottom of the sea, enough to enable communication with submarines at depth. It's also sufficient to light up the sky with \"optical bullseye patterns,\" scintillating points of light, or the same otherworldly glow we see during a solar storm that causes the aurora borealis. And all of this comes from just one or two percent of the energy released by a flash of positive lightning.\n\nUSS Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe phenomena we've discussed here all unravel under scrutiny. And it's easy to dismiss a sighting as a \"trick of the light,\" especially when it's just one camera, person, and observer. But in 2017, the New York Times published reports by American military personnel of UFOs in progress that defied explanation so far.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt started in 2004 when two pilots from the USS Nimitz investigated a \"possible target\" off the coast of southern California. One captured a video with the plane's infrared camera, termed \"Tic Tac\" or \"FLIR.\"\n\nTen years later, fighter pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group recorded two more videos, later called \"GIMBAL\" and \"GOFAST.\" In late 2014, a Super Hornet squadron from the Theodore Roosevelt filed an official incident report after a \"near collision\" with an object of some kind while flying in formation. Investigation revealed that Navy pilots from the carrier group had reported seeing strange flying objects almost every day for months while operating off the US East Coast. Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot, and Lt. Danny Acoin of the same squadron told reporters that they and others of their squadron had seen strange flying objects on their instruments for months before picking them up on visual.\n\nGraves and four other Navy pilots, including Lt. Accoin, spoke to the New York Times, and Graves testified before Congress. \"These things would be out there all day,\" said Lt. Graves. \"Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we'd expect.\"\n\nNavy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told the New York Times in 2019 that pilots now operate under new, classified guidance on reporting UFOs. A few months later, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. None of the pilots from the Theodore Roosevelt are willing to speculate about what they might have seen. Lt. Accoin commented, \"We're here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2021, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a preliminary report on UFOs. Now, the ODNI releases a new UFO report each year. You can find a declassified version of the 2022 report here.\n\nWe've found rocks great and small of extraterrestrial, interplanetary, and even interstellar origins. Rocks from Mars found their way to Antarctica. And in 2017, the same year The New York Times first published the videos from the USS Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt, 'Oumuamua appeared in the sky at a speed and angle so far out of the ecliptic that it must have come from somewhere beyond our solar system. So it's clear Earth can receive visitors from beyond the tiny, quivering bubble of our unremarkable star's solar wind. Despite decades and decades of committed and invested research, there still exists no coherent or credible evidence available to mere mortals that any UFO sighting has documented a visit from actual little green men\u2014or in the parlance of Roswell aficionados, a close encounter of any kind.\n\nWhat we do have is an abundance of evidence for two things. First, the US government and military do engage in covert, classified research and surveillance while also being righteously shitty at cover-ups. Like, reprehensibly bad. Naturally, some folks don't buy the official explanations: once deceived, twice skeptical.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that frauds, hoaxsters, and charlatans are scavenger predator species that flourish (only at others' expense) in most terrestrial and rhetorical environments. They rely on the innate sense of wonder and curiosity to ensnare their prey. No less than L. Ron Hubbard himself used the promise of redemption via sci-fi concepts like flying saucers and intelligent life on other planets to attract the credulous and enrich the few.\n\nSo, Are UFO Sightings Real, Or Not?\n\nWhere does this leave us, with respect to the Big Question of whether UFOs are real?\n\nAs of 2023, the ODNI UFO summary states that out of a total of 510 cases on its radar, it can confidently attribute 191\u2014less than 40% of reported sightings. In 2021 alone, 366 new reports came in.\n\nThese reports are \"real\" in that they were observed; the people reporting them were telling the unvarnished truth; multiple lines of evidence, such as video from multiple angles, substantiate the reports. That seems to be the case for many such reports. The sighting is often unequivocally real, not a story or fabrication. But the sighting, in and of itself, isn't enough evidence to prove that a UFO is of extraterrestrial origin. That doesn't mean UFOs aren't real; it just means the jury's still out.\n\nThe universe is a very big place. In its incomprehensible vastness, the odds of our existence round to zero. And yet, we are here, which makes the probability of our existence 100%. It seems like the height of arrogance to imagine we're the only intelligent life in the universe.\n\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\u2014and as of this writing, despite tens of thousands of UFO reports, there simply is no conclusive evidence that Earth has ever received visitors from an intelligent extraterrestrial species. But if you accept the idea that all things have an explanation, even if we don't have it yet, the study of UFOs and UAPs starts to look more like a problem for better imaging and AI, and less like the province of fools. Throw more and more photons and pixels at the issue, and eventually, we can shove outward the perimeter of human understanding. It's only a matter of time."

            "article_content": "Every time generative artificial intelligence drafts an e-mail or conjures up an image, the planet pays for it. Making two images can consume as much energy as charging a smartphone; a single exchange with ChatGPT can heat up a server so much that it requires a bottle's worth of water to cool. At scale, these costs soar. By 2027, the global AI sector could annually consume as much electricity as the Netherlands, according to one recent estimate . And a new study in Nature Computational Science identifies another concern : AI's outsize contribution to the world's mounting heap of electronic waste. The study found that generative AI applications alone could add 1.2 million to five million metric tons of this hazardous trash to the planet by 2030, depending on how quickly the industry grows.\n\nSuch a contribution would add to the tens of millions of tons of electronic products the globe discards annually. Cell phones, microwave ovens, computers and other ubiquitous digital products often contain mercury, lead or other toxins. When improperly discarded, they can contaminate air, water and soil. The United Nations found that in 2022 about 78 percent of the world's e-waste wound up in landfills or at unofficial recycling sites, where laborers risk their health to scavenge rare metals.\n\nThe worldwide AI boom rapidly churns through physical data storage devices, plus the graphics processing units and other high-performance components needed to process thousands of simultaneous calculations. This hardware lasts anywhere from two to five years \u2014 but it's often replaced as soon as newer versions become available. Asaf Tzachor, a sustainability researcher at Israel's Reichman University, who co-authored the new study, says its findings emphasize the need to monitor and reduce this technology's environmental impacts.\n\nTo calculate just how much generative AI contributes to this problem, Tzachor and his colleagues examined the type and volume of hardware used to run large language models, the length of time that these components last and the growth rate of the generative AI sector. The researchers caution that their prediction is a gross estimate that could change based on a few additional factors. More people might adopt generative AI than the authors' models anticipate, for example. Hardware design innovations, meanwhile, could reduce e-waste in a given AI system \u2014 but other technological advances can make systems cheaper and more accessible to the public, increasing the number in use.\n\nRelated: New memory chip controlled by light and magnets could one day make AI computing less power-hungry\n\nThis study's biggest value comes from its attention to AI's broad environmental impacts, says Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside, who studies responsible AI and was not involved in the new research. \"We might want these [generative AI] companies to slow down a bit,\" he says.\n\nFew countries mandate the proper disposal of e-waste, and those that do often fail to enforce their existing laws on it. Twenty-five U.S. states have e-waste management policies, but there is no federal law that requires electronics recycling. In February Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced a bill that would require federal agencies to study and develop standards for AI's environmental impacts, including e-waste. But that bill, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024 (which has not passed the Senate), would not force AI developers to cooperate with its voluntary reporting system. Some companies, however, claim to be taking independent action. Microsoft and Google have pledged to reach net zero waste and net zero emissions respectively by 2030; this would likely involve reducing or recycling AI-related e-waste.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

It's possible to squeeze more life out of servers, for instance, through regular maintenance and updates or by shifting worn-out devices to less-intensive applications. Refurbishing and reusing obsolete hardware components can also cut waste by 42 percent, Tzachor and his co-authors note in the new study. And more efficient chip and algorithm design could reduce generative AI's demand for hardware and electricity. Combining all these strategies would reduce e-waste by 86 percent, the study authors estimate.\n\nThere's another wrinkle as well: AI products tend to be trickier to recycle than standard electronics because the former often contain a lot of sensitive customer data, says Kees Bald\u00e9, an e-waste researcher at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, who wasn't involved with the new study. But big tech companies can afford to both erase that data and properly dispose of their electronics, he points out. \"Yes, it costs something,\" he says of broader e-waste recycling, \"but the gains for society are much larger.\""

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard about some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, said the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford said, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, saying he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home.

            "article_content": "Popular YouTube series visits site where at least five deaths have occurred at the former slaughterhouse, including suicides, goring and an explosion\n\nParanormal investigators Raif Boric and Krista Maryk of Walking Among Us recently filmed an episode of their popular YouTube series Walking Among us at Sanford and Son Emporium in Barrie.\n\n1 / 1 Paranormal investigators Raif Boric and Krista Maryk of Walking Among Us recently filmed an episode of their popular YouTube series Walking Among us at Sanford and Son Emporium in Barrie. Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road in Barrie earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium, which is located inside the building, said the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford said, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, saying he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going.

I miss the old days when horror flicks were just classic slasher/killer/scare-you-type movies. Not some over-the-top but underexplained types of movies. The acting in it was good, but the storyline was just underwhelming compared to how it was advertised, which is about 90% of horror movies these days.\"\n\n\u2014autumnbrookem What it's about: An FBI Agent is tasked with tracking down a serial killer, which sends her down a rabbit hole filled with occult happenings and ties to her own past.

I'm also a huge fan of event movies and Jurassic Park sits proudly among those films. So of course I will always go into a new entry hoping for something grand. Holy shit did this one fuck the bed! It got to a point somewhere between giant locusts, poisoning the world's food supply, and dinosaur fight club, where I turned to my wife and said, 'Do you want to go?'

Maybe it was because the movie was made 20 years before I was born and I missed the historical and societal context. Or maybe it's just a bad movie. But I didn't last ten minutes into Rebel Without a Cause. I couldn't buy Jim Backus as anyone other than Mr. Howell, and Jimmy Dean's ham-fisted acting (screaming, 'You're tearing me apart!' while pulling at his face) just put me over the edge.\"\n\n\u2014deadpanpuppy241 What it's about: A coming-of-age romantic drama starring James Dean in his first role as a rebellious teen with a troubled past who arrives in a new town.

It is the slowest, dialogue-heavy war movie ever made. It is also mind-numbingly boring. I\u2019ve seen a lot of bad movies, but I watch them through to the end so I can see how truly bad they are.

The basic premise is that a man was killed by poison, but two of his employees spent the weekend pretending that he was still alive. They set up these rigs to make the body move and stuff, and preteen me thought it was the pinnacle of comedy. So when the sequel came out, I couldn\u2019t wait to see it. So, why did I walk out? In this movie, the corpse was animated by means of voodoo, and at the time, we were living in a haunted house, and I experienced some freaky and terrifying things. So, even though the reanimation of the corpse was done in a comical way, it was too much for me, and I had to leave. I waited outside while my friends finished the movie.\"\n\n\u2014jmacxjr What it's about: Larry and Richard are once again dealing with Bernie's (their late boss) corpse which this time is targeted by a voodoo queen hired by mobsters looking for money that Bernie had embezzled.

            "article_content": "A rock on Mars spilled a surprising yellow treasure after Curiosity accidentally cracked through its unremarkable exterior.\n\nWhen the rover rolled its 899-kilogram (1,982-pound) body over the rock back in May, the rock broke open, revealing yellow crystals of elemental sulfur: brimstone.\n\nAlthough sulfates are fairly common on Mars, this represents the first time sulfur has been found on the red planet in its pure elemental form.\n\nWhat's even more exciting is that the Gediz Vallis Channel, where Curiosity found the rock, is littered with rocks that look suspiciously similar to the sulfur rock before it got fortuitously crushed \u2013 suggesting that, somehow, elemental sulfur may be abundant there in some places.\n\n\"Finding a field of stones made of pure sulfur is like finding an oasis in the desert,\" said Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in July.\n\n\"It shouldn't be there, so now we have to explain it. Discovering strange and unexpected things is what makes planetary exploration so exciting.\"\n\nSulfates are salts that form when sulfur, usually in compound form, mixes with other minerals in water.\n\nWhen the water evaporates, the minerals mix and dry out, leaving the sulfates behind.\n\nThese sulfate minerals can tell us a lot about Mars, such as its water history, and how it has weathered over time.\n\nPure sulfur, on the other hand, only forms under a very narrow set of conditions, which are not known to have occurred in the region of Mars where Curiosity made its discovery.\n\nThere are, to be fair, a lot of things we don't know about the geological history of Mars, but the discovery of scads of pure sulfur just hanging about on the Martian surface suggests that there's something pretty big that we're not aware of.\n\nSulfur, it's important to understand, is an essential element for all life. It's usually taken up in the form of sulfates, and used to make two of the essential amino acids living organisms need to make proteins.\n\nSince we've known about sulfates on Mars for some time, the discovery doesn't tell us anything new in that area. We're yet to find any signs of life on Mars, anyway.\n\nBut we do keep stumbling across the remains of bits and pieces that living organisms would find useful, including chemistry, water, and past habitable conditions.\n\nStuck here on Earth, we're fairly limited in how we can access Mars. Curiosity's instruments were able to analyze and identify the sulfurous rocks in the Gediz Vallis Channel, but if it hadn't taken a route that rolled over and cracked one open, it could have been sometime until we found the sulfur.\n\nThe next step will be to figure out exactly how, based on what we know about Mars, that sulfur may have come to be there.\n\nThat's going to take a bit more work, possibly involving some detailed modeling of Mars's geological evolution.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nMeanwhile, Curiosity will continue to collect data on the same.\n\nThe Gediz Vallis channel is an area rich in Martian history, an ancient waterway whose rocks now bear the imprint of the ancient river that once flowed over them, billions of years ago.\n\nCuriosity drilled a hole in one of the rocks, taking a powdered sample of its interior for chemical analysis, and is still trundling its way deeper along the channel, to see what other surprises might be waiting just around the next rock.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in July 2024."

            "article_content": "There seems to be growing consensus among AI leaders that the field could end up transforming all of science and technology at a rate previously thought unimaginable.\n\nAfter Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei had said that AI could bring about a 100 years\u2019 worth of scientific progress in just 5-10 years, Google\u2019s AI Chief Demis Hassabis has echoed his thoughts. \u201cI really do feel like we\u2019re on the brink of a new golden era of discovery,\u201d he said at a conference. \u201cI think what we need is a lot more interdisciplinary science. So using AI and asking the right questions with domain experts, it\u2019s, it\u2019s almost limitless what its applications could be,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, AI itself is a scientific discipline which is improving all the time,\u201d Hassabis added. \u201cSo (it can) apply today\u2019s technologies directly to other fields, and (can) also continue to improve AI itself. And that as well is a sort of exponential improvement. So there\u2019s a lot of progress to be made in just the next few years,\u201d he continued.\n\nHassabis cited the example of Material Science \u2014 the study of new materials \u2014 which could be one of the fields to be impacted by AI. \u201cWe\u2019re touching on nearly every area of science. GNoME is one of my favourite projects which is on material design. And I think material design has some of the same characteristics that we look for in a problem that\u2019s suitable for AI. It\u2019s a massive combinatorial space. You need to try and build a model that understands the physics and the chemistry of the natural phenomena. And then if you have a model like that, you can then maybe use it to do a very efficient search through that search space, and then find an optimal solution. And in materials I think that would be groundbreaking \u2014 you could imagine designing new batteries, or maybe one day discovering a room temperature superconductor has always been one of my dreams,\u201d he added.\n\nHassbis should know a thing or two about science \u2014 he was awarded the Nobel Prize this year in Chemistry for working on an AI model that helps determine the structure of proteins. He seemed to be suggesting that much of scientific progress today remains stuck in silos \u2014 the best minds in physics, for instance, don\u2019t necessarily regularly speak to the best minds in biology to figure out how their respective research could be related. But if we manage to create a powerful enough AI that\u2019s smart enough as Nobel Prize winners in all fields, it could combine the different knowledge bases in interesting and unique ways to create new discoveries. And given how fast AI is improving \u2014 NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang says that AI is growing much faster than Moore\u2019s law \u2014 a new age of discovery in science and technology could be just around the corner."

            "article_content": "The Red Planet has always been a subject of intrigue and fascination. Recent research led by Curtin University has added more fuel to this age-old curiosity. The scientists discovered what could possibly be the oldest evidence of hot water activity on Mars.\n\nThis discovery opens up possibilities that at some point in its mysterious past, Mars may have been a place where life could exist.\n\nHot water on Mars\n\nThe study focused on a zircon grain from the renowned Martian meteorite NWA7034, fondly known as Black Beauty. This tiny grain, although no larger than a grain of sand, holds secrets dating back billions of years.\n\nThe analysis of the 4.45 billion-year-old zircon grain revealed geochemical fingerprints of ancient water-rich fluids. These traces of the past suggest that hot water was once present on Mars.\n\nDr. Aaron Cavosie from Curtin\u2019s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences noted that this discovery opens new paths for understanding early Martian hydrothermal systems and the planet\u2019s past habitability.\n\n\u201cWe used nano-scale geochemistry to detect elemental evidence of hot water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago,\u201d said Dr. Cavosie.\n\nEarly conditions on Mars\n\nHydrothermal systems are vital for the development of life. They were crucial for life to flourish on Earth. Dr. Cavosie noted that the same essential ingredients for habitable environments were present on Mars during its early crust formation period.\n\nThe team utilized nano-scale imaging and spectroscopy to identify essential elements on the zircon grain, including iron, aluminum, yttrium, and sodium.\n\nThe presence and pattern of these elements, added during the zircon\u2019s formation billions of years ago, suggest that water was present during early Martian magmatic activity.\n\nThis intriguing discovery indicates that during the initial stages of the Red Planet\u2019s existence, conditions were conducive to the existence of water.\n\nResilience of Mars\u2019 crust\n\nThe study also highlighted the resilience of Mars\u2019 crust. Despite enduring massive meteorite impacts, causing upheaval of its surface, Mars still had water during the early Pre-Noachian period, which was before about 4.1 billion years ago.\n\nIn 2022, Curtin researchers studied the same zircon grain. They found that it had been \u201cshocked\u201d by a meteorite impact, marking it as the first and only known shocked zircon from Mars.\n\nImplications for life on Mars\n\nThe discovery of ancient hydrothermal activity on Mars significantly changes our understanding of the planet\u2019s potential for life. Hydrothermal systems could have created environments rich in chemical energy and nutrients vital for life.\n\nThe presence of warm, mineral-laden waters in Mars\u2019 crust could have served as a cradle for microbial communities, much like the hydrothermal vents on Earth harbor diverse ecosystems despite the absence of sunlight.\n\nThis implies that if life ever existed on early Mars, hydrothermal systems may have been havens, providing conditions to support some form of life.\n\nThe research offers valuable insights into planetary habitability within our solar system and beyond.\n\nFuture research directions\n\nThe revelations from the zircon grain continue to ignite curiosity and lay the groundwork for future Mars exploration missions.\n\nPlanetary scientists are eager to explore other ancient Martian rocks and meteorites that might hold additional clues about Mars\u2019 hydrothermal systems and geological history.\n\nMissions equipped with advanced technology could further investigate the surface and subsurface of Mars, searching for more evidence of past water activity and potential biological markers.\n\nThese future efforts could significantly enhance our understanding of the Red Planet and refine our search for life beyond Earth, spurring innovative technologies and methodologies in planetary science research.\n\nEarly Mars and its water activity\n\nThis recent study builds on previous research, taking us a step closer to understanding what early Mars was like.\n\nAccording to Dr. Cavosie, identifying the signs of water-rich fluids from the zircon\u2019s formation period provides geochemical markers of water in the oldest known Martian crust.\n\nThe research was conducted by scientists from Curtin\u2019s Space Science and Technology Centre, the John de Laeter Centre, and the University of Adelaide.\n\nDr. Jack Gillespie is the lead author of the paper detailing study, which is set to be published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "In 1905, a young American scientist named William Coolidge set to work on an ambitious assignment for his new job at General Electric: creating a better light bulb. The carbon filament used in Thomas Edison\u2019s world-changing invention wasn\u2019t very energy efficient. Scientists were experimenting with tungsten, which had the advantage of a higher melting point, but the metal wire was too brittle and broke easily.\n\nSeveral years later, after numerous trials, errors, and accidents\u2014by some accounts, a breakthrough occurred when the tungsten rod fell into liquid mercury pooling from the heating system\u2014Coolidge created \u201cductile tungsten,\u201d a more bendable form of the metal that ultimately became the wiring still found inside incandescent light bulbs today.\n\nEkin Dogus Cubuk, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, points to ductile tungsten as an example of how new materials can revolutionize existing technologies\u2014often after careful, laborious efforts riddled with unexpected twists and turns. More than 100 years after that landmark innovation, his team has created an AI tool that could transform the way scientists discover new materials. Much like ductile tungsten, any of these compounds could improve upon current materials and lead to next-generation electric vehicle (EV) batteries or better solar panels. \u201cMany materials discoveries involve a lot of trial and error, luck, and serendipity,\u201d Cubuk says. \u201cWith AI we hope to reduce the reliance on luck. We have the potential to accelerate each stage of the process, from discovery to development, with more accurate and scalable predictions.\u201d\n\nGNoME catapults materials discovery\n\nThe AI tool that Cubuk\u2019s team built is called GNoME (Graph Networks for Materials Exploration), and it has used deep learning to determine the structure of 2.2 million inorganic crystals. Of those, GNoME identified 380,000 materials that are stable at low temperatures, according to simulations. \u201cWe hope that having this information will help the community to catapult further breakthroughs in materials discovery and design,\u201d Cubuk explains.\n\nSince the public release of these crystals in 2023, scientists have been experimenting with AI-identified compounds in labs worldwide\u2014including three that were recently synthesized in Japan by researchers at Hokkaido University.\n\n\u201cThere is a wealth of AI knowledge, but currently there\u2019s a gap between translating those insights to material synthesis in the lab. This early research shows how we can bridge the gap to explore new materials more efficiently,\u201d says Akira Miura, an associate professor at Hokkaido University, who led the study.\n\nMeanwhile, GNoME independently identified hundreds of crystals that scientists had already discovered on their own as stable, including \u201cexciting\u201d superconductor candidates, according to Cubuk. Furthermore, hundreds of these crystals were independently synthesized by labs around the world. That\u2019s a strong signal that the new material candidates in GNoME\u2019s findings have real-life viability.\n\nGNoME was initially trained with data on crystal structures that is available through the Materials Project, an open-source reference that has been central to new materials discovery. Identifying the structure of a new material is just the beginning of what can be a long, intensive development process. The original idea of the Materials Project was to reduce invention time by focusing experiments on compounds with the most potential for success, according to founder and UC Berkeley professor Kristin Persson. That itself was a game changer from the days when Persson was a graduate student in the mid-\u201990s and had to comb through oversize tomes to look up a material\u2019s chemical structure and properties. In the laboratory, researchers would combine intuition with past results to inform their experimentation. \u201cThere were no recipes for it except in the researcher\u2019s brain,\u201d Persson says. \u201cThey would use their experience to make new materials, and it would take a long time.\u201d\n\nNot that long ago, it was relatively rare to be able to calculate a new material on the computer that was thermodynamically stable, explains Chris Wolverton, a professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University. For one, the sheer magnitude of the required computational power was a hurdle. \u201cGoogle is particularly rich when it comes to computational time and power,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were able to\u2014in a very short order\u2014calculate the properties of several million compounds.\u201d\n\nThe availability of this vast data trove is opening up new possibilities to materials researchers, says Persson. \u201cThey\u2019re giving this body of work to the community and saying, \u2018Do what you want with it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the new kid on the block in terms of the tools we have. If you\u2019re a materials company and not thinking of machine learning, you\u2019re behind, and Google put a brilliant spotlight on that.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean researchers are suddenly going to have piles of new materials cluttering their lab benches. The tool has identified crystals that computations predict will be stable under absolute zero, or about -273C\u2014an ideal condition in which particle motions come to a stop. A key question persists: Can these crystals be created in a stable form that won\u2019t change or decompose at room temperature? Myriad factors, including temperature and pressure, can influence whether a theoretical compound can exist in a form that would become, say, the next EV battery. Scientists will have to figure out the right experimental methods to create materials that will be useful in innovation. \u201cThat\u2019s the next giant challenge in this field: predicting synthesis recipes,\u201d Wolverton says.\n\nMaterials scientists explore next steps\n\nIndeed, the tremendous scale of the AI findings has spurred important conversations about the best way to identify and synthesize new materials. A researcher may spend an entire career conducting experiments on just a few compounds, a painstakingly slow and labor-intensive process. The key is finding a balance between creating AI-led possibilities and developing the known science, explains University of Liverpool professor Andy Cooper, whose research group focuses on ways to accelerate the discovery of functional materials: \u201cI think that\u2019s a challenge for the future. What is the right place to be on that spectrum?\u201d\n\nNew materials improve the foundations of modern life\n\nAt Google DeepMind, Cubuk envisions a future when new materials could reshape today\u2019s most exciting technologies\u2014from semiconductors to new power sources for supercomputers. As AI tools evolve, a key challenge is determining which potential materials best correspond to technologies and products, Cubuk explains. For example, knowing what criteria makes a good lithium-ion conductor helps researchers better identify the most promising candidates. Already, the GNoME team has identified 528 potential materials for batteries\u2014more than 25 times the number identified in a 2017 study, which was led by Austin Sendek, the CEO of Aionics, a technology company dedicated to designing high-performance batteries with AI.\n\nGenerative AI can predict the next big thing. As we exhaust what\u2019s known, we have to develop new ways to push boundaries, and this is one of those paths. Jakoah Brgoch, associate professor of chemistry at the University of Houston\n\nAI\u2019s contributions might also open up researchers\u2019 minds to unforeseen possibilities, says Jakoah Brgoch, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Houston, whose work explores functional inorganic materials. Maybe the AI-suggested compounds aren\u2019t viable under current lab temperatures and pressure, for example; but what happens if you alter those variables? \u201cScience is often a slog,\u201d Brgoch says. \u201cThe hope and the hype is we don\u2019t have to go through this slog. Generative AI can predict the next big thing. As we exhaust what\u2019s known, we have to develop new ways to push boundaries, and this is one of those paths. Of course, experimentally validating these predictions is easier said than done.\u201d\n\nAccording to current industry wisdom, new material discovery requires, on average, at least 10 years of work and north of $10 million to $100 million. While the cost to build a factory is the same, what used to take weeks to simulate on a computer can now be done in seconds with AI, says Sendek.\n\n\u201cAI-based materials discovery methods will unlock unorthodox solutions that would have otherwise eluded human intuition, while also leading to fewer \u2018dead ends\u2019 that cannot be commercialized,\u201d says Sendek, pointing to the recent discovery by Aionics\u2019s AI system that adding a luxury perfume molecule to a battery\u2019s electrolyte could improve the battery\u2019s overall performance. Aionics is now actively testing this molecule in real-life batteries.\n\n\u201cMaking meaningful progress in materials innovation requires us to discover better materials faster and then get them to market in a fraction of the time.\u201d"

This will be the last time this year that this planet will show such behavior. Traditionally, a Mercury retrograde occurs about three times a year and is a phenomenon feared in astrology. In its apparent backward motion, Mercury will move from 22 degrees to 6 degrees in the sign of Sagittarius.\n\nAstronomically, it is an optical illusion in which it appears that this planet is moving in the opposite direction in its orbit. While astrologically, Mercury is a planet to which an energy is attributed that affects individuals. It is associated with aspects such as communication, travel and technology. The presence of Mercury retrograde has to do with a connection with the past and encourages introspection.\n\nElon Musk's 'Starship' explodes on test flight\n\nAstrologers indicate that this transit is not bad in itself, but rather opens up possibilities for learning and working on different aspects of life. It is recommended for deep reflection, to slow down routines and to become aware of reality.\n\nAdditionally, astrologers recommend taking advantage of this time to learn to say no, express our boundaries without fear and cultivate patience to close the year in a harmonious way to better receive the coming year.\n\nWhich zodiac signs will be affected during Mercury retrograde?\n\nThis time, Mercury retrograde will occur in the sign of Sagittarius, symbolizing a dispute between logic and spirituality, generating doubts between beliefs and the decisions we make. Because the energy is focused on introspection, experts also recommend avoiding making big decisions until this influence is over.\n\nThe signs that will have the greatest influence from this Mercury movement are:"

Beth (Kelly Reilly) and her brother Kayce (Luke Grimes) push through the police tape to see what's going on, only to see a handgun on the bathroom floor and blood. While the camera never show's John's face, you can see his body sprawled on the ground and the distraught look on his children's faces.\n\nCostner played John Dutton since its 2018 Paramount Network premiere, but announced in June that he was not returning for what were billed as the final episodes. The actor was not among the countless Americans tuning in for the season's long-awaited premiere.\n\n\u201cI didn't see it,\" Costner told SiriusXM's \"The Michael Smerconish Program\" earlier this month. \"I'm going to be perfectly honest. I didn't know it was actually airing last night. That's a swear-to-God moment. I swear to God.

He's the center of her soul,\" Reilly said. \"What's that going to do to this woman? It's going to turn her into a hurricane.\"\n\nReilly said she has known how \"Yellowstone\" would end since the show started in 2018. Costner's premature departure has not fundamentally changed that course. \"It wasn't supposed to happen so soon,\" she said. \"But the fact that we got to return poetically to the show's authentic vision is satisfying.\"\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Authenticity is increasingly a competitive edge.\n\n\n\nThe erosion of trust across American life forced creators to pivot from mere promotion to delivering value through high-quality, engaging content. This led to a separation between influencers, who rent their audiences to brands, and \u201ccreators,\u201d who rent their creative skills to brands with an audience in tow.\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, there was a significant surge in people who create online content for money. Most of us consume this content; brands are increasingly collaborating with creators to reinforce messaging; and it\u2019s becoming a primary mode of information sharing. \u2192 Read on for details and join Chris Wink\u2019s weekly newsletter for more\n\nIn March 2015, Lord & Taylor promoted its new Design Lab collection with what had become a standard style marketing campaign.\n\nIn addition to magazines, the retailer gave 50 fashion influencers a free paisley asymmetrical dress and paid them $1,000 to $4,000 each to post styled photos on Instagram. The influencers\u2019 combined posts reached 11.4 million users in just two days, leading to 328,000 engagements and a sold-out dress.\n\nThe problem: none of the influencers disclosed they were paid to promote the dress. Someone somewhere lodged a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, which was following the rise of undisclosed paid social media posts. Back in 2013, the FTC had organized hearings to set standards. Regulators wanted to set an example, and the Lord & Taylor campaign fit.\n\nIn early 2016, L&T reached an agreement with FTC, giving the commission a chance to make a splashy announcement and introduce new \u201cnative advertising\u201d guidelines. Among the requirements were clearer disclosures on paid posts, using \u201c#ad\u201d or similar markers.\n\nIndustry watchers warned it could kill influencer marketing. Surely, audiences would tune out content so obviously labeled as advertising. But, as documented by longtime creator-journalist Taylor Lorenz in her 2023 book \u201cExtremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet,\u201d the opposite happened.\n\nBy 2018, influencers promoting Christian Dior\u2019s saddle bag were tagging \u201c#ad\u201d even when they weren\u2019t paid. Getting a paid promotional gig was a signal of influence, and it seemed every fashionable social media creator wanted to be an influencer.\n\nThe FTC guidelines inadvertently raised the bar for authenticity and creativity. Influencer marketing wasn\u2019t killed, it evolved into a subset of what is called the creator economy, a sprawling industry worth $150 billion and projected to reach $500 billion by 2030. Definitions vary, so the numbers do too. About 250 million Americans engage with social media daily, and of them, about 27 million get paid for it \u2014 whether that means a share of advertising from a platform like Youtube, individual supporters via Patreon or direct payment or free products from a brand.\n\nSo, what does the creator economy mean for the rest of us, both as buyers and as consumers?\n\nThe shift from influence to creation\n\nThe creator economy isn\u2019t just an evolution of influencer culture\u2014it\u2019s a response to changing audience expectations.\n\nTrust is declining across American life. A bruising pandemic accelerated declines in the approval Americans have for practically all great institutions of public life: government, university, science, corporations, the courts, the media and even religious groups, per Pew research released last month.\n\nThe only groups that bipartisan majorities of Americans say they trust are small business and the military \u2014 cops and educators still fare OK, but it\u2019s going the wrong way.\n\nEven the once mighty influencer has fallen. Only 2.2% of Americans say they trust influencers for purchase advice, according to a new survey from Reviews.org. This \u201cisn\u2019t surprising because most influencers aren\u2019t trained experts and often are just posting sponsored content,\u201d said the survey\u2019s managing editor Peter Holslin in the release. (Note: I\u2019ve seen higher trust ratings for influencers but typically about topics, not purchases.)\n\nOnly 2.2% of Americans say they trust influencers for purchase advice.\n\nHerein marks a separation between influencers, who rent their audiences to brands, and \u201ccreators,\u201d who rent their creative skills to brands \u2014 with an audience in tow. This matters because across decades of research on trust, one obvious trend is clear: The globally connected online world is training a more skeptical public to seek disinterested parties and those we\u2019ve known for a long time.\n\nThat Reviews.org survey estimated trust in user reviews above 30% and trust in friends and family closer to half. (For those who doubt the recommendations of your loved ones, I see you.)\n\nThis trust divide runs counter to strategies from the corporations behind social media platforms. In the 2010s, Facebook and Twitter were structured for users to mostly follow people they knew personally \u2014 which insiders call \u201cthe social graph.\u201d Despite political pressure, TikTok\u2019s surging popularity has been defined by its \u201cFor You Page,\u201d in which users are served up videos about stuff they like, not necessarily people they know, and Youtube has long prioritized not personal relationships but topics \u2014 what is called \u201cthe interest graph.\u201d Facebook and Instagram followed. Even earnest Linkedin launched in March 2021 a creator mode to support influencers speaking to fans they don\u2019t know.\n\nThis erosion of trust has forced creators to pivot from mere promotion to delivering value through high-quality, engaging content \u2014 better to create some semblance of connection. Just 40% of marketers hire creators to directly boost revenue (ie. sell that paisley dress for me!), and more than two-thirds work with them to boost social engagement, reinforce brand or as pure staff augmentation, per a SproutSocial survey. Marketing execs typically advise creators are better for boosting engagement than closing deals.\n\nWho calls themselves a professional creator?\n\nAdobe\u2019s most recent creator survey estimated 500,000 people globally were full-time creators, and barely 1 in 10 made more than $50,000 a year \u2014 with a tiny sliver earning large sums. Or are there 11.6 million full-time creators in the United States alone? That\u2019s what a different November 2023 analysis estimated, a figure that would mean there are three times as many creators as software developers, and or five times as many as marketers.\n\nI spoke to Ed Keller, the market research veteran behind that last analysis. \u201cIf the number of full-time creators seems high,\u201d Keller told me, \u201cI have confidence in it.\u201d\n\nA 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis projected that by 2026 a slate of creative workers, including photographers, writers and animators would be self-employed \u2014 a cohort of 50,000 or so possible full-time creators. Different surveys may vary on the numbers, but not the trend. Over the past decade, 2021-2022 recorded the fastest surge in those creating online content for money, per MBO Partners.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, the pandemic changed things,\u201c Keller said. \u201cPeople were in a mode of looking for an outlet and other people were looking to find somebody to follow. Creators had the right idea at the right time with the right tools.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreators had the right idea at the right time with the right tools.\u201d Ed Keller, Market Research Institute International\n\nWithout government data or tax records, a \u201cfulll\u2013time\u201d creator is a self-identification. Might a marketer or software developer call themselves a creator, even if their employer doesn\u2019t? A tax attorney told me there\u2019s little consistency in how so-called creators would be categorized in government data, like the NAICS codes of companies they form or in the occupation codes they might use for their taxes.\n\nThis backs us into one reason the creator economy matters: We\u2019re still shaping what it means that more than half of young people today report they can \u201ceasily\u201d make a career of creating content online for some audience, per Morning Consult.\n\nThis matters for other reasons too. For one, most of us consume the stuff. About three-quarters of Americans use at least one of the platforms on a regular basis. Increasingly it\u2019s less about updates from our friends and more a stream of strangers, celebrities and a fledgling workforce that is somewhere in between.\n\nIf you don\u2019t rely on makeup or sourdough tutorials, you might seek game reviews from a Twitch streamer, science explainers from a TikToker, silly memes from an Instagram account or car repair tips from a YouTuber. What motivates this labor, then, informs what content you can access, where and why.\n\nOthers of us are both consumers and creators ourselves \u2014 I think most journalists should be \u2014 and so these trends shape our work. Still others of us may not be the creator but will hire them.\n\nBrands long ago recognized the importance of so-called \u201cambassadors,\u201d our fans who will write online reviews, post to social and share testimonials. This organic activity remains vital. The creator economy, which implies a monetary exchange, is something different, and it is growing.\n\nIn 2025, 86% of companies with more than 100 employees will use influencer or creator marketing, per Statista. We at Technical.ly are piloting a creator-in-residence program, in which we\u2019re paying comedian Tata Sherise to translate our journalism for new audiences. It\u2019s about sharing our work and shaping how people think about our news organization. (We also added a best local creator category to our annual awards.)\n\nCreators are not just promoting products; they\u2019re co-creating narratives that resonate deeply with their audiences. I bet this will matter more, not less, as generative AI tools flood the digital space with automated content. While AI can churn out text and visuals at scale, it cannot replicate the trust and authenticity that come from human creators.\n\nAuthenticity is a competitive edge.\n\nHow does working with creators\u2026work?\n\nCreators now span a wide spectrum, from nano-influencers with hyper-engaged audiences to macro-creators commanding millions of followers.\n\nStories of excess dominate the narrative: Canadian streamer xQc signed a $100 million deal with Kick, outpacing even LeBron James\u2019 recent NBA contract. But each creator approaches things differently. An old rule of thumb was that an Instagram creator charged $100 per each 10,000 followers for a post, signaling just how commodified audience had become. A recent Shopify analysis puts more granularity to estimated costs, but prices vary with expectations.\n\nFrom those old days of buying influence to one in which creators are collaborators, pricing can look less like an alternative to display advertising (how to most cost effectively reach 1,000 accounts) and more like a fee for service (help us translate our story to your audience).\n\nMost creators \u2014 and, in my telling, news orgs like Technical.ly are both creators and curators of creators \u2014 have clearer processes and pricing models. If you follow a social media user with a style and a following you\u2019d like to reach, check their bio link for a website that typically has contact information. Some have fixed pricing (think of celebrities on Cameo), but more often they take a collaborative approach. (We at Technical.ly do something similar here,)\n\nA lesson from Lord & Taylor\n\nA decade ago, the Lord & Taylor campaign and ensuing FTC action was a turning point for marketing, and the social web. That year, a Technical.ly conference speaker dubbed it the \u201cyear of the influencer.\u201d That gave rise to competition for ever more creative storytelling.\n\nThe internet is a crowded bazaar. Guides are helpful. The creator economy is an imperfect phrase for a very real trend: brands seek audience, and audiences congregate around helpful information and great stories.\n\nIn an essay published on Microsoft\u2019s website in January 1996, Bill Gates wrote what has become an axiom of the digital age: \u201cContent is king.\u201d\n\nTransparency and authenticity will help cut through increasing clutter."
