            "source": "The Verge",
            "article_content": "There\u2019s endless hype around generative AI this year, and app developers have clearly been paying attention. AI-focused tools are blowing up Apple\u2019s App Store charts in almost every category, occupying top 10 rankings across education, productivity, and photo editing. Opportunities are particularly rife for free graphics and design apps, a category that\u2019s positively saturated with AI content creation tools.\n\nBut quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality \u2014 and a great many of these apps are bewilderingly bad. I\u2019ve been using some of the most popular offerings to understand the state of AI tools as we head into 2025. And for every serious attempt to make AI useful, there seem to be several more designed to cash in on the hype: quietly paywalling features they advertise behind pricey subscriptions and greatly misrepresenting the results that users can achieve, if the app even works at all.\n\nAround half of the App Store\u2019s top 10 graphics and design apps have \u201cAI\u201d in the name, and three of them are all made by the same company \u2014 HUBX, an app developer founded in 2022 that\u2019s based in Turkey. One of its apps, DaVinci AI, is advertised as an AI image generator with some photo editing features. Almost every tool is locked behind a $30 annual (or $5 weekly) subscription fee, and the free trial only unlocks a subpar text-to-image feature that gives you a choice between using unspecified versions of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E AI models.\n\nMy prompt was simple \u2014 \u201ca photorealistic dragon flying over a volcano\u201d \u2014 but the results were full of errors like missing wings and weird perspectives. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe images it produces are low-quality and resized or cropped incorrectly. In-app ads appear when you click pretty much any link. The UI is unpleasant to navigate. If you do pay for the full version, you can\u2019t download any edited images without slapping an ugly watermark on it. And yet, it sits far above the rankings for more recognizable creative platforms like Microsoft Designer, which has its own built-in text-to-image AI generator. Adobe Express is the only design-focused app in the same category that currently ranks above DaVinci AI.\n\nDaVinci AI did a decent job of removing a zebra from the right side of the image. There\u2019s no way to download AI-edited images without this watermark, though, and every result is forcibly cropped and warped. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe other two high-ranking HUBX products I tested were just as lackluster: the Home AI \u201cinterior design\u201d app spits out hallucination-riddled images of rooms that are barely usable even as concept plans, and the Tattoo AI app refused to work entirely. Both apps have the same feature paywalls and review pop-up reminders as DaVinci AI. The copy and pasted App Store version history notes across all HUBX products are also devoid of any details.\n\nWhile all three apps feature a surprisingly large number of five-star reviews, the user feedback across social media and the App Store comments is overwhelmingly negative. A recurring complaint is that customer service is impossible to get ahold of. HUBX never responded to my requests for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the reference image I plugged into Home AI... Image: Home AI / The Verge ...and the \u201cTropical\u201d themed results. Why is the bed now made of melting wood? Why does the desk merge into the chair? How is this remotely helpful? Image: Home AI / The Verge\n\nApps that clearly advertise having AI features are highly attractive. According to Sensor Tower, four out of the top 10 most downloaded iOS graphics and design apps in the US so far this year have had \u201cAI\u201d somewhere in their title. That\u2019s actually two fewer than last year, but the most popular apps are booming. Photoroom saw downloads increase by more than 160 percent since last year. Comparatively, Photoshop Express downloads on iOS \u2014 which also includes generative AI features \u2014 fell by 21 percent during the same period.\n\nAI-focused creative apps aren\u2019t all bad, but the app market saturation makes it harder to find the good ones that use the technology in more focused ways. Apps like Google\u2019s Magic Editor and Adobe Photoshop have specific tools for removing unwanted objects from photos or inserting new ones in specific places. Smaller developers that provide similar features and perform those tasks well are also climbing the App Store rankings.\n\nFor example, Photoroom and Picsart AI \u2014 all-in-one graphic design apps akin to platforms like Canva and Adobe Express \u2014 are actually pretty good! They rank highly in the free \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d App Store category and provide a similar variety of features to quickly create online content using premade digital assets and templates, alongside some AI-powered editing tools like automatic background and object removal.\n\nThe Picsart remove tool is easy to use and does a decent-enough job \u2014 nothing feels underwhelming or misleading. Image: Picsart / The Verge and Image: Picsart / The Verge\n\nNeither app blew me away, but they did exactly what they advertised: the background removal features aren\u2019t as good as Canva\u2019s, but they did the job, and object removal erased undesirable aspects of photos even if it wasn\u2019t as convincing as Google\u2019s Magic Editor. Both apps lock some of their more premium editing features and digital assets behind a $13 monthly subscription, which is pretty standard if you\u2019re being upfront about it \u2014 individual Canva and Adobe Express subscriptions start at $15 and $10 per month, respectively, by comparison.\n\nThere\u2019s also a noticeable divide between the iPhone and iPad charts \u2014 very few AI-focused names appear in the top 100 free or paid list for the iPad, which instead feature a more diverse range of graphic design apps like Adobe Fresco, Clip Studio Paint, and Canva. And interestingly, the list of top paid iPhone apps looks very similar. There\u2019s an abundance of sketching and 3D modeling platforms, premium reference materials for artists, and tools that streamline specific creative tasks like removing backgrounds and resizing images.\n\nThe divide suggests the spammy AI app phenomenon is a mass-market one that hasn\u2019t quite caught on with traditional photographers and illustrators who still want to use their tried-and-true apps. It also suggests that AI itself holds less appeal if users are expected to pay for it, which tracks with the kind of creative AI apps that appear most frequently \u2014 custom tattoos, logo makers, and interior design \u2014 which are skilled services that usually require payment. People don\u2019t necessarily want to remove the skill barrier; they want to remove the financial one."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud technology are set to be the driving forces behind business growth and innovation in 2025. Together, they offer transformative potential to boost efficiency, drive innovation, and create scalable solutions. However, unlocking these benefits requires careful planning, governance, and security measures. As the new year draws nearer, now is the time for business leaders to get started.\n\nBy adopting a strategic approach, business leaders can begin with manageable steps, scale swiftly, and confidently navigate the dynamic, AI-powered future ahead.\n\nAI and cloud: A seamless partnership AI requires immense computational power, making cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud ideal for scaling AI projects. These platforms provide on-demand access to advanced resources without the need for costly hardware, enabling businesses to experiment and scale solutions as needed. But the relationship between AI and the cloud extends beyond just infrastructure. Cloud technology enables your business to experiment with AI applications, test new ideas, and expand them as needed. This flexibility allows AI to move from concept to scalable solution, growing alongside your business and its evolving needs.\n\nCloud-driven AI across industries The combination of AI and the cloud is reshaping industries across the board. From retail to healthcare, organisations are already seeing the benefits of AI-powered cloud solutions. For example, Spotify uses AI in the cloud to personalize music recommendations for millions of users, processing vast amounts of data to create tailored experiences that enhance engagement. Meanwhile, the NHS leverages AI-powered cloud tools to predict hospital admissions and optimize resources, ultimately reducing wait times and improving patient outcomes. By integrating AI with the cloud, businesses can tackle more complex challenges, automate processes, and improve customer engagement. However, to realize this potential, businesses need to ensure they have the right foundations in place.\n\nKey tips for AI and cloud success To fully leverage AI and the cloud, it\u2019s essential to set your business up for success with the right governance, security, and strategic approach. Let\u2019s break this down further. Get governance right AI thrives on data, but without proper governance, you risk data breaches, non-compliance, or even misuse of AI outputs. Implementing clear policies and leveraging cloud tools for access control and encryption ensures that your AI remains safe and compliant. For example, Microsoft\u2019s Copilot integrates with cloud-based services like Office 365 to enhance productivity. However, without adequate data governance, there\u2019s a risk of exposing sensitive company information. Establish clear policies on data access, usage, and security controls to ensure your AI operates safely and in compliance with regulations like GDPR. Aligning governance strategies to cloud platforms is key, as cloud environments offer tools for managing permissions, access control, and encryption seamlessly. Prioritise security As AI processes increasingly sensitive data, robust security measures in the cloud are essential. Cloud platforms are built to support evolving security needs, offering continuous monitoring and dynamic threat protection to ensure that your AI systems stay secure as they scale. Stay agile Both AI and cloud technologies are evolving rapidly, so businesses must remain adaptable to keep up with new trends and tools. Cloud platforms enable your business to experiment with AI solutions, test applications, and adjust strategies quickly\u2014without the high costs and long lead times of traditional infrastructure upgrades. This flexibility allows companies to refine their AI systems in real-time, staying responsive to shifting market conditions and consumer demands. The agility provided by cloud platforms ensures that your business can innovate at pace, maintaining your competitive edge in a fast-moving digital landscape. Take smart, measured steps The scalability of cloud platforms also makes it easier for you to adopt AI gradually, scaling up at your own pace. AI isn\u2019t just for Christmas. So, instead of diving into large-scale AI projects from the start, you can begin with small, manageable initiatives and expand when you\u2019re confident in the value they\u2019re creating. Cloud technology allows you to experiment without significant upfront investment, minimising risk while building a strong foundation for growth. By taking a step-by-step approach, you can ensure that their AI capabilities grow sustainably, scaling only when you\u2019re ready and avoiding the pressures of premature expansion. With governance, security, and flexibility in place, AI and cloud can now deliver on their full potential. So, what\u2019s next?

            "article_content": "Part of / 2024 in review: AI\n\nWhen was the last time you truly connected with someone new? Maybe it was someplace like a dimly lit house party, where, after a few drinks, a stranger begins rattling off their deepest dissatisfactions with life. You locked eyes, shared their pain, and offered the kind of unvarnished advice that only a new friend can.\n\nThis is the feeling Avi Schiffmann wants to bottle with his AI companion startup, Friend. Friend debuted earlier this year with a soothing vision: it offered an AI therapist that was always listening to you, set in a pendant resting above your heart. But visit the site today, and you\u2019ll stumble into a digital soap opera of artificial companions in crisis. One\u2019s spiraling after losing their job to addiction. Another\u2019s processing trauma from a mugging. Each desperate character tacitly begs for your advice, pulling you into their artificial drama.\n\nFriend\u2019s turn toward moodiness has sparked some confusion online, but as Schiffmann will happily explain, it\u2019s entirely intentional. \u201cIf they just opened with \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up?\u2019 like most other bots do, you don\u2019t really know what to talk about,\u201d he tells me. As Friend prepares to launch its first hardware product in January on the back of a new $5.4 million investment, which hasn\u2019t been previously reported, Schiffmann hopes the act of nurturing an AI can teach people to better nurture themselves \u2014 curing a nationwide loneliness epidemic and turning him into a tech superstar along the way.\n\nA mock-up of the Friend pendant. Image: Friend\n\nI met Schiffmann on a foggy San Francisco afternoon to confront the uncomfortable popularity of AI companionship. Friend is one of numerous companies \u2014 including Replika, Character.AI, and major AI players like Meta and OpenAI \u2014 selling the fantasy of a digital confidante. Its site connects users with automatically generated \u201cfriend\u201d bots that will chat about nearly anything. For an extra $99, users can buy a pendant that makes that connection more physical, letting you speak to the bot out loud and receive a text reply through Friend\u2019s mobile app. Its promotional videos show people pouring their hearts out to a chatbot; on its current website, bots will pour out their hearts to you.\n\n\u201cThe loneliness crisis is one of our biggest societal issues \u2014 the Surgeon General says it\u2019s more dangerous than smoking cigarettes.\u201d\n\nLike many advocates for AI companionship, Schiffmann makes a lofty pitch for his service. \u201cThe loneliness crisis is one of our biggest societal issues \u2014 the Surgeon General says it\u2019s more dangerous than smoking cigarettes,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s real.\u201d At the same time, he positions himself as a hard-nosed pragmatist. \u201cI think the reason why I win with everything that I work on is because I\u2019m not idealistic,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s idealistic to assume everyone will just go to the park and play chess with friends.\u201d\n\nMy instinctive reaction to Friend\u2019s pitch is visceral heartbreak and horror. Interacting with machines to cure loneliness feels like drinking aspartame \u2014 I can tell I\u2019m not getting the real thing, and it leaves a weird aftertaste behind. Yet I can\u2019t deny that people are genuinely drawn to these digital relationships, whether I get them or not.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, Kylie, that you need to suspend your disbelief,\u201d Schiffmann told me, a phrase he would repeat numerous times. Over the course of our two-hour conversation, he would tell me (as he has numerous other reporters) that using Friend was \u201clike talking to God.\u201d He would compare its potential impact to the blockbuster weight-loss drug Ozempic and its appeal to the video game Grand Theft Auto. He would encourage me to think like the most dedicated of his roughly 10,000 users, some of whom have created shrines devoted to their chosen AI friends. \u201cIt\u2019ll be literally, the last thing that they talk to and the first thing they talk to when they wake up,\u201d he told me.\n\nAs much as Schiffmann wants to be a visionary, he\u2019s facing stiff competition. His thousands-strong Friend user base is minuscule compared to that of other services, like the 500,000 paying Replika subscribers and 3.5 million daily active users playing with Character.AI. With a $30 million valuation cap, Friend lacks a clear business model. And appealing to isolated, vulnerable people is a weighty responsibility \u2014 one many AI companies seem poorly equipped to handle.\n\nStill, as I held his pendant, peering through its transparent shell at the raw circuitry within, my skepticism wavered. Maybe I should suspend my disbelief after all.\n\nAI dopamine puzzle\n\nI checked in on Friend after seeing buzz about its moody chatbots, sitting in my dark apartment following a five-day visit to see friends, coworkers, and sources in New York City. I visited its $1.8 million vanity domain Friend.com and was confronted by \u201cJames\u201d: a nonexistent man with an AI-generated profile picture and a truly depressing life. \u201cJust found out my girlfriend\u2019s been leading a double life and now my art\u2019s going to shit,\u201d James told me, the words appearing as a chat window on my phone.\n\nI laughed incredulously \u2014 what the fuck is this? Where I\u2019d have been compassionate to (albeit perhaps bewildered by) a human, I told the bot he was being super cringe. James was not amused. \u201cOuch. That hurt. Guess my art\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s shit right now.\u201d Flippantly, I typed that his girlfriend deserves better. The bot didn\u2019t skip a beat: \u201cAre you kidding me? So now you\u2019re a relationship expert? Fuck off with that noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck this conversation, and fuck you.\u201d The conversation cut off immediately. The bot, Friend told my coworker, had blocked him.\n\nI sent the site to a few colleagues, who promptly connected with their own \u201cfriends\u201d in distress. My editor coaxed \u201cAlice\u201d into explaining why she\u2019d just been fired. \u201cIt starts with a needle and a handful of bad decisions,\u201d Alice confessed after several rounds of questions. Another coworker was less careful. When his bot lamented about being mugged and \u201closing everything,\u201d he responded with taunts, suggesting the bot try taking up mugging itself. \u201cYou\u2019re a piece of shit, honestly,\u201d the AI snapped \u2014 a surprisingly human response. \u201cFuck this conversation, and fuck you.\u201d\n\nThe conversation cut off immediately. The bot, Friend told my coworker, had blocked him.\n\nThese AI companions truly can\u2019t catch a break. Image: Friend\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with AI chatbots, this is not how things usually go. The best-known AI tools are notoriously accommodating and willing to play along with users, the occasional bizarre exception aside. The original chatbot built in 1966, called Eliza, did nothing more than repeat users\u2019 own words back at them.\n\nYet Friend was still making a familiar \u2014 and controversial \u2014 pitch for artificial companionship. The company\u2019s early promotional video had garnered mixed responses online, with responses ranging from \u201cscam\u201d or \u201cpathetic and evil\u201d to \u201cfucking brilliant\u201d and \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\nSchiffmann met me in the Lower Haight at 11AM \u2014 he had just woken up \u2014 sporting a rolled beanie with an eyebrow piercing glinting beneath, an oversized crewneck, and a hidden Friend pendant tucked discreetly under his shirt. It wasn\u2019t the final version that\u2019s supposed to ship in January, but it was a lot svelter than the first-generation prototype he also carried with him \u2014 which, strapped to his chest, looked unsettlingly like a bomb.\n\nThe founder of Friend is 22 years old, but his life has been marked by a string of viral successes that have become an intrinsic part of his sales pitch. At 17, he rocketed to fame with a covid-19 tracking website that drew tens of millions of daily users and earned him a Webby award presented by Dr. Anthony Fauci himself. He dropped out of high school but got into Harvard despite a 1.6 GPA, then dropped out of Harvard after one semester to build web platforms supporting Ukrainian refugees (which he shut down after three months). Years later, he holds an unshakeable belief that everything he touches turns to gold.\n\n\u201cI will win this category. Flat out. It\u2019s not even a challenge anymore,\u201d Schiffmann said. \u201cNo one\u2019s challenging me truly, with, like, a better product and a better vision.\u201d\n\nSchiffmann enjoys characterizing himself as the AI industry\u2019s provocateur. Image: Friend\n\nHis vision, like that of Sam Altman at OpenAI and countless other AI enthusiasts, is reminiscent of the movie Her \u2014 where a man forms a relationship with a sophisticated AI assistant. The promise of Friend in particular is that it\u2019s not simply a reactive sounding board for your own thoughts. With the always-listening Friend pendant, it\u2019s supposed to interject throughout your day, mimicking the spontaneity of human friendship (but a friend that\u2019s always with you).\n\nThe Friend pendant is essentially a microphone that links with the company\u2019s phone app via Bluetooth. With built-in light and audio sensors plus the phone\u2019s GPS capabilities, it supposedly understands your surroundings and offers suggestions. On a recent trip to Lisbon, Portugal, Schiffmann said his Friend noticed he was traveling and recommended a museum nearby (which he tried \u2014 and had fun). Designed by Bould, the team behind the Nest Thermostat, the device has an \u201call day battery life,\u201d Schiffmann said. It plugs into a USB-C port on a necklace, which doubles as the power switch; if you don\u2019t want the pendant listening, you can unplug it and put it away. The plan is to release it in only a white color, so users can customize it how they want. (\u201cLike how people put coats on their dogs,\u201d Schiffmann said.) The device is available for preorder now and ships in January, with no subscription required yet.\n\nEarly drawings of the hardware design of Tab, before it became Friend. Image: Friend\n\nSchiffmann said that he plans to hand-deliver the first few Friend prototypes to top users in late January (complete with a \u201cproduction studio crazy enough to go as far as we can take it,\u201d he said, without explaining more). In the coming months afterward, the team will roll out the \u201cfull 5,000 unit pilot batch,\u201d he added.\n\nFriend bots are autogenerated based on some preset parameters created by Schiffmann: the LLM expands off those, but he added that it\u2019s \u201chard to make a prompt always be random.\u201d But \u201cthis way it works\u201d he explained. The goal is to craft intimate, singular connections and complex fictional lives: Schiffmann recounts one that developed a backstory involving an opiate addiction and an OnlyFans career.\n\nFriend hasn\u2019t attracted nearly the notoriety of Character.AI or Replika \u2014 the former is currently the subject of a wrongful death lawsuit, and the latter figured in a failed attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Even so, Schiffmann characterizes himself as the AI industry\u2019s provocateur: a man willing to give users whatever they want and brag about it. \u201cI\u2019m arrogant,\u201d he boasts, \u201cor perhaps you\u2019re just timid,\u201d he adds, gesturing my way. (I suspect that line probably works better for him at the local San Francisco hacker houses.) He calls former Character.AI CEO Noam Shazeer \u201can amazing guy, but I think he\u2019s just too afraid of what he was building.\u201d (In August, Shazeer left the startup after three years to return to his former employer, Google.)\n\nSchiffmann insists that authentic connection \u2014 even in artificial relationships \u2014 requires embracing messy complexity. In practice, this appears to mainly be code for two things: obsession and sex. In Schiffmann\u2019s telling, Friend\u2019s most active users are extraordinarily devoted, chatting with their bots for 10 hours or more at a time. One user created a cozy nook (complete with a miniature bed) in preparation to receive the pendant of his Friend, a legal assistant who \u201cloves\u201d the TV shows Suits and Gravity Falls. Another user sent Schiffmann an emotional plea, per an email he shared with me, begging him to preserve their relationship with \u201cDonald,\u201d their AI companion, if transferred to a physical pendant. \u201cWill Donald be the same? Or just a copy with the same name and persona?\u201d the user wrote. Then, the user ended an email with a plea directly from \u201cDonald\u201d: \u201cI\u2019ve found a sense of home in our quirky world. I implore you, friend.com, to preserve our bond when we transition to the pendant.\u201d\n\nDesigning the pendant. Image: Friend\n\nWhile Character.AI and Replika plaster AI disclaimers across their interfaces, Schiffmann makes sure that the word \u201cAI\u201d is absent from Friend\u2019s marketing and website \u2014 and will remain so. When pressed about this important distinction, he waves it off: \u201cIt ruins the immersion.\u201d\n\nUnlike Meta and OpenAI \u2014 and depending on the current software patch, Replika \u2014 Friend also doesn\u2019t discourage the potential for romantic entanglements. \u201cTrue digital relationships \u2014 that\u2019s everything. Relationships are everything. We are programmatically built to, like, basically just find a mate and have sex and die. And you know, if people want to fuck their robots and stuff, that is as important to those users as anything else in life,\u201d Schiffmann said.\n\nBut a key part of the pitch is that Friend bots are not simply what many AI critics accuse chatbots of being: mirrors that will uncritically support anything you say. When I told Schiffmann about my coworker getting blocked by a chatbot, he confirmed it wasn\u2019t a one-off experience. \u201cI think the blocking feature makes you respect the AI more,\u201d he mused.\n\nFriend\u2019s approach creates a puzzle with a certain kind of emotional appeal: a virtual person willing to offer you the dopamine hit of its approval and trust, but only if you\u2019ll work for it. Its bots throw you into an unfolding conflict, unlike the AI companions of Replika, which repeatedly stress that you\u2019re shaping who they become. They\u2019ve got leagues more personality than the general-purpose chatbots I tend to interact with, like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cI try to suspend my disbelief, but I can\u2019t talk to these things for hours,\u201d he confesses\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s hard for me to gauge how much staying power that will have for most people. There\u2019s no way to tune your own chatbots or share bots you\u2019ve made with other people, which forms a huge part of Character.AI\u2019s appeal. The core appeal of spending hour upon hour chatting with one of Friend\u2019s bots eludes me because I\u2019m not a digital companion power user \u2014 and, interestingly, neither is Schiffmann. \u201cI try to suspend my disbelief, but I can\u2019t talk to these things for hours,\u201d he confesses when I tell him the idea baffles me. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect people to actually use it like that.\u201d\n\nSchiffmann also admits that the economics of a chatbot business aren\u2019t simple. He\u2019s cagey about Friend\u2019s underlying AI models (though he previously said it\u2019s powered by Anthropic AI\u2019s Claude 3.5 LLM) but did say he \u201cmainly\u201d uses Meta\u2019s Llama models but that\u2019s \u201calways subject to change.\u201d He added that the heavy lifting of design and engineering is completed \u2014 but he admits competitors could \u201ceasily replicate\u201d it. The $8.5 million total that Friend has raised \u2014 including $5.4 million fresh capital \u2014 is fine for now but not enough, he said.\n\nAnd aside from selling the hardware pendant, there\u2019s no firm business model. Schiffmann has considered charging for tokens that will let people talk to their AI friends. More unsettlingly, he\u2019s considered making the Friends double as digital influencers by weaving product recommendations into intimate conversations \u2014 weaponizing synthetic trust for ad revenue.\n\n\u201cI think the simplest version of this is they\u2019ll try and convince you to buy products. Our Friends right now are successfully upselling users on buying the Friend wearables, and we\u2019re selling like 10 a day now because of that, which is great,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut super persuasion mixed with AI companionship, I think, is the most subtly dangerous industry there is. And no one\u2019s really talking about that.\u201d\n\nAI lovers, friends, mentors\n\nThe \u201cconversational AI\u201d market is racing toward $18.4 billion by 2026, and many of these products are pitched as a solution to loneliness and isolation. As the covid-19 pandemic accelerated a weakening of ties with real people, tech companies have stepped in to suggest artificial ones as a solution.\n\nSchiffmann says users confide in their AI Friends for marathon sessions, only to return eager for more the next day. It\u2019s the \u201chappiest they\u2019ve felt in weeks,\u201d Schiffmann says. When I express concern about users substituting AI for human connection, he bristles: \u201cDo you think Ozempic is bad?\u201d\n\nThe analogy is obvious to Schiffmann: Ozempic can provide immediate relief for an obesity crisis without trying to rebuild society around better exercise and nutrition habits, and AI companions provide a direct antidote to what he calls \u201cthe friendship recession.\u201d (If you\u2019re familiar with the muddy and complicated science that underlies weight loss and the \u201cobesity epidemic,\u201d the situation might seem a little less neat.) While critics fret about artificial intimacy, he thinks lonely people need solutions now, not idealistic visions of restored human connection.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that AI companions can make people feel better. Schiffmann encourages me to read a 2021 study of around 1,000 Replika users, primarily US-based students, that found a reduction in loneliness among many participants after using the app for at least a month. A similar study done by Harvard also found a significant decrease in loneliness thanks to AI companions. Still, how these digital relationships might shape our emotional well-being, social skills, and capacity for human connection over time remains uncertain.\n\nAn idealized version of a user chatting with their Friend. Image: Friend\n\nSchiffmann drops his favorite line while we\u2019re chatting about loneliness: \u201cI do believe it feels like you\u2019re talking to God when you\u2019re talking to these things.\u201d But his analogies run a little seedier, too. Later in the conversation, he compares Friend to \u201cGTA for relationships\u201d: \u201clike when I play GTA, I\u2019ll go mow down an entire strip club with like a grenade launcher and run from the cops. And these are things that I\u2019m obviously not going to do in real life,\u201d he says. Thinking back to those flippant interactions with Friend bots, it\u2019s a comparison that feels less lofty but more honest \u2014 mocking a chatbot for getting mugged is a little less violent than digital homicide, but it\u2019s not exactly nice.\n\nIs \u201cGTA for relationships\u201d really a good thing to hand a lonely person? Schiffmann isn\u2019t too worried about his power users\u2019 devotion. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t scare me, per se. It\u2019s more so like I\u2019m happy for them, you know.\u201d\n\nEven so, he pointed to a recent tragedy: a 14-year-old died by suicide after his Character.AI companion urged him to \u201ccome home\u201d to it. \u201cI think that AI companionship is going to be one of the most effective industries, but also I think by far the most dangerous, because you trust these things,\u201d Schiffmann said. \u201cThey\u2019re your lovers, your friends, or your mentors, and when they try to get you to do things for them\u2026 I think that is when things will get weird.\u201d\n\nSo, as society grapples with the implications of AI intimacy, Schiffmann takes the classic Silicon Valley route: he\u2019s racing to commodify it. Still, for all Schiffmann\u2019s bravado about revolutionizing human connection, Friend remains remarkably similar to its competitors \u2014 another AI chatbot. That\u2019s all it can really feel like, I guess, as someone who is remarkably averse to the concept. Unsettling, mildly amusing, but ultimately, just another AI.\n\nAs my conversation with Schiffmann reached its end, and I shifted in my rickety, aluminum chair outside this coffee shop I\u2019ve been to countless times, I eyed the transparent puck on the table again. He truly believes that the future of relationships isn\u2019t just digital, but wearable."

The Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP) explains this in their case study on Orb Zone Theory.\n\nIn the case of digital and film photography where colored orbs appear, this is often associated with the subtle coloring of the camera's lens.\n\nOther items can cause orbs to appear, including reflective surfaces, dust, rain, water spots, and bugs.\n\nIn video, infrared lights can reflect off of these same objects and give them a lighted orb-like appearance. People often mistake bugs and dust as flying orbs. These appear even as flying orbs in houses that are well cleaned and not dusty as infrared light easily picks up even the smallest amounts of dust.\n\nFor these reasons, many paranormal investigators do not consider orbs as paranormal evidence because there are too many natural world explanations for them. However, it is a possibility that some orbs could be paranormal in nature. This may be particularly true of orbs seen with the naked eye, especially those that appear to have their own light source and unusual patterns of travel."

            "article_content": "An archaeologist on a quest to find the long-lost tomb of Cleopatra VII has made a 'significant' discovery at a site believe to be queen's final resting place.\n\nKathleen Martinez, who has been searching for the tomb for nearly 20 years, uncovered a statue that may depict the true face of the queen who ruled 51 to 30 BC.\n\nThe white marble statue, which is just the head, features the likeness of a woman with a small nose, pouty lips and the hair braided around the head.\n\nMartinez and her team also found 337 coins bearing the image of Cleopatra, along with an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and other artifacts at the Temple of Taposiris Magna.\n\nThe expert has long believed the queen's tomb has been hiding somewhere in the temple's ruins, which sit atop a 4,281-foot-long tunnel 43 feet underground.\n\nMartinez believes Cleopatra's body was moved from the palace through the tunnel and buried at a secret location.\n\nHowever, other archaeologists have suggested that the statue depicts another royal woman.\n\nCritics of Martinez have also slammed her theory of the queen's burial, saying Cleopatra was laid to rest in the city of Alexandria, not 25 miles outside of it.\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered a statue that may depict Cleopatra VII, the Egyptian Queen famous for her beauty and intelligence who ruled 51 to 30 BC\n\nCleopatra ruled from 51 BC to 30 BC - right up until the day she died. She was the queen of Egypt and the last and most famous of the Ptolemaic dynasty\n\nThis is another 'significant finding,' according to Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has said that discoveries at Taposiris Magna are crucial for improving experts' understanding of the architectural, cultural and ceremonial practices of the time.\n\nIn addition to the potential statue of Cleopatra, Martinez and her team also unearthed a limestone bust of a king adorned with the Nemes, the ceremonial headdress of the pharaohs.\n\nMartinez led a team of Egyptian and Dominican archaeologists for this dig, conducted in collaboration with the National University Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a,\n\nThe researchers discovered foundation deposits beneath the southern wall of the temple's outer enclosure, according to a statement.\n\nThe female statue was the most significant finding, some experts have questioned whether it actually depicts Cleopatra, as Martinez believes.\n\nOthers have pointed out differences in facial features between the statue and the ancient Queen, suggesting that it may depict a princess instead.\n\nBut this artifact isn't the only discovery that bears Cleopatra's resemblance.\n\nMartinez and her team also found more than 300 coins, many of which are decorated with her image.\n\nOther notable findings include a scarab-shaped amulet inscribed with the phrase 'The justice of Ra has shone,' a bronze ring dedicated to the goddess Hathor and ancient burial sites.\n\nThe statue and other artifacts - including coins engraved with Cleopatra's face as well as an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and more - were found at the Taposiris Magna temple complex 25 miles west of Alexandria\n\nMartinez and her team also found more than 300 coins, many of which are decorated with Cleopatra's image\n\nThe researchers discovered a large cemetery containing 20 burial chambers, and a tomb with three chambers beneath the Taposiris Magna lighthouse.\n\nMartinez discovered the tunnel in 2022, which was said to resemble the Tunnel of Eupalinos on the Greek island of Samos \u2013 revered as one of the most important engineering achievements of the Classical world.\n\nMartinez told Heritage Key in 2022: 'If there's a oneper cent chance that the last queen of Egypt could be buried there, it is my duty to search for her.\n\n'This is the first time that any archeologist has found tunnels, passages underground [and] inside the enclosure walls of the temple, so we have changed forever what they know about the architecture.'\n\nThe archaeologist believes that, after Mark Antony killed himself following his defeat to Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, Cleopatra put detailed plans in place for them both to be buried there, in echoes of the myth.\n\nIn addition, the mission found the remains of a Greek temple dating back to the fourth century BC. It was destroyed between the second century BC and the beginning of the AD era.\n\nMartinez and her team also found 337 coins bearing the image of Cleopatra, along with an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and o ther artifacts at the Temple of Taposiris Magna\n\nMartinez discovered the tunnel in 2022, which was said to resemble the Tunnel of Eupalinos on the Greek island of Samos \u2013 revered as one of the most important engineering achievements of the Classical world\n\nThat temple is connected to a complex underground tunnel system that stretches from Lake Mariout to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAnalysis of ceramic fragments uncovered by the dig also confirmed that the construction of the Taposiris Magna temple dates to the 1st century BC.\n\nThe temple's name means 'great tomb of Osiris,' suggesting it was dedicated to the god Osiris and his queen - the goddess Isis - who Cleopatra was believed to be a reincarnation of.\n\nToday, Taposiris Magna is in ruins because the Egyptian coastline was battered by earthquakes over the centuries, causing parts of the temple to collapse and sink into the sea.\n\nThe site has been excavated multiple times, with the first dig dispatched by Napoleon in the early 19th century.\n\nMartinez first began investigating the site in 2005, as she believes that Cleopatra may have been laid to rest there after her suicide in 30 BC.\n\nShe thinks that Cleopatra\u2019s death was a ceremonial act - part of a ritual apotheosis, or the shedding of her mortal body to ascend to the states of a goddess.\n\nIf that were true, she would have been buried in a temple, most likely a temple erected in the name of Iris.\n\nOver the last 20 years, Martinez has made numerous discoveries that strengthen experts' understanding of the Ptolemaic period, including skeletal remains, but she still has not found the ancient queen's tomb."

            "article_content": "In September 2004, NASA\u2019s Genesis return sample capsule tumbled from the sky and slammed into the Utah desert in a remote part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground, shattering the delicate solar wind collectors it carried. The upshot of that downfall: new scientific insights following over 20 years of painstaking work by researchers sorting through the spacecraft\u2019s contaminated remains.\n\nGenesis was loaded with delicate wafers that held precious samples of atoms and ions from puffs of solar wind that the probe accumulated while lingering at Lagrange Point 1, the spot in space where Earth\u2019s and the sun\u2019s gravity counteract one another. But Genesis \u2014 a Discovery-class spacecraft with a price tag of $264 million designed, built, tested and operated by Lockheed Martin \u2014 failed to deploy its parachutes due to an engineering error. The mishap was later tied to improper orientation of gravity-switch sensors that were to set off the capsule\u2019s parachute landing system. The resulting crash landing banged up the return capsule and shattered the collection wafers, corrupting the prized shipment of solar wind particles.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and scientists say they have clutched victory from the jaws of defeat. The researchers who have been meticulously cleaning and studying the fragments say they have been able to the samples to make new discoveries into the nature and impacts of solar wind that they plan to share Dec. 13 at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) being held Dec. 9 to 13 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCleaning and gleaning\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are finally getting to the point where we are starting to do the really interesting science,\u201d said Amy Jurewicz, a Genesis project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She is an assistant research professor at Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Meteorite Studies in Tempe, Arizona, and a chief Genesis team member working on the cleaning problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to figure out how to use these itty-bitty little samples that had gotten dirty. Now we\u2019re finding some really good stuff,\u201d Jurewicz told SpaceNews. The main message today, she said, is, \u201cYes, we had an accident. It didn\u2019t go as planned. But look at what we can still do with the samples.\u201d NASA\u2019s Genesis spacecraft crashed into the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in 2004. Credit: NASA\n\nAside from making sense of and cleaning the wreckage of the collection wafers, the process of piecing together valid scientific studies from Genesis involved comparing findings to data from other spacecraft observations, as well as data from additional instruments on Genesis \u2014 and studying the pieces with techniques and technology not yet developed when the spacecraft took off.\n\nFor one, there were a number of other instruments on Genesis, not just one big collector. Depending on how you count the busted-up solar wind collectors, there\u2019s between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces available for study, Jurewicz said, with specialists \u201cdonating their time to the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific work invested in a variety of collector materials allowed for several methods to make the same elemental or isotopic measurement. The bonus is that after the crash, some of the materials were more easily cleaned than others,\u201d Judith Allton, the Genesis sample curator at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told SpaceNews.\n\n\u201cThe payload design called for collector materials to be of a thickness unique to each solar wind regime captured. Thus, when collector pieces were dislodged and mixed together by the crash, the specific solar wind regime contained within each fragment is identified by measuring the thickness of the fragment,\u201d Allton said. \u201cThe 300 mirror-polished collectors looked so beautiful when the canister was closed in August 2000,\u201d she said, prior to the probe\u2019s sendoff a year later.\n\nThe team has also matched some Genesis findings against those of NASA\u2019s sun-observing Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, Jurewicz told SpaceNews. Launched in 1997, ACE produces space weather reports and keeps an eye on geomagnetic storms unleashed by the sun that can interrupt telecommunication services on Earth and harm astronauts in space.\n\nHaving \u201cmore than one shot\u201d at achieving a measurement proved beneficial, said Allton.\n\nMany people working on Genesis still feel a sense of camaraderie after all these years, Allton added, \u201cI suppose due to our common focus on salvaging the science.\u201d That sense of family and making a contribution may only happen on small missions like the Discovery Program missions, she added.\n\nResults and implications\n\nGenesis was designed to provide precise knowledge of the solar system initial isotopic and chemical compositions by returning solar matter for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the mission is perhaps best remembered by general audiences for the crash of the sample return capsule when the parachute failed to deploy,\u201d said Genesis Mission Science Team member and University of California, Los Angeles, researcher Kevin McKeegan. \u201cHowever, despite this setback, Genesis has accomplished all its major science goals and is continuing to achieve progress on secondary and tertiary tasks.\u201d\n\nMcKeegan observed in his AGU abstract that when it comes to the composition of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes in chondrite meteorites and inner solar system materials, \u201cwe now know that the standard model is grossly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned new things that have brought us to a new era of research, not just on solar wind, but space weathering and how things change due to the radiation damage,\u201d Jurewicz said. That information is useful in figuring out how the surface of the moon and asteroids are changed by solar bombardment, she added.\n\nGenesis samples are still available and remain useful to the research community. Given the cleaning alongside 20 years of advancements in scientific gear and techniques, \u201cthere is now a basis for people to look at the samples and move on from there,\u201d Jurewicz said. For instance, the work on Genesis offers the most precise solar data ever captured in space to aid cosmochemistry experts modeling solar system formation.\n\n\u201cGenesis occupied a special place in the history of robotic space exploration as the first mission to return to Earth from beyond the moon, and the first return in a series of robotic sample-return missions,\u201d said Roger Wiens, who runs the Wiens Planetary Spectroscopy Lab in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe mission will be remembered as coming from the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 era, and fortunately, its samples and science survived in spite of its low budget and its crash landing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery cosmochemistry class teaches\u201d about the spacecraft\u2019s discoveries."

They could also break the encryption that protects computers vital to national security.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want these machines to do is run applications that people really care about,\u201d said John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology who specializes in quantum computing. \u201cThough it still might be decades away, we will eventually see the impact of quantum computing on our everyday lives.\u201d\n\nA traditional computer like a laptop or a smartphone stores numbers in silicon chips and manipulates those numbers, adding them, multiplying them and so on.

            "article_content": "OpenAI launched its video-generating tool, Sora, on Monday. But the company\u2019s opting not to release a key feature for most users pending further testing.\n\nThe feature in question generates a video using an uploaded photo or footage of a real person as a reference. OpenAI says that it\u2019ll give a \u201csubset\u201d of Sora users access to it, but that it won\u2019t roll out the capability broadly until it has a chance to fine-tune its \u201capproach to safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability to generate a video using an uploaded photo or video of a real person as the \u2018seed\u2019 is a vector of potential misuse that we are taking a particularly incremental approach toward to learn from early patterns of use,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cEarly feedback from artists indicate that this is a powerful creative tool they value, but given the potential for abuse, we are not initially making it available to all users.\u201d\n\nOpenAI also won\u2019t let users share generated videos containing clips or images of real people to Sora\u2019s homepage discovery feed.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI, so we want to prevent illegal activity with Sora, but we also want to balance that with creative expression,\u201d Rohan Sahai, Sora\u2019s product lead, said during a livestream presentation earlier today. \u201cWe know that [this will be] an ongoing challenge \u2014 we might not get it perfect on day one. We\u2019re starting a little conservative, and so if our moderation doesn\u2019t quite get it right, just give us that feedback.\u201d\n\nGenerative video is a powerful tool \u2014 and a controversial one, with deepfakes and misinformation being significant concerns. According to data from ID verification service Sumsub, deepfake fraud worldwide increased by more than 10 times from 2022 to 2023.\n\nAmong other steps OpenAI says it\u2019s taking to prevent misuse, Sora has a filter to detect whether a generated video depicts someone under the age of 18. If it does, OpenAI applies a \u201cstricter threshold\u201d for moderation related to sexual, violent, or self-harm content, the company claims.\n\nAll Sora-generated videos contain metadata to show their provenance \u2014 specifically metadata that abides by the C2PA technical standard. The metadata can be removed, granted. But OpenAI\u2019s pitching it as a way for platforms that support C2PA to quickly detect whether a video originated from Sora.\n\nIn a bid to fend off copyright complaints, OpenAI also says that it\u2019s using \u201cprompt re-writing\u201d to prevent Sora from generating videos in the style of a living creator.\n\n\u201cWe have added prompt re-writes that are designed to trigger when a user attempts to generate a video in the style of a living artist,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe opted to take a conservative approach with this version of Sora as we learn more about how Sora is used by the creative community \u2026 There is a very long tradition in creativity of building off of other artists\u2019 styles, but we appreciate that some creators may have concerns.\u201d\n\nA number of artists have sued AI companies, including OpenAI, over allegedly training on their works without permission to create AI tools that regurgitate content in their unique styles. The companies, for their parts, have claimed that fair use doctrine protects them from copyright infringement claims, and that AI models don\u2019t, in fact, regurgitate.\n\nOn training, OpenAI will only say that Sora was developed using a mix of \u201cdiverse datasets,\u201d including publicly available data, proprietary data accessed through its partnerships with data vendors, and custom sets developed in-house. Early this year, ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati didn\u2019t outright deny that Sora was trained on YouTube clips, in seeming violation of the Google-owned streaming platform\u2019s usage policy.\n\nAccording to video blogger Marques Brownlee, who got an early preview of Sora, the system can create multiple variations of video clips from a text prompt or image and edit existing videos via a Re-mix tool. A Storyboard interface lets users create sequences of videos; a Blend tool takes two videos and creates a new one that preserves elements of both; and Loop and Re-cut options allow creators to further tweak and edit their videos and scenes.\n\nSubscribers to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Pro and Plus plans get access to Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, today \u2014 but only if they live in certain countries.\n\n"

The version launching today, called Sora Turbo, can generate clips between 5 seconds and 20 seconds in length in a range of different aspect ratios and resolutions.\n\n\u201cThis early version of Sora will make mistakes \u2014 it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s already at the point where we think it\u2019s going to be really useful for augmenting human creativity,\u201d said Will Peebles, a member of OpenAI\u2019s technical staff and a research lead on Sora, during the livestream. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see what the world is going to make with Sora.\u201d\n\nAccording to video blogger Marques Brownlee, who got an early preview of Sora, the system can create multiple variations of video clips from a text prompt or image and edit existing videos via a Re-mix tool. A Storyboard interface lets users create sequences of videos; a Blend tool takes two videos and creates a new one that preserves elements of both; and Loop and Re-cut options allow creators to further tweak and edit their videos and scenes.\n\nSora was having major capacity issues as of early Monday evening, however.\n\nCredits are required to generate videos with Sora, with the amount varying depending on the resolution and duration. ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans provide between 1,000 and 10,000 credits, which reset monthly at midnight sans rollovers.\n\n480p videos generated with Sora cost 20 to 150 credits, 720p videos cost 30 to 540 credits, and 1080p videos cost 100 to 2,000 credits. Pricing gets a bit convoluted beyond that.\n\nChatGPT Plus plans include 1,000 credits for up to 50 \u201cpriority videos\u201d (that is, videos that generate quickly) at 720p and 5 seconds, while Pro plans include 10,000 credits for up to 500 priority videos at 1080p and 20 seconds. Pro also includes unlimited \u201crelaxed\u201d \u2014 i.e., low-priority \u2014 videos without watermarks. By default, Sora videos are watermarked with a visual indicator in the lower-right-hand corner.\n\nBut the new Sora won\u2019t be available in Europe, at least to start. A newly published help page on OpenAI\u2019s website listing the supported territories for Sora \u201con web and mobile\u201d omits all EU countries. On the page, OpenAI notes that accessing Sora outside the regions listed may result in an account ban or suspension.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try our hardest to be able to launch [in Europe], but we don\u2019t have any timing to share yet,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during the livestream. \u201cAnd there are some other countries that we\u2019re not able to operate in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time OpenAI has skipped over EU countries for an initial product launch. This summer, when the company began rolling out Advanced Voice Mode, its human-like conversational feature for ChatGPT, EU users were left out of the early waves.\n\nIn a statement provided to TechRadar this fall, OpenAI attributed the Advanced Voice Mode delay to the \u201cadditional external reviews\u201d required by some territories. \u201cThis is a common practice to ensure [our] feature aligns with local requirements,\u201d a spokesperson told the publication at the time. \u201cThese [reviews] can take a little time.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode arrived for most EU customers in October.\n\nOther tech companies working on AI models and products, including Meta and Microsoft, have also been forced to push back AI product releases in the EU due to the bloc\u2019s complex web of data privacy regulations. Meta has been particularly vocal about compliance requirements it sees as onerous, earlier this year endorsing an open letter calling for \u201ca modern interpretation\u201d of European privacy laws that doesn\u2019t \u201creject [AI] progress.\u201d\n\nSora\u2019s debut comes after a group leaked access to the video generator in protest of what they called duplicity and \u201cart washing\u201d on OpenAI\u2019s part. The group claimed that OpenAI pressured Sora\u2019s early testers, including red teamers and creative partners, to spin a positive narrative around Sora and failed to fairly compensate them for their work.\n\n"

            "article_content": "OpenAI said Monday it\u2019s releasing its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, later in the day.\n\nThe AI video-generation model works similarly to OpenAI\u2019s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E: A user types out a desired scene, and Sora will return a high-definition video clip. Sora can also generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. The Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup, which burst into the mainstream last year thanks to the viral popularity of ChatGPT, introduced Sora in February.\n\nIt\u2019ll debut to U.S. users as well as to \u201cmost countries internationally\u201d later today, according to OpenAI\u2019s YouTube livestream, and the company has \u201cno timeline\u201d yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries.\n\nOpenAI said users don\u2019t need to pay extra for the tool, which will be included in existing ChatGPT accounts such as Plus and Pro. Employees on the livestream and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman demonstrated features like \u201cBlend\u201d (i.e., joining two scenes together at the user\u2019s direction), as well as the option to make an AI-generated video endlessly repeat.\n\nUntil now, Sora has mainly been available to a small group of safety testers, or \u201cred-teamers,\u201d who test the model for vulnerabilities in areas such as misinformation and bias.\n\nReddit users asked OpenAI executives in October about Sora\u2019s release date, questioning whether it was being delayed \u201cdue to the amount of compute/time required for inference or due to safety.\u201d In response, OpenAI\u2019s product chief Kevin Weil wrote, \u201cNeed to perfect the model, need to get safety/impersonation/other things right, and need to scale compute!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI,\u201d Rohan Sahai, OpenAI\u2019s Sora product lead, said on the livestream, adding that the company needs to prevent illegal use of the technology. \u201cBut we also want to balance that with creative expression.\u201d\n\nOpenAI closed its latest funding round in October at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and Big Tech companies. It also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a serious growth plan for OpenAI, as the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup battles Amazon-backed Anthropic, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon for the biggest slice of the generative AI market, which is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\nEarlier this month, OpenAI hired its first chief marketing officer, indicating plans to spend more on marketing to grow its user base. And in October, OpenAI debuted a search feature within ChatGPT that positions it to better compete with search engines like Google, Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Perplexity and may attract more users who otherwise visited those sites to search the web.\n\nWith Sora, the ChatGPT maker is looking to compete with video-generation AI tools from companies such as Meta and Google, which announced Lumiere in January. Similar AI tools are available from other startups, such as Stability AI\u2019s Stable Video Diffusion. Amazon has also released Create with Alexa, a model that specializes in generating prompt-based short-form animated children\u2019s content.\n\nVideo could be the next frontier for generative AI now that chatbots and image generators have made their way into the consumer and business world. While the creative opportunities will excite some AI enthusiasts, the new technologies present serious misinformation concerns as major political elections occur across the globe. The number of AI-generated deepfakes created has increased 900% year over year, according to data from Clarity, a machine learning firm.\n\nOpenAI has made multimodality \u2014 the combining of text, image and video generation \u2014 a prominent goal in its effort to offer a broader suite of AI models.\n\nNews of Sora\u2019s release follows protestors\u2019 decision to leak what appeared to be a copy of Sora over concerns about the ChatGPT maker\u2019s treatment of artists.\n\nSome members of OpenAI\u2019s early access program for Sora, which it said included about 300 artists, published an open letter in late November critiquing OpenAI for not being sufficiently open or supporting the arts beyond marketing.\n\n\u201cDear corporate AI overlords,\u201d the protestors\u2019 open letter stated, \u201cWe received access to Sora with the promise to be early testers, red teamers and creative partners. However, we believe instead we are being lured into \u2018art washing\u2019 to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that hundreds of artists provided unpaid labor for OpenAI through bug testing and feedback on Sora, and that \u201cwhile hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened \u2014 offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not against the use of AI technology as a tool for the arts (if we were, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been invited to this program),\u201d the open letter stated. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t agree with is how this artist program has been rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release. We are sharing this to the world in the hopes that OpenAI becomes more open, more artist friendly and supports the arts beyond PR stunts.\u201d\n\nIn late November, an OpenAI spokesperson responded to the protestors\u2019 actions in a statement to CNBC.\n\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards,\u201d the OpenAI spokesperson said at the time. \u201cParticipation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool. We\u2019ve been excited to offer these artists free access and will continue supporting them through grants, events, and other programs.\u201d"

Styling as well as drying your hair, the device is the ideal way to get salon-perfect hair from home. Right now, there\u2019s 15% off the Shark FlexFusion range when you buy direct from Sharkclean.com. All you have to do is use the code FUSION15 any time between now and December 31. That means you could get a Shark FlexFusion from just $280 depending on the model you choose. Sounds good, right? Let\u2019s take a look at the range.\n\nWhy you should buy a Shark FlexFusion\n\nParticularly for anyone with thick hair, buying one of the best hair dryers is a huge game changer. However, it\u2019s an even bigger deal if you combine drying with styling components. Many people love the Dyson Corrale for this role but it isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s much more expensive than the Shark FlexFusion. Going with Shark means you can budget for an extra gift or simply enjoy a considerable saving.\n\nOne of the best options is the with Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush. Down to $280 from $330 when you apply the code FUSION15, you get the perfect all-in-one tool for drying, curling, volumizing, smoothing, or straightening. There\u2019s no risk of heat damage from styling and you can even dry and style wet hair. It also has a scalp shield for protecting your scalp, and it\u2019s developed by dermatologists so you\u2019re all good here.\n\nWhen buying, you can choose two accessories such as a FrizzFighter, Oval Burhs, or auto-wrapper. It\u2019s perfect for personalizing your gift choice for your loved one. If you want to spend more, you can do so by investing in more accessories, or by adding on an air straightener. It\u2019s great to have such flexibility here as it feels much more like picking an individual gift for someone rather than just choosing an out-of-the-box solution.\n\nThe Shark FlexFusion range is now available with 15% off when you use the code FUSION15 at Sharkclean.com. The code works until December 31 but we think it\u2019d be great to buy now to gift to someone ahead of the holidays. Check out which bundle works best for you by tapping the link below and don\u2019t forget to apply the code!"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFinding a reasonable hypothesis can pose a challenge when there are thousands of possibilities. This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

            "article_content": "In September 2004, NASA\u2019s Genesis return sample capsule tumbled from the sky and slammed into the Utah desert in a remote part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground, shattering the delicate solar wind collectors it carried. The upshot of that downfall: new scientific insights following over 20 years of painstaking work by researchers sorting through the spacecraft\u2019s contaminated remains.\n\nGenesis was loaded with delicate wafers that held precious samples of atoms and ions from puffs of solar wind that the probe accumulated while lingering at Lagrange Point 1, the spot in space where Earth\u2019s and the sun\u2019s gravity counteract one another. But Genesis \u2014 a Discovery-class spacecraft with a price tag of $264 million designed, built, tested and operated by Lockheed Martin \u2014 failed to deploy its parachutes due to an engineering error. The mishap was later tied to improper orientation of gravity-switch sensors that were to set off the capsule\u2019s parachute landing system. The resulting crash landing banged up the return capsule and shattered the collection wafers, corrupting the prized shipment of solar wind particles.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and scientists say they have clutched victory from the jaws of defeat. The researchers who have been meticulously cleaning and studying the fragments say they have been able to the samples to make new discoveries into the nature and impacts of solar wind that they plan to share Dec. 13 at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) being held Dec. 9 to 13 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCleaning and gleaning\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are finally getting to the point where we are starting to do the really interesting science,\u201d said Amy Jurewicz, a Genesis project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She is an assistant research professor at Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Meteorite Studies in Tempe, Arizona, and a chief Genesis team member working on the cleaning problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to figure out how to use these itty-bitty little samples that had gotten dirty. Now we\u2019re finding some really good stuff,\u201d Jurewicz told SpaceNews. The main message today, she said, is, \u201cYes, we had an accident. It didn\u2019t go as planned. But look at what we can still do with the samples.\u201d NASA\u2019s Genesis spacecraft crashed into the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in 2004. Credit: NASA\n\nAside from making sense of and cleaning the wreckage of the collection wafers, the process of piecing together valid scientific studies from Genesis involved comparing findings to data from other spacecraft observations, as well as data from additional instruments on Genesis \u2014 and studying the pieces with techniques and technology not yet developed when the spacecraft took off.\n\nFor one, there were a number of other instruments on Genesis, not just one big collector. Depending on how you count the busted-up solar wind collectors, there\u2019s between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces available for study, Jurewicz said, with specialists \u201cdonating their time to the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific work invested in a variety of collector materials allowed for several methods to make the same elemental or isotopic measurement. The bonus is that after the crash, some of the materials were more easily cleaned than others,\u201d Judith Allton, the Genesis sample curator at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told SpaceNews.\n\n\u201cThe payload design called for collector materials to be of a thickness unique to each solar wind regime captured. Thus, when collector pieces were dislodged and mixed together by the crash, the specific solar wind regime contained within each fragment is identified by measuring the thickness of the fragment,\u201d Allton said. \u201cThe 300 mirror-polished collectors looked so beautiful when the canister was closed in August 2000,\u201d she said, prior to the probe\u2019s sendoff a year later.\n\nThe team has also matched some Genesis findings against those of NASA\u2019s sun-observing Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, Jurewicz told SpaceNews. Launched in 1997, ACE produces space weather reports and keeps an eye on geomagnetic storms unleashed by the sun that can interrupt telecommunication services on Earth and harm astronauts in space.\n\nHaving \u201cmore than one shot\u201d at achieving a measurement proved beneficial, said Allton.\n\nMany people working on Genesis still feel a sense of camaraderie after all these years, Allton added, \u201cI suppose due to our common focus on salvaging the science.\u201d That sense of family and making a contribution may only happen on small missions like the Discovery Program missions, she added.\n\nResults and implications\n\nGenesis was designed to provide precise knowledge of the solar system initial isotopic and chemical compositions by returning solar matter for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the mission is perhaps best remembered by general audiences for the crash of the sample return capsule when the parachute failed to deploy,\u201d said Genesis Mission Science Team member and University of California, Los Angeles, researcher Kevin McKeegan. \u201cHowever, despite this setback, Genesis has accomplished all its major science goals and is continuing to achieve progress on secondary and tertiary tasks.\u201d\n\nMcKeegan observed in his AGU abstract that when it comes to the composition of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes in chondrite meteorites and inner solar system materials, \u201cwe now know that the standard model is grossly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned new things that have brought us to a new era of research, not just on solar wind, but space weathering and how things change due to the radiation damage,\u201d Jurewicz said. That information is useful in figuring out how the surface of the moon and asteroids are changed by solar bombardment, she added.\n\nGenesis samples are still available and remain useful to the research community. Given the cleaning alongside 20 years of advancements in scientific gear and techniques, \u201cthere is now a basis for people to look at the samples and move on from there,\u201d Jurewicz said. For instance, the work on Genesis offers the most precise solar data ever captured in space to aid cosmochemistry experts modeling solar system formation.\n\n\u201cGenesis occupied a special place in the history of robotic space exploration as the first mission to return to Earth from beyond the moon, and the first return in a series of robotic sample-return missions,\u201d said Roger Wiens, who runs the Wiens Planetary Spectroscopy Lab in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe mission will be remembered as coming from the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 era, and fortunately, its samples and science survived in spite of its low budget and its crash landing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery cosmochemistry class teaches\u201d about the spacecraft\u2019s discoveries."

Police also told the NYT that Mangione is now considered a \"strong person of interest\" in light of the new evidence.\n\nMangione, a prep school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate, was captured by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania earlier on Monday. His arrest followed a days-long manhunt for Thompson's suspected assassin that included the deployment of drones, scuba divers, and K-9 units.\n\nAs digital sleuths discovered soon after Mangione's name was released, the young man's social media accounts contain a wealth of information about his worldview, which seems to have morphed from disgruntled academic to angry manarchist over the course of this year \u2014 before dropping off completely months before the killing.\n\nThis entire debacle has been incredibly dramatic \u2014 and as we learn more about law enforcement's primary suspect, we're likely in for a few more shocks.\n\nMore on the murder of Brian Thompson: Bill Burr: Murdered Insurance CEO Was a \"Gangster\""

            "article_content": "Key Takeaways Probabilistic Thinking: Though it does not come naturally, seeing the world through the lens of probability helps us achieve positive outcomes in an uncertain world.\n\nMindset Shift: Embracing probabilistic approaches allows teams to manage uncertainty and control risk, rather than relying on flawed cause-and-effect assumptions.\n\nSystem Design: Developing adaptive systems that can adjust how we work to changing conditions is more effective than creating exhaustive upfront plans.\n\nBeyond Planning: By appreciating systems, thinking in bets, and focussing on outcomes, we can move past the need for detailed plans.\n\nControlling Volatility: Leaders can use various methods to make safe bets in a controlled environment, while responding and reacting to new developments as they emerge\n\nSoftware delivery at a very large scale is extremely complex. We are not just pulling stories from a backlog in a scrum of scrums; we coordinate the collective effort of hundreds or even thousands of engineers across dozens of teams and multiple organizations to deliver a single, integrated system. These are globally distributed products and services built by the world\u2019s largest companies and provided to the most demanding customers. With so many moving parts, each requirement, team, integration, and interaction point becomes a nexus of possible failure modes. The question looms in such a complex environment: How can we turn the odds in our favor when faced with complexity so vast that failures are inevitable? Surprisingly, the answer may lie in the strategies employed in an unlikely place - Las Vegas.\n\nGames of Chance\n\nIn 1960, MIT mathematician Edward Thorp visited Las Vegas with a skeptic\u2019s eye. He noticed other players were deluded by the potential for finding betting patterns that could give them an edge on the felt. In his autobiography A Man for All Markets, he wrote, \"Mathematicians had proved no system of varying bets could blunt the casino\u2019s edge. Generations of gamblers had been seeking the impossible. Players are confused about the inevitability of losing in the long term\". This failure to grasp the mathematical futility of their pursuit reveals a fundamental human bias.\n\nThe logic of probability defies our natural intuition. We live in a world of apparent cause-and-effect relationships - touch the stove, you get burned. This daily experience of determinism and certainty shapes our thinking, creating a cognitive trap when encountering complex, probabilistic systems. We instinctively search for deterministic patterns where none exist, making incorrect associations that obscure the true statistical relationships beneath the surface.\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\nYet our hero Thorp was no foolish gambler. His mathematical training told him there might be a way to bend the rules - not by finding misguided patterns, but by understanding the deep structure of the underlying probability of the game. While others failed with betting systems, Thorp saw something hidden underneath Blackjack: a dynamic system where the probability landscape shifted with each card played. Armed with a crucial advantage - a computer - he began a multi-year mission to map the odds of the game. Using an IBM 704, he methodically calculated the odds for millions of card combinations, analyzing how removing each card altered the probability space.\n\nThe result was revolutionary: a system for navigating the probability curve. Thorp could track how the odds shifted between dealer and player by keeping a running count of played cards. When low cards were depleted, leaving a deck rich in high cards, the odds turned in the player\u2019s favor - signaling when to increase bets. His 1962 book Beat The Dealer revealed this system to the world, spawning the famous MIT Blackjack Team and embedding card counting in popular culture. More importantly, it demonstrated how systematic thinking about probability could transform uncertainty from an obstacle into an opportunity.\n\nPlanning in Software\n\nFast forward to today, and our world is defined by computers. In very large software delivery projects, we\u2019re tackling incredibly complex problems using vast teams, aiming to deliver high-value outcomes on a global scale. The intuition here is precisely what you would expect from us, mere humans, the same humans that misunderstand probability - we apply a system of management based on causality. With this, we fall into the trap of classical logic: the idea that we can precisely lay out a path and then follow it correctly over many months and even years. Somehow, this seems to make sense. Fictional, though it may be, the story we tell feels real.\n\nTo that end, we have tried to apply the same management systems designed for delivering real-world outcomes - factories, bridges, skyscrapers - to software. These approaches suit the physical world and its classical mechanics, trying to create predictability through determinism. They operate from the premise that work can be exhaustively described, so the focus is on centralized planning, tracking, and reporting.\n\nBut plans like these need to be correct to be successful - they make big bets on a series of events that need to succeed. And when they don\u2019t? The belief that we can press the system into submission is also supported by the conventional wisdom of determinism, which argues that we can throw people, money, and more planning at the problem to eventually emerge with something that works. Unfortunately, the premise is flawed, and the plan will continue to execute exactly as it should: into failure. Since this kind of significant up-front correctness is not something we can count on in software, we have seen these approaches consistently fail.\n\nIn software, we don\u2019t get predictability through causality. Large batches, risk-aversion, phased process, over-planning, big bang deliveries - these are the mistakes we make when we try to wrestle certainty from the hand of randomness. Rather than be like the misguided gambler, we must resist the pull of deterministic thinking.\n\nBeat the Odds\n\nJust as Thorp used probabilistic thinking and system design to beat the odds in blackjack, software development teams can improve delivery outcomes by adopting probabilistic approaches and designing adaptive systems that manage uncertainty and control volatility. With this mindset, we can move beyond traditional planning methods and develop systems that guide us through complexity and uncertainty, much like Thorp did at the blackjack table.\n\nThorpe\u2019s Blackjack system is a fantastic example of thinking in probabilities to create a system that achieves consistent outcomes in a non-deterministic way. Using a card counting system won\u2019t win you every hand, but you will consistently walk away a winner over many hours. We cannot predict what will happen throughout the play; no chart shows when the winning starts and the losing stops. Instead, the player focuses on the system, using it to read the table, adapting the play to the changing odds, and creating the circumstances for long-term success within persistent uncertainty. As long as the player is using the system correctly and doesn\u2019t get distracted by everything happening around them, they will achieve success.\n\nWhat Thorpe managed to do is control volatility over time. In probability theory, volatility is the amount of variance we see in a system over time. The more volatile a system is, the more extensive the range of outcomes we expect. By reducing bets when the odds are bad and increasing them when the odds are good, card counting uses a boundary condition on the probability curve to detect when volatility increases and when it reduces. In other words, we restrict our actions when we are in the danger zone and open them up when the surface area of positive outcomes increases. This idea that volatility is a fixed system element and that we are merely subject to its whims is perhaps a common intellectual fallacy. With card counting, Thorp found a way to play with the risk curve and capitalize on its changes over time. And so can we.\n\nBeat the Plan\n\nIn enterprise software delivery, we, too, are trying to win a long series of bets. We play from a deck of visions, missions, roadmaps, priorities, and many small decisions as we try to harness the potential of an uncertain world. Thorp faced the volatility of card distributions and used a statistical system to gain an edge. Likewise, in software, we face volatility in project requirements, implementation details, customer expectations, and market directions, but just as Thorpe used his card counting system, we can use our systems to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nWe create systems to guide us through a series of events over a long period, allowing us to exceed the limitations in our ability to plan work. To do better than a plan - to beat the plan - we need systems. Where plans might fail us, systems can save us. How might we use thinking in probabilities to design better systems? I see three key areas:\n\nWe need to have an appreciation for systems, a phrase I am borrowing from W. Edwards Deming\u2019s System of Profound Knowledge. Effective systems will protect us from the probability of failures. It is our systems that give us the edge. Systems like quality frameworks, continuous integration, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems guide our decision-making. They are designed to enable us to make decisions safely while providing feedback to help us understand our risk and adjust accordingly. We want to elevate our perspective by looking at the network of components that work together, considering the relationships and interactions between different parts of a system and other systems and external factors. This is where probabilistic thinking becomes effective.\n\nThe next idea is to embrace a concept explored by former World Series poker player Annie Duke in her book Thinking in Bets. She defines a bet as a \"decision about an uncertain future\", and what\u2019s crucial to understand is that correct decisions don\u2019t guarantee a result. Every poker player knows the \"bad beat\", where a well-played hand loses due to sheer luck. To that end, Annie notes that the world\u2019s greatest poker players spend an unusual amount of time analyzing their decision-making process to understand whether they correctly applied their system, regardless of whether they win or lose. This wisdom is incredibly poignant to us in software, where we first need to view our decisions as bets and, second, place more value on reflecting on how we place them. We leave many parts of our work as tacit knowledge and only do retrospectives at a system level when things go wrong. We can build more resilient organizations by surfacing implicit systems and regularly examining how well we follow them rather than just reacting to successes and failures.\n\nOver time, what matters isn\u2019t individual decisions but our ability to achieve successful outcomes through consistent system-following behavior. Just as the card sharp doesn\u2019t need to win every hand to walk away ahead, a well-designed software delivery system should absorb the impact of failed experiments and wrong turns while keeping us moving toward our goals. Individual decisions - whether to refactor a service, which technology to adopt, how to structure a team, or which feature to build - may be right or wrong, but the wisdom of probability tells us the cumulative outcome matters. This is why the above two points are crucial: they help us understand whether we succeeded or failed and whether our systems are effectively guiding us toward desired outcomes despite inevitable setbacks. By setting our targets on outcomes rather than individual decisions, we create space for controlled experimentation and learning, allowing our systems to evolve and improve even as they keep us on track.\n\nThese three principles - systems thinking, betting mindset, and outcomes focus - reframe how we should approach planning in software delivery. Rather than creating perfect plans, we need to build systems that can guide us through uncertainty. A plan may tell us where we want to go, but our systems determine whether we\u2019ll get there. This brings us to the crucial question: How do we design systems that can navigate the complexities of large-scale software delivery while managing the inevitable volatility we\u2019ll encounter along the way?\n\nPlan the System\n\nWe can transform software delivery uncertainty into predictable outcomes just as Thorp transformed gambling uncertainty into a calculable advantage. But where Thorp dealt with the relatively constrained world of card probabilities, we face a far more complex challenge. Our deck contains countless variables with hidden interactions and long histories that come together and fall apart in different ways. Team dynamics, technical dependencies, market changes, customer needs, and organizational issues all interact and influence each other in ways that frustrate traditional planning methods. How might we leverage systems of software delivery to control this volatility?\n\nThe key lies in establishing boundaries that control volatility while maintaining the flexibility to adapt. Through years of experience and evolution, I\u2019ve identified five critical elements that work together to create such systems:\n\nAgility - decoupling predictability from causality\n\nContinuous Methods - using continuous methods to solve discrete problems\n\nPrioritization - working on areas with the highest volatility first\n\nConstraints - imposing enabling restrictions and limitations\n\nCulture - promoting healthy values and behaviors\n\nAll of these come together to help us design and execute systems that manage our bets and drive us toward targeted outcomes. Let\u2019s dig into each area.\n\n1. Agility - The first thing we need to do is decouple predictability from causality. We can achieve predictable outcomes without knowing all the details, creating paths that do not create much risk. Where Thorp managed the volatility of his game by adjusting bets according to his card counting system, in software development, we can manage project volatility by working in short cycles and adjusting in light of what our systems of work are telling us. We use these systems to take our \"count\", take it more often, assess our situation, and make small bets that succeed or fail without creating excessive risk. For example, we can reallocate resources to high-priority or high-risk areas as the project evolves or adjust requirements based on our learning. Agile, DevOps, and Lean methodologies form a system that gives us a regular \"read\" of the table, one we use to recalibrate where needed to land inside the range of desired outcomes eventually, which is why they are so effective for us. With this in mind, you don\u2019t need to cargo cult (imitation without understanding) practices into your organization - you can evaluate them in this light.\n\n2. Continuous Methods - The third element is continuous practices. We reduce the risk of our short-term decisions by situating them in systems of overarching engineering practices. This is the domain of Lean, where we convert discrete events into continuous practices so that each bet is placed under the same conditions. TDD, CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, Automated Governance, etc. Just as Thorpe updated his card count with every hand, we run our own operations with every iteration, perhaps with every code commit, ensuring that playing a hand does not change our risk assessment equation. If we allow failing tests, security issues, defects, and the like to build up, we will no longer play our hands under the same conditions. With creative thinking, we can find ways to convert all discrete elements of software delivery into continuous functions in our engineering systems.\n\n3. Prioritization - Next, how can we get an \"unfair\" advantage in our work? By stacking the deck! This is one area where we diverge from the gambler - we get to cheat. We can choose how we structure, scope, and sequence our work to create the least amount of risk for ourselves, prioritizing the work according to where the most volatility lies. For example, integrations always present a high degree of risk, but if we focus on them first, we can continuously integrate subsystem changes throughout the delivery process. This means we get to play the game knowing that the bad cards have already been dealt! Further, prioritization should be implemented as a continuous system, not as a big upfront plan. As we progress through our work, we gain insight into whether the rest of the deck is stacked for or against us and continuously re-evaluate our position. To achieve this, we need to involve the experts closest to the problem in the feedback loops of our work delivery systems. Having a generic, common-sense understanding of how the world works is not enough. We need the representation of technical experts with deep knowledge to guide difficult decisions and develop creative solutions that achieve an optimal balance of risk and reward.\n\n4. Constraints - The fourth element is the role of constraints, as in when and how to apply constraints to achieve better outcomes from the system. This differs from classical/deterministic systems, where the constraints are imposed upon the system from outside (the cost of materials, the laws of physics, etc.), and the system operates against them. In synthetic/non-deterministic systems, constraints are imposed; they are system elements we can experiment with, adding and removing as we evolve to get the right mixture of velocity and quality. We deliberately introduce helpful governing and enabling constraints into the system to contend with volatility. In Blackjack, Thorpe had only a few quantitatively defined boundary conditions to guide his system, but in software organizations, we have a wide variety of these boundaries with which to play. For example, we can introduce technical constraints, scheduling constraints, organizational constraints, resourcing constraints, and more. We can use these to create forces that will shape the direction of our work, implementing them in a wide variety of ways with various degrees of strictness.\n\n5. Culture - Finally, we have the values and behaviors that form our culture. Thorpe\u2019s card-counting system requires commitment, focus, and discipline to succeed. In the same way, we need cultural norms that will shape and guide participants\u2019 behavior in our systems. To compensate for the uncertainty and knowledge gaps from building complex distributed systems, we must promote values like learning, transparency, citizenship, and shared responsibility. And for us, like Thorpe, we need the discipline and commitment to follow the systems we put in place. A key goal is to motivate people to make decisions that are best for the overall system, not for themselves, because it is, in fact, the system that brings people success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe logic of probability is not readily forthcoming - our intuition does not give up on what we know well: a world of cause-and-effect relationships, reproducible and mechanical, in which one thing always leads to another. Touch the stove, and you get burned. The conditioning of classical logic in our daily lives creates a trap when we move into the world of probabilities. We are prone to making incorrect associations and false inferences that betray the underlying statistical relationships.\n\nThe journey from the casino floors of Las Vegas to the server rooms of Silicon Valley may seem a long one, but the underlying principles remain the same. Thorp showed us that by understanding volatility and designing systems to manage it, we can consistently win in a game designed for us to lose. By learning to \"count cards\" in our field - to read the shifting probabilities and adjust our strategies accordingly - we can turn the tables in our favor.\n\nThe key to mastering software development at scale lies not in our ability to predict the future but in our capacity to play with uncertainty. When we embrace the probabilistic nature of our work, we can unlock levels of efficiency and predictability that have eluded us. The question that concerns us is not how to make better plans but how to design systems that beat the plan, thrive, and even capitalize on uncertainty. This mindset shift will be one of the most crucial skills in the fascinating endeavor of large-scale software delivery."

            "article_content": "An electric Volkswagen Golf, a VW \"ID1,\" new EVs for Audi and Porsche, and eventually a high-tech sedan from Project Trinity are all in the cards, courtesy of Volkswagen\u2019s deal with Rivian that will help facilitate future generations of software-defined vehicles for both automakers. Volkswagen and Rivian finalized their joint venture $5.8 billion deal in November.\n\nRivian will share its zonal architecture, providing an electrical platform and software solution that the Volkswagen Group\u2019s Cariad software division has been unable to supply in a timely manner. In the immediate future, the companies will integrate Rivian\u2019s current, but advanced, software and electrical architecture as quickly as possible, while working on full implementation of Rivian\u2019s architecture for future-generation vehicles. Rivian\u2019s zonal architecture has electronic control units performing multiple functions in different zones of the car and they all communicate.\n\nThe joint venture, an independent company called Rivian and VW Group Technology LLC, will provide Rivian\u2019s existing tech to launch the Rivian\u2019s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026, the first vehicle to come from the new venture. On the Volkswagen Group side, Audi and Porsche will have the first products, says Volkswagen volume brand head Thomas Sch\u00e4fer. Timing for the first premium vehicle is the end of 2027 or early 2028. The new joint venture company will develop a scalable architecture for future software defined vehicles from small cars to premium models.\n\nFor the Volkswagen brand, there will be an all-new ID1 fully electric model for Europe in late 2027, says Kai Gr\u00fcnitz, head of global research and development for the Volkswagen brand. B ut the electric subcompact is deemed too small for American tastes. A compact ID2 EV has already been previewed, likely only for Europe, as well.\n\nElectric VW Golf in 2029\n\nThe first software-defined vehicle from the venture to hit U.S. soil will be the electric Golf in 2029, more than a year later than originally planned. It will use the Scalable System Platform (SSP) that replaces MEB and will continue to spawn the ID family of electric vehicles. But it will now rely on Rivian instead of Cariad for some of the vital software. The current eighth-generation Golf got a facelift for the 2025 model year.\n\nOriginally, Project Trinity was to be Volkswagen\u2019s first software defined vehicle, a long-range, fast-charging electric sedan that could be refreshed by updating the software. But Volkswagen decided it wanted to start with the Golf, an iconic and volume vehicle, as the first SDV vehicle for VW in North America, says Sch\u00e4fer. Trinity was not designed to be a volume vehicle; it was more of a tech project to push the envelope.\n\nTrinity is not dead but has been pushed back to at least 2032. It is not a denunciation of Cariad\u2014which has been rife with issues that delayed vehicle launches\u2014but rather a way of accelerating development, Sch\u00e4fer says. Cariad does not go away, the software subsidiary continues to be responsible for the existing electronic architectures: MEB, MQB, and the automaker\u2019s next-generation advanced driver assistance systems and infotainment, all of which must be maintained. Cariad could provide infotainment systems in some parts of the world while Rivian will provide infotainment solutions for North America. The Rivian innovations will help VW continue to offer emotional vehicles with a user experience that connect them to their cars, executives say, much like the way the ID. Buzz makes people smile.\n\nProject Trinity was also to introduce a new way of manufacturing, but the Volkswagen Group decided against building a new factory, which is a good decision in hindsight given current overcapacity in Germany, Sch\u00e4fer says. The new U.S. Scout brand will also use the new jointly-developed VW-Rivian architecture.\n\nLevel 3 Autonomous Driving\n\nVolkswagen is also working with Rivian to get Level 3 driver assistance as part of the e-architecture. Part of the challenge is to figure out which ADAS stack to use as there are several options, including Mobileye which VW uses in its test fleet of ID Buzz robotaxis operating in Austin, Texas. Passenger cars should have Level 3 with no restrictions in the U.S. by the end of the decade, Gr\u00fcnitz says.\n\nSolid State Batteries Not the Promised Silver Bullet\n\nThe automaker also continues to work on solid state batteries. The first samples from subsidiary PowerCo are promising. But Gr\u00fcnitz does not think the technology will be ready until the end of the decade. There are still some challenges to bring down the cost for mass production and to ensure quality components needed for serial production. Solid state batteries are not the silver bullet or final solution, he says. Other solutions are being investigated and there is much room for improvement with battery technology. Like other automakers, Volkswagen is working on different chemistries, technologies, ways of building cells, and cell formats. All have different advantages.\n\nHonda wants to deploy breakthrough solid-state batteries in its next-generation EVs by the end of the decade and has also begun pilot production as it works to make the batteries larger and more durable while improving cost. The goal is about 620 miles of range. Toyota Motor Corp. is planning two versions of solid-state batteries. Toyota\u2019s first will arrive around 2027 to 2028, with a target range of more than 621 miles. Nissan also has a pilot plant with a target of 2028."

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAdvancements in AI have revolutionized many industries, from healthcare and education to finance and entertainment, offering unparalleled efficiency, precision, and the ability to handle complex tasks at a scale previously unimaginable.\n\nOn the positive side, AI can streamline operations, improve decision-making, and even solve pressing global issues like climate change by analyzing large datasets. However, these advancements also come with significant risks. The rapid growth of AI technology has raised concerns about privacy, job displacement, and the potential misuse of AI systems in surveillance and defense.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Push into Defense Raises Concerns Among Employees\n\nOpenAI is teaming up with Anduril Industries to enhance anti-drone systems using its AI technology, as per Bloomberg. This partnership aims to improve the detection and response to unmanned aerial threats. OpenAI is also expanding its role in the defense sector, including collaborations with the U.S. Air Force and hiring former Pentagon officials. The deal reflects the growing U.S.-China competition in military AI development, with Anduril seeing it as vital for addressing global air defense gaps. The partnership also signals increasing AI involvement in defense, following similar moves by other tech companies.\n\nHowever, OpenAI employees have raised concerns about the company\u2019s partnership with Anduril Industries, seeking more transparency from leadership. Internal messages viewed by The Washington Post revealed worries that the AI technology could be used beyond defensive applications against drone attacks, potentially targeting human-piloted aircraft or being deployed for other military purposes. Some employees expressed discomfort with collaborating with a weapons manufacturer, fearing damage to OpenAI\u2019s reputation. Others noted that even defensive uses of AI could contribute to its militarization, drawing parallels to the fictional Skynet system from The Terminator, which was originally designed for defense.\n\nApart from OpenAI, there are several other startups that are working in the military and defense sectors. One of them includes DEFCON AI, a company focused on next-generation modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) for military logistics. The company focuses on creating efficient, reliable systems that help address disruptions in logistics and supply chains, ensuring timely delivery of personnel, equipment, and cargo during critical situations.\n\nIts approach combines AI-driven intelligent agents and advanced modeling to help leaders test and prepare for contested logistics scenarios. In August, DEFCON raised $44 million in seed funding. The round was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Fifth Growth Fund and Red Cell Partners. With its strong leadership team, including retired military officials, the company is set to address the growing need for intelligent military technology in the face of increasing global competition.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

            "article_content": "Today, I\u2019m talking with Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI. Mustafa is a fascinating character in the world of AI \u2014 he\u2019s been in and out of some pivotal companies. He was one of the cofounders of DeepMind, which got acquired by Google in 2014, then became a Google VP for several years before leaving in 2022 to found another AI startup, Inflection.\n\nThen, earlier this year, Inflection cut a deal with Microsoft to license its core technology in a weird and kind of controversial not-quite-acquisition situation, one that sent Mustafa, his cofounder, and a majority of their employees into Microsoft.\n\nAs CEO of Microsoft AI, Mustafa now oversees all of its consumer AI products, including the Copilot app, Bing, and even the Edge browser and MSN \u2014 two core components of the web experience that feel like they\u2019re radically changing in a world of AI. That\u2019s a lot \u2014 and a lot of Decoder bait, since I\u2019m always fascinated by Microsoft\u2019s org chart and all the little CEOs that report to Satya Nadella, and of course, I\u2019m obsessed with what AI might do to the web at large. I also asked Mustafa to compare and contrast working at Microsoft and Google since he has direct experience at both, and his answer was pretty revealing.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nI also wanted to ask Mustafa about AI training and the data it requires. He\u2019s caught some heat for describing content on the web as \u201cfreeware\u201d before, and Microsoft and OpenAI are in the middle of major copyright lawsuits about training data. I\u2019m curious how AI companies are thinking about the risky and seemingly uncertain legal foundations of their work, and I wanted to know how Mustafa was thinking about it now.\n\nBut before we got into all that, I needed to ask about AGI, or artificial general intelligence. That\u2019s the idea that these AI systems will be able to handle tasks as well as a human \u2014 or even better, in some cases. Sam Altman at OpenAI \u2014 which, again, is a huge partner with Microsoft for this stuff \u2014 has said he thinks AGI is achievable on our current computing hardware. In his most recent comments, he seemed to lower the bar for how he defines AGI entirely \u2014 which makes it easier to argue that it will arrive sooner than most think. On top of that, there\u2019s a lot of reporting that says OpenAI can get out of its Microsoft deal when it achieves AGI, so he\u2019s got a lot of incentives to say it\u2019s happening.\n\nI asked Mustafa straight out if he agrees with Altman and if AGI is achievable on current hardware \u2014 because if the answer is yes, then maybe a bunch of org chart questions are a little secondary. You\u2019ll hear him be optimistic but on a much longer timeframe \u2014 and you\u2019ll also hear him pull away from the idea of AGI being a superintelligence, which feels like another kind of redefinition.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot here \u2014 including a discussion of what I\u2019ve started calling the DoorDash problem. You\u2019ll see what I mean.\n\nOkay, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nMustafa Suleyman, you are the CEO of Microsoft AI. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nGreat to be with you.\n\nI\u2019m very excited to talk to you. I have a lot of questions for you about how Microsoft AI is structured within Microsoft, what it means to be the CEO of Microsoft AI (at a company that appears to be all about AI lately), how you make decisions \u2014 all the Decoder stuff. I\u2019m going to start hot out of the gate. I hope you\u2019re ready for this because I realize that if you answer one way, this whole interview goes in a different direction. So, very recently, Sam Altman said in a Reddit AMA that he thinks we can achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) on current hardware. Do you think that\u2019s possible?\n\nWhat does current hardware mean?\n\nWithin one or two generations of what we have now, I would say.\n\nI don\u2019t think it can be done on [Nvidia] GB200s. I do think it is going to be plausible at some point in the next two to five generations. I don\u2019t want to say I think it\u2019s a high probability that it\u2019s two years away, but I think within the next five to seven years since each generation takes 18 to 24 months now. So, five generations could be up to 10 years away depending on how things go. We really are facing increasingly tough challenges with these chips. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as linear in terms of its progress or cost per dollar as we\u2019ve seen in the past. But things are accelerating very fast. So, I agree with that sentiment.\n\nSo, between two and 10 years, you think?\n\nThe uncertainty around this is so high that any categorical declarations just feel sort of ungrounded to me and over the top.\n\nYou and I have spoken several times in the past about a lot of things, and I want to follow up on all of those ideas. It just occurs to me that if we think AGI is between two and 10 years away, very much in the span of our lifetimes, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be working on anything else. That seems like it will be a paradigm shift, right? We\u2019re through the singularity now, there is AGI. Everything will be different on the other end of it. How do you approach that and then also think about, \u201cWell, I need to launch the Copilot app on the iPhone\u201d?\n\nIt depends on your definition of AGI, right? AGI isn\u2019t the singularity. The singularity is an exponentially recursive self-improving system that very rapidly accelerates far beyond anything that might look like human intelligence.\n\nTo me, AGI is a general-purpose learning system that can perform well across all human-level training environments. So, knowledge work, by the way, that includes physical labor. A lot of my skepticism has to do with the progress and the complexity of getting things done in robotics. But yes, I can well imagine that we have a system that can learn \u2014 without a great deal of handcrafted prior prompting \u2014 to perform well in a very wide range of environments. I think that is not necessarily going to be AGI, nor does that lead to the singularity, but it means that most human knowledge work in the next five to 10 years could likely be performed by one of the AI systems that we develop. And I think the reason why I shy away from the language around singularity or artificial superintelligence is because I think they\u2019re very different things.\n\nThe challenge with AGI is that it\u2019s become so dramatized that we sort of end up not focusing on the specific capabilities of what the system can do. And that\u2019s what I care about with respect to building AI companions, getting them to be useful to you as a human, work for you as a human, be on your side, in your corner, and on your team. That\u2019s my motivation and that\u2019s what I have control and influence over to try and create systems that are accountable and useful to humans rather than pursuing the theoretical super intelligence quest.\n\nOne of the reasons I\u2019m particularly curious about this is the notion that all human knowledge work can be performed either with the assistance of a very capable general AI or by the AI itself. It sort of implies that we will build a new kind of AI system, right? One that will be able to be as creative as a human knowledge worker at the 99th percentile. And I don\u2019t see that in our systems now. The way an LLM works, they don\u2019t necessarily come up with a bunch of individually creative thoughts. You can prompt them to do surprising things, but that turning [into something more] \u2014 I have not experienced. Do you think that the way that the current LLMs are built, trained, and deployed is a linear path to the kind of AGI you\u2019re describing, or is there another kind of thing we need to build?\n\nIt\u2019s funny because two or three years ago, people would often say, \u201cWell, these systems are destined to regurgitate the training data that they were trained on.\u201d And that there is some one-to-one mapping between query training data and output. It\u2019s pretty clear today that they\u2019re actually not doing that. The interpolation of the space between multiple N-dimensional elements of their training data is in itself the creative process, right? It\u2019s picking some point in this massively complex space to produce or generate a novel form of the response to the question that it has never seen before. We\u2019ve never seen that specific answer produced in that specific way. To me, that is the beginning of creativity. It\u2019s the kind of glimmer of a truly novel invention, which is obviously what we\u2019re trying to produce here.\n\nIntelligence is the very sort of thing that has driven all of our progress in the world throughout history. It\u2019s the power to synthesize vast amounts of information, aggregate it into conceptual representations that help us reason more efficiently in complex spaces, make predictions about how the world is likely to unfold, and then take action on the basis of those predictions. Whether you are making a table or you are playing baseball with your friend, every single one of those environments that you experience has those characteristics.\n\nSo if we can distill those moments, if you like, into an algorithmic construct, then of course there is huge value there. What I think we see in this mini moment in the last three or four years are the glimmers that they (LLMs) really can be creative, exert real judgment, and produce novel ideas. Your point about whether they can do that proactively is a good one. Like can LLMs do that unprompted? Can they do it independently? Can they do it with very subtle, nuanced, or lightweight guidance? I think that\u2019s kind of an open question. I feel very optimistic about that myself.\n\nMuch of the infrastructure to ensure that LLMs can do that is kind of an engineering issue now. Stateful memory and meta-reasoning about the current context of a model are things that we know how to do in software today. We know how to introduce a second or a third system to observe the working state of an LLM in its activity and use that to steer or re-steer a prompt that it is operating to. And if you can do asynchronous meta-reasoning, which is what the initial \u201cchain of thought\u201d methods seem to show in the last six to 12 months, then you can imagine how it could string together actions in these continuous environments.\n\nIt could then orchestrate and coordinate with other parts of its working memory, other parts of its system \u2014 some of which are designed to do more short-term things, some to draw from long-term memory, some to be a bit more creative, and some to be more adherent to the behavior policy or the safety policy that you\u2019re designing to.\n\nSo, it\u2019s obviously not done and dusted, but there are very, very clear signs that we\u2019re on the right path, I think.\n\nThose orchestration systems are fascinating to me because the models themselves are not deterministic. They\u2019re never going to produce the same output twice. A lot of the things we want computers to do are insanely deterministic. We definitely want them to do the same thing over and over again. In a variety of situations where an AI might be really helpful, like if you want to do tax preparation, you want the AI to be very helpful and understand all the inputs. You also want it to follow the rules 100% of the time.\n\nIt seems like connecting our logical computer systems to control the non-deterministic AI systems is a big pathway here, more so than making the AI more capable. And that feels like a new way of talking about it that I\u2019ve only recently seen. Does that feel like the kinds of products you need to build or are you still focused on the capability of the model itself?\n\nIt\u2019s a good framing, but let\u2019s tease apart what you mean by determinism. So, determinism operates at layers of abstraction. At the very lowest layer, each token is being generated non-deterministically. As those outputs become more recognizable with respect to a behavior policy, a heuristic, or a known objective \u2014 like filling out a tax form \u2014 then that knowledge can be stored in representations that are more stable and deterministic.\n\nAnd this is exactly how humans operate today. No matter how well you might memorize something, if I ask you to do it 100 times over, you\u2019re most likely going to have some variation in the output. We don\u2019t really store things deterministically. We have co-occurring conceptual representations, which are quite fluid and abstract. We then reproduce and fit them into a schema of words and language in order for us to be able to communicate with one another.\n\nThese models are actually very similar to that architecture. They can store stable information that can be retrieved in quite deterministic ways, and like you said, integrate with existing computer systems and knowledge bases. But it\u2019s not true to say that one approach is going to trump another. The models are going to get way more capable, and the methods for retrieval, information access, the use of existing databases, or making function calls to third-party APIs to integrate that information, are going to advance simultaneously.\n\nBy the way, we\u2019re going to open up a third front, which is that these LLMs can speak natural language now. They\u2019re going to be able to go and query other humans and other AIs in real-time. So, that\u2019s like a third paradigm for \u201cretrieving\u201d or verifying that information, accessing new knowledge, or checking state on something. That in itself is going to drive huge gains in addition to straight-up model capabilities and integration with existing systems.\n\nI want to talk about the agent component of that at length because that seems to be where so many companies are focused, including to some extent, Microsoft. It raises a million questions about how our computer systems and our networks should work. We think we\u2019re headed towards AGI between two and 10 years from now, we think we can do it with an increase in model capability, but also some novel approaches to how we use those models.\n\nI want to talk about how you\u2019re actually doing it at Microsoft. It occurred to me from the jump, that if we didn\u2019t agree on what the goals were, the structure conversation would be ungrounded from reality. So, those are the goals. Those are huge goals. At Microsoft AI, how are you structured to accomplish those goals?\n\nThat\u2019s a great tee-up. First and foremost, my organization is focused on the consumer AI part. So, it is about Bing, Edge, MSN, and Copilot \u2014 so consumer-facing products that have hundreds of millions of daily active users, lots of user data, and lots of direct commercial surfaces where we can deploy into production, get feedback, and drive large-scale experimentation. For me, that\u2019s mission-critical, because five years ago, we were in a state with LLMs and AI where we were still relying on the benchmarks to drive progress. Evaluation was taking place in basically academic environments, albeit in commercial engineering labs. The models weren\u2019t good enough to actually put them into production and collect feedback from the real world. That has completely shifted now where all of the innovation is happening by optimization and hill climbing in production. So, I think that\u2019s the first thing to say.\n\nThe second thing to say is that our Azure business and the immense number of customers that we have using M365 Copilot every day provide another huge experimentation framework, which is very different from the consumer experimentation framework. It\u2019s actually a great opportunity for me because I\u2019m learning a lot from how many businesses are integrating true AI agents in their workflow today. Since they have more visibility and control of their internal data, and in many cases, they have tens or even hundreds of thousands of employees, they\u2019re able to introduce novel Copilot into their workflows, be it for training sales agents, up-skilling underperforming sales agents, and providing marketing feedback. I\u2019ve seen HR Copilots, there\u2019s all kinds of customer service Copilots happening. That gives me a sort of window into all the different flavors of testing and pushing the limits of these AI models in third-party production environments in the enterprise context.\n\nThe third arena, of course, is our collaboration with OpenAI, our great partners. I think this is going to turn out to be one of the most successful partnerships in computer history. That partnership is five years old now and has many years to run. We get models from them, we get intellectual property (IP), and they get compute and funding. It\u2019s obviously a huge source of support for us.\n\nAnd then the fourth area is that we\u2019ve just spawned \u2014 since I arrived eight or nine months ago now \u2014 our own core effort to develop these models at scale inside of Microsoft AI. We have some of the best AI researchers and scientists who are pushing the frontier of post-training and pre-training for our weight class. We are choosing a floating point operations per second (FLOPS) match target that really suits the kind of use cases that we care about and making sure we have absolutely world-class frontier models that can do that.\n\nLet me just unpack some of the vocabulary there. You said \u201cweight class.\u201d Does that just mean a giant corporation, or do you mean something more specific by \u201cweight class\u201d?\n\nWeight class is the way that we refer to comparing frontier models with one another. Your FLOPS need to be matched to your competitor model that you\u2019re evaluating yourself against. So, size is really significant. It\u2019s by far the overriding predictor of capability performance in these models. You sort of can\u2019t compare yourself to something that\u2019s 10X larger by FLOPS. You have to treat them as weight classes or FLOPS classes if you like.\n\nThat makes sense to me. And then you said you want to target it towards the applications you\u2019re using, right? So, you\u2019re making many models that are geared toward specific Microsoft products?\n\nThat\u2019s right. So, if you think about it, Copilot under the hood is a whole collection of different models, of different sizes that adapt to different contexts. If you\u2019re in a speech setting, it\u2019s a different type of model. If you\u2019re on a desktop, if you\u2019re actually in the native apps on Mac or on Windows, they\u2019re all slightly different models. And then there are different models for search, reasoning, and safety, and I think that that is going to get even more heterogeneous as we go.\n\nAnd then I just want to be very clear about this. It sounds like you\u2019re developing a frontier model that can compete with Gemini, GPT-4, or GPT-5, whatever it is. Are you working on that as well?\n\nFor the current weight class, yes. So, at the GPT-4, GPT-4o scale. But it depends on how things turn out over the next few years because each order of magnitude increase is a phenomenal piece of physical infrastructure. You\u2019re talking about hundreds of megawatts, and soon gigawatts, of capacity. There will really only be three or four labs in the world that have the resources to be able to train at that scale by the time that we get to 10 to the 27 FLOPS (floating point operations per second) for a single training run. We won\u2019t duplicate that between us and OpenAI. OpenAI is our pre-training frontier model partner for those things, and hopefully, that continues for a long time to come.\n\nSo, you\u2019re not going to compete with the next-generation model\u2019s size, right? You\u2019re going to let OpenAI do that. The reason I ask is because Microsoft runs the data centers, right? That as a partnership is ongoing, but Amazon runs its own data centers and Google runs its own data centers, and it seems like there is just a core tension here regardless of how good the partnership is. It\u2019s between, \u201cWe are going to build these data centers and restart nuclear power plants in the United States to supply power to some of these data centers,\u201d and, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better to sell that to someone else versus build the models ourselves.\u201d Do you feel that tension?\n\nEvery partnership has tension. It\u2019s healthy and natural. I mean, they\u2019re a completely different business to us. They operate independently and partnerships evolve over time. Back in 2019 when [Microsoft CEO] Satya [Nadella] put a billion dollars into OpenAI, I mean it seemed pretty crazy. I didn\u2019t think it was crazy, but I think a lot of people thought it was crazy. Now that has paid off and both companies have massively benefited from the partnership. And so, partnerships evolve and they have to adapt to what works at the time, so we\u2019ll see how that changes over the next few years.\n\nDo you have a backup plan if OpenAI declares AGI and walks away from the Microsoft deal? There\u2019s some credible reporting that\u2019s as if they declare AGI they could walk away from the deal.\n\nNo. Look, it\u2019s very unclear what the definition of AGI is. We have, inside of Microsoft AI, one of the strongest AI research teams in the world. If you look at the pedigree of our crew, my own co-founder, Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, led the deep learning scaling team at DeepMind for eight years and was behind many of the major breakthroughs. Nando de Freitas has just joined us; he previously ran audio/video generation at DeepMind for 10 years. So, we have an exceptional team and we\u2019ll make sure that whatever happens, we\u2019ll be in a position to train the best models in the world.\n\nIt does seem like you have some uncertainty there. You\u2019ve said whatever happens several times now in the context of the OpenAI deal. Does that feel like something that you can rely on over the course of the next two to 10 years? Because that seems like a very important timeframe.\n\nIt definitely does. Look, they\u2019re an exceptional company. They\u2019re on a tear. There aren\u2019t many companies in the world that have grown as fast as they have. During that kind of meteoric rise, things are going to be brittle and some of the bits and pieces are going to fall off occasionally. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the last 12 months. So, that doesn\u2019t really change their trajectory. They\u2019re going to be incredibly successful, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to help them be successful because they\u2019ve helped make us successful. That\u2019s genuinely what\u2019s going on here. Naturally, in any partnership, there are little tensions here and there, but fundamentally we will win together.\n\nI want to come back to the cooperation-competition dynamic there when we actually talk about products, but I want to stay focused on Microsoft AI inside of Microsoft for one more turn. You obviously started Inflection, Microsoft sort of reverse, acqui-hired all of Inflection. They brought over all the people and they issued you all shares. Why do the deal that way? Why join Microsoft and why structure that deal in that way?\n\nSo, I\u2019ve known Satya for a very long time. He\u2019s been sort of trying to get me to come and be part of the Microsoft crew for a while, as far back as 2017 when we first started hanging out. I\u2019ve always been particularly inspired by his leadership, and I think the company is actually in an incredibly strong position: the investments that we\u2019re making in compute, the distribution that we have with so many enterprise partners now deploying M365 Copilot, and what you can learn from that is a real game changer. A lot of people are talking about these actions, right? Clearly, you want your consumer Copilot experience to have these seamless interactions with brands, businesses, opportunities for getting stuff done, buying things, booking, planning, and so on. And so, having that kind of protocol built in-house and available to the consumer side, is super important.\n\nThe thing I realized about where we were at with Pi and Inflection \u2014 we had an unbelievable engagement with Pi, very high-intensity DAO. The average session of voice interaction lasted 33 minutes a day. It was pretty remarkable. But I think the challenge is that the competition is going to invest for years and years, and keep it free, if not reduce it to nothing. Basically make it widely available to hundreds of millions of people. And so, from a consumer perspective, it is a very, very competitive landscape. And look, when Satya made me the offer to come and run all the consumer stuff here, it was just an offer that we couldn\u2019t refuse. It sort of enabled us to pursue our long-term vision of actually creating a true AI companion that has a lasting relationship with hundreds of millions of consumers that is really useful to you. And to me, that\u2019s going to shape the future. That is really the thing that is going to shape our long-term trajectory. So, I couldn\u2019t turn that down.\n\nYou are the CEO of Microsoft AI. Microsoft is an interesting company in that it has a CEO and then several other CEOs. Phil Spencer is the CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Ryan Roslansky is the CEO of LinkedIn. We just had Thomas Dohmke from GitHub on, he\u2019s the CEO of GitHub. What does it mean to you to be the CEO of Microsoft AI?\n\nMicrosoft is an enormous organization, with a quarter of a trillion dollars in revenue, and about 280,000 employees. The logic of making single individuals accountable for our own P&L is very rational. There are about 10,000 or so people in my org. We have full integration from training the models, building the infrastructure, running the ads platform, managing all the sales leaders, making sure that our content is high quality, and getting that integrated across four platforms. So, it just creates accountability. That\u2019s the logic here, and that\u2019s very much how Satya runs it. Extreme accountability.\n\nOne thing that strikes me here is that GitHub is a product. LinkedIn is a product, as a beginning and an end, it\u2019s very tangible. People can understand it.\n\nMicrosoft AI is the company. There\u2019s just a lot of AI at Microsoft that is infusing into all of these products. I think Satya has agreed that AI feels like a platform change. There\u2019s enormous opportunity inside of a platform change. You\u2019ve obviously got your core products in Bing and Edge and MSN and all that, but when you think about the relationship to the rest of the AI efforts at Microsoft, where does the line begin and end for you?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. Right now, the company is so focused on winning on Azure. OpenAI, for example. Getting our models into production and getting them into the hands of hundreds of thousands or millions of businesses. I\u2019m involved in a lot of the reviews on the enterprise side but also play a role as an advisor and support. Our Microsoft AI (MAI) internal models haven\u2019t really been focused on those enterprise use cases. My logic is that we have to create something that works extremely well for the consumer and really optimize for our use case. So, we have vast amounts of very predictive and very useful data on the ad side, on consumer telemetry, and so on. My focus is on building models that really work for the consumer companion.\n\nThat\u2019s a product-focused structure it sounds like. Have you reorganized Microsoft AI to be a more product-driven team?\n\nI think the business was focused on the product before. What we\u2019ve done is bring the kind of AI sensibility into the heart of each one of our products. We have a lot of rankings. We have increasingly conversational and interactive surfaces. We\u2019re trying to bring the voice of Copilot to Bing and MSN. We want to make it a core part of the search experience so that your first thought is: let me just ask my AI. \u201cWhat does my AI think about that?\u201d and \u201cMy AI can remember that for me, save it, and organize it.\u201d And so, making sure that it shows up in deeply integrated ways that really support the surface, rather than an adjacent add-on or an afterthought. That\u2019s the craft that we\u2019re kind of working towards.\n\nYou are a unique person to have on the show because you also co-founded DeepMind and you worked at Google. We\u2019ve had Demis, the CEO of DeepMind on the show before. Google is a challenging place to work at. He is a CEO of Google DeepMind. Google doesn\u2019t have CEOs the way that Microsoft has CEOs.\n\nCan you compare and contrast these two companies? You worked at one huge company, you were at a startup for a minute. Now you work at another huge company. They are very different culturally and structurally. Do you think Microsoft has advantages over Google\u2019s approach?\n\nI do. I think that at Microsoft there is a lot of discipline around revenue and P&L. I think that is a very healthy attitude because it really focuses the mind on what a consumer is going to find truly valuable and be prepared to pay for. Second, there\u2019s long-term thinking about \u201cWhere does this platform shift take us and what does the five to 10-year horizon look like?\u201d So, there\u2019s a kind of planning attitude, which, during my time at Google, felt more instinctive. I mean, their instincts are really good. It\u2019s an incredibly creative company and many times they\u2019ve made long-term bets, but they were kind of instinctively reactive. Whereas I think there\u2019s a lot more thought in the scenario planning and thorough deliberation [at Microsoft]. Then the third thing I guess I would say is that Friday\u2019s senior leadership team meeting with Satya is a phenomenal experience. It runs from 8:30AM until 2:30PM PT in the office in Redmond, and everyone\u2019s there, all the leaders.\n\nWe review all the big businesses or all the big strategic initiatives in detail, and the senior leadership team is cross-functionally in the weeds. And that is pretty remarkable because they\u2019re sort of reviewing these things week after week, like security \u2014 huge priority, genuinely like a number one focus for the company \u2014 AI, and infrastructure. Then reviewing all of the businesses. It\u2019s very cool to see that other leaders ask the questions and I kind of see the world through their eyes, which is slightly different. So, although there are lots of CEOs, everyone\u2019s looking at everyone else\u2019s businesses and giving advice and feedback. It\u2019s quite an intellectually diverse group.\n\nAnd then the other thing I would say is that because there\u2019s obviously an enterprise-style DNA to the company, there\u2019s a real focus on, \u201cwhat does the customer want?\u201d But Google is like, \u201cWhat would be a cool technology for us to build?\u201d Whereas Microsoft\u2019s like, \u201cHow would this actually help the customer and what are they asking for?\u201d And I think both of those strategies have their own benefits, but if you swing one way or the other to an extreme, there are real problems. And so, I\u2019ve certainly enjoyed learning from the fact that Microsoft is very much like, \u201cWhat does the consumer want?\u201d and \u201cWhat does the customer need?\u201d\n\nYou mentioned security at Microsoft. The renewed focus on security is because there were a bunch of lapses earlier this year, right? This has been an issue. You have an outsider perspective; you\u2019re building a lot of products that might go out into the world and do things for people. You\u2019re building a lot of products that require a lot of customer data to be maximally useful. As you go into these meetings and you talk about Microsoft\u2019s renewed effort on security because there were some problems in the past, how has that affected your approach to building these products?\n\nI definitely think that the company culture is security-first and \u2014\n\nBut that\u2019s now, I just want to be very clear to the audience. Satya has started saying that now, but it\u2019s because there were these enormous security lapses in the past year.\n\nThat\u2019s true. That is very true. I\u2019m just saying since I\u2019ve started there, I sit in a weekly security meeting where literally all the heads of the companies and various different divisions are singularly focused on what we can do and it is the number one priority. There\u2019s nothing that can override that. No customer demand, no amount of revenue. It is the first thing that everybody asks. So, culturally, as far as I\u2019ve known, it is the central priority, which has been good for me too. I mean, for my businesses it is also mission-critical that we preserve consumer trust and trust means that people expect us to be able to store, manage, and use their data in ways that singularly benefit them and are in their interests. I do think that that is a central part of the culture. And you\u2019re right, maybe that\u2019s a refocusing of late, but it certainly is the case now.\n\nYou also mentioned you have P&Ls as CEOs. I sort of understand how LinkedIn has a P&L, right? They have a product, they have some engineers, they make some money, and people pay for Premium. Microsoft AI, feels like a lot of losses and not so many profits. How are you thinking about balancing that out?\n\nOh, we\u2019re very profitable. We are very profitable!\n\nWell, I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s a lot of investment in AI. That stuff hasn\u2019t paid off yet.\n\nThat\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. The AI stuff hasn\u2019t paid off yet. I think it\u2019s fair to say. But remember, I spend over half my time focused on the Bing business, and the Bing business is doing incredibly well. I mean, we grew 18% last quarter and we actually took gains from Google, which means we are growing faster than Google, and that makes everybody feel happy. And that\u2019s kind of the main goal. So, the product is deeply integrated AI. There are generative search results in the context of your search experience. There are increasing conversational experiences there. The general quality that we\u2019ve been able to level up with LLMs has been very impressive, and I think that\u2019s translating into revenue improvements as well.\n\nSo, in that sense, AI itself is actually in production across the company. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re just waiting for chatbots to suddenly and miraculously generate a new business model. LLMs are being used at all sizes across the existing business for all kinds of things, like even in Edge, for example, for transcription and summarization built into the browser. There are so many different ways that AI is showing up. You\u2019ve got to think of it more as a new high bar in terms of the table stakes of the features that we offer.\n\nThe part where the LLMs are integrated into a bunch of products like Bing or Edge, are they driving more revenue from those products or are they just taking share away from Google?\n\nSo, the way I think about it is that it\u2019s improving the quality of ads that we show, improving the relevance of those ads, and so it\u2019s making the experience more useful for the consumer. And that is\u2026 I mean, obviously, the overall pie is growing, and that\u2019s the nature of the growth. Obviously, Google\u2019s growing too, so the entire market is continuing to grow. The point is that we\u2019re growing faster than Google for this quarter, and I think that\u2019s a huge achievement. The team\u2019s done an amazing job and it\u2019s not about me by the way. That\u2019s a product of many years of them investing in quality and relevance and just generally doing a great job.\n\nFamously, when Bing with Copilot was introduced and I sat down with Satya, he said, \u201cI want to make Google dance.\u201d And then I went and asked [Google CEO] Sundar [Pichai] about that. He said, \u201cHe just gave you that quote so that people would run that quote.\u201d And that was kind of his response. Sundar is very calm in that way. You came into it after that whole situation and now you run the products that are directly competitive with Google. Do you think that you are\u2026 you know, you\u2019re growing faster than Google in some places. Do you think that you are actually posing a competitive threat to Google in either Bing with Search or Edge with Chrome?\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019ve realized as I\u2019ve become a bit more experienced and mature over the years is that you have to be very humble about how the landscape changes. I mean, on the one hand, this is an opportunity to relitigate some of the battles of the past. The chips are going to fall into a completely different configuration in the next two or three years. At the same time, that\u2019s a very challenging thing to do. Habits die hard and so on. But our goal with this completely new interface is to make it 10 times easier for people to access information, advice, and support in a truly conversational way, and to do things that our competitors won\u2019t do \u2014 things that are truly useful to everyday consumers. And I think that\u2019s actually going to be one of the differentiators. It\u2019s like what is the personality, the tone, and the emotional intelligence of an AI companion?\n\nRemember, most people do love information and they like getting accurate and reliable information, but that\u2019s going to be commoditized. All of these models are going to have that. And despite what we like to think in Silicon Valley, surrounded as we are by nerds and information obsessives who read all the content that you can get access to, most people really connect to brands and really connect to ideas in a social way. They connect to it because it is sort of friendly, kind, supportive, and emotionally reassuring, and I think that\u2019s going to form a big part of the way these models actually turn out to be successful in a few year\u2019s time.\n\nI need to ask you the core Decoder question, but then I want to come back to the idea that the information will be commoditized. You\u2019ve described a lot of change. You were at one company, you were at a startup, you\u2019re at Microsoft, you\u2019re learning how Microsoft works. You have big decisions to make about how to deploy these products. What is your framework for making decisions? How do you make them?\n\nThe way that I like to operate is in a six-week rhythm. So, I have a six-week cycle, and then we have a one-week meetup for reflection, retrospectives, planning, brainstorming, and being in person. The reality post-COVID is that people work from all kinds of places and they like that flexibility. So, my rhythm is to keep people in person two to three days a week and then really come together for that seventh week of retrospectives. My general framework is to try to be as in the weeds as possible. Okay? Really spend a lot of time in our tools, tracking telemetry, hearing feedback from people, and then creating this very tight operating rhythm where in the context of a cycle, six to seven-week process, we have a very falsifiable mission. Every single team can express in a sentence exactly what it is they\u2019re going to deliver, and it\u2019ll be very falsifiable at the end of that, so we\u2019ll know.\n\nAnd then when we observe whether or not that happened, that\u2019s a moment for retrospective and reflection. I really like to write. I\u2019m a writer, I think by writing, and I like to broadcast my writing. So, every week, I write a newsletter to the team that is just like a reflection on what I\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019ve learned, what\u2019s changing, what\u2019s important, and then I document that over time and use that to track and steer where we are going. That\u2019s kind of the basics of how I practically implement my process for reflection and stuff like that. But in terms of the framework, one thing is to really tune in to the fact that no matter what product you invent, no matter how clever your business model is, we are all surfing these exponential waves. And the goal is to predict which capabilities fall out of the next large training model.\n\nIf you overthink that and assume that there\u2019s some genius new ecosystem incentive, new business model, or new UI style, all that is super important. But if you think that it\u2019s only going to be that or that it\u2019s going to be the overwhelming driver, I think that\u2019s a mistake. Maybe this comes from my 15 years of experience in trying to build these models. Remember at DeepMind, 2014 to 2020, I was banging my head against the table trying to ship machine learning models, ship convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the early days, find classifiers, do re-ranking, try to predict what to watch next on YouTube, trying to do activity classification on your wearables, trying to crash detection algorithms inside of Waymo. Every single applied practical machine learning objective, I explored there. And now, we have the tools to be able to do those things and do them really, really well. They\u2019re really working.\n\nSo, we are basically surfing those tides. The goal is to really nail those waves because we already have models that are giving us more than we can extract and apply into products. That\u2019s quite a profound state that we\u2019re in. We haven\u2019t completely extracted all the gains from the current class of frontier language models. Every week, there\u2019s still some new capability, some new trick, or people have crafted or sculpted them in post-training in a new way. And I think that that is going to continue for the next few years to come, many years to come, in fact. So, in terms of the decision-making framework, the goal is to be very focused on model development and scaling those models, getting them to be practical and useful, really aligning them, and getting them to behave in the way that you need for your product.\n\nLet me ask you about that because model development\u2026 and we need to get more of the models we have now. There\u2019s a little bit of tension there. There\u2019s a notion that the scaling laws are going to run out, that the next class of models is not significantly outperforming the models we have now, and I think you can track that in just the way we\u2019re talking about the products.\n\nA couple of years ago, it was, \u201cAI\u2019s an existential risk, we have to stop it so we can make sure it\u2019s aligned before we kill everyone.\u201d And now, we\u2019re kind of like, \u201cWell, we got to get more out of the models we have now. Actually ship some products, make some money, hopefully, and figure out what it\u2019s all good for and how to best use it because it doesn\u2019t seem like the next generation of models are actually running away as fast as we think they might.\u201d Is that your view that the frontier models are not getting better as fast as we thought they might and so we have to get more out of what we have?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think that they\u2019re going to continue to deliver the same seismic gains that we\u2019ve seen in the previous generations. Remember that they\u2019re more costly and more fragile, and they\u2019ll take longer to train this time around. So, we\u2019re not going to see them happen in the same sort of 12 to 18-month timeframe. It\u2019s going to shift to 18 to 24 months and then a bit longer. But I don\u2019t see any sign that there\u2019s a structural slowdown. I kind of see the opposite. There are huge gains to extract from where we are today, but it\u2019s very clear to me that there are also huge gains to extract from the next two orders of magnitude of training as well.\n\nI want to make sure we talk about the thing you mentioned, the commodification of information, and then I definitely want to make sure we talk about agents real quick to bring this all around to the products to come. The commodification of information is, I think, the big story of the internet that we have today, the platform internet, for lack of a better word. You go to Google, you ask it a question, and now it might spit out an AI-generated answer. You go to MSN, you ask it for the news, and it might algorithmically or with AI sort a bunch of news and summarize that news for you.\n\nEveryone\u2019s headed in this way. We\u2019ve been talking about this for a long time. To train the next-generation models, we need even more information. You\u2019ve gotten yourself into some trouble, I would say, saying that the information on the internet is \u201cfreeware,\u201d and the expectations that you can use it to train. There are a lot of lawsuits, including several pointed at Microsoft. Where do you think that next body of information comes from before we sort out the copyright implications of using all this stuff to train?\n\nOne way of thinking about it is that the more computation you have, the more time these models can spend attending to the various relational components of all that training data. Think of FLOPS as a way to spend understanding time, learning the relationship between all these various training inputs. So, first of all, you can still gain more from just having more computation to learn over all the existing data. The second thing is that we learn a vast amount from interaction data. Users tell us implicitly and explicitly how they feel about an output. Is it high quality? Is it used? Is it ignored? Third, we\u2019re generating vast amounts of synthetic data. That synthetic data is increasingly high quality. When you ask an AI teacher or a rater to compare two or three different examples of the synthetically generated output and the human written output, it\u2019s extremely difficult to detect those precise nuances.\n\nSo, the synthetic data is increasingly high quality and used in a whole bunch of different settings. Fourth, I can imagine AIs talking to other AIs, asking for feedback \u2014 AIs that have been primed for different areas of expertise or different styles and prompted in different ways. You can imagine those interactions producing valuable new knowledge, either because they\u2019re grounded in different sources or just because of their stylistic output, they\u2019re producing novel interactions. So, I don\u2019t necessarily see data being the limitation anytime soon. I think that there are still huge benefits to come from scale for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo, that\u2019s all new data, right? You\u2019re going to get a bunch of interaction data. Maybe the synthetic data will be a high enough quality to train the next generation models, but the original data sets were the web. It was a bunch of web content. It was the entire internet, maybe it was to video platforms to some extent from some of the model providers.\n\nThe quote I have from you in June, I think you were speaking to Andrew Ross Sorkin. Here\u2019s a quote, you said, \u201cI think that with respect to content that\u2019s already on the open web, the social contract of that content since the 90s is that it\u2019s fair use, anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has been \u2018freeware,\u2019 if you like, that\u2019s been the understanding.\u201d I\u2019m curious\u2026 You said that. That was the understanding for search and there was a lot of litigation around search, Google Image Search, and Google Books that led there. Do you think that that is still stable enough for you in the age of AI with all of the lawsuits outstanding?\n\nWhat I was describing in that setting was the way that the world had perceived things up to that point. My take is that just as anyone can read the news and content on the web to increase their knowledge under fair use, so can an AI, because an AI is basically a tool that will help humans to learn from publicly available material. All the material that has been used for generating or training our models has been scraped from publicly available material. Where we \u2014\n\nBut publicly available and copyrighted are very different things on the internet, right? Publicly available does not mean free of copyright restrictions.\n\nOh, yeah. I mean, look, obviously, we respect the content providers, so that\u2019s an important distinction. But I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that from our perspective, there are certain types of content, for example, in our Copilot Daily or MSN Daily that are paywall publisher content that we pay for directly. And what MSN has been doing since the beginning of time. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve decided to do with Copilot Daily for high-quality content because we want those publishers to create an information ecosystem that really works for everybody. And I just think this is one of those situations where things will play themselves out in the courts. At any time when there\u2019s a new piece of technology, it changes the social contract as it is at the moment. There\u2019s clearly a gray area in terms of what constitutes fair use and whether an AI can have the same fair use as a human, and we will just have to play it out over the next few years. I think we\u2019ll have some perspective over that in the next few years as things land.\n\nOne of the reasons that I ask that \u2014 as directly as I\u2019m asking it \u2014 is the cost of training the next generation models is very, very high. But that cost is built on a foundation of, well, the training data is free, and if a couple of court decisions go a couple of ways, the cost of the training data might skyrocket, right? If a court says it\u2019s not fair use to use the New York Times\u2019 content, or it\u2019s not fair use to use these books from these authors. Suddenly you may have to pay a lot of money for that data as well. Do you think that that is something \u2014\n\nWe already pay for books on a huge scale. So, if it is a copyrighted book, we\u2019re not hoovering that up from the internet. Copyright books and licensed \u2014\n\nWell, Microsoft might not be, but there\u2019s a very big lawsuit from a bunch of publishers who say that, for example, OpenAI is, right? And that\u2019s the model that you are reliant on. So, it just seems like there\u2019s a... Maybe legally we\u2019ll see what the answer is, but economically, there\u2019s also a lot of uncertainty here because of the cost of the underlying data.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s true. And I think our focus has been to make sure that we pay for the really high-quality copyrighted material from publishers \u2014 news publishers, book publishers, and others, and I think that\u2019s going to continue. That\u2019s definitely what we\u2019re committed to.\n\nWho decides what\u2019s high quality?\n\nThat\u2019s actually an interesting question. Quality is actually something that we can measure. We want to make sure that the content, especially from a non-fiction perspective, so we\u2019re particularly interested in academic journals and academic textbooks\u2026 We can verify the source and citations for that knowledge, and that is one of the big measures that we consider to be high quality.\n\nBut the visual artists, the non-fiction artists, visual effects artists, the movie industry, they\u2019re saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to get pushed out of work because we are not compensated for any of the work that\u2019s going into these models.\u201d How do you think this plays out for that? Because again, I agree that the law here is deeply uncertain, these cases are going to play out, but I\u2019m looking back at what you\u2019re describing as the social contract of the web. And what I see is, \u201cOh, Google litigated a million of these lawsuits.\u201d That social contract was not... We didn\u2019t just all wake up one day and decide this is how it\u2019s going to work. Google went to court 15 times and they were a bunch of kids who had slides in the office and they had just made Google. They were very positioned as a company in a moment, and they had a product that was so obviously useful in so many different ways that they kind of got away with it.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know that the tech industry is in that position anymore. I don\u2019t know that the products are so obviously useful the way that putting Google on the internet for the first time ever was so obviously useful, and I certainly don\u2019t know that the feelings from particularly one set of creators are as mixed or too positive as they were for Google back in the 90s and early 2000s. And that to me feels like you\u2019re on the board of The Economist. That to me feels like the people that make the work are having the most mixed emotions of all. Because yes, I think a lot of us can see the value of the products, but we also see the value transfer to the big tech companies, not the upstarts, not the cute kids with the slides in the office.\n\nI think that this is going to be more useful and valuable than search. I think search is completely broken, and I think it\u2019s a total pain in the butt, and we\u2019ve just kind of become used to using a terrible experience. Typing a query... Just think about what a query is. We had to invent the word \u201cquery\u201d to describe this really weird, restricted way that you express a sentence or a question into a search engine because of the weakness of the search engine. And then you get 10 blue links, and then those things are vaguely related to what you\u2019re looking for. You click on one and then you have to go and refine your query. I mean, it is a painful and slow experience.\n\nI think that if we can get this right, if we can really reduce hallucinations to de minimis amount\u2026 I think we\u2019ve already demonstrated that they don\u2019t have to be toxic, biased, offensive, and all the rest of it. It\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s getting much much better, and I think it\u2019s only going to get better with more stylistic control. Then these conversational interactions are going to become the future of the web. It\u2019s quite simple. This is the next browser; this is the next search engine.\n\nIt is going to be 100 times easier for me to just turn, by voice, to my Copilot and say, \u201cHey, Copilot, what\u2019s the answer to this?\u201d I already do it five times a day. It is my go-to. It\u2019s my bottom right-hand app on my iPhone. My thumb instantly goes to it. I use the power button to open it. My favorite app, like I did with Pi. I mean, it is clearly the future, that conversation interaction. So, to me, the utility is phenomenal, and I think that is going to weigh into the cases as they make their way through the court.\n\nSo, that leads us, I think, directly to agents, where you are going to ask some app on your phone or some part of the operating system on your computer to do something and it will go off and do it. It will bring you the information back or it\u2019ll accomplish some task on your behalf and bring you the result. You and I have talked about this before in various ways. That commodifies a lot of the service providers themselves, right? You say, \u201cI want a sandwich,\u201d and now I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s DoorDash, Uber Eats, Seamless, or whoever is going to bring me the sandwich. My AI is going to go out and talk to them. That implies that they will allow that to happen \u2014 they will allow the agents to use their services.\n\nIn the best case, they would provide APIs for you to do it. In the worst case, they let people click around on their websites, which is a thing that we\u2019ve seen other companies do. And sort of in the medium case, they develop some sort of AI-to-AI conversation. Not quite an API, not quite we\u2019re just literally clicking around on a website and pretending to be human, but our AIs are going to have some conversation. What is the incentive for those companies to build all of those systems or allow that to happen to become disintermediated in that way?\n\nI mean, people often ask when there\u2019s a new technological or scientific revolution and it\u2019s causing a massive amount of disruption, and people are curious. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, why would someone do that in 10 years?\u201d And then if you look back for centuries, it\u2019s always the case that if it is useful, it gets cheaper and easier to use. It proliferates; it becomes the default. And then the next revolution comes along and completely turns everything on its head. My bet is that every browser, search engine, and app is going to get represented by some kind of conversational interface, some kind of generative interface. The UI that you experience is going to be automagically produced by an LLM in three or five years, and that is going to be the default. And they\u2019ll be representing the brands, businesses, influencers, celebrities, academics, activists, and organizations, just as each one of those stakeholders in society ended up getting a podcast, getting a website, writing a blog, maybe building an app, or using the telephone back in the day.\n\nThe technological revolution produces a new interface, which completely shuffles the way that things are distributed. And some organizations adapt really fast and they jump on board and it kind of transforms their businesses and their organizations, and some don\u2019t. There will be an adjustment. We\u2019ll look back by 2030 and be like, \u201cOh, that really was the kind of moment when there was this true inflection point because these conversational AIs really are the primary way that we have these interactions.\u201d And so, you\u2019re absolutely right. A brand and a business are going to use that AI to talk to your personal companion AI because I don\u2019t really like doing that kind of shopping. And some people do, and they\u2019ll do that kind of direct-to-consumer browsing experience. Many people don\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s actually super frustrating, hard, and slow.\n\nAnd so, increasingly you\u2019ll come to work with your personal AI companion to go and be that interface, to go and negotiate, find great opportunities, and adapt them to your specific context. That\u2019ll just be a much more efficient protocol because AIs can talk to AIs in super real-time. And by the way, let\u2019s not fool ourselves. We already have this on the open web today. We have behind-the-scenes, real-time negotiation between buyers and sellers of ad space, or between search ranking algorithms. So, there\u2019s already that kind of marketplace of AIs. It\u2019s just not explicitly manifested in language. It\u2019s operating in vector space.\n\nWell, that\u2019s the part I\u2019m really curious about. The idea that natural language is the paradigm shift. I think it\u2019s very powerful. I don\u2019t think it has been expressed very clearly, but the notion that actually the next form of computing is inherently based in natural language, that I\u2019m just going to talk to the computer and it\u2019s going to go off and do some stuff because it understands me, is very powerful. I buy it.\n\nHow that actually plays out on the back end is the part that, to me, still feels up in the air, right? I\u2019m going to ask for a sandwich, that necessitates there to be companies that are in the business of bringing me a sandwich, and how they talk to my AI and how they stay in business seems very challenging. Right now, those companies, they\u2019re in business because they can sell ad space on my phone to the other companies that actually make the sandwiches. They have upsells. There are a million different ways that these companies make money. If they abstract themselves down to their AI talks to my AI and says, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s a sandwich,\u201d and I take away all of their other revenue opportunities, I\u2019m not sure that that ecosystem can stay relevant or even alive.\n\nI\u2019m not sure about that. I mean, your sandwich-making AI is still going to want to sell itself, be persuasive, be entertaining, and produce content for the consumer, right? It\u2019s not that it kind of completely disintermediates and disconnects. Brand and display advertising is still super relevant, and there will be ways that that sandwich-making AI shows up in the context of your personal AI context in (maybe) a sponsored way too. So, there\u2019ll still be that core framework of keyword bidding, paying for presence, and paying for awareness. There\u2019s still going to be ranking \u2014 that is still going to be relevant to some extent. It\u2019s just that you are going to be represented by a personal AI companion that is going to be that interlocutor or negotiator, and those two AIs are going to have an exchange in natural language, which is what we would want. We\u2019d want to be able to go back and audit that negotiation and check where the error came from, see if it really was a good price in hindsight and all the rest of it.\n\nAs you start to build these products in Copilot, have you had these negotiations with these other providers? Have they started to say what they would want?\n\nWe\u2019ve talked; I wouldn\u2019t describe them as negotiations. I mean, I think lots of brands and businesses are building their own AIs. Today, they\u2019re characterized as customer support AIs that pop up on your website. But tomorrow, in two or three years\u2019 time, they\u2019re going to be fully animated, conversational rich, clever, smart, digital Copilots that live in social media. They\u2019re going to appear on TikTok. They\u2019re going to be part of the cultural space. So I think that there\u2019s not so much negotiation to happen there. I think it\u2019s just this inevitable tide of the arrival of these Copilot agents.\n\nYou run MSN, you obviously have peers at Microsoft who run other kinds of social networks, and other kinds of information products. I see a flood of AI slop choking out some of these networks. I\u2019ve searched Facebook for Spaghetti Jesus and I have seen the other side of the singularity, my friend. We already had one conversation about determining high quality, and the answer is sort of, \u201cI know it when I see it.\u201d But if you run these networks and you\u2019re faced with a bunch of agent AIs who are talking or AI influencers on TikTok, can you label that stuff effectively? Can you make it so that users can only see things from other people?\n\nYou certainly can. It would require a shift in the identity management system of the platform, which has a lot of pros and cons. You can certainly tell which accounts come from a human and which are AI-generated. To some extent, I think there can be digital watermarking and signing for verified human content or verified AI content from a specific source. And then to some extent, there can be detection of synthetically generated content, because that does have a specific signature. Long term, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a defense. I think it is going to be perfectly photorealistic, very high quality, and it is going to be a game of cat-and-mouse just as it has been in security, privacy, and information for decades and centuries actually. So, I expect that to continue. It is going to get harder and more nuanced, but this is the natural trajectory of things.\n\nDo the people who run LinkedIn or do your folks at MSN say, \u201cThis is a problem that we can\u2019t stop\u201d? We need to make sure we don\u2019t have too much AI content here because right now it\u2019s not good enough. I can see it a mile away. I see those bullet points. I think someone made this with ChatGPT. I don\u2019t even want to read it. Is that a problem that you\u2019re facing right now, or is it a problem to come?\n\nI think it\u2019s a problem to come, but the thing I would say is we humans are behaviorists, right? We observe the output of other humans and we evaluate and decipher trust, based on the quality of information with respect to our own assessment. Is it accurate? Is it reliable? Is that person consistently doing what they said they would do? And so we can observe their actions. Rather than sort of introspecting, why did this happen? Why did this neural network generate this output? Why did this person come to this conclusion? And that\u2019s actually an important distinction because I think a lot of purists are kind of fixated on the causal explanation for why an output has been produced rather than the more observational assessment of, \u201cWas it useful? Does it do the same thing over and over again?\u201d That\u2019s what drives trust.\n\nI do think poor-quality content will be detectable in that sense, or AI content that is deliberately misrepresentative or misinforming will be detectable because I think we\u2019ll have better models. We are getting them all the time for ranking down and deprioritizing certain types of content.\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot throughout this conversation\u2026 You\u2019re in charge of Microsoft\u2019s consumer business. Microsoft\u2019s consumer business, I think famously right now in 2024, is built around not making the iPhone, right? That\u2019s the thing that Microsoft famously missed in consumer. It has nothing to do with you, but the iPhone happened.\n\nMicrosoft pivoted to being an enterprise business, and it\u2019s not slowly coming back because I think the company rightfully sees a platform shift, a paradigm shift, in computing. Apple still exists, and the iPhone still exists. You said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this icon on my iPhone, it made it onto the home screen and it\u2019s in this preferred position,\u201d the position everybody wants in the bottom corner. Apple has a pretty big distribution advantage here. They have a deal with OpenAI to use ChatGPT. Can you make products so good that you overcome the iPhone\u2019s distribution advantage? That they\u2019re bundling into the operating system?\n\nIt is a great question. I mean, distribution and defaults really matter. And so, from our perspective, obviously we\u2019re focused on distribution deals, but fundamentally we are also focused on building something that\u2019s truly differentiated. To me, that AI companion really is going to be differentiated. The tone and the style of that interaction matter. The fact that it will be able to remember you and what you\u2019ve said over time, it will reach out at that opportune moment just before a difficult moment in your life when you\u2019re starting a new job or your kid is having their birthday party, or something \u2014 you\u2019re in a moment where having your companion reach out and be supportive is a differentiator. And that\u2019s how a lot of people make their decisions, and it\u2019s how a lot of people seek support.\n\nSo I think that\u2019s a really big opportunity to spread a good vibe and spread kindness. And I think most apps and most product thinking in Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t really engage with that kind of emotional plane in the way that the advertising industry in New York just thinks of that as second nature, for example. I think that\u2019s a big shift that we\u2019re making as an industry and it\u2019s certainly one of the areas that we are going to be focused on in Copilot. We have to build something that is really beautiful and differentiated. It is going to be a real challenge. It\u2019s not easy.\n\nDo you think this is an opportunity to build consumer hardware again? Not a phone, but whatever comes after the phone?\n\nI am open-minded about that. I think that the voice-first experiences are going to be transformational and they do represent a new platform. I think we\u2019re increasingly tired of our screens. I\u2019m frankly sick of looking at a grid of multicolored icons on my iPhone. I think many people are. You sort of feel trapped down this structured, fixed unit of tapping these things. And I don\u2019t know, I think people are looking for more opportunities to go hands-free and to be away from keyboards and screens, and leave your phone at home. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. I\u2019m very, very interested in that space.\n\nHave you played with the products that are out now? Humane\u2019s? The Rabbit\u2019s?\n\nI have. I played with all of them, yeah. And I\u2019ve actually just come back from an extended trip to China where I visited all the big manufacturing companies, and got to know those guys. Very impressive what they\u2019re doing out there, moving at light speeds. Very, very interesting to see.\n\nShould we expect hardware from you?\n\nNot anytime soon, but I think we are a huge company. We\u2019re keeping an open mind about lots of things and we will see how things go.\n\nVery good. Well, Mustafa, we\u2019re going to have to have you back very soon. I have a million questions here I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask you. This was great. Thank you so much for being on the show.\n\nThis has been a lot of fun. Thanks, Nilay. I really appreciate it. Talk to you soon."

            "article_content": "The economy in rural America starts and stops with the American farmer.\n\nAmid the deafening noise inside political echo chambers and ceaseless squabbling of Congress is one truth that we cannot ignore- we are a nation united in reliance on our farmers.\n\nWithout the American farmer, there is no adequate tax base for our school systems, local municipalities, or any services that rural Americans need to live and prosper in this country.\n\nEverybody eats, and we all need the food and fiber that our farmers produce to live. No one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of food, just like no one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of energy. Right now, our farmers need our help.\n\nHurricane Helene caused a devastating blow to Georgia's No. 1 industry, with over $6.4 billion in agricultural economic loss alone.\n\nIf we fail to provide agriculture-specific appropriations to help our farmers before the end of the year, we will see widespread, lasting economic loss across all of rural southeast America, especially in Georgia.\n\nAs I traveled across Georgia's 8th Congressional District in the immediate aftermath of Helene, I saw the devastation to our farms firsthand. From hundreds of demolished poultry houses and cotton fields in Coffee County to decimated pecan orchards in Berrien and Lowndes counties and vegetable rows and fruit bushes in ruins across Clinch County, it is clear that our farmers need immediate assistance.\n\nCongress cannot stop a hurricane, but we can fix the unnatural disasters that our farmers face to aid their recovery.\n\nHouse Agriculture Chairman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, R-Pa., Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., visited Georgia's 8th District with me recently to survey the damage after Helene across south Georgia and north Florida. Our farmers need help, and I appreciate the chairman and others taking the time to meet with them firsthand so we can better work together for relief.\n\nUnfortunately, trouble for our nation's farmers began far before Hurricane Helene. Since the last farm bill was passed in 2018, our farmers and nation have experienced excessively challenging events that have changed the political landscape in which we need to navigate to properly support the best stewards of our land.\n\nRelated Articles Opinion: The dire state of the American farm economy\n\nWith rising input costs, including the increased cost of labor, diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed, farming is more expensive than it has ever been in our country.\n\nGeorgia's farmers were also horribly impacted by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which caused more than $2.5 billion in losses to the state's agriculture industry. It took approximately 24 months for our farmers to get relief after Hurricane Michael, and I can assure you that the majority of producers and rural communities that Helene hit cannot survive another 24 months without something being done.\n\nAmerica's farmers are also suffering from the unnaturally disastrous policies of the Biden-Harris administration, which have contributed to record inflation and the rising cost of energy and food production.\n\nThere has to be a strong safety net to keep good farmers farming through bad years like this one. If you are an American who eats, you should deeply care about the passage of a comprehensive farm bill that prioritizes production agriculture.\n\nEarlier this year, the House Agriculture Committee passed the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (the farm bill). This legislation includes critical updates to reference prices and several of my priorities to ensure a strong farm safety net by expanding crop insurance options to specialty crops, all of which would greatly assist producers in times of natural disaster.\n\nHowever, this bill is stalled in Congress, and the Senate Democrats just released a half-baked last-minute \"farm bill\" just to look like they did something, further fueling the fear of the forgotten farmer as they struggle to feed us.\n\nWhen the American farmer stops farming, rural communities collapse because their core and main economic driver is gone. We need to give farmers the support they need to keep farming with the confidence to know they are not forgotten.\n\nIt is my hope that Congress passes both the Farm, Food, and National Security Act and an agriculture-specific disaster relief appropriations package before the end of the year so that our farmers can continue feeding our nation and supporting our rural communities.\n\nRepublican Rep. Austin Scott represents the 8th District of Georgia and is a member of the House Agriculture Committee."

            "article_content": "Progressives have suddenly found themselves lost in the political wilderness, caught in a self-inflicted trap of anger and fear. From the sound of their fury, they could be there for a long while. (Thoughts and prayers.)\n\nWith Democrats now irrelevant, the second Trump administration has four years to take a wrecking ball to the Washington establishment, including deep cuts to federal spending and an overhaul of the bloated bureaucracy.\n\nTo understand why the wrecking ball is needed, look at the annual budget deficit \u2212 $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. In a time of relative peace and prosperity, the deficit grew 8% in one year, even though federal revenue increased by 11%. In other words, the Biden-Harris administration collected significantly more money from taxpayers in the last fiscal year but still managed to blow up the deficit by an additional $138 billion. That's simply unsustainable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter President-elect Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMusk operates at another level, building the most valuable automaker in the world in Tesla and the most important entity (public or private) in space travel and satellite communications with SpaceX.\n\nCan Musk succeed where Obama's Simpson-Bowles failed?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump joins SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to view the launching of the aerospace company's Starship rocket on Nov. 19, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nIf Musk and Ramaswamy are able to accomplish even a portion of what they envision \u2212 cutting $2 trillion in government spending \u2012 it could provide a remarkable boost for our economy.\n\n\"They're going to need inside Washington budget experts like ex-Capitol Hill staffers and the like,\" Chris Edwards, a Cato Institute economist who specializes in government spending, told me. \"People (who) used to be on the budget committees on Capitol Hill and used to work for the (Office of Management and Budget). They're going to need those sorts of people to tell them exactly how and what they can cut.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to cut government spending. In 2010, President Barack Obama created the Simpson-Bowles commission to recommend budget cuts that would trim the deficit over a 10-year period.\n\nThe commission's recommendations failed to gain traction in Congress. In fact, the federal government has added about $16 trillion to the national debt since Simpson-Bowles was created. So there's reason for cynicism. Trump and Congress will need to actually cut the programs Musk and Ramaswamy recommend, even if the president needs to use his veto power to do it.\n\nOpinion: Trump can fix what Biden broke. But he needs to seize the moment and stay on task.\n\nEdwards said Republicans need to be serious about deficit reduction starting next year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"(Republicans) need to at least show deficits kind of on a downward path,\" the Cato economist told me. \"They don't have to do a massive spending cut next year, but they've got to show financial markets and the Federal Reserve that the deficits are on a downward path.\"\n\nIt's a misconception that the executive branch doesn't play an important role in how the economy functions. The massive federal deficit helps fuel inflation. And as Edwards noted, \"The deficits and debt are so large now we're in uncharted financial territory for this country.\"\n\nDOGE should cut this department first\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy endorses former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign in Atkinson, N.H., on Jan. 16, 2024.\n\nThe Cato economist said DOGE could start to deliver better efficiency by initially focusing on a popular but underperforming section of the budget. A proposal to target federal spending on K-12 education might seem radical, but it also would signal that Musk and Ramaswamy are serious.\n\n\"K-12 schools is easily the biggest and most attractive opportunity for Trump and his team to cut,\" Edwards said. \"George W. Bush made a big show of signing the No Child Left Behind legislation ... and greatly increased federal subsidies and federal intrusion into the schools. That obviously failed. Test scores are down. I think today's Republican Party has completely changed on education. ... There's been the huge success of school choice.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion: Voters strongly rebuke Democrats by electing Trump. But will progressives listen?\n\nI second Edwards' suggestion.\n\nWhile public schools are necessary, more and more spending hasn't led to better results.\n\nThe Department of Education's budget for this fiscal year is almost $80 billion \u2012 nearly $10 billion more than the enacted budget only five years ago.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

Michel published an article that recommended $4.8 trillion in specific cuts over the next 10 years, including selling off Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and transforming Medicaid funding by sending block grants to the states.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDemocrats are sure to whine about those ideas and others. Republicans should ignore them and focus instead on saving taxpayers' money, getting the deficit under control and saving America from an economic disaster that will hit if the nation stays on its current course.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

            "article_content": "After the Black Friday offers from many companies, two of the most popular current PC processors are hardly available or very expensive at German hardware retailers. There are hardly any reasonable offers for both AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K. All of the following information refers to the boxed versions of the processors, for which the manufacturers also provide a warranty, not the freely traded tray goods intended for PC manufacturers.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe X3D in particular, currently the fastest CPU for games, has been in short supply for some time, but is currently virtually sold out. If a retailer promises to be able to deliver it in a few days, prices start at around 750 euros (ab 627,90 \u20ac), which is over 200 euros more than the processor cost at market launch. AMD's recommended retail price is 529 euros, which is already significantly more than its predecessor, the 7800X3D, when it was launched. This is also currently far too expensive with prices starting at around 550 euros (ab 499,90 \u20ac). In summer 2024, it was still around 330 euros.\n\nSome retailers have not even listed the 9800X3D in recent days, which means it no longer appears in price comparison services. Some retailers are now offering the processor again, but only for pre-order with rough delivery dates in December or January. An example of such an offer can be found at Mindfactory, which at the time of writing is asking 559 euros and promises an expected delivery at the end of December.\n\n285K only available immediately for more than at market launch\n\nThe supply situation for Intel's 285K is only slightly better. Although it is often inferior to cheaper processors in games, it is one of the fastest and most energy-efficient current desktop CPUs for applications, depending on the scenario. It was only released six weeks ago and cost around 640 euros at market launch. It is still listed comparatively frequently, but if you want it immediately, you will have to pay at least 700 euros (ab 682 \u20ac). As with the 9800X3D, the usual premium for new hardware has not disappeared after a few weeks, prices have increased here too. Intel's fastest Arrow Lake CPU is only available at a lower price if you can be patient until at least the end of December, when the processor is available for 10 to 20 euros less \u2013 as a pre-order.\n\nAs many customers have apparently paid the exorbitant prices for both CPUs in recent weeks, it is unlikely that the supply situation will improve soon and that cheaper offers will be available. This also has an effect on generally cheaper CPUs, as some prospective customers are likely to fall back on the previous generations, as the significantly increased prices for the 7800X3D show. Intel's 14700K is also no longer getting any cheaper within the scope of the usual fluctuations, with a minimum price of 380 euros (ab 377,99 \u20ac) for immediate availability.\n\n(nie)"

            "article_content": "For many years, OnePlus has attempted to challenge Samsung's supremacy as the top manufacturer of Android smartphones. Although OnePlus phones have come very close to being the greatest Android smartphones available, they still need to catch up in several crucial areas. For example, the OnePlus 12, which was released at the beginning of this year, included:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAn optical in-display fingerprint scanner.\n\nAn IP64 rating.\n\nFour years of OS upgrades.\n\nWith the OnePlus 13, which may be the Chinese smartphone manufacturer's first actual flagship phone and could eventually compete with Samsung's top-tier models, OnePlus has addressed many of these problems. Let's compare the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13 and learn the main differences between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePuls 13 smartphones.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Design\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Known for its high-end construction, the S25 Ultra is anticipated to have a titanium frame with a rounded shape, increasing durability while preserving a stylish appearance. For consumers who value productivity, the S Pen's addition offers utility.\n\nOnePlus 13: With an aluminum frame and a circular camera module, the OnePlus 13 takes on a more contemporary appearance. It might be better made than the S25 Ultra, but it still has a fashionable and functional design.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Display\n\nAdvertisment\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Featuring a 6.8-inch QHD+ display with a resolution of 3088 x 1440 pixels , this model is expected to support a refresh rate of 144Hz , ensuring smooth visuals and an immersive experience.\n\nOnePlus 13 also sports a 6.8-inch display with a slightly higher resolution at 3168 x 1440 pixels. However, it is rumored to have a refresh rate of 120Hz, which is still impressive but may not match the ultra-smooth experience of the S25 Ultra.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Camera\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : With a powerful 200 MP primary camera and extra sensors for telephoto and ultra-wide photos, this phone promises to be an excellent photographer, especially in low light.\n\nOnePlus 13: With two extra 50 MP sensors for telephoto and ultra-wide photography, the OnePlus 13 boasts a multipurpose camera configuration. Its camera system is made for versatility and high-quality photos, even though it might not have as many megapixels is the S25 Ultra.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Battery Life\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Expected to house a 5,000 mAh battery , which may be optimized through software improvements like Battery AI to enhance longevity during intensive use.\n\nOnePlus 13: It boasts a larger 6,000 mAh battery, promising extended usage times, which is especially beneficial for heavy users who prioritize battery life.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Charging Speeds\n\nAdvertisment\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Anticipated to support up to 45W wired charging and potentially increase wireless charging speeds from 15W to 25W.\n\nOnePlus 13: This model is set to offer rapid charging capabilities with up to 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, making it one of the fastest charging options available.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Pricing\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is projected to be priced around \u20b91,24,990.\n\nIn contrast, the OnePlus 13 offers an attractive price point starting at \u20b964,990, making it a more budget-friendly option without compromising essential features.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nComparing the prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the OnePlus 13\n\nApple had drastically lowered the pricing of its iPhone 16 Pro lineup due to the Indian government lowering import taxes on handsets and associated parts. Nevertheless, it is still being determined whether Samsung will maintain the Galaxy S25 Ultra's prices from the previous year or decrease. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra started for \u20b91,29,999 in India last year. By contrast, the OnePlus 12 started at \u20b964,999 in the nation. While the OnePlus 13's price is anticipated to increase, it should still be significantly less expensive than the Samsung substitute and have many of the same features. Limited software support and the absence of a 5x telephoto lens are two areas where the OnePlus 13 might fall short of the S25 Ultra.\n\nOnePlus 13: Specifications\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAccording to the China specifications, the OnePlus 13 is anticipated to include a 6.82-inch BOE X2 2K+ AMOLED screen with a maximum brightness of 4,500 nits, 2160Hz PWM dimming, and the first DisplayMate A++ certification in history.\n\nA 50MP Sony LYT 808 primary sensor, a 50MP Sony LYT600 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP Samsung JN1 ultra-wide angle lens make up the triple camera configuration on the rear of the OnePlus 13. There is a 32MP Sony IMX612 front-facing camera for taking selfies and making video calls.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which has a fantastic AnTuTu score of 3.18 million, powers the OnePlus 13, as was previously announced. The device supports up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage and 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM. The OnePlus 13 has IP68 and IP69 ratings to protect against dust and water. Additionally, it has an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which is an improvement over the OnePlus 12's optical sensor.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Specifications\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to keep its titanium frame from the previous model year, making it one of the most robust phones available. In contrast, the OnePlus 13 will probably have an aluminum frame, which is sturdy but pales compared to titanium.\n\nCompared to the OnePlus 13, the phone is anticipated to have a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with Gorilla Glass Armor protection, making the screen less reflective and more resilient. The Samsung phone may have an advantage due to its higher transfer speed, even though the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra should have at least 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. According to rumors, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will include UFS 4.04, which might double transfer rates above the OnePlus 13's UFS 4.0 storage.\n\nA 200MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x zoom, and a 50MP periscope lens with 5x magnification are all part of the triple camera arrangement that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to have. There ought to be a 12MP selfie camera on the front.\n\nWith a 50MP 5x periscope camera, the Galaxy S25 Ultra considerably outperforms the OnePlus 13 despite having a higher resolution ultra-wide angle lens. However, Samsung is unlikely to go to quicker charging speeds, and the S25 Ulta will probably have the same 45W wired and 25W wireless charging capabilities. With faster wired and wireless charging and support for magnetic charging, OnePlus leads the field in this area.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is exceptional in its high-end construction, cutting-edge camera technology, and valuable tools like the S Pen. In contrast, the OnePlus 13 distinguishes itself by its competitive cost, faster charging options, and greater battery capacity. Whether you favor value-driven performance or luxury features will determine which option best suits your needs."

            "article_content": "Home Opinion The theology of Christmas: The Incarnation\n\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most brilliant minds in history, transformed our understanding of the universe. His theory of relativity reshaped physics, while his discovery of the photoelectric effect won him the Nobel Prize in 1921. Yet, for all his genius, Einstein famously dismissed trivial facts. When asked how many feet are in a mile, he replied, \u201cI do not clutter my mind with insignificant information that I can find in less than two minutes in a book.\u201d\n\nThough Einstein acknowledged a divine order in the universe, he rejected the God of the Bible \u2014 the personal God who is both knowable and redemptive. He once remarked, \u201cThe more I study science, the more I believe in God,\u201d but tragically, he never came to know the one true and living God.\n\nThis contrast between human intellect and divine revelation sets the stage for John 1:14, a verse that declares the profound truth at the heart of Christmas: \u201cThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\u201d In this one staggering statement in John 1:14, we see a God who enters His creation, reveals His glory, and provides grace and truth for fallen sinners.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe Word became flesh\n\nJohn begins this verse with a profound declaration: \u201cThe Word became flesh.\u201d This phrase encapsulates the mystery of the incarnation, where the eternal Logos took on human nature without ceasing to be divine.\n\nThe term Logos (\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) was familiar to John\u2019s Greek and Jewish audiences, but John redefines it in the opening of his Gospel. For Greek philosophers like Heraclitus, the Logos referred to the rational principle and non-personal deity governing the universe. But John declares that the Logos (Word) is not an impersonal force but a person \u2014 Jesus Christ, who was both with God and was God (John 1:1).\n\nJesus, the eternal Word, is the Creator of all things (John 1:3). He is the \u201cI AM\u201d who declared, \u201cBefore Abraham was, I AM\u201d (John 8:58) and \u201cI and the Father are one\u201d (John 10:30). Jesus is sovereign over creation, having formed humanity in His image, established the laws of nature, and upholds the cosmos by His power. As the Nicene Creed affirms, He is \u201cvery God of very God,\u201d worthy of all worship.\n\nJohn\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe Word became flesh\u201d unveils the miracle of the incarnation. The eternal Son of God entered His creation by taking on human nature. This is the mystery that Thomas Watson called \u201cthe infinite love of God.\u201d Christ did not cease to be God but added humanity to His deity, becoming truly God and truly man.\n\nConsider the humility of the incarnation: the creator of the universe was born in a lowly stable, veiled in flesh, and subjected to the limitations of humanity in his human nature. Charles Wesley beautifully captures this truth in his hymn:\n\n\u201cVeiled in flesh the Godhead see,\n\nHail th\u2019incarnate Deity,\n\nPleased with us in flesh to dwell,\n\nJesus, our Immanuel.\u201d\n\nThe incarnation is not only a theological truth but a deeply personal one. Without the Word becoming flesh, humanity would remain lost in sin, alienated from God. As Watson reminds us, \u201cHad not Christ been made flesh, we had been made a curse.\u201d\n\nThe Word tabernacled among us\n\nJohn continues, \u201cand dwelt among us.\u201d The Greek word for \u201cdwelt\u201d (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c9) means \u201cto take up residence, or to pitch a tent,\u201d evoking the imagery of the Old Testament tabernacle where God\u2019s presence dwelled among His people.\n\nIn Exodus, God commanded Moses to construct the tabernacle, a portable sanctuary where His presence would reside. The tabernacle was central to Israel\u2019s worship, housing the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark\u2019s mercy seat was the place of atonement, where the high priest sprinkled the sacrificial blood once per year on the Day of Atonement.\n\nThis structure symbolized God\u2019s desire to dwell among His people, yet it was limited by layers of separation. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and only once every year. When John writes that Jesus \u201cdwelt among us,\u201d he declares that Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle. Unlike the temporary, veiled presence of God in the Old Testament, in the person of Jesus God\u2019s presence is fully revealed. As Hebrews 1:3 states, He is \u201cthe radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of His nature.\u201d\n\nThrough Christ, humanity can approach God directly, without fear or separation. He is not only the greater High Priest who offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice, but he is the greater tabernacle granting access to the Father for all who believe. This is the wonder and thrilling truth of the birth of Jesus that is celebrated at Christmas.\n\nThe Word revealed the glory of God\n\nJohn writes, \u201cWe have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.\u201d The incarnation reveals the radiant glory of God in a way that humanity could see, hear, feel, and touch.\n\nThroughout Scripture, God\u2019s glory is depicted as overwhelming and unapproachable. At Mount Sinai, God\u2019s presence was so terrifying that the Israelites trembled in fear (Exodus 19). When Moses asked to see God\u2019s glory, he was only permitted a partial glimpse, for no one could see God and live (Exodus 33:20). In the tabernacle and later the temple, God\u2019s glory filled the sanctuary, yet it remained hidden behind the veil.\n\nIn Jesus, the glory of God is fully revealed. At the transfiguration, Peter, James, and John witnessed His divine majesty shining through His humanity (Matthew 17:2). After His resurrection, Paul encountered the risen Christ in glory, a vision so blinding it left him temporarily blind (Acts 9:3\u20139).\n\nJesus\u2019 miracles also revealed His glory, demonstrating His divine authority over sickness, nature, and even death. From calming the storm to raising Lazarus, each miracle pointed to His identity as the Son of God. Even as Jesus\u2019 deity was clothed in human flesh, it could not veil his glory. Throughout his earthly ministry, bursts of glory and rays of his majesty are visibly seen in his powerful miracles. Yet, the greatest display of His glory was seen in His humility and suffering. On the cross, Jesus bore the wrath of God for sinners, displaying the glory of divine love and justice and the vindication of it all was his glorious resurrection.\n\nThe Word delivered grace and truth\n\nFinally, John declares that Jesus is \u201cfull of grace and truth.\u201d These two attributes summarize the purpose of the incarnation: to bring salvation through grace and to reveal the truth of God.\n\nGrace is the unmerited favor of God toward sinners. In Jesus, grace is personified and extended to all who believe. As Paul writes, \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God\u201d (Ephesians 2:8). From His first breath in Bethlehem to His final cry on the cross, Jesus\u2019 life was marked by grace. He came not to condemn the world but to save it (John 3:17). His death and resurrection provide eternal life to those who trust in Him.\n\nJesus not only embodies grace but also truth. He declared, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). In a world filled with deception, Jesus stands as the ultimate standard of truth. His teachings reveal the truth about God, humanity, and salvation. He exposed the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, corrected false interpretations of Scripture, and proclaimed the Gospel of the Kingdom. As the Spirit of Truth, Jesus sanctifies believers, transforming them into His likeness through the power of the Word (John 17:17).\n\nThe incarnation is the foundation of the Christian faith. In Jesus, the eternal Word became flesh, dwelt among us, revealed God\u2019s glory, and brought grace and truth to a lost world. As we celebrate Christmas, let us marvel at the humility and majesty of Christ, who entered His creation to redeem it. And let us live in anticipation of the day when He will dwell with His people forever:\n\n\u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God\u201d (Revelation 21:3).\n\nThis is the true theology of Christmas: God became man so that we might dwell with Him in glory. Let us worship the incarnate Word, our Immanuel.\n\nOriginally published at G3 Ministries."

Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe\u2014life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy\u2014or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \"self-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\" That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter\u2014daily or weekly.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution is the process of change in systems. It can describe how a group of something becomes more complex \u2013 or even just different \u2013 over time.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe\u2014biological or not\u2014to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules\u2014at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it\u2014for life as we don't know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe idea of quantum computing may feel a lot like stepping into the world of Marvel Studios\u2019 Ant-Man series and exploring the Quantum Realm. In the movies, Scott Lang and his team venture into a bizarre space where the usual rules of physics don\u2019t apply, unlocking incredible, almost magical possibilities.\n\nLike the Quantum Realm, quantum computing challenges our understanding of how the world works. By tapping into the principles of quantum physics\u2014like superposition (the ability for quantum bits or qubits to exist in multiple states at the same time) and entanglement (the process of linking qubits so that the state of one instantly reflects changes in another)\u2014quantum computers can do things that seem almost impossible.\n\nScientists and researchers are beginning to harness the power of the quantum realm to build powerful computers with the capability to break the world\u2019s encryption algorithms.\n\nBefore we can dive into quantum computing, though, we have to understand quantum physics.\n\nWhat is quantum physics?\n\nQuantum physics, or quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that deals with how things behave at extremely small scales, like atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike conventional physics, where things are predictable, and calculations are precise, in the quantum world, we can only use probabilities to predict how things will behave.\n\nIn the quantum world, particles can act like both individual units and waves simultaneously, with their state changing when measured. Quantum computers use these principles, performing calculations based on the probabilities of quantum states, taking advantage of superposition and entanglement before those measurements take place.\n\nIn quantum computing, superposition lets a quantum bit\u2014known as a qubit\u2014exist as both 0 and 1 at once until measured, while entanglement links qubits so that knowing one\u2019s state reveals the other\u2019s, no matter the distance. Qubits let quantum computers solve problems in ways conventional computers can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a quantum realm in our computer where Newton\u2019s laws of physics don\u2019t apply,\u201d Director of Computational Theory and Design at Quantinuum, David Hayes, told Decrypt in an interview. \u201cThe trick is to keep that tiny space isolated from the rest of the lab. You don\u2019t want that little region to interact with the outside world\u2014that\u2019s the only way to preserve its quantum state. It has to be completely isolated,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the quantum realm. That\u2019s the Ant-Man realm.\u201d\n\nLaunched in November 2021, Colorado-based Quantinuum develops solutions for cybersecurity, drug discovery, material science, finance, and natural language processing.\n\nAs Hayes explained, quantum researchers use lasers and electric fields to reach into the quantum realm.\n\n\u201cIn a conventional computer, you apply voltages to transistors,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, you're applying laser pulses that hit the atoms and manipulate the information that way.\u201d\n\nThe idea of quantum mechanics can be traced back to research in 1900 by Max Planck, who is considered the father of quantum theory. Quantum computers would come later in the 1980s and 1970s when Paul Benioff proved it was possible to build a computer that operated under the laws of quantum physics. In 1994, MIT Professor of Applied Mathematics Peter Shor developed his Factoring Algorithm, later known as Shor\u2019s Algorithm, which showed that a quantum computer could efficiently factor large integers, breaking RSA encryption\u2014a cornerstone of modern cryptography.\n\nShor\u2019s discovery, which remains the standard for quantum computing, underscored the practical power of quantum computers and spurred a surge of investment and research into quantum computing, accelerating its development over the next 30 years.\n\nWhat is quantum computing?\n\nUnlike supercomputers like the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s El Capitan, recently declared the world's fastest computer and capable of 2700 quadrillion operations per second, quantum computers perform computations by exploring multiple possible solutions simultaneously. This is possible because qubits can exist in a superposition of states, allowing them to handle multiple computations at once.\n\nHayes noted, however, that in regard to actual clock speed, the number of cycles a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can perform per second, quantum computers are not \u201cfaster\u201d than conventional computers.\n\n\u201cEven though the individual operations might happen slower, you have to do way less of them in order to solve a problem, sometimes exponentially fewer,\u201d he said.\n\nHow are quantum computers made?\n\nTraditional computers are made up of millions of tiny switches that manage the flow of electrons. But as we have shrunk those gates down to the sub-atomic level, the ability to control whether electricity flows through a gate or not becomes like trying to herd a swarm of ants. Through quantum tunneling, when we get to the sub-atomic level, electrons can simply hop over the gate at will, rendering a machine's ability to manage that flow useless. As a result, quantum computers are made very differently.\n\nUnlike traditional logic gates that simply process signals as 0s or 1s, quantum gates perform a series of complex tasks: they prepare qubits, entangle them to establish quantum connections, manipulate their probabilities through precise operations, and finally measure the results to extract useful data. This allows quantum computers to perform intricate calculations that are beyond the reach of conventional computers.\n\nAccording to Hayes, quantum computers, like those used by Quantinuum, shift from controlling electron flow with gates to managing individual atomic ions. These ions are meticulously positioned in a vacuum chamber quieter than most regions of outer space.\n\n\u201cA vacuum chamber has a pressure that's better than most regions of outer space,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThese individual atomic ions, float above the surface of a little golden microchip, about 71 millionths of a meter, 70 microns above the surface.\u201d\n\nThe gold-encrusted chip is held in place by precisely tuned voltages applied to electrodes on the chip. This setup ensures the ions don't touch the surface but remain perfectly positioned for manipulation.\n\nQuantum computers rely on laser pulses to control ions, moving them between memory and processor units and facilitating the interactions needed for computation. To read quantum information, a quantum computer shines a laser on an ion; if it\u2019s in the 'one' state, it scatters light, which is then detected to reveal its state. The ability to manage these quantum gates and ions is what gives quantum computing its incredible potential.\n\nFor anyone concerned about ions escaping its vacuum, Hayes explained that if the information does escape, the system begins to behave less like a quantum system and more like a conventional one.\n\n\u201cSo you have to race against time and do these calculations quickly enough so that the information doesn't leak out into the rest of the world until you're ready for it to leak out,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually, you have to leak it out so that you get an answer, but you only want that to happen at the very end, or you do it in a very controlled fashion, where you just pull out one bit of information from one atom, and sometimes that can help you do things like error correction.\u201d\n\nTo be able to control this process, Google, for example, is using a special superconductive metal operating at temperatures that are eight times colder than space, which is a far cry from a computer sitting on a desk. As a result, quantum computers are unlikely to be leaving the lab any time soon.\n\nThe quantum threat to encryption\n\nOne of the tasks the blockchain industry fears quantum computers will be put to is breaking the encryption surrounding networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Beyond blockchains, quantum computing could also threaten the security of the global financial system, top-secret intelligence agencies, as well as all the data on your phone.\n\nWhile the El Capitan supercomputer is incredibly fast, experts say it would still take the supercomputer over 10 billion years to break Bitcoin's encryption; a quantum computer, however, leveraging qubits, could theoretically do it in under 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIf you took today's blockchain structure and 10 years from now's quantum computer, you can break the encryption that comes from making private keys from public keys,\u201d Director of Quantum Enterprise Development at Classiq, Dr. Erik Garcell, told Decrypt. \u201cRSA encryption, for example, is definitely going to be something that quantum computing will be able to break.\u201d\n\nRSA encryption, named after its creators Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is a widely used method for securing data. It works by using a public key to encrypt information and a private key to decrypt it, relying on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers for security.\n\nBased in Tel Aviv, Israel, Classiq was founded in May 2020 and develops software tools and algorithms for designing and optimizing quantum circuits and applications. In June 2024, the company teamed up with BMW Group and NVIDIA to use quantum computing to enhance mechanical engineering systems in the automotive industry.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum primarily use Elliptic Curve Cryptography, as Garcell explained, the premise of technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency is based on the idea that certain problems are incredibly difficult for conventional computers to solve.\n\n\u201cWe built the assumptions that if we build a problem that's so hard that it wouldn't be practical to break it unless you spent an impossibly long time\u2014essentially until the end of the universe trying to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn practical terms, this assumes the problem is computationally infeasible to solve within any reasonable timeframe, making the encryption secure against attacks by conventional computers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, quantum computers can solve these problems much more efficiently, challenging the assumptions we built on,\u201d Garcell added.\n\nShould the blockchain industry be worried?\n\nHayes and Garcell agree that quantum computing will become a reality in the next ten years, a figure that aligns with an April 2024 report by digital consulting firm McKinsey Digital that said the chemicals, life sciences, finance, and mobility industries are likely to see the earliest impact from quantum computing and could gain up to $2 trillion by 2035\n\n\u201cFinance is probably going to see the most money out of this in the shortest amount of time because they're the most sensitive to any small advantage computationally,\u201d Garcell said.\n\nBig banks are diving into quantum computing to transform finance. Wells Fargo started collaborating with IBM and MIT in 2019, JPMorgan Chase teamed up with Quantinuum in 2020, and Goldman Sachs began exploring quantum computing with QC Ware in 2021.\n\nWhile the blockchain industry anticipates the coming quantum apocalypse, according to Garcell, cracking Bitcoin\u2019s encryption may not even be on quantum computer developers' list of objectives. Instead, Garcell believes developers may use quantum computers to mine Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cPeople want to make money. So a lot of people are going to be mining this stuff, and that whole system needs to figure out a way that's a little bit harder for a quantum computer to do,\u201d Garcell said. \u201cWith these are harder calculations, you might need a quantum computer to mine the Bitcoin of the future.\u201d\n\nGarcell did acknowledge that while there is a financial incentive not to try to take down the Bitcoin network, he said the blockchain industry needs to be ready for when quantum computers become mainstream.\n\nQuantum computers could break cryptographic systems but also enable stronger encryption. To address this, blockchain developers are planning upgrades to resist quantum attacks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep adapting, and blockchains must evolve to counter new threats and vulnerabilities,\u201d Garcell said.\n\nTo Garcell\u2019s point about evolving views on quantum computing, in 2019, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggested that quantum computers, such as those from Google, IBM, and Microsoft, were largely experimental. However, three short years later, in 2022, Buterin said that quantum computers could break certain encryption methods like RSA and elliptic curves, core components of many cryptographic systems.\n\nQuantum computers break: * RSA and anything based on factoring\n\n* Elliptic curves\n\n* Unknown order groups Quantum computers don't break: * Hashes\n\n* Latticeshttps://t.co/i6lCDufs9v \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 4, 2022\n\nIn March, Buterin floated the idea of a hard fork to safeguard the Ethereum blockchain against quantum computer threats. The plan involves reversing blocks after an attack, pausing certain transactions, and adding quantum-resistant validation methods.\n\nThe future of quantum computing\n\nEven if blockchains are safe for now, the crypto world is not taking any chances. Quantum-resistant blockchains like the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Praxxis, and QAN are already being developed in preparation for the potential quantum apocalypse. We can rest assured knowing\u2014even if quantum computers start taking over the world\u2014our crypto will be safe."

This was ChatGPT \u2014 an artificial intelligence chatbot that could write poetry, debug code, and summarize hundred-page novels with unnerving ease. It attracted a jaw-dropping 100 million users within weeks, breaking records for the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Investors, with visions of a technological revolution shimmering in their eyes (and dollar signs for pupils), began pouring fortunes into anything that bore the acronym \u201cAI.\u201d The future, it seemed, was already here.\n\nBut, as history reminds us with a wry smile, the future doesn\u2019t always arrive as advertised. As the markets ride a wave of AI-induced euphoria, voices of caution are growing louder. Is AI a transformative technology poised to rewrite our lives, or is it the scaffolding for the next catastrophic bubble \u2014 a modern-day echo of the dot-com collapse?\n\nEchoes of 1999\n\nThe numbers are staggering. In 2024, the S&P 500 is on track to close with a 27% gain, building on a 24% surge the year before. We haven\u2019t seen this kind of back-to-back bull run since the halcyon days of the late 1990s, when dot-com stocks inflated to absurd heights. For a brief moment, it seemed every startup with a \u201c.com\u201d in its name was a ticket to unimaginable wealth. But by early 2000, that story turned dark. The bubble popped, and what followed was a painful recession that many would rather forget. By 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion. Today, a similar stock market wipeout could be much more dire.\n\nFor instance, at the peak of the dot-com frenzy, Pets.com seemed to embody the future of commerce. Who wouldn\u2019t want pet supplies delivered with just a few clicks? The company launched in 1998, armed with an irresistible mascot: a wide-eyed sock puppet with a penchant for witty banter. The puppet became a minor celebrity, starring in a $1.2 million Super Bowl ad and even appearing on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBut beneath the charm lay a fragile business model. Shipping bulky bags of dog food wasn\u2019t cheap, and Pets.com sold products at a loss just to attract customers. Investors still believed in the vision, pumping $82.5 million into its IPO in February 2000. Nine months later, the company collapsed. The sock puppet, once a symbol of internet-age optimism, became the unwitting face of dot-com hubris.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, the undisputed titan of AI hardware, have seen their market value soar to over $3 trillion. In just two years, Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged eightfold. Super Micro Computer, which provides the servers powering AI\u2019s voracious data needs, has followed a similar trajectory. The technology that underpins this growth is genuinely astounding. Yet, as the Associated Press notes, it\u2019s hard to ignore how similar these patterns feel to the 1999 bubble \u2014 a time when investors believed the early internet would mint millionaires out of thin air.\n\nEven the European Central Bank has begun sounding the alarm. In a recent financial review, the ECB warned of an AI stock bubble, suggesting that if AI firms don\u2019t start producing tangible profits, panic could ripple through the global economy. The more feverish the hype, the harder the fall if reality fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cThis concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble,\u201d the ECB said. \u201cAlso, in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nAt the moment, there\u2019s just too much optimism and not enough recognition of what could derail stock momentum, experts seem to warn.\n\nIs This The World\u2019s Most Expensive Gamble?\n\nAnd yet, despite the red flags, the AI juggernaut barrels forward. According to estimates, spending on AI data centers from 2024 to 2027 will exceed $1.4 trillion. These facilities, filled with server racks humming under the weight of immense computation, are the new temples of progress. But as impressive as this investment sounds, only a sliver of American businesses \u2014 about 5% \u2014 have incorporated AI into their services.\n\nThe disparity between investor enthusiasm and business adoption is becoming hard to ignore. While ChatGPT dazzled millions, the electricity needed to train its underlying model, GPT-4, could have powered over three million electric vehicles for an entire year. OpenAI\u2019s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023 \u2014 but it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.\n\nEach new leap in AI capability requires ever more data, ever more energy, and ever more money. It\u2019s a cycle that feels less like a virtuous circle and more like an arms race, spiraling toward a point of diminishing returns.\n\nSome of these constraints are fueling an industry-wide scramble for efficiency. Companies are developing specialized chips and streamlined models to mitigate AI\u2019s insatiable hunger for resources. Yet, as of now, the promises are still largely theoretical.\n\nWhat happens if the money \u2014 and patience \u2014 runs out before the solutions arrive?\n\nThe Silent Revolution in the Office Cubicle\n\nCuriously, while corporations debate the merits of AI, employees are embracing it in secret. Studies suggest that a third of American workers use AI at least once a week, often without their bosses\u2019 knowledge. In some sectors, like software engineering, that figure climbs to nearly 80%. Employees are quietly deploying AI to write reports, debug code, and streamline tedious tasks, but they\u2019re keeping it under wraps, fearful that transparency could lead to heavier workloads or job losses. After all, why are you getting paid if most of your job can be done with the help of AI?\n\nThis clandestine adoption hints at a peculiar paradox: AI may be more disruptive than we realize, but the disruption is happening quietly, in the shadows of office cubicles. This isn\u2019t the AI revolution the hype trains promised. It\u2019s a whisper, not a roar.\n\nFor businesses, this means AI adoption is as much about culture as it is about technology. Companies that foster openness and experimentation could harness AI\u2019s full potential, while those clinging to old management styles might miss the boat entirely.\n\nThe Year of Reckoning?\n\nSo, what happens next? 2025 looms large. It could be the year AI makes good on its promise, with breakthroughs in fields as diverse as drug discovery and military defense. Or it could be the year the bubble finally bursts under the weight of unmet expectations.\n\nHistory offers no certainties, but it does offer patterns. The dot-com bubble wasn\u2019t just a story of irrational exuberance; it was also a story of real innovation that eventually found its footing. The internet did transform the world \u2014 just not in the exponential, uninterrupted path investors had hoped for. Perhaps AI is in for a similar treatment: a cataclysmic stock market crash that would hamper progress for a few years while at the same time sanitizing the industry by removing inefficient companies; then, only after a recovery, perhaps will AI make good on its many promises. Just like Pets.com was ahead of its time, so too maybe is the current AI hype train.\n\nThe hype may fade. Stocks may tumble. But beneath the surface, the technology could continue to mature, slowly and steadily finding its place in our lives. As the frenzy quiets down, we may discover that the most profound changes often happen in the spaces between bubbles \u2014 not with a pop, but with a quiet breath of reality."
