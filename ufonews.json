            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 explores the reality behind the supposed existence of extraterrestrial beings through the alleged experiences of several former and retired US Army officials, including Jason Sands. The UFO whistleblower served in the Air Force as a master sergeant before concluding his career in 2007. As per reports, he is also one of the numerous individuals who have spoken to former intelligence official and whistleblower David Grusch about allegedly encountering UFOs. Jason\u2019s claims have shaken the online communities and platforms that study UAPs. Interestingly, his experience of allegedly meeting an alien, as he revealed in the documentary, forms one of the most detailed and vivid accounts delivered by a whistleblower in recent times! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nJason Sands Served 22 Years in the Air Force\n\nJason Sands joined the US Air Force in 1985. His discharge/release certificate states that his primary specialties were electronic system security assessment and aircraft structural maintenance. However, after emerging as a UFO whistleblower, he claimed that he was part of several top-secret programs within the Air Force. In an interview given in April 2024, he alleged that one of his duties concerned understanding technology captured from non-human intelligence (NHI). He further added that he was a member of the \u201cRed Team,\u201d which was committed to monitoring exchanges between scientists, which apparently concerned numerous alien races at times. Despite these claims, there isn\u2019t any evidence in the public domain to prove that he was part of any missions that targeted extraterrestrial activity.\n\nJason\u2019s life supposedly turned around in 1994 when he allegedly met an extraterrestrial being while driving through the Nellis Air Force Base Complex in Nevada. As detailed in \u2018The Program,\u2019 he witnessed the apparent entity disappearing from Earth in a peculiar-looking craft. He shared this unverified experience with the documentarian James Fox, paving the way for his inclusion in the project. After meeting the former Air Force officer, the filmmaker investigated the claims and details concerning his tenure, only to be convinced about his credibility. After collaborating with Jason on the documentary, Fox accidentally revealed the former\u2019s identity, only for him to emerge as a whistleblower.\n\nJason Sands\u2019 Allegations and Claims Are Highly Contested\n\nJason Sands has been a significant presence in the online UFO research community since April 2024. He garnered immense attention with his claim of meeting an alien in 1994 and being part of several secret government programs. In an interview, he reportedly said he joined a UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomenon) task force forum in 2021 to contribute his supposed knowledge concerning \u201cblack projects.\u201d Even though many have accepted him and his words, several others have approached the same with critical eyes. After Jason released his Air Force release/discharge certificate in April 2024, a former UFO enthusiast raised suspicions concerning his alleged involvement in extraterrestrial research, which are not indicated in the \u201cproof\u201d he shared.\n\nFurthermore, in an interview with Spaced Out Radio in April 2024, Jason claimed he was \u201cforced to serve\u201d in the \u201c20 and Back Program.\u201d As per reports, it was described as a program in which participants spent 20 years in a Secret Space Program (SSP) to interact with extraterrestrial beings and visit military bases across the solar system. In 2022, a whistleblower named Corey Goode admitted that he fabricated the entire program to take advantage of his fans financially. Jason\u2019s alleged involvement in a fictional program turned numerous UFO enthusiasts against him, forcing him to describe the whole ordeal as a misunderstanding. He stated in April 2024 that \u201c20 and Back\u201d was an \u201cexperience\u201d for him rather than one official program.\n\nSimilarly, Jason\u2019s claim that he heard scientists discussing multiple alien races has also been scrutinized. In March 2024, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense published a report about the US government\u2019s involvement with UAP. The same offers insights about test and evaluation units with a nickname with \u2018alien\u2019 connotations, which can be what Jason apparently heard as an alleged member of the \u201cRed Team.\u201d\n\nJason Sands is Involved in the UAP Discourse While Working as a Consultant Today\n\nAs discussions and debates concerning Jason Sands\u2019 claims and allegations grow, he has been working as an independent consultant for the Department of Defense since August 2024. The whistleblower is currently based in Gaithersburg, a city in Montgomery County, Maryland. While he remains a popular figure in the UFO research community, he has chosen to keep his family away from the spotlight, which is understandable considering the scrutiny he faces day after day. The backlash he deals with has only increased following his inclusion in James Fox\u2019s \u2018The Program.\u2019 The recent reactions against Jason can be traced back to an interview he gave to Post Disclosure World, a YouTube channel dedicated to UFO news, in December 2024.\n\nWhen asked about his experiences as an Air Force officer, Jason alleged that he was forced to do some \u201cdirty work,\u201d which mainly involved killing \u201cNHI,\u201d also known as non-human intelligence. He went on to explain that he had to do it because he was informed that \u201cbad things\u201d would happen to him or his family if he didn\u2019t comply. The online UFO research community immensely scrutinized the whistleblower\u2019s \u201calien assassin\u201d claim. The credibility he garnered since his emergence as a first-hand witness of alleged alien existence was severely affected within a day. Even James Fox, who initially backed Jason, expressed his disbelief.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely devastates his credibility. But I still believe that encounter may have happened based on the background digging I did, but yeah, that\u2019s not good for his credibility,\u201d Fox shared. Irrespective of the backlash Jason continues to receive, he remains a sensational figure when it comes to alien discourse. Since April 2024, he has given numerous interviews and appeared on several podcasts to explain his claims. He is also one of the advocates of a comprehensive Congressional investigation into UAP within the jurisdiction of the US government. As \u2018The Program\u2019 sheds light on the possible existence of extraterrestrial beings, we can look forward to more clarity concerning Jason\u2019s credibility and his claims\u2019 authenticity.\n\nRead More: Darrell Livengood: Where is the Alleged UFO Witness Now?"

            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 delves into the mysteries behind some of the most puzzling reported UFO sightings, including the popular Calvine sighting. In August 1990, two chefs working at a Scottish hotel went hiking in Calvine, Scotland, only to allegedly come across a diamond-shaped aircraft. The duo then reportedly clicked six photographs of the unbelievable sight, which were passed on to the tabloid newspaper, Daily Record. When the authorities learned about the incident, the photographs were sent to the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defence. Since then, the Calvine sighting remained a myth, but only until Craig Lindsay startled the world with a photograph he had safeguarded for decades!\n\nCraig Lindsay Secretly Possessed the Alleged Calvine UFO Sighting Photograph For Over 30 Years\n\nCraig Lindsay was born in the Scottish town of Kilbirnie. His career began with short stints as a journalist at the Dalkeith Advertiser and the Fife Herald. In the 1960s, he left the world of journalism to work in the PR departments of the Scottish Tourist Board and Vauxhall Motors. He eventually became a civil servant by joining the Scottish Office. During this period, he covered several tragedies, including the Chernobyl disaster. Lindsay joined the Royal Air Force\u2019s Scotland and Northern Ireland division as a PR officer in 1989. The very next year, he became the first official to talk to one of the two chefs who allegedly encountered a UFO in Calvine.\n\nAfter the two chefs had submitted the photographs they had taken to the Daily Record, Lindsay was responsible for collecting and sending them to the Ministry of Defense in London, England. However, before completing this task, he broke the rules and kept a copy of one of the six photographs with him. The illegal print remained inside his desk for the next three decades, safely inside a copy of the book, \u2018Great Aircraft of the World.\u2019 The print Lindsay possessed was revealed to the world through the investigative journalist and lecturer David Clarke. The latter met the retired RAF officer in 2022 after reaching out to him in August 2021 without any awareness concerning the existence of the invaluable photograph\u2019s copy.\n\nCraig Lindsay Donated the Alleged Calvine UFO Sighting Photograph in 2022\n\nIn a way, Craig Lindsay eagerly waited for someone like David Clarke to lift a burden from him. \u201cI have been for waiting for someone to contact about this for more than 30 years,\u201d the retired RAF officer told the Journalist, as per Daily Mail. In June 2022, he decided to donate the photograph to Sheffield Hallam University. The donation was followed by an evaluation by the photographic specialist Andrew Robinson, who confirmed that the diamond-shaped object featured in the photograph was not integrated into it after it was clicked. Lindsay\u2019s actions attracted curious minds from across the globe to one of the most well-preserved photographs of an alleged UFO. As a former civil servant, it was not at all easy for him to unveil this prized possession to the world.\n\nLindsay was even scared of breaching the Official Secrets Act, especially since the Ministry of Defense and The National Archives wanted to keep the photograph hidden until 2076 due to privacy reasons. \u201cAs a press officer for Scotland, I dealt with many UFO reports but most were just of lights in the sky. It was obvious this one was different,\u201d Lindsay told Clarke, as per the same Daily Mail feature. \u201cWhen I asked what sort of noise it had made, the man said, \u2018It didn\u2019t make any noise at all.\u2019 Up to that point, I wasn\u2019t treating it very seriously, but when he said it was silent, I suddenly realized there is no aircraft that I know of that is silent,\u201d he added.\n\nCraig Lindsay Serves His Local Community With His Wife Today\n\nThe publication of the photograph placed Craig Lindsay in the limelight. However, his focus remains on leading a peaceful retired life with his beloved family in Waulkmill Steading, a small region near the Scottish city of Dunfermline. He continues to share his life with his constant companion and better half, Jennifer Lindsay, with whom he welcomed four children and six grandchildren. Lindsay concluded his time as an RAF officer in July 1999 with a short voyage aboard a Jaguar fighter. Following the remarkable send-off from service, he was invited by the Registrar General for Scotland to be part of the publicity campaign for the 2001 Scottish Census.\n\nThe campaign was a notable success, and Lindsay even earned a national award for his efforts. Over the years, he has been an unignorable presence in his local community. He occupied several positions after his retirement, such as the chairman of Limekilns and Charlestown Community Council and the Dunfermline Heritage Trust. In 2022, the former RAF officer retired from Scouting after leading the Dunfermline District Scout Committee for a considerable while. Lindsay has also served as a member of the Charlestown-based Queen\u2019s Hall committee. Nowadays, he is committed to fighting for the restoration of the Limekilns Pier as a trustee of the Limekilns Heritage Trust.\n\nIn December 2023, Lindsay and Jennifer marked a milestone in their relationship by celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. The joyous occasion was graced by a Coronation portrait of King Charles and Queen Camilla, who congratulated one of the British Empire\u2019s commendable retired servants. Even though \u2018The Program\u2019 turns the attention of the UFO enthusiasts to Lindsay, it appears to us that he won\u2019t be bidding adieu to his comfortable, quaint life in Waulkmill Steadings for a prolonged time in the limelight.\n\nRead More: Jason Sands: Where is the UFO Whistleblower Now?"

And small language models will also likely come into their own, addressing specific tasks without overburdening data center processing and power.\n\nOrganizations will also adopt new technologies and architectures to better govern data and AI, with a return to predictive AI, according to Forrester Research."

            "article_content": "The information was impressive enough, but the visualisation was the really impressive bit. It was far more powerful than any 1400-word block of text could ever be.\n\nGet your life (and marriage) in order\n\nMen might be doing more of the chores than they used to but they\u2019re still way behind on what\u2019s known as \u201cthe mental load\u201d: the planning, co-ordinating, scheduling, organising, assigning and following up on all the thousands of tasks big and small needed to make a family work.\n\nA recent NZ Herald headline put it this way: \u201cBeing CEO of the household is weighing women down and hurting relationships\u201d.\n\nIt told of a UC Berkeley study, which found: \u201cWomen reported being responsible for 73% of the cognitive labour, leading them to feel stressed, depressed, burned out and dissatisfied with their relationship\u201d.\n\nA bevy of AI-based apps is now available that might be able to help with this. Apps like Gether, Goldee and Jam allow you to forward emails and other correspondence to an email address where AI detects your family\u2019s names and automatically schedules their events in your and their calendars, and assigns people to the right tasks.\n\nThe tech isn\u2019t all the way there yet, still requiring some manual inputs, but it\u2019s a massive leap forward. The question is: will this get more men involved in the mental labour or just make them feel better that things are slightly easier for their partners?\n\nMake yourself happier\n\nThe amount of research on happiness and how to improve it has grown exponentially in the past 20 years, to the point where it\u2019s become impossible to know what to do with it, or even where to start. Imagine if you could feed all that information into an AI and have it create you a plan for how to live the perfect life. Well you can\u2019t, but you can get closer than ever before.\n\nThere are many platforms that allow you to upload files and get AI to answer your questions, give you insights and do all sorts of other cool things. The one that\u2019s getting most of the attention is Google\u2019s NotebookLM, probably partly because it\u2019s Google, partly because it\u2019s very good, partly because it\u2019s free.\n\nI took thousands of words of research from positive psychology research repository the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley, fed them into NotebookLM and asked it to construct a plan that would maximise my wellbeing in 2025. Here\u2019s its top-line summary:\n\nMorning:\n\nMindfulness meditation (5-10 minutes):\n\nGratitude journaling (5 minutes):\n\nPurpose check-in (5 minutes):\n\nAfternoon:\n\nSocial Connection Break (10 minutes):\n\nAwe Walk (5 minutes):\n\nEvening:\n\nAltruism Hour (15 minutes):\n\nReflect and Plan (5 minutes):\n\nWeekly practices:\n\nGratitude letter (once a week):\n\nSocial gathering (once or twice a week):\n\nAwe-inspiring experience (once a week):\n\nI\u2019m sharing it with you as part of my altruism hour. In return, perhaps you could write me a gratitude letter.\n\nMake more money\n\nApps such as Venture Planner, LivePlan and VentureKit allow you to write a sentence or two about some vague moneymaking idea, click some boxes and come out with a full, extremely impressive-sounding (and looking) business plan.\n\nNo ideas? No worries! Ask ChatGPT or some other LLM what they suggest, then cut and paste into Venture Planner.\n\nWant some extra cash but can\u2019t be bothered with all the hassle and expense of a startup?\n\nWrite a few sentences about something you know something about, and platforms like Teachable or Heights can instantly turn it into an online course, including full lesson plans, with which you can then spam your friends on social media.\n\nWho knows? Maybe someone will pay you for it.\n\nI set up a writing course up in less than 10 minutes, including detailed lesson plans and a full website including pictures of happy families I\u2019d never seen who were presumably delighted by my valueless course they\u2019d never heard of.\n\nGoogle is developing a raft of AI tools. Can they help you change your life?\n\nWin more arguments\n\nWant to give someone a piece of your mind about the issues of the day, but you\u2019ve clicked on a bunch of studies you thought would prove your point and you\u2019ve got no idea what they mean?\n\nI gave NotebookLM three papers and one book about education in New Zealand and asked it for talking points that could be used for a talkback radio call complaining about the dire state of Kiwi kids\u2019 reading.\n\nIt responded with 10 ideas, every one of them excellent.\n\nThe first read: \u201cOver a third of 15-year-olds in New Zealand struggle to read and write. This is a shocking statistic uncovered by Unicef in 2020. This isn\u2019t just about acing exams \u2013 poor literacy is linked to poorer health, lower incomes, and even criminal activity. Something needs to change!\u201d\n\nI could feel the phone lines lighting up even before I\u2019d reached the exclamation mark.\n\nTalk to your future self\n\n\u201cFuture You\u201d is a project from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which helps you create a 65-year-old chatbot version of yourself and chat with it about any topic you like: existential dread, disappointment at the state of the world, general sense of ennui and so on. An initial study into the project reported all sorts of benefits for users, including decreased anxiety, improved mental health and better academic performance.\n\nSide note: The project is targeted at younger people, who have had far less time to become worn down by life.\n\nSave on therapy\n\nMental health chatbots are suddenly everywhere.\n\nTheir MO is generally therapy 101: they ask you how you\u2019re feeling, then offer \u201cempathy\u201d, then conclude with potential coping strategies. Some studies have shown these bots to have promise, and while it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019re as good as real therapy for your mental health, they\u2019re definitely much better for your financial health.\n\nWhen I told Earkick about my many stresses and anxieties, it suggested using \u201cmicro breaks\u201d for a five-step mindfulness practice (\u201cPause and acknowledge, find your breath, focus on the present, let go of thoughts, return to your breath\u201d) which, while not groundbreaking, cost me $150 less than the almost identical advice I once paid $150 an hour for.\n\nGet a job\n\nEmployers have been using AI to screen you out of your dream job for years, so it\u2019s only fair that you can now use AI to beat them at their own game.\n\nApps like Jobscan, Kickresume and Job Copilot allow you to find jobs, build your CV and write cover letters that can beat the screening systems, all with a minimum of effort. Some of them will even auto-apply for jobs on your behalf.\n\nPro tip: tell AI to include in your application the fact that AI created your job application, demonstrating to employers both your technical prowess and your ruthless commitment to productivity.\n\nIt\u2019s not just CVs AI can help with. The career-help corner of the AI universe is booming. I used a free tool from Taplio to critique my LinkedIn profile. It was both surprisingly good and crushingly brutal and led me to make several changes. I also asked it to assess the LinkedIn profile of Bill Gates. It criticised his failure to include his key skills.\n\nChange the world\n\nI googled \u201chow to change the world\u201d, found 20-30 research papers, articles and even books, fed them into NotebookLM, then asked it for answers. It produced 1000 well-researched, erudite and occasionally inspiring words, but right now you probably just want the key points:\n\n1. Identify problems that resonate with you.\n\n2. Deconstruct the problem and understand the context.\n\n3. Embrace experimentation and learning.\n\n4. Become a \u201cchangemaker\u201d by cultivating essential skills: these include empathy, vision, initiative, resourcefulness, persistence.\n\n5. Join or support existing organisations.\n\n6. Promote a culture of change in your own sphere of influence.\n\n7. Remember that building state capability takes time and collaboration."

            "article_content": "The Mysterious Recording\n\n\n\nIs It Paranormal or a Real Intruder?\n\n\n\nTheories and Speculation: What Was the Voice Saying?\n\n\n\nA woman is now sleeping with one eye open after her sleep tracking app recorded an unsettling incident: a mysterious man's voice speaking to her while she slept. This bizarre experience has left her questioning the safety of her own home. Sleep talking is a common occurrence. A 2010 study from Norway revealed that as many as two in three people engage in some form of sleep talking. From mumbling to full conversations, it's a phenomenon that many have experienced. However, few have had the unsettling realization that an unknown voice might be talking back.This is exactly what happened to one Reddit user, who shared her unnerving story with the community. The woman posted a 10-second recording captured by the Sleepcycle app at 3:26 AM. The app flagged the moment as \u201ctalking,\u201d but what stood out was not her own voice\u2014there was a man\u2019s voice speaking in the recording. Incredibly clear, the male voice uttered sounds that appeared to be gibberish, such as \u201cwaka waka, baka baka,\u201d to which the woman responded with soft \u201cmmm\u201d and \u201cmmhm.\u201dThe woman speculated that the voice might be speaking in a different language, but despite using translation apps, she was unable to decode the strange words. \u201cThe voice is incredibly clear and seems to be talking to me and I\u2019m responding. I don\u2019t recognize the man\u2019s voice and I think I detect a bit of some kind of accent,\u201d she explained.Her concern grew as she recalled that she lives alone in a second-floor apartment, with deadbolt locks on her door and no other apparent means of entry. She wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is paranormal or ghost, to me it sounds like there was someone in my apartment, but I don\u2019t know how that would be possible.\u201dSearching for a logical explanation, the woman suggested that perhaps her devices might have been hacked, but she ruled it out as the technology in her living room was too far from her phone to pick up such a clear voice.The recording understandably \"freaked\" her out, and she wasn\u2019t the only one. Hundreds of Reddit users shared their own reactions to the bizarre clip, with many offering advice to protect her safety. One user suggested installing cameras in her apartment to check for a possible intruder, writing, \u201cI know it\u2019s horrifying and also rare, but it happens. I\u2019d rule that out ASAP. Safety first, and mundane before magic.\u201dOthers tried to decipher the mysterious words. Some suggested that \u201cwaka waka\u201d might be slang from Cameroon, meaning \u201cdo it,\u201d while \u201cbaka\u201d is a Japanese term for \u201cidiot.\u201d Reddit users speculated that the voice was telling the woman to \u201cdo something and not doing it would be stupid.\u201dDespite the attempts to understand the meaning, some found humor in the situation, joking that the \u201cpoltergeist\u201d might be singing Shakira\u2019s \u201cWaka Waka (This Time for Africa)\u201d or that Fozzie Bear from the Muppets had moved into her apartment.However, for most, the unsettling thought of an actual person invading her privacy was far scarier than the idea of a ghost."

            "article_content": "(Editor\u2019s note: Looking back on 2024, there were so many good albums released that we decided to reach out to some of today\u2019s artists and get them to weigh in on their favorites. What follows is Entheos vocalist Chaney Crabb\u2019s \u2018Top Albums of 2024\u2019.)\n\nMy name is Chaney Crabb and I am the vocalist of the band ENTHEOS. We released an EP this year on Metal Blade Records called An End to Everything and are looking forward to sharing a full album in 2025.\n\nJB Dunckel \u2013 Paranormal Musicality\n\nJB Dunckel\u2019s \u2018Paranormal Musicality\u2019 was my first favorite album of 2024. JB is one half of one of my favorite musical groups of all-time \u2013 AIR. Air\u2019s hauntingly enchanting and melancholy melodies have kept me a fan of every release I\u2019ve heard from them since their music first graced my ears in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides\u201d score, and JB\u2019s solo efforts are no different.\n\n\u2018Paranormal Musicality\u2019 is a piano-only album \u2013 there are no vocals and no accompanying instruments, but as every melodic line passes there\u2019s a sense that they\u2019ve always existed within our world. There\u2019s heavy emotion behind every keystroke of the piano. This is this album that ushered in every winter day for me at the start of 2024 \u2013 and I predict that it\u2019ll be the one I listen to the most to close out the year.\n\nKim Petras \u2013 Slut Pop Miami\n\nOne night over the summer as I was alone in my house, smoking a joint, and surfing through videos on YouTube I came across Kim Petras\u2019s lyric video for \u201cRim Job\u201d. I\u2019d heard a few Kim Petras tracks in the past but had never really taken a full dive into her work, but by the time the lyric video for \u201cRim Job\u201d was finished, I knew that I was a fully committed fan.\n\nFrom that point forward, \u2018Slut Pop Miami\u2019 became my summer go-to album. Its perfect blend of dancy, club hits with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and synthy, catchy lines is everything I want in a fun album to put on in a group setting. I can proudly say that I turned many of my friends and my band onto this album \u2013 we listened to it almost every day before we went on stage over the summer.\n\nMarilyn Manson \u2013 One Assassination Under God \u2013 Chapter One\n\nFrom the moment the first single from this album was released I had a feeling it would end up on my favorite albums of the year list. At this point I would say that this is the album I\u2019ve listened to more than anything else this year \u2013 songs like \u201cOne Assassination Under God\u201d and \u201cAs Sick As the Secrets Within\u201d are up there with my favorite Manson classics. The production is clear and perfect \u2013 Manson\u2019s voice is as good as its ever been and seeing the band live over the summer cemented that.\n\nChelsea Wolfe \u2013 She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She\n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Chelsea Wolfe\u2019s for a while, and one thing that I love about her as an artist is that she\u2019s never afraid to explore different aspects of her own artistry and sound. \u2018She Reaches Out to She Reaches out to She\u2019 embraces the landscape of dark electronica to its fullest \u2013 one of my favorite parts of this album is the atmosphere of it \u2013 at moments its almost suffocating, but always with the outward breath of beauty and relief masterfully entwined in the darkness.\n\nThe Cure \u2013 Songs of A Lost World\n\nIt comes as a little bit of a surprise, even to myself, that I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of The Cure. It\u2019s not that I have never liked their music \u2013 it\u2019s that I\u2019ve never taken the time to familiarize myself with their entire discography. I can proudly say that this changed this year with the release of \u201cSongs of A Lost World\u201d. From the first lyrical line on the album \u201cThis is the end of every song that we sing\u201d I was completely entranced by the dark beauty of this album. The album feels to me like a deep, introspective look at death. I feel such a kinship to that lyrical matter and sense of darkness in this beautiful world."

            "article_content": "This story was originally published in the 2024 edition of Discovery magazine, the College of Science's publication. This edition of Discovery celebrated the 20th anniversary of the College of Science.\n\nThe Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG) is Nevada\u2019s state geological survey. The bureau\u2019s primary mission is to provide Nevadans with geologic information about natural resources and geologic hazards to protect the public and facilitate, diversify and enhance Nevada\u2019s economic future. All but two states in the U.S. have a state geological survey, and about half are associated with their state university systems. The NBMG is a public service unit at the University of Nevada, Reno and supports the University\u2019s land grant, educational and research missions.\n\nThe NBMG was originally established as the Nevada Bureau of Mines in 1929 by the Nevada State Legislature, with the charge of serving as a bureau of information and exchange on Nevada's mineral industry, mineral resources and geology.\n\n\n\nOther responsibilities outlined in state statute include field investigations and laboratory studies, application of geologic engineering principles to geologic problems around the state and assisting state and local governmental agencies on topics related to the geology of Nevada.\n\nIn 1971, the bureau\u2019s name was changed to \"Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology.\" James Faulds, state geologist and director of the NBMG, said that with this change came a shift in the bureau\u2019s responsibilities to take on more of a research and teaching mission. The bureau\u2019s research output grew substantially and, in the late 1980s, NBMG research geologists were reclassified as University faculty. Later, in 2012, responsibilities for the NBMG\u2019s academic faculty were further expanded to include regular teaching and advising of graduate students. Today, over a dozen graduate students are training to become geologists under the supervision of NBMG mentors.\n\n\"It is interesting to reflect on changes in the state\u2019s geological needs over the bureau\u2019s almost 100-year history, as well as our evolution within the University,\" Faulds, who has worked at the NBMG for over a quarter century, said. \"Our mission was initially focused on the state\u2019s natural resources, particularly its mineral resources, as they related to Nevada\u2019s extensive mining activities. However, as the state grew in population and diversified its economy amid periodic earthquakes, floods and landslides, the NBMG\u2019s mission expanded to include assessments of geological hazards to facilitate more careful infrastructure planning and thus enhance public safety. Meanwhile, the University was also evolving into a premier research institution, and the NBMG\u2019s mission expanded accordingly into both research and education over a period of several decades.\"\n\nOverall, the NBMG employs nearly 30 individuals to cover its wide spectrum of responsibilities. These include specialists in geological mapping, economic geology (mineral resources), geothermal energy, geologic hazards, GIS/cartography and data organization/dissemination. Producing geological maps is a core function of state geological surveys like NBMG, as they provide foundational information needed for assessment of natural resources and geologic hazards. Major research organizations within the bureau include the Great Basin Center for Geothermal Energy, which hosted its first geothermal open house event last fall to inform the local community about geothermal resources in the state; the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory, which operates a network of more than 400 GPS stations tracking crustal motions across Nevada, helping to define earthquake hazards; and the Center for Research in Economic Geology, which conducts cutting-edge studies on gold deposits, critical minerals (such as lithium), and mine waste as a potential source of minerals (see page 14). NBMG also operates the Great Basin Science Sample and Records Library, a public facility and regional repository housing over 350,000 geologic specimens and reports. Additionally, the bureau provides outreach to K-12 students and teachers. The NBMG\u2019s many activities are summarized in biennial reports.\n\nOver its 95-year history, the bureau has carried out its role by sharing information with citizens and industry about hazards and resources to advance both public safety and economic development in the state, using the most up-to-date technology available. Major recent accomplishments include publishing a record number of geological maps in the past year, completing a new geological map of the Las Vegas Valley, conducting detailed analyses of some of Nevada\u2019s largest lithium deposits, election of one its faculty (Geoffrey Blewitt) to the National Academies of Sciences, and awarding of the prestigious Donath Medal (Young Scientist Award) by the Geological Society of America to another faculty member (Andrew Zuza).\n\nFaulds, who has served as director of the bureau since 2012 and is planning to step down upon the hire of a new director, reflects on its long history and promising future:\n\n\"As the search for a new director progresses, I can only reflect in awe at all of the accomplishments over the past several decades of our dedicated faculty and staff, who have endured tight budgets and expanding duties, but have continued to excel in producing high quality maps, reports and publications to meet the growing needs of this amazing state, endowed with all of its geological complexity and enormous potential,\" Faulds said. \"It has truly been an honor both to serve Nevada for the past 12 years as state geologist and to work with my talented colleagues to achieve important objectives for the state. I know that the bureau will continue to expand its horizons in concert with both the state\u2019s increasing needs and continued growth at the University.\""

The climate crisis is still gaining momentum, COP underlined the lack of consensus on what to do about it, and attempts to create a plastics treaty failed. Political violence rose to the surface in the US, and there was an election result that foretells four years of chaos and persecution for many. And war, conflict, and violence continue to afflict millions worldwide, from the DRC to South Sudan, Haiti to Yemen, Ukraine to Gaza.\n\nBut in the midst of the darkness, there were some bright rays of light. Scientists made big strides in countering some of the greatest health problems faced by humanity. Efforts to fight climate change have pressed on. And a cute baby hippo bit her zookeeper\u2019s knee in a fit of childish rage, launching a thousand memes. Here\u2019s our rundown of the best news to come out of 2024.\n\nRoutine Childhood Vaccination Against Malaria Began\n\nMalaria has proven a stubborn foe\u2014the quest to produce a vaccine against it began more than a century ago. Now, two are available, and in early 2024, the world\u2019s first routine childhood immunization campaign against malaria began in Cameroon. The disease kills more than half a million people worldwide every year, but this could be the starting point for bringing this number down significantly.

Researchers hope these rock samples will help reveal how the moon, and other planets, evolved.

That\u2019s an ambitious goal, but SpaceX made great progress toward it this year. The Starship program completed a number of test flights, the most eye-catching being the fifth test, in October, which saw the giant craft launch successfully and its booster return to and land on its launch tower. It was an exhilarating spectacle\u2014and potentially a historic milestone in the history of interplanetary travel. Read more on Ars Technica."

            "article_content": "An increasingly diverse coalition is forming in opposition to OpenAI\u2019s plan to restructure itself into a fully for-profit company.\n\nOn Monday, Encode, a youth-led advocacy organization representing young people in dozens of countries, filed an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk\u2019s ongoing lawsuit to stop OpenAI\u2019s corporate metamorphosis. The filing came with support from one of the biggest names in the field, Nobel and Turing prizes award-winner Geoffrey Hinton, who is often called the godfather of AI.\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode along with its brief. \u201cIt received numerous tax and other benefits from its non-profit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHinton recently told the BBC he believes there is a \u201c10 percent to 20 percent\u201d chance that AI will lead to human extinction within the next 30 years. Previously, Hinton\u2019s been more modest, putting the odds at just 10 percent.\n\nOpenAI is currently structured as a for-profit company controlled by a non-profit board, which places some restrictions on its mission and ability to raise money and compensate investors. The company formally announced its intention to restructure itself as a more traditional for-profit corporation last week, although the change had been anticipated for some time and Musk, who was a cofounder of OpenAI, filed his federal lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to stop it in November.\n\nEncode argues that OpenAI\u2019s planned shift from a nonprofit to a Delaware public benefit corporation would \u201cundermine specific safety-focused commitments the nonprofit has made to the public.\u201d In particular, the brief questions whether a for-profit corporation could ever fulfill OpenAI\u2019s promise that it will \u201cstop competing with and start assisting\u201d any value-aligned organization that appears close to building artificial general intelligence before it does.\n\n\u201cToday, a handful of companies are racing to develop and deploy transformative AI, internalizing the profits but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,\u201d Sneha Revanur, the president and founder of Encode, said in a statement. \u201cThe courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.\u201d\n\nFor its part, OpenAI has urged the court to reject Musk\u2019s lawsuit, arguing that he lacks standing and is seeking to gain an unfair competitive advantage for his own AI startup, xAI. OpenAI also released a trove of emails and other messages from Musk, including several that the company said showed Musk advocated for converting the organization to a for-profit as early as 2017."

The October 1st viral trend has taken off and it has made the Halloween month the time to fall in love. Try out the Melissa McCarthy I Want Something dance trend.

If you want to change your hair, the calico hair look trend is perfect for you. Another trend can either be an artsy activity or a date night disaster.\n\nIt has also highlighted the creative ways in which social media users adapt to perceived restrictions on free speech and information sharing.\n\nWhile TikTok has released statements about banning hate speech, there is no suggestion the platform is restricting views on content featuring drones.\n\nIn 2020, TikTok said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud that we have already taken steps to keep our community safe, for example, by not permitting content that denies the Holocaust and other violent tragedies.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s always more we can do, which is why we are taking further action to remove misinformation and hurtful stereotypes about Jewish, Muslim and other communities.\n\n\u201cThis includes misinformation about notable Jewish individuals and families who are used as proxies to spread antisemitism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also removing content that is hurtful to the LGBTQ+ community by removing hateful ideas, including content that promotes conversion therapy and the idea that no one is born LGBTQ+.\u201d"

So whether you\u2019re looking to give up fat frogs, find the love of your life skating by the Pier Head, or just want to attend more than two lectures a week, you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nHopefully these resolutions for 2025 will fill you with hope and ambition rather than the all-consuming feeling of guilt and paranoia we\u2019ve all experienced at some point. No doubt you won\u2019t follow any of them and still end up being that one third year who\u2019s blackout drunk at AU night. Happy New Year!\n\nStop trying to find your lost parcel on the Smithdown Matters Facebook page\n\nLet\u2019s face it, a middle aged scouser is probably trying on your Oh Polly parcel as we speak. You can only pray that you\u2019ve not lost the envelope that has your missing ID in it, or any birthday money from your grandparents. There\u2019s only so many times you can ask for the neighbours\u2019 names from the house opposite you, and sometimes you just have to come to terms with the fact that yor Vinted parcel has become part of a student house\u2019s secret santa for the year.\n\nCut down the amount of cash you bring out on a Monday at The Raz\n\nRealistically speaking, telling a medical professional that you consumed 34 raz-bombs the night before a 9am lecture should genuinely be a criminal offence. Adding in the fact that that only cost you \u00a337 in total with entry, they\u2019ll probably give you a pat on the back, but your housemates certainly won\u2019t be celebrating your achievements when you\u2019re throwing up against a lamppost whilst simultaneously crying at the transaction notifications from your bank. Getting a grip is a commendable feat, we promise.\n\nStart wearing multiple layers to the Grove Wing of the Sydney Jones\n\nAlternatively, start protesting against the energy saving in all the libraries and make them turn the heating on. Why is it so cold and why do I never learn to pack a jumper?\n\nStop regretting which modules you picked last year (and complaining about it)\n\nIt\u2019s literally your fault that you picked that one really niche module about Northern Irish art history or coding obscure maths data in Spanish, sorry. Maybe your goal for 2025 is to fulfil the academic weapon role you thought you\u2019d adopt after your first year at uni.\n\nStop getting blackout drunk at pres\u2026\n\nI wish I took a mental note of my alcohol tolerance every time I got caught throwing up outside The Lime Kiln but you win some, you lose some I suppose. Sometimes necking an entire bottle of cheap wine from Wag 1 Offy isn\u2019t the move, and you definitely don\u2019t need that concoction of leftover gin, out of date fruit juice and off brand lemonade to take with you as \u201cjourney juice\u201d. Maybe Dry January would be a good idea for you x\n\nBut start ACTUALLY going to pres\n\nNo doubt you\u2019re getting paralytic before every night out because you\u2019re only doing one every three months \u2013 stop saying no to social plans just because you\u2019ve got assignments to do or CVs to write. The time will make itself for your uni work, but never stops when it comes to piling in an Uber at 3am with no plans, just a few weird props you acquired from the living room floor. It\u2019s all well and good entering your intelligent era next year, but you deserve to let your hair down too. You\u2019ll regret it otherwise, trust me.\n\nStart washing up everything in the sink of your uni kitchen\n\nSink does not equal dumping ground for crusty pasta bowls.\n\nStop making friends with the bossmen on Leece Street\n\nAs hilarious as it was to be a fresher behind the counter in Hot n Tender, there\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than seeing videos of drunk you taking orders from a confused bunch of third years just popping in for a kebab. Save yourself the shame of initiating a love story with the chicken shop man.\n\nStop adding to the bin mountain\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\nStart walking from Smithdown to uni even when your mates don\u2019t go\n\nThe feeling of betrayal you experience when you wake up in time for a 10am, get yourself ready with the expectation that all of your coursemates are meeting you on the way to walk to campus, and then seeing that they haven\u2019t been active for 14 hours, is incomparable to anything else. The brand new 2025 you should be brave enough to trek from Smithdown to South Campus Teaching Hub solo, even on a chilly morning. Use it as your hot girl walk and opportunity to listen to a weirdly niche podcast, or stomp along to your \u201cmisty mountain solo self reflection main character moment jams\u201d daylist on Spotify.\n\nStart giving yourself a break from uni assignments\n\nAlong the same lines of actually having a night off to head out on the town with your flatmates, having a relaxing evening tucked up on the sofa with a friend or two can do you wonders mid-semester. There\u2019s only so many late night study sessions you can pull off before you\u2019re burnt out and start to convince yourself that your housemates have forgotten that you exist and you\u2019ll never find a graduate job with an arts degree. So not true! Have a break, have a self care night, have a cheeky takeaway. You deserve it.\n\nStop spending half your student loan on sweet treats\n\nHowever, when you do manage to get that 4000 word assignment started, spending \u00a33 on a pastry after every 150 words is actually quite bad for your bank account \u2013 or so I\u2019ve heard.\n\nStart saying no to Concert Square for a night out\n\nWe\u2019ve all got that one friend that wants to start the night in SOHO or MODO for the \u201cvibes\u201d but you always end up feeling sober, freezing cold and no longer excited to go out. There are so many venues and clubs in Liverpool to test out once or twice, so make a list with your friends of your ideal places to visit and branch out a little! The nightlife scene in town defo stretches further than Concert Square and Quick Burger, you just have to look for it.\n\nStop texting your ex\n\nTHEY ARE NOT THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.\n\nIf they\u2019re an avid Skint goer, on any of the snowsports society boards at John Moores, or genuinely disagree that pineapple doesn\u2019t belong on pizza, then they\u2019re not for you I\u2019m afraid. Get those grapes down you on New Years babe.\n\nStop avoiding walking up Brownlow Hill\n\nWhat happened to those 75 hard plans you made, eh? Taking the long way through campus to avoid clambering up Brownlow Hill is not part of the hot girl gym aesthetic you put on your vision board for 2025. Get those legs moving and squint through your tears, it\u2019s not that bad. Joking. LOL.\n\nStart making time to visit your friends or invite them to visit you\n\nA little bit of home never does anyone any harm. Dragging your home friends up to Liverpool to give them a tour around the Docks and Baltic Market will help you take your mind off things when you\u2019re fighting those winter blues. Sometimes you just need that comfort of getting wine drunk with your best friends in a different city \u2013 making time for this in the new year can do wonders for you.\n\nStop being scared of the teenagers on Lawrence Road\n\nSeriously though, why are they so scary?\n\nStart making moves on your library crush\n\nOur Library Crush feature on Instagram hears, sees and knows everything you\u2019d be dying to know about everyone\u2019s love lives on campus, believe me. There\u2019s nothing more exhilarating than noticing the love of your uni life sitting across from you in the Hogwarts room in the Harold Cohen, or brushing past them on the stairs in the Sydney Jones. I expect to see you all flirting in the Starbucks in time for Valentine\u2019s Day this year.\n\nStop putting the attendance code in for seminars after 11am\n\nIf it\u2019s past 11am just get a grip and go onto campus, surely? The only exception MIGHT be the Thursday after AU night, but you\u2019re admitting your weaknesses if you\u2019re asking the course group chat for the attendance code for the 2pm seminar.\n\nStop being afraid to do things solo\n\nLiverpool is an incredible city with so many activities and places to visit \u2013 if none of them take the fancy of your friends or housemates, don\u2019t be afraid to go and explore things on your own! Incorporating solo dates into your resolutions for 2025 is so cute and VERY mindful.\n\nStart applying to jobs to fuel your Gourmet Grill/Nabzy\u2019s/Harper\u2019s addiction\n\nThere\u2019s only so far a trust fund will stretch when it comes to cheesy chips and gyros unfortunately.\n\nTake our advice and run with it \u2013 we know you won\u2019t stick to any of these resolutions and can\u2019t wait to hear how miserable we all feel by the Easter break. If you manage to find a way to romanticise January and the dreaded exam season, please let us know."

partly through techniques within the classroom; and partly through the narratives attached to the sciences.\n\n'Specifically, the curriculum should offer children a chance to learn about historic Western and non-Western contributions to the sciences, as well as cutting-edge contemporary research from diverse teams of scientists.\n\n'Teachers should be encouraged to frame historic examples of scientific discoveries in the context that some individuals, groups, cultures and nations were disadvantaged in their ability to participate in or to resource research and less able to claim credit and ownership for ideas that had been developed by them.'\n\nThe Royal Society of Biology also said it had sought expertise on 'decolonising the curriculum' and for a 'no more heroes' approach to teaching science in schools.\n\nThis would mean 'avoiding prescriptive lists of historic figures in biology' and instead 'exploring opportunities for local, recogniseable, diverse historic and contemporary figures through which discovery and exploration of biological concepts can be explored'.\n\nIt added that students should be encouraged to 'see a wide range of biologists in action'.\n\nThe Institute for Physics suggested that 'ideas should be framed in the context of the times in which discoveries were made and accredited within Western science'.\n\nIts submission to the curriculum review added: 'They can explain how many of those discoveries drew on earlier work in other parts of the world.\n\n'And how, during the period of growth of Western science, different groups, cultures and nations were more or less able to participate in research, resource scientific activity, or claim credit and ownership for ideas.'\n\nThe Royal Statistical Society called for the greater use of 'real-world data' - such as on gender inequalities or migration - in the teaching of maths and statistics.\n\n'The curriculum should be focused on solving problems using data rather than answering questions about data,' its submission added.\n\nTeaching unions are also among groups to have submitted evidence to the curriculum review.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders said the current curriculum 'prioritises a somewhat monocultural worldview, especially with regards to literature and history'.\n\nMs Phillipson has hailed the review as an 'important step in this Government's mission to break down barriers to opportunity, deliver better life chances and enable more young people to get on'.\n\nThe review is being chaired by Professor Becky Francis, who has spearheaded research into educational inequalities.\n\nTory MP Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said: 'Labour's curriculum changes will drive down educational standards.\n\n'Instead of continuing with a rich, knowledge-based curriculum which has led to our children being the best readers and mathematicians in the Western world, they are tearing it all up.\n\n'Pure education vandalism once again.'\n\nReform UK deputy leader Richard Tice hit out at 'a ludicrous proposal from the wokerati'.\n\nHe added: 'We need more historic British heroes and achievements to be taught to our children, not less.'"

            "article_content": "Part of being human is to create\u2014to invent objects and ideas that will make life possible, simple and enjoyable. Homo sapiens have been innovating for more than 300,000 years, ever since the first stone tools. But nature\u2014the iterative process of evolution\u2014is as old as life itself.\n\nNow, engineers sometimes look to other kinds of life for ways to improve our medicines and make our technology better. This year, for instance, inventors took a tip from jellyfish to create a non-toxic, fluorescent spray that can make fingerprints visible at a crime scene. Inspired by green fluorescent protein found in jellies, they created two dyes that bind to the negatively charged molecules in fingerprints and glow under a blacklight.\n\nIn another breakthrough, researchers built an ultra-sensitive microphone informed by spider silk, which vibrates with the subtle perturbations of sound waves moving through the air. By mimicking that strategy, the microphone can be made more compact than standard ones, which are instead designed after the human eardrum. Building on this invention, researchers said in May that spider silk could continue to revolutionize sound technology\u2014from helping to identify hearing loss early to picking up on low-frequency sounds known to precede tornadoes that might enable life-saving early warnings.\n\nBut before these advancements could come to be, scientists first needed to learn something about biology. In 2024, researchers tested the metabolism of fruit bats, analyzed the mechanics of swimming fish, and took note of the wound-healing abilities of both primates and ants. Each of these endeavors and others might open the door to developments in engineering or medicine down the line.\n\nHere are seven scientific discoveries from this year that could lead to new inventions in the future.\n\nSea creatures can merge their bodies together\n\nThe bizarre love life of the anglerfish | Surprising Science Watch on\n\nFinding love, for a male anglerfish, means looking for the bright lure\u2014or following the scent\u2014of a female, to whom he becomes fully devoted. And devotion, for the male anglerfish, means gripping on with his teeth to her underside until their bodies fuse together, his eyes fall into disuse, and their bloodstreams become one. The male loses his organs and becomes, essentially, a permanently affixed source of sperm for the female.\n\nThis bizarre love story is a mating strategy known as obligate sexual parasitism, and according to research published in Current Biology in June, it might have helped anglers to dominate the deep ocean.\n\nBetween 35 million and 50 million years ago, the ancestors of anglerfish evolved to lose their habit of \u201cwalking\u201d on modified fins in shallow water and instead shifted into the deep sea. This transition happened during a period of global warming that drove other organisms extinct\u2014and, according to the research, it happened at the same time that the anglerfish evolved sexual parasitism.\n\nGenetically speaking, two things needed to happen for the fish to have success with this mating strategy. For one, females had to become much larger than the males. Importantly, they also had to lower their immune defenses so that the female\u2019s body would not attack the tiny male as it joins to her.\n\nSuch a suppression of immunity is \u201ccrucially important\u201d to organ transplant procedures and skin grafting in humans, as Thomas Near, an evolutionary biologist at Yale University and a co-author of the study, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting area for future medical research.\u201d\n\nA similar feat is performed by comb jellies, primitive sea creatures distinct from jellyfish that are thought to have been the first lineage to break from the common ancestor of all animals on the evolutionary tree. A separate team of researchers reported in Current Biology in October that comb jellies, when injured, can merge their bodies together\u2014two heads, one nervous system.\n\nLike the anglerfish, fusing comb jellies might point scientists toward a mechanism that could prevent organ transplant rejection. Some experts, however, see potential in another direction\u2014studying how the creatures\u2019 neurons work together could shed light on nerve regeneration.\n\nMatabele ants produce antibiotics to heal injured nestmates\n\nLife for a Matabele ant is dangerous. The sub-Saharan ants exclusively feed on termites, but hunting their favored prey involves infiltrating the insects\u2019 colonies, which are heavily guarded. When Matabele ants go on the attack, about 20 percent of them might come away with injuries to their legs.\n\nIf those wounds become infected, it could be a death sentence. But the colonies have figured out how to heal their fighters: The ants generate antimicrobial secretions to prevent infection.\n\nIn a paper published in Nature Communications in late December 2023, researchers report that Matabele ants can distinguish between peers with infected and uninfected wounds, potentially due to a difference in the hydrocarbon profile of their exoskeletons. They\u2019ll target treatment on the individuals with infections, secreting a substance with more than 50 components boasting antimicrobial and other healing properties.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the team either separated injured ants from their colony or let the other insects attempt to heal the wounds. They found that injured ants isolated from their peers faced 90 percent mortality within 36 hours of the injury. But the Matabele ants under the care of their colonies saw only 22 percent mortality.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of humans, I know of no other living creature that can carry out such sophisticated medical wound treatments,\u201d says study co-author Erik Frank, an animal ecologist at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany, in a statement.\n\nThe ants\u2019 stunning medical abilities have the potential to help where human ones are falling short. For instance, several strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa infect humans and have evolved to resist many of our antibacterial treatments. The same bacteria infect Matabele ants, so researchers suggest something in the insects\u2019 secretions might help fight the pathogen in our own wounds.\n\nClams use the first known natural fiber optics\n\nNestled within heart-shaped shells, the soft body of a heart cockle dwells away from light. To get the nutrition it needs, the clam relies on photosynthetic algae that also live in the shell. But to give the algae access to sunlight without exposing the clam to harsh radiation, the heart cockle has developed the first known use of fiber optics in nature, according to research published in Nature Communications in November.\n\nHumans have been producing fiber-optic cables\u2014bundles of glass or plastic fibers that quickly transport light and enable the internet\u2014since the 1970s. But it turns out that the walnut-sized heart cockle \u201cwas way ahead of us\u201d in terms of fiber-optic innovation, per a statement about the discovery.\n\nScientists found that the clam\u2019s shell, made from a type of calcium carbonate called aragonite, is mostly built with plate-like structures. In between, however, are so-called windows, where the aragonite is instead stretched into hair-like fibers. These avenues transport red and blue light\u2014the best wavelengths for photosynthesis\u2014into the shell while blocking harmful ultraviolet radiation. In computer simulations, the researchers tried to find a more efficient structure by testing different sizes, shapes and orientations of the fibers, but they revealed that the clam\u2019s method was the optimal design.\n\nIn the future, engineers could mimic the mollusk\u2019s construction and create aragonite fiber-optic cables that might out-perform the ones we have today. These devices of tomorrow could rapidly transport information over long distances and revolutionize wireless communications. They might even allow for a key innovation: transmitting light without an expensive reflective coating on the cable, which is needed by the standard technology today, per Science News\u2019 Elie Dolgin.\n\nThe findings might also inform conservation work in the oceans. The clams, because of this innovative \u201csunblock,\u201d limit the UV light that could damage their DNA and that of the algae. As such, heart cockles tend to avoid bleaching in warmer waters, a phenomenon that affects both corals and other clams. Researchers say that using this fiber-optic technology could shield corals and their symbiotic algae in heating oceans.\n\n\u201cCan we maybe take inspiration from that to engineer new algae or new corals? A little bit more resilient, a little bit more robust?\u201d study lead author Dakota McCoy, an evolutionary biophysicist at the University of Chicago, says to NPR\u2019s Ari Daniel. After all, she adds to Science News, \u201cbillions of years of product design have gone into this.\u201d\n\nFruit bats have a special metabolism that prevents diabetes\n\nWhen humans consistently eat too much sugar, it can contribute to developing diabetes, a condition in which the body can\u2019t properly use insulin to regulate blood sugar. Worldwide, diabetes rates are expected to increase by 46 percent by 2045. But fruit bats don\u2019t have that problem\u2014they regularly eat twice their body weight in sugar-filled fruit each day without developing the autoimmune disease.\n\nTo understand why, researchers compared the DNA, kidneys and pancreas of Jamaican fruit bats, which have a diet high in sugar, and big brown bats, which have a high-protein diet of insects. They shared their results in Nature Communications in January.\n\nIn the fruit-eating bats, the pancreas contained more cells related to producing insulin and glucagon, hormones that regulate sugar. They found genetic changes that help the bats react to and process a vast amount of sugar. And the kidney, which filters waste from blood, helped the bats\u2019 bodies retain electrolytes. The organ had more cells meant to trap these salts, which resulted in fruit bats having more diluted, watery urine compared to big brown bats.\n\n\u201cEven small changes, to single letters of DNA, make this diet viable for fruit bats,\u201d Wei Gordon, co-lead author of the paper and a biologist at Menlo College, said in a statement. \u201cWe need to understand high-sugar metabolism like this to make progress helping the one in three Americans who are prediabetic.\u201d\n\nResearchers say the findings could help create a way for the human body to better detect insulin or sugar and react to it. But questions remain: Are other organs, such as the liver or small intestine, also involved in regulating sugar for Jamaican fruit bats? And can these findings apply to other kinds of bats, let alone humans?\n\nUsing the new knowledge to treat people with diabetes won\u2019t be immediate; it\u2019s \u201cvery much down the road,\u201d Gordon told NPR\u2019s Ari Daniel in August. But if researchers succeeded in finding an application to human health, \u201cthat would be the ultimate, \u2018Wow, we did it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFish swim in schools to save energy\n\nScientists have long understood that schooling together with their peers makes fish like the giant danio less vulnerable to predators. The coordinated expansions and contractions of the group could confuse a potential attacker and make any individual fish a less likely target. But researchers wondered whether schools serve another purpose, too: helping fish save energy.\n\nTo answer this question, researchers put giant danios on a type of treadmill for fish\u2014essentially, a closed loop for swimming that uses a propeller to create a current. As the fish moved against the flow, high-speed cameras captured their motions, and a probe measured how much oxygen they consumed, to reveal their energy expenditure. In some trials, the fish swam in a group; in others, they swam alone.\n\nThe findings, reported in PLOS Biology in June, showed that danios grouped in schools of eight used up to 79 percent less energy than the ones swimming solo. Essentially, like bikers in a peloton, the schooling fish could weather turbulence and save energy. No matter whether they were swimming in rough or calm waters, the school used the same amount of energy. A single fish had to increase its energy use by about 22 percent to maintain its speed against a current.\n\nUnderstanding these hydrodynamics could pave the way for advances in robotics. A fleet of flying drones, for instance, could follow the same principles to move together and save power. Or, possibly, swimming robots could take the shape of several schooling fish, rather than a single large one. Such devices might be able to tally fish populations or search for sources of pollution underwater, per Science News Explores\u2019 Andrea Tamayo.\n\nBut the findings could also have implications for fish themselves: As oceans warm, fish will have to expend more energy to swim and maintain their body temperature. So, taking note of their energy requirements when they move could help scientists to better predict how the animals will fare in a changing world. \u201cIn the face of climate change, we really want to understand things like [the energy needs] of fish,\u201d David Coughlin, a fish biologist at Widener University who was not involved in the study, told Science News Explores.\n\nTardigrades use extreme dehydration to withstand stress\n\nWhat can defeat a tardigrade? The eight-legged, microscopic animals are known for being nearly indestructible. They can bear the heat and pressure around deep-sea vents, endure temperatures just short of absolute zero and withstand several thousand times the radiation that would kill a human. The vacuum of outer space? Exploding out the barrel of a gun at nearly 2,000 miles per hour? Tardigrades can survive it. Even the five mass extinctions on our planet couldn\u2019t wipe them out.\n\nThese funny-looking creatures, also known as \u201cwater bears,\u201d can weather these extreme conditions by entering what\u2019s known as a tun state. They\u2019ll suspend their metabolism and eject 95 percent of their moisture, essentially shriveling into a dehydrated ball. In a paper published in PLOS One in January, scientists probed just how this hardy adaptation works.\n\nWhen researchers exposed tardigrades to the extreme cold, or things like sugar, salt or hydrogen peroxide, the animals began to produce free radicals, or oxygen atoms with an extra electron. As a result of their added charge, free radicals are very reactive and can destabilize DNA or proteins. Some scientists have even proposed that free radicals can lead to aging in humans and other creatures, though that idea is disputed.\n\nFree radicals in tardigrades react with a protein called cysteine, the team discovered, but when those reactions are blocked, tardigrades can\u2019t enter tun. Without cysteine, tardigrades also weren\u2019t able to survive freezing, even though they don\u2019t enter tun under that condition. This suggests the protein might play a larger role in the water bears\u2019 overall survivability. The findings might shed light on human aging or long-term space travel, or on dormant states such as cryptobiosis, researchers say.\n\nA second study, published in Protein Science in March, took this one step further and looked at how tardigrades endure tun. One of their tricks is to use what are known as known as cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble proteins, which form a gel that keeps the tardigrades\u2019 cells hydrated. Those researchers ejected the proteins into human cells and found they did the same thing\u2014made the cells more resistant to stress and slowed their metabolism.\n\nTo Silvia Sanchez-Martinez, lead author of the second study, this research doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re about to start preserving entire humans in an ultra-resilient, dehydrated state. Instead, she told Discover magazine\u2019s Cody Cottier, it might teach doctors how to pause tissue decay in organ transplant or trauma situations, such as in a war zone. Potentially, \u201cwe can stop or halt some of the injuries until we can address them properly,\u201d she said.\n\nChimpanzees use the forest as a pharmacy\n\nWhen chimpanzees are sick or wounded, research shows they might soothe themselves as humans do\u2014by seeking out medicines. But in their case, the primates use the forest as a pharmacy, seemingly picking and choosing leaves and woods with healing properties.\n\nIn a study published in PLOS One in June, researchers describe following two groups of chimpanzees in Uganda\u2019s Budongo Forest for eight months. They tracked what the animals ate, as well as whether or not they showed signs of illness, determined by checking for wounds and testing their urine and feces. The team zeroed in on a group of 13 plants eaten by the apes that had little nutritional value but carried antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits. In several cases, chimps with ailments went out of their way to look for these plants.\n\nScientists say this behavior could be a window into new drugs for humans. \u201cWe can\u2019t test [every plant] in these forests for their medicinal properties,\u201d says study lead author Elodie Freymann, a primatologist at the University of Oxford in England, to BBC News\u2019 Victoria Gill. \u201cSo why not test the plants that we have this information about\u2014plants the chimps are seeking out?\u201d\n\nIn another instance of self-medication, scientists recently witnessed an orangutan heal his own wound. In a paper published in May in Scientific Reports, researchers described the curious case of Rakus, a male Sumatran orangutan in Indonesia. The animal sustained a wound on his cheek, and just days later, he started chewing a plant called yellow root and rubbing its juices on the sore. The next day, he ate the plant\u2014even though yellow root typically makes up only 0.3 percent of the orangutans\u2019 diet. In less than a week, the wound closed, and it remained uninfected.\n\nBeyond potentially pointing humans toward discovering new natural remedies, the incident also suggests the ability to self-medicate originated long ago in the primate lineage. As study co-author Caroline Schuppli, a primatologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, told Nature News\u2019 Gayathri Vaidyanathan, \u201cit shows that orangutans and humans share knowledge.\u201d"

With 350 million people being unbanked in Africa and only 20% of families using formal banks, Fonbnk\u2019s solution is not only unique but also relevant. With the integration of the Stellar blockchain, Fonbnk allows users to redeem airtime for USDC and access the world of financial services.\n\n350 million people in Africa don't have access to bank accounts, and only 20% of families have formal bank accounts.@fonbnk1 provides a real-world solution to this problem by turning 8 billion active prepaid SIM cards globally into virtual debit cards with Stellar. Here's how\u2026 \u2014 Stellar (@StellarOrg) December 30, 2024\n\nThe platform takes advantage of the high penetrance rate of prepaid SIM cards in the continent. Fonbnk, with over 8 billion active prepaid SIM cards worldwide, connects these phone accounts into a financial interface so that users can engage in the digital economy.\n\nFonbnk\u2019s CEO, Chris Duffus, emphasized the potential of their solution, stating,\n\n\u201cIn many new markets where traditional financial services have given up, solutions like ours, combined with Stellar, can help billions join the digital financial world.\u201d\n\nSeamless Conversion of Airtime to USDC\n\nFonbnk\u2019s process is very straightforward and efficient. Customers load their Fonbnk wallets with their money or prepaid airtime, and the airtime is expressed in USDC on Stellar. Every airtime credit is equivalent to $0.01 of USDC, thus making the conversion easy. As a USDC holder, one can buy goods and services, gain access to services, or buy cheap airtime credits. To access cash, USDC can be swapped back through the Stellar anchors.\n\nThe integration with the Stellar network broadens Fonbnk\u2019s application. The company offers low and no-code tools for ease of use to non-technical users. These include:\n\nPayWidget: A non-custodial web dApp that allows for the easy adoption of the Stellar network into existing financial streams. It can facilitate movement from airtime to bank transfer without any difficulty.\n\nTopUp Widget: This tool allows customers to purchase airtime and send and receive mobile money without float balances. The customer\u2019s wallet balances in USDC facilitate all transactions.\n\nInstant Merchant Widget: Businesses can utilize this widget to accept USDC payments from merchants, offer customers the option to pay with airtime, and conduct transactions on mobile and web interfaces.\n\nStellar Lumens price analysis\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM) has been on the back foot recently, losing almost half of its value from the November peak. However, many technical signals and market conditions indicate a potential revival of cryptocurrency in the near future.\n\nThe XLM/USD is in the falling wedge structure, which is considered the reversal pattern. This pattern started in December when Stellar was traded at $0.600. The upper trendline links the highs of December 2, 17, and 24, while the lower trendline links the lows of December 3, 9, and 20.\n\nAs these lines converge, the chances of a breakout rise. Should a breakout happen, analysts believe the initial target will be $0.500, about 50% above the current price.\n\nSupport for this prediction stems from Fibonacci Retracement levels. The 61.8% level at $0.2970 is anticipated as a potential bottom for XLM, supported by a Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing oversold territory. This convergence of technical signals points to a possible rebound in January. As of this writing, XLM is trading at $0.33, registering a 1.45% decline in the last 24 hours.\n\nRecommended for you:"

            "article_content": "BENGALURU: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and University College London have developed a machine learning method to predict material properties using limited data. They believe this can aid in the discovery of materials with desired properties, such as semiconductors.\u201cIn recent years, materials engineers have turned to machine learning models to predict which types of materials can possess specific properties such as electronic band gaps, formation energies, and mechanical properties, in order to design new materials,\u201d IISc said.It added that, however, data on material properties \u2013 which is needed to train these models \u2013 is limited because testing materials is expensive and time-consuming. This prompted researchers led by Sai Gautam Gopalakrishnan, Assistant Professor at the Department of Materials Engineering, IISc, to work on addressing this challenge.In a new study, they found an efficient way to use a machine learning approach called transfer learning to predict the values of specific material properties.In transfer learning, a large model is first pre-trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned to adapt to a smaller target dataset. \u201cIn this method, the model first learns to do a simple task like classifying images into, say, cats and non-cats, and is then trained for a specific task, like classifying images of tissues into those containing tumours and those not containing tumours for cancer diagnosis,\u201d Gopalakrishnan said.Their transfer learning-based model demonstrated superior performance compared to models trained from scratch, Reshma Devi, the study's lead author, said. The team\u2019s Multi-property Pre-Training (MPT) framework achieved remarkable results by simultaneously training on seven different bulk 3D material properties. Most notably, the model successfully predicted band gap values for 2D materials it never encountered during training.Looking ahead, the technology shows promise for battery development by predicting ion movement within electrodes. \u201cThis research could contribute significantly to India\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing initiatives by helping predict material defects,\u201d Gopalakrishnan said."

One of the most common blood tests in the world, CBC tests are run billions of times each year to diagnose conditions and monitor patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut despite the test\u2019s ubiquity, the way clinicians interpret and use it in the clinic is often less precise than ideal. Currently, blood test readings are based on one-size-fits-all reference intervals that don\u2019t account for individual differences.\n\nI am a mathematician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and my team studies ways to use computational tools to improve clinical blood testing. To develop better ways to capture individual patient definitions of \u201cnormal\u201d lab values, my colleagues and I in the Higgins Lab at Harvard Medical School examined 20 years of blood count tests from tens of thousands of patients from both the East and West coasts.\n\nIn our newly published research, we used machine learning to identify healthy blood count ranges for individual patients and predict their risk of future disease.\n\nClinical tests and complete blood counts\n\nMany people commonly think of clinical tests as purely diagnostic. For example, a COVID-19 or a pregnancy test comes back as either positive or negative, telling you whether you have a particular condition. However, most tests don\u2019t work this way. Instead, they measure a biological trait that your body continuously regulates up and down to stay within certain bounds.\n\nYour complete blood count is also a continuum. The CBC test creates a detailed profile of your blood cells \u2013 such as how many red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells are in your blood. These markers are used every day in nearly all areas of medicine.\n\nFor example, hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that allows your red blood cells to carry oxygen. If your hemoglobin levels are low, it might mean you are iron deficient.\n\nPlatelets are cells that help form blood clots and stop bleeding. If your platelet count is low, it may mean you have some internal bleeding and your body is using platelets to help form blood clots to plug the wound.\n\nWhite blood cells are part of your immune system. If your white cell count is high, it might mean you have an infection and your body is producing more of these cells to fight it off.\n\nNormal ranges and reference intervals\n\nBut this all raises the question: What actually counts as too high or too low on a blood test?\n\nTraditionally, clinicians determine what are called reference intervals by measuring a blood test in a range of healthy people. They usually take the middle 95% of these healthy values and call that \u201cnormal,\u201d with anything above or below being too low or high. These normal ranges are used nearly everywhere in medicine.\n\nBut reference intervals face a big challenge: What\u2019s normal for you may not be normal for someone else.\n\nNearly all blood count markers are heritable, meaning your genetics and environment determine much of what the healthy value for each marker would be for you.\n\nAt the population level, for example, a normal platelet count is approximately between 150 and 400 billion cells per liter of blood. But your body may want to maintain a platelet count of 200 \u2013 a value called your set point. This means your normal range might only be 150 to 250.\n\nDifferences between a patient\u2019s true normal range and the population-based reference interval can create problems for doctors. They may be less likely to diagnose a disease if your set point is far from a cutoff. Conversely, they may run unnecessary tests if your set point is too close to a cutoff.\n\nDefining what\u2019s normal for you\n\nLuckily, many patients get blood counts each year as part of routine checkups. Using machine learning models, my team and I were able to estimate blood count set points for over 50,000 patients based on their history of visits to the clinic. This allowed us to study how the body regulates these set points and to test whether we can build better ways of personalizing lab test readings.\n\nOver multiple decades, we found that individual normal ranges were about three times smaller than at the population level. For example, while the \u201cnormal\u201d range for the white blood cell count is around 4.0 to 11.0 billion cells per liter of blood, we found that most people\u2019s individual ranges were much narrower, more like 4.5 to 7, or 7.5 to 10. When we used these set points to interpret new test results, they helped improve diagnosis of diseases such as iron deficiency, chronic kidney disease and hypothyroidism. We could note when someone\u2019s result was outside their smaller personal range, potentially indicating an issue, even if the result was within the normal range for the population overall.\n\nThe set points themselves were strong indicators for future risk of developing a disease. For example, patients with high white blood cell set points were more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes in the future. They were also nearly twice as likely to die of any cause compared with similar patients with low white cell counts. Other blood count markers were also strong predictors of future disease and mortality risk.\n\nIn the future, doctors could potentially use set points to improve disease screening and how they interpret new test results. This is an exciting avenue for personalized medicine: to use your own medical history to define what exactly healthy means for you.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The country may not be out of the woods yet. Still, the economy has made a tremendous comeback, and the country has finally gained political stability through presidential and general elections.\n\n\n\nHowever, if history is any guide, every time Sri Lanka recorded a modest success, dark clouds of complacency set in and reversed the economic gains, leading to another period of economic stagnation. That eventuality is the primary challenge in 2025. More so, considering that the current Government in power, with its ideological leaning and campaign promises, is more susceptible to being the harbinger of that sense of complacency.\n\n\n\nDuring the first three quarters of 2024, the economy grew at a cumulative 5.2 per cent, and it may grow around 5 per cent for the whole year, a major turnaround from the two previous years of negative growth. The country exited bankruptcy, and the Rupee appreciated against USD by 10%. During the first ten months, the budget deficit was down by 31 per cent, and tax revenue went up by 34 per cent.\n\n\n\nOverall, the country has made a remarkable comeback from the nadir of economic collapse two years ago - though some folks are complaining on primetime television news about not having rice to cook Milk Rice to celebrate the dawn of the New Year.\n\n\n\nAlso on the political front, the Sri Lankans, disenchanted with the old guard, elected a president and a government from a party that had in the past led a violent insurgency to capture power -- without the elites or the military launching a countercoup as it generally happened in many parts of the world, most recently in Thailand.\n\nWhile the rationale of the electoral choice of the majority of Sri Lankans is yet to be tested, the very spirit of peaceful transfer of power at the end of competitive multi-party elections is something everyone could be proud of.\n\nThe current administration cannot take credit for either of the above achievements, but it could for sticking with the IMF program and not upsetting the economic recovery process.\n\n\n\nHowever, now that it is firmly in power and the economy is in a recovery mood, the new Government of JVP/NPP may opt to chart its own economic course this year.\n\n\n\nThe greatest macroeconomic danger to the economy this year would be the Government walking back on the economic reform agenda of its predecessor. That reform agenda may be unpopular among groups with vested interests, but it worked, hence the economic recovery. There are already signs of the Government walking back on plans to restructure loss-making and under-performing State Owned Enterprises. There are other mutually exclusive goals, such as increasing the productivity of the government sector while keeping its mammoth 1.4 million workforce intact. Such missions are practically untenable.\n\n\n\nThe lack of clarity on its economic policies would also exacerbate the problem. The emphasis on statism would also affect the investor outlook while rewarding the vested interest in loss-making state-owned enterprises.\n\nEven if the Government does not seek a complete reversal of the economic reform agenda, the reform process would lose momentum \u2013 that is not to say its predecessors of the Ranil Wickremesinghe administration was decidedly gung-ho in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Government itself faces its own dilemma this year. One of the most concerning would be how it could stay true to its manifesto, which is vague at best in the implementation of its policies \u2013 and placate a microscopic minority of its core supporters, whose economic views run counter to the economic reality.\n\n\n\nOne could see the same predicament in the President\u2019s India visit, where he said all the right things, which his predecessor had already told but failed to add anything new and substantial in harnessing India\u2019s economic success to leapfrog ours.\n\n\n\nHe should avoid the repetition in his visit to Beijing and seek to venture beyond what his predecessors have already done to expand the economic cooperation \u2013 as any forward-looking emerging economy would do.\n\nThough its political and economic orientation may be different, the challenge it faced is not unique to the JVP/NPP government. Successive Sri Lankan government policies were the biggest inter-generational drag on the country\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\n\n\nThe Government should avoid this eventuality. It could do so by setting the most generalizable measure of a country\u2019s economic performance- economic growth rate- as the gauge of its performance. That would also provide a way out of its ideological straight jacket and probably silence its fellow travellers.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, though, the government members seem to be busy in front of TV cameras, outing the crooks of the former Government. That is a spectacle in which the Yahapalanaya itself indulged, and it ended without a single successful conviction. When that fanfare was over, Yahapalanaya did not have anything tangible to show for the worth of its Government.\n\n\n\nThe JVP/NPP administration should also avoid that eventuality. The best course of action in the New Year would be alongside the corruption busting, which everyone loves to see; it should stick to the course of economic reforms \u2013 and venture beyond what its predecessor had already mapped out.\n\n\n\nHappy New Year 2025!"

Hurricanes Milton and Helene brought a bill of $50 billion, while other losses were incurred because of a \"high frequency\" of severe thunderstorms. In total, the U.S. saw two-thirds of the planet's total insured losses.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen looking at the wider picture, there was a 6% increase in global economic losses from natural disasters in 2024 when compared to the previous year, and it was the fifth consecutive year of insured losses topping $100 billion.\n\nIn Europe, intense flooding was estimated to have caused $10 billion in insured losses, while this weather phenomenon also brought financial losses in the Gulf region.\n\nWhy is Swiss Re's report concerning?\n\nIn early December, the Copernicus Climate Change Service confirmed that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, coming after the previous record set in 2023.\n\nThat's an alarming pattern, and according to Swiss Re, if we don't get a handle on rising global temperatures \u2014 which exacerbate extreme weather events \u2014 it's anticipated that \"losses are likely to increase.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Adaptation is therefore key, and protective measures, such as dykes, dams and flood gates, are up to 10 times more cost-effective than rebuilding,\" the company said in a statement, according to Fox 28.\n\nWhat can be done to protect against losses from extreme weather?\n\nPrevention from the potential damage caused by extreme weather is indeed becoming more crucial as multiple insurers have either pulled coverage for losses incurred following hurricanes and flooding or else are severely increasing the cost of premiums.\n\nWhat would you do if natural disasters were threatening your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nThat's why Savannah Trims president Gene Kennedy, whose company makes flood protection barriers, emphasized to The Cool Down that businesses and homeowners should investigate what kind of products are available to protect properties from the damage and financial losses caused by extreme weather events.\n\nBut these figures also demonstrate the importance of reducing the rate of rising global temperatures by curbing our production of planet-warming pollution.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the ways to do so are swapping gas-guzzling cars for electric versions, eating more plant-based foods, and investing in renewable energy technology.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

The antisemitic persecution continued even after the Soviet Army liberated the city from the Nazis, as they sought to arrest the rabbi who was taking care of her because he rescued Jewish children from orphanages. So they fled in the middle of the night.\n\nVilunya Diskin\u2019s earliest memory is as a 4-year-old, traveling on a train through a country that no longer exists, being implored to stay quiet as she and others fled the genocidal violence convulsing much of Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVilunya Diskin sat in her home in Jamaica Plain. She recently discovered through genealogy testing and records in Europe and Israel who her birth parents and twin sister were. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\n\nDiskin\u2019s flight would eventually bring her to the United States, where she was adopted by a Jewish family and raised in California before settling in Boston as a young adult. She would become a feminist icon when she co-authored the seminal text \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d in 1970.\n\nBut she never saw her parents again, nor did she know what had become of her twin sister. The answers would be lost to the cataclysm of the war until, eight decades later, she finally found out who she really is.\n\nMemory can be a tricky thing. In Diskin\u2019s earliest recollection, she is the ward of a rabbi, Israel Leiter, and his family, and believes they had fled Poland and were traveling through what was then-Czechoslovakia. Before Leiter, Diskin had been hidden away for years by a Catholic woman who was a childhood friend of her father. Her twin sister wasn\u2019t so lucky. Unbeknownst to Diskin, her sibling was dead.\n\nYears later, as a college student at the University of California, Berkeley in the early 1960s, she would flip through Polish-language magazines, searching for photos of her sister, though she could no longer understand the words. She eventually made requests to archivists in Israel who specialize in information about those killed in the Holocaust. There were obstacles, missing or incorrect bits of information, which complicated her search. She had the wrong year and wrong location of her birth. She had her parents\u2019 last name, but not their first names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVilunya Diskin with Ester Leiter. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\n\nA longtime resident of Jamaica Plain and now 83, Diskin finally has some answers. Her parents were named Salomon and Edzia, and she knows the identities of her grandparents and great-grandparents, what some of them did for work, and when some were born, married, and died.\n\nAnd thanks to the work of the Holocaust Reunion Project, she now knows her birth name: Wilhelmina Fliegelman.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s like a rebirth,\u201d she said recently in between sips of tea at a cafe in her Boston neighborhood. \u201cHere I am in my 80s and it\u2019s a whole new chapter.\u201d\n\nSpecialists in Ashkenazi Jewish genealogy, Jennifer Mendelsohn and Adina Newman, pieced together Diskin\u2019s past. In this case, they used a DNA match list that included distant familial connections to Diskin to reverse-engineer her family tree, using available records and databases from Europe and Israel to fill in the gaps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with meaning,\u201d Newman said during a recent interview.\n\nVilunya Diskin with Rabbi Israel Leiter. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\n\nFor both her and Mendelsohn, the discovery of family roots and relatives can be rewarding, but also bittersweet.\n\n\u201cThese are always happy reunion stories but they\u2019re built on a foundation of very, very, very, awful, painful trauma,\u201d Mendelsohn said.\n\nDiskin\u2019s parents, she has discovered, worked in a bakery run by her grandfather. She has the address of the bakery, as well as the address of her first home in Lviv, which is now in present-day Ukraine. She hopes to visit after the latest war in that part of the world \u2014 a conflict that has pitted Ukraine against Russia \u2014 is over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is profound,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is profound to fill those holes.\u201d\n\nHer twin sister\u2019s name was Amalia. The Catholic woman who took her in when her parents were taken away was Anna Demenczuk, and Diskin lived with her for three years. When her father, Salomon, failed to return after Lviv was liberated, Demenczuk honored his wishes that Diskin be raised by a Jewish family, giving her over to Leiter, a local rabbi. After fleeing through Europe, Leiter and his family eventually emigrated to New York, taking Diskin with them. In the United States, she was adopted by a Jewish American couple at the age of 7 and grew up in California.\n\nOur Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era Handout\n\nIn her youth, she was drawn to the Civil Rights Movement because, she said, of her background surviving the Holocaust. She saw parallels between the treatment of Black Americans and the historic oppression of Jews.\n\nShe has lived in Greater Boston since the mid-1960s. In her 20s, she was a member of a local 13-member collective that wrote \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves,\u201d an influential text that has been celebrated as the bible of women\u2019s health, updated multiple times over the decades to introduce generations of girls to their own anatomy. That advocacy was born out of frustration with how little doctors knew about how women\u2019s bodies worked and how they failed to listen to female patients.\n\nDiskin cuts an energetic presence, willing to discuss modern-day politics or history with a smiling frankness. Nowadays, she worries the United States is \u201cgalloping backward into the 19th century\u201d regarding women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cThe women\u2019s movement has always said that knowledge is power,\u201d said Diskin, who has two children and three grandchildren. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, learning her own history has made her feel even more powerful, she said. When she received a trove of information in September that revealed so much about her family and her past, Diskin said she did not cry but did feel so overwhelmed that she took a long nap.\n\nLemberg Ghetto, USSR, World War II, 1941-1944. Lemberg, formerly part of Poland, was captured by the Soviet Union in 1939. A ghetto was created in 1941 by Nazi Germany, which held the city during much of World War II. The Jewish population of the city was almost completely exterminated, with thousands sent to Belzec concentration camp. Renamed Lviv, the city, also known as Lwow or Lvov, is now in Ukraine. Heritage Images/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis information is so big,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so gigantic.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there are remaining mysteries she may never unravel. She knows when and where her mother died; she was not sent to a concentration camp but to a ghetto established specifically for Jews in Lviv, Diskin said. Her mother died the same year she was born. But she does not know what became of her father. She assumes he was killed in the Holocaust; otherwise, he would have returned for her. He would have known where to look, she said. And while she knows that her twin sister died at only three months of age, she does not know the circumstances of her death.\n\nStill, she is buoyed and heartened by the new revelations. She now has photos of her biological parents, whose faces she previously could not conjure up. She has cousins she never knew about in Israel and Australia. She has corresponded with the son of Demenczuk, the woman who took her in. She considers him a long-lost brother. And she is pushing for Demenczuk\u2019s name to be added to a memorial in Israel honoring those who risked their safety to save Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nThe only heaviness she felt in finally receiving the news of her birth parents was that she could not share it with her husband, Martin, who died in 1997. She is a self-described optimist, someone who wakes up happy, and she credits researchers like Mendelsohn and Newman, as well as \u201cthe miracle\u201d of DNA testing, that allowed \u201cimportant facts\u201d to be realized. The Nazis, she said, tried to erase Jews from history, and this kind of research is a form of justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s righteous work,\u201d Diskin said, \u201cand it\u2019s important work.\u201d\n\nFlowers, candles, and a flag of Israel at the memorial to the victims of Lviv ghetto during the commemoration ceremony of the 80th anniversary of the liquidation of the Lviv ghetto and Janowska concentration camp on Nov. 12, 2023, in Lviv, Ukraine. More than 136,000 Jews were resettled to the Lviv ghetto, the third-largest ghetto in Eastern Europe.

            "article_content": "'What the f**k is that?' a young jackaroo on a remote cattle station asks the other three blokes riding rough in the tray of a HiLux ute.\n\n'Lindsay\u2026. that's a Min Min light! And if it catches up to us, we'll all disappear into the sky,' a rugged Indigenous stockman named William replied in terror.\n\nBaffled and confused, Lindsay turned and asked: 'What the hell is a Min Min light?'\n\nSince the dawn of man, every ancient civilisation has detailed strange sights in the sky.\n\nAncient Egyptians carved hieroglyphs of 'sky gods' into their monuments, the Romans reported seeing 'gleaming' lights above their cities at night, while Hindu mythology and the Bible mention glowing 'chariots' hovering among the clouds.\n\nAustralia also has its own version of UFOs - or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) as they've now come to be known after a rebrand by NASA.\n\nAnd the first recorded encounters with 'conscious' glowing orbs unfolded in the 1870s, in the remote Queensland mining outpost of Min Min.\n\nSince then, it has become a hub for the strange phenomenon, with hundreds of documented sightings leading it to be dubbed Australia's Area 51.\n\nBoulia, population 230, is ground zero for the eerie phenomenon dubbed Min Min lights\n\nFootage shows an object purported to be a Min Min light spotted east of Boulia in November 2021 at about 10pm\n\nIn the year 2000, a Min Min light tourism centre even opened up there, welcoming thousands of visitors from across the world each year.\n\nResting on a lonely stretch of road between Boulia and Winton, in the central west of the Sunshine State, the tiny community sprang to life as the first commercial copper mines in the region were established in the 1860s.\n\n'The first recorded sightings were in 1879 at the Min Min pub,' Karen Savage, a tourism officer at the Min Min Encounter centre in Boulia, tells me.\n\n'But local Indigenous people say sightings go back as long as there have been people here.'\n\nThere are many differing beliefs surrounding Min Min lights, depending on what part of the country they appear.\n\nSome say the lights are there to guide lost travellers back home, while others fear the orbs lead wandering souls to their doom.\n\nMany also claim the lights appear out of nowhere, just to play tricks on them.\n\n'We don't know why this area has become a hub. But we do know that the prevalence of sightings here are far higher than the rest of Australia,' Ms Savage says.\n\nMin Min has become a hub for the strange phenomenon, with hundreds of documented sightings leading it to be dubbed Australia's Area 51\n\n'They can appear, disappear and reappear. It can be just one light or it can be multiple lights and while most of the sightings are white, there are also recorded sightings in various different colours - like green, blue, purple, yellow.\n\n'Local Indigenous people in the Boulia area mainly see them as a light that would guide them home.\n\n'In other areas, they see the lights as ancestral spirits in unrest - and dangerous.'\n\nThat's certainly the case for local Aboriginal people in the Barkly Tablelands region of the Northern Territory, where one of the country's largest cattle stations, Alroy Downs, is located.\n\nLindsay Pyne travelled to the area to work as a jackaroo in the mid 1990s, when he was just 17.\n\nFor many rough and ready country kids who had just left high school, it was a rite of passage to head to the Outback and muster cattle before settling on a trade.\n\nNowadays, the uniquely Australian custom has largely given way to gap-year Contiki tours overseas.\n\nKeen for adventure and unafraid of hard work, Lindsay fit in perfectly with the no-nonsense crew of stockmen.\n\nAmong them was an Aboriginal elder in a cowboy hat named William - who wore black stubbies and a blue singlet every day, with tattered R. M. Williams boots and no socks.\n\n'The bloke who owned the farm said he couldn't run the joint without William because he knew every square inch of the property - and being an elder, he just knew everything there was to know about the bush as well,' Lindsay tells me.\n\n'He took a shine to me and when we'd get sent off in groups of two or three, I'd often go with him and he would often tell me things about the dreamtime.'\n\nLindsay Pyne (pictured recently) once saw a Min Min light when he was working as a young jackeroo\n\nBecause the property was so large, the men would be camping away from the homestead about 50 per cent of the time.\n\nAccording to Lindsay, if they were more than 150km out, they would just set up camp, if it was less than that, they'd ride their horses back to the homestead or pile into a ute.\n\nOn this particular day, they were right on the boundary and it was getting dark.\n\nBut after a gruelling day's work, they decided to head back for a warm shower and comfy bed.\n\n'I was on the back of the ute with him and I looked over to the right and there it was - this weird white light - maybe the size of a soccer ball,' Lindsay recalls.\n\n'I thought it was the spotty of a roo shooter. But you've gotta understand, where it was coming from, there are no tracks. It's tufted grass, so you couldn't even ride a motorbike through there.\n\n'So there is no way someone was hunting out there or in a vehicle.'\n\nLindsay says he wasn't afraid - until he saw the look of horror on William's face.\n\n'He said to me, \"If the light comes we'll all disappear into the sky.\" He was hysterical,' Lindsay recounts.\n\n'Everyone looked up to him so we were more scared of it because of the way he was reacting to it. You gotta understand that this is the toughest guy you'd ever meet.'\n\nWilliam slammed on the roof of the twin cab and told the driver to gun it.\n\nWhile encounters and descriptions of Min Min lights vary considerably, one of the most common observations is that the orbs appear 'intelligent, conscious and curious'.\n\n'It sort of moves with you and always feels like it's getting closer. It started off the size of a soccer ball and then got bigger and bigger,' Lindsay says.\n\n'It kind of seemed like it wanted to follow us or something. It's hard to explain.'\n\nWhile encounters and descriptions of Min Min lights vary considerably, one of the most common observations is that the orbs appear 'intelligent, conscious and curious' (stock photo)\n\nDespite the enduring mystery, there are many possible scientific explanations for what could cause the phenomenon.\n\nOne theory is known as Fata Morgana - which takes its name from the Italian term for the Arthurian sorceress the Morgan Fairy, who was said to lure sailors to their deaths with bewitching lights, like fairy castles in the air.\n\nFata Morgana occurs when a layer of warm air rests over a layer of cooler air, causing light rays, from tens or even hundreds of kilometres away, to bend in a narrow band around the horizon.\n\nWhen these temperature inversions happen, it can often create a mirage or make objects appear distorted.\n\nA famous example of this is when ships can appear as though they are floating above the water.\n\nOthers believe sightings of Min Min lights are merely just lights from camp fires, far-off moving vehicles, aircraft or buildings.\n\nBut no definitive explanation has ever been proven.\n\nThe eerie inside story of Australia's most infamous UFO sighting: Witnesses threatened, a government cover-up and the official report so explosive it was destroyed after the death of its author\n\nBy Steve Jackson for Daily Mail Australia\n\nThere was no sound to begin with, just an eerie shape, looming in from the distance. Some say it looked like a giant silver cigar, others a flying saucer, a metallic disc, shimmering overhead.\n\nAs the craft slowed to a hover above Westall High School, the children in the playground started screaming. One of the eyewitnesses, Mary Eastwood, said it felt like 'the end of the world'. Students were running around, hysterical, or throwing themselves to the ground in panic. Mary and her friend sat on the perimeter fence, dumbstruck.\n\nThe only thing we know for sure almost 60 years later is that something strange and unnerving happened at the school, just south-east of Melbourne, on an April morning in 1966. Official efforts to dismiss the eye-witness reports by insisting the 'craft' was nothing more than a stray weather balloon have never quite succeeded and a secret government report into the incident has never been released.\n\nIndeed, that explosive report - authored by a high-ranking aviation official - is believed to rubbish the official explanation that the mysterious object was a high-altitude balloon.\n\nSo, it is no surprise that many of the people at Westall that day \u2013 students, teachers and residents of nearby Clayton South \u2013 resolutely believe what they saw was an alien spacecraft, a UFO. And now, even more astonishingly, a leading UFO investigator says what they actually encountered might have been a captured alien craft deployed as part of secret U.S. military tests.\n\nAuthor Ross Coulthart has spent decades investigating the Westall incident and is convinced the truth has been deliberately covered up.\n\nThe key to the mystery lies in the secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting of an unidentified craft which is still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the document, it was compiled in 1967 by an engineer - known only as 'Mr X' - who was working as the Assistant Controller of the Aircraft, Guided Weapons and Electronics Supply Division of the government's now-defunct Department of Supply.\n\nLeading UFO investigator Ross Coulthart claims the truth about the Westall incident has been deliberately covered up, with a secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives\n\nA purported photograph of the Westall UFO incident, in which almost 200 students, teachers and residents in south-east Melbourne claimed to have witnessed an unexplained flying object hovering near a suburban school before descending onto a nearby open field in 1966\n\nA newspaper clipping outlining what several witnesses saw on that fateful day in 1966\n\nCoulthart claims only two copies of the 'Westall Papers' were ever made. One was destroyed by Mr X's widow on his orders after his death, while the other remains hidden from public sight.\n\n'One of the things that happened in the wake of the Westall incident was that an official, who was very senior in Australian aviation, was retained by Defence to write an investigation into what took place that day,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'He's since died... but I have spoken with the son of the man who wrote the report.\n\n'He says his father worked on the report in the family home and that he became aware as a child of the fact that his dad was travelling to the Westall school for three or four days in a row in what became an extraordinarily intense investigation.\n\n'And his father was so freaked out by what he discovered \u2013 the implications of what he learned \u2013 that he gave a secret copy of the Westall Papers to his wife and told her to keep it hidden away in a particular location in the family home.\n\n'He made her promise she would destroy it when he died but, essentially, that was his insurance policy.\n\n'Mr X's son doesn't know what was precisely revealed in that document, but he does have a strong recollection of his father's position on the Westall incident, and believes the truth went well beyond the simple spy balloon explanation.\n\n'He watched his mother burn the report in their back garden after his father died but there is another copy that was the filed with the Department of Supply.'\n\nCoulthart, a five-times Walkley Award-winning investigative journalist, says the mystery file was transferred to the Defence archives after the Department of Supply was dissolved in June 1974.\n\nINTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED CRAFT\n\nAndrew Greenwood was a teacher at Westall High School when the unexplained incident occurred \u2013 and says he was later threatened into silence.\n\nHe vividly recalls a 'hysterical' student running into his Year 9 science class during first break, claiming there was a flying saucer in the sky. While dubious at first, Mr Greenwood nonetheless went outside and was shocked to see a bright silver object 'the size of a car' hovering in the air near the school.\n\nHe said the object began to slowly rise into the sky before it was approached by five aircraft. Whenever these aircraft drew close to the silver object, it quickly darted in a different direction before stopping again.\n\nThe cat-and-mouse encounter continued for about 20 minutes before the object landed briefly in a nearby field - known as the Grange Reserve - then shot away and vanished into the sky entirely.\n\nAndrew Greenwood, one of the teachers at Westall High School during the UFO encounter, has described a frightening visit he received from government officials demanding he keep quiet\n\nTerry Peck, who was a student at Westall, shows former 60 Minutes investigative reporter Ross Coulthart a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school in April 1966\n\nWithin 40 minutes, air force and army personnel poured into the area in military vehicles and formed a secure barrier around the reserve. But, knowing the area well, Mr Greenwood and dozens of students were able to sneak in and see what was going on.\n\n'[We saw a] circular area, like trampled grass,' Mr Greenwood says. 'And there were guards around it and there were people in there with equipment.'\n\nMr Greenwood remains convinced the object he witnessed was an alien aircraft.\n\n'I saw a craft. A mechanical object intelligently controlled hovering above me,' he told Coulthart in The Phenomenon, a documentary released in 2022.\n\nHe added that after discussing the incident with local news reporters, Mr Greenwood received an unexpected \u2013 and unwelcome \u2013 late-night visit at his home from two men claiming to be government officials.\n\nAccording to him, one was wearing plain clothes and the other a high-ranking air force uniform. They told him his recollection of the incident was incorrect - and he would be well advised to stop talking about the encounter.\n\n'When I tried to explain to them that they weren't there - I was - and I knew what I saw, well, the first suggestion was, 'You'd be ill-advised to go on saying that because clearly you were drunk on duty and will have to be reported to the education department and of course you will lose your job',' he says.\n\n'Absolutely, I was threatened. I was told that I should not say anything.'\n\nHe believes the intimidating visit was part of a government conspiracy to cover up the country's largest mass UFO encounter.\n\nEYEWITNESSES THREATENED\n\nOne oft-reported explanation for the Westall incident is that the object could have been a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from the HIBAL program at Mildura Airport, about a six-hour drive away in Victoria's north-west.\n\nThe program was established by Australia's Department of Supply in conjunction with the US Atomic Energy Commission in 1960. It purportedly used white and silver high-altitude balloons to sample the levels of radioactive elements injected into the stratosphere by atomic experiments in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSome sceptics have suggested the object spotted hovering over the Westall school in 1966 was a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from Mildura Airport about six hours away\n\nBut Coulthart - who has led investigations across ABC's Four Corners, Nine's 60 Minutes and Seven's Sunday Night flagship news and current affairs programs - is convinced there is a more sinister explanation.\n\n'Andrew's account is extraordinarily credible,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'And he's adamant that what he saw was something anomalous that he couldn't explain away as a balloon or anything like that.\n\n'In fact, he says categorically that it was not a balloon of any kind whatsoever, that it was clearly some kind of craft.\n\n'He says he saw an elliptical, metallic disc-shaped object moving in some intelligent way.\n\n'And he's not the only one. There are well over 180 witnesses who saw the exact same thing - people like Terry Peck, who has a particularly vivid memory of what she saw, and who is equally adamant 'it was not a balloon'.\n\nPeck, a former student at Westall, provided Coulthart with a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school.\n\nRecounting that fateful April day, she claimed she jumped over the school fence and raced towards where the UFO had landed in the pines.\n\nBy the time she arrived, two other classmates were already there. One of them, a girl, was hysterical. Peck alleges the student was carried off in an ambulance and never came back to school.\n\nWhat happened next still troubles her.\n\n'We all got called to an assembly... and they told us all to keep quiet,' she says.\n\n'I know this sounds corny, but I know what I saw. It was not a balloon. It was a machine, a craft.'\n\n'I'd absolutely just like someone to come forward from the services just to say, \"Yes, it did happen, and it landed and there was a cover-up\".'\n\nCoulthart says he has since spoken to multiple people who attended the assembly who all shared the same story.\n\n'They all describe how there were officials from the government and people in uniform who were standing up the back of the hall who were listening to what was being said to the students,' he says.\n\nAnd it wasn't only the students being warned.\n\n'We've spoken to firemen who attended the incident, and numerous people who were told - threatened - that if they talked about this, this was a national security issue, and that they should shut up about it,' Coulthart says.\n\nFive-time Walkley Award-winning journalist Ross Coulthart vows he will continue investigating the 'non-human technology' involved in encounters such as the Westall mass sighting despite ongoing attempts to discredit anyone who speaks out about the 'biggest story in history'\n\n'Moreover, when the recovery operation happened, there were American-accented personnel driving American left-hand-drive jeeps.\n\n'So, it's just absurd to try to patronise these witnesses by saying, 'You don't know what you saw, it was just a spy or weather balloon'. That's bollocks, absolute rubbish.'\n\nPUBLIC LEFT IN DARK\n\nCoulthart has spent years pushing for the Westall Papers to be made public, but fears they may remain locked away in the Defence Department forever. In the absence of the full report, he has been able to assemble only tantalising pieces of the jigsaw.\n\n'Certainly, there was detailed analysis that was done: soils removed, there were radiation detectors used, Geiger counters used,' Coulthart says.\n\n'It was the most extraordinarily intense investigation and the public has been completely left in the dark.\n\n'I suspect there was a finding [in the Westall Papers] that the object was American technology. I am convinced the Americans have been using Australia as a secret location for testing of technology - non-human technology - that became too sensitive to test in places like Area 51, the Nevada Test Range.\n\n'There's been an ongoing Cold War between the Russians, the Chinese and the Americans over who gets access to this retrieved, non-human technology - and fighting for the knowledge of how to use it and how to develop and replicate it.\n\n'We've moved beyond the argument about whether these things are real. It's been formally admitted that they're real.\n\n'What we have now is a continuing attempt at a feeble cover-up by the Pentagon and the intelligence community, which, I suspect, believes that it can derive some kind of hegemonical American military advantage from the technology that it is hiding.\n\n'That is why the public is being lied to about incidents like Westall, and why this is being concealed.'\n\nTHE ROAD AHEAD\n\nThe Westall sighting has become one of the most enduring of Australian mysteries.\n\nThe incident has not only featured in a raft of popular documentaries, but has also been commemorated at the site itself with a UFO-themed playground.\n\nHIBAL balloons were used to sample the levels of radioactive elements in the atmosphere\n\nOfficially, the Department of Defence will not comment on the existence of the Westall Papers and critics continue to dismiss Coulthart's work. However, the investigator says that despite the passage of time, he will continue to push for the release of Mr X's secret report.\n\n'I have been vilified and attacked for investigating the technology involved in these kinds of encounters,' he tells me.\n\n'Numerous people I have spoken to have told me it is routine for people who are working inside this secret program to be intimidated and threatened with death if they reveal what they know.\n\n'But there is no amount of intimidation or bullying or threats that will stop me from investigating this. It's too far down the track.\n\n'This is the biggest story in human history, and I know it's real.'"

            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 delves into the mysteries behind some of the most puzzling reported UFO sightings, including the popular Calvine sighting. In August 1990, two chefs working at a Scottish hotel went hiking in Calvine, Scotland, only to allegedly come across a diamond-shaped aircraft. The duo then reportedly clicked six photographs of the unbelievable sight, which were passed on to the tabloid newspaper, Daily Record. When the authorities learned about the incident, the photographs were sent to the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defence. Since then, the Calvine sighting remained a myth, but only until Craig Lindsay startled the world with a photograph he had safeguarded for decades!\n\nCraig Lindsay Secretly Possessed the Alleged Calvine UFO Sighting Photograph For Over 30 Years\n\nCraig Lindsay was born in the Scottish town of Kilbirnie. His career began with short stints as a journalist at the Dalkeith Advertiser and the Fife Herald. In the 1960s, he left the world of journalism to work in the PR departments of the Scottish Tourist Board and Vauxhall Motors. He eventually became a civil servant by joining the Scottish Office. During this period, he covered several tragedies, including the Chernobyl disaster. Lindsay joined the Royal Air Force\u2019s Scotland and Northern Ireland division as a PR officer in 1989. The very next year, he became the first official to talk to one of the two chefs who allegedly encountered a UFO in Calvine.\n\nAfter the two chefs had submitted the photographs they had taken to the Daily Record, Lindsay was responsible for collecting and sending them to the Ministry of Defense in London, England. However, before completing this task, he broke the rules and kept a copy of one of the six photographs with him. The illegal print remained inside his desk for the next three decades, safely inside a copy of the book, \u2018Great Aircraft of the World.\u2019 The print Lindsay possessed was revealed to the world through the investigative journalist and lecturer David Clarke. The latter met the retired RAF officer in 2022 after reaching out to him in August 2021 without any awareness concerning the existence of the invaluable photograph\u2019s copy.\n\nCraig Lindsay Donated the Alleged Calvine UFO Sighting Photograph in 2022\n\nIn a way, Craig Lindsay eagerly waited for someone like David Clarke to lift a burden from him. \u201cI have been for waiting for someone to contact about this for more than 30 years,\u201d the retired RAF officer told the Journalist, as per Daily Mail. In June 2022, he decided to donate the photograph to Sheffield Hallam University. The donation was followed by an evaluation by the photographic specialist Andrew Robinson, who confirmed that the diamond-shaped object featured in the photograph was not integrated into it after it was clicked. Lindsay\u2019s actions attracted curious minds from across the globe to one of the most well-preserved photographs of an alleged UFO. As a former civil servant, it was not at all easy for him to unveil this prized possession to the world.\n\nLindsay was even scared of breaching the Official Secrets Act, especially since the Ministry of Defense and The National Archives wanted to keep the photograph hidden until 2076 due to privacy reasons. \u201cAs a press officer for Scotland, I dealt with many UFO reports but most were just of lights in the sky. It was obvious this one was different,\u201d Lindsay told Clarke, as per the same Daily Mail feature. \u201cWhen I asked what sort of noise it had made, the man said, \u2018It didn\u2019t make any noise at all.\u2019 Up to that point, I wasn\u2019t treating it very seriously, but when he said it was silent, I suddenly realized there is no aircraft that I know of that is silent,\u201d he added.\n\nCraig Lindsay Serves His Local Community With His Wife Today\n\nThe publication of the photograph placed Craig Lindsay in the limelight. However, his focus remains on leading a peaceful retired life with his beloved family in Waulkmill Steading, a small region near the Scottish city of Dunfermline. He continues to share his life with his constant companion and better half, Jennifer Lindsay, with whom he welcomed four children and six grandchildren. Lindsay concluded his time as an RAF officer in July 1999 with a short voyage aboard a Jaguar fighter. Following the remarkable send-off from service, he was invited by the Registrar General for Scotland to be part of the publicity campaign for the 2001 Scottish Census.\n\nThe campaign was a notable success, and Lindsay even earned a national award for his efforts. Over the years, he has been an unignorable presence in his local community. He occupied several positions after his retirement, such as the chairman of Limekilns and Charlestown Community Council and the Dunfermline Heritage Trust. In 2022, the former RAF officer retired from Scouting after leading the Dunfermline District Scout Committee for a considerable while. Lindsay has also served as a member of the Charlestown-based Queen\u2019s Hall committee. Nowadays, he is committed to fighting for the restoration of the Limekilns Pier as a trustee of the Limekilns Heritage Trust.\n\nIn December 2023, Lindsay and Jennifer marked a milestone in their relationship by celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. The joyous occasion was graced by a Coronation portrait of King Charles and Queen Camilla, who congratulated one of the British Empire\u2019s commendable retired servants. Even though \u2018The Program\u2019 turns the attention of the UFO enthusiasts to Lindsay, it appears to us that he won\u2019t be bidding adieu to his comfortable, quaint life in Waulkmill Steadings for a prolonged time in the limelight.\n\nRead More: Jason Sands: Where is the UFO Whistleblower Now?"

partly through techniques within the classroom; and partly through the narratives attached to the sciences.\n\n'Specifically, the curriculum should offer children a chance to learn about historic Western and non-Western contributions to the sciences, as well as cutting-edge contemporary research from diverse teams of scientists.\n\n'Teachers should be encouraged to frame historic examples of scientific discoveries in the context that some individuals, groups, cultures and nations were disadvantaged in their ability to participate in or to resource research and less able to claim credit and ownership for ideas that had been developed by them.'\n\nThe Royal Society of Biology also said it had sought expertise on 'decolonising the curriculum' and for a 'no more heroes' approach to teaching science in schools.\n\nThis would mean 'avoiding prescriptive lists of historic figures in biology' and instead 'exploring opportunities for local, recogniseable, diverse historic and contemporary figures through which discovery and exploration of biological concepts can be explored'.\n\nIt added that students should be encouraged to 'see a wide range of biologists in action'.\n\nThe Institute for Physics suggested that 'ideas should be framed in the context of the times in which discoveries were made and accredited within Western science'.\n\nIts submission to the curriculum review added: 'They can explain how many of those discoveries drew on earlier work in other parts of the world.\n\n'And how, during the period of growth of Western science, different groups, cultures and nations were more or less able to participate in research, resource scientific activity, or claim credit and ownership for ideas.'\n\nThe Royal Statistical Society called for the greater use of 'real-world data' - such as on gender inequalities or migration - in the teaching of maths and statistics.\n\n'The curriculum should be focused on solving problems using data rather than answering questions about data,' its submission added.\n\nTeaching unions are also among groups to have submitted evidence to the curriculum review.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders said the current curriculum 'prioritises a somewhat monocultural worldview, especially with regards to literature and history'.\n\nMs Phillipson has hailed the review as an 'important step in this Government's mission to break down barriers to opportunity, deliver better life chances and enable more young people to get on'.\n\nThe review is being chaired by Professor Becky Francis, who has spearheaded research into educational inequalities.\n\nTory MP Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said: 'Labour's curriculum changes will drive down educational standards.\n\n'Instead of continuing with a rich, knowledge-based curriculum which has led to our children being the best readers and mathematicians in the Western world, they are tearing it all up.\n\n'Pure education vandalism once again.'\n\nReform UK deputy leader Richard Tice hit out at 'a ludicrous proposal from the wokerati'.\n\nHe added: 'We need more historic British heroes and achievements to be taught to our children, not less.'"

            "article_content": "What\u2019s the appeal of quantum computers?\n\nThey can do things that classical computers can\u2019t. Google revealed in December that its latest quantum processor, Willow, had solved a problem in five minutes that the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers wouldn\u2019t have been able to solve even if they had been working on it since the universe began.\n\nExperimental quantum computers are typically given tasks that would confound a conventional computer because there are too many variable inputs. Their greatest potential is for modeling complex systems involving large numbers of moving parts whose characteristics change as they interact with one another. They might, for example, replicate the behavior of molecules to accelerate the development of new medicines, or simulate the decisions of economic actors and financial intermediaries to make market forecasting more accurate.\n\nQuantum computers are not expected to be of much use in the laborious but simpler work fulfilled by most of today\u2019s computers, which process a relatively limited number of isolated inputs sequentially on a mass scale.\n\nWho is building quantum computers?\n\nCanadian company D-Wave Quantum Inc. became the first to sell quantum computers in 2011. International Business Machines Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon Web Services and numerous startups have all created working quantum computers.\n\nMore recently, companies such as Microsoft Corp. have made progress toward building scalable and practical quantum supercomputers. Intel Corp. started shipping a silicon quantum chip to researchers with transistors, known as qubits (quantum bits), that are as much as 1 million times smaller than other qubit types.\n\nGoogle and IBM, alongside startups Universal Quantum and PsiQuantum Corp., claim they will deliver a useful quantum supercomputer by the end of the decade. China is building a $10 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences as part of a big push in the field.\n\nHow do quantum computers work?\n\nThey use tiny circuits to perform calculations, as do traditional computers. But they make these calculations in parallel, rather than sequentially, which is what makes them so fast. Regular computers process information in units called bits, which can represent one of two possible states \u2014 0 or 1 \u2014 that correspond to whether a portion of the computer chip called a logic gate is open or closed. Before a traditional computer moves on to process the next piece of information, it must have assigned the previous piece a value.\n\nBy contrast, thanks to the \u201cprobabilistic\u201d nature of quantum mechanics, the qubits in quantum computers don\u2019t have to be assigned a value until the computer has finished the whole calculation. This is known as \u201csuperposition.\u201d So whereas three bits in a conventional computer would only be able to represent one of eight possibilities \u2014 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 and 111 \u2014 a quantum computer of three qubits can process all of them at the same time. A quantum computer with 4 qubits can in theory handle 16 times as much information as an equally-sized conventional computer and will keep doubling in power with every qubit that\u2019s added. That\u2019s why a quantum computer can process exponentially more information than a classic computer."

            "article_content": "Google recently unveiled its latest quantum processor, named \u2018Willow\u2019. The research team that built it also tested it and the results were published in Nature.\n\nThey created a great level of buzz about the realisability of quantum computers that could tackle many practical problems.\n\nThe results also kicked up intriguing debates about explaining the power of quantum information processing and how they could solve problems that even the most powerful classical computers struggle with.\n\nBit versus qubit\n\nComputers process information stored in an array of 0s and 1s. In classical computers, some physical system with two possible states is used to represent these 0s and 1s. These physical systems are called bits. A common example is an electric circuit that allows two levels of voltage, one called 0 and the other called 1. A classical computer is a collection of bits together, and the information flowing in and out of bits is controlled and manipulated by physical operations called gate operations. For example, an AND gate accepts two inputs, each either 0 or 1, and outputs 1 if both inputs are 1 and 0 for any other combination of inputs.\n\nA quantum bit, or qubit, has two distinct states representing 0 and 1. More importantly, a qubit can be in states that are also combinations of 0 and 1. This feature is called quantum superposition. Classical bits can\u2019t do this. Because of this ability, each qubit needs two distinct numbers to represent the contributions of 0 and 1 respectively in the qubit\u2019s state. If we have two bits, we need two numbers, one for each bit, to represent the state of the collection. With two quantum bits, we need four numbers to represent the state. For 10 bits, we need 10 numbers to represent the state of the collection. For ten qubits, we need 210 (1,024) numbers.\n\nThis exponential growth in the information required to represent qubits\u2019 states and the superposition of states are the major reasons why quantum computers could be more efficient and powerful than classical computers. Like a classical computer, a quantum computer is also a collection of qubits and a host of physical operations called quantum gates that change the states of qubits to perform calculations.\n\nDifficult to isolate\n\nA major impediment to realising quantum computers is the fragile nature of quantum states. Specifically, while classical bits are robust and long-lasting, qubits are fragile and collapse quickly at the slightest disturbance. This in turn limits the amount of time for which qubits can hold information, how errors-free the quantum computer can keep its calculations, and how well a quantum computer can be scaled.\n\nIt is difficult to isolate a physical gadget to avoid perturbations due to external noise. Therefore, computations are prone to errors. For example, when a bit is expected to represent 0, there is a small chance it may be in the state representing 1. This is called the bit flip error. Methods to identify and fix these errors are called error-correction protocols.\n\nA single 0 is represented by three bits in the state 000 (corresponding to each bit in the state 0). If there is a bit-flip error, the resulting state could be 100, 010 or 001 (depending on whether the first, second or third bit is flipped). Similarly, 1 is represented as 111. If we need to encode 01 as the basic information, its true representation is 000111. Looking at the concatenated sequence in groups of three bits, the occurrence of 100, 010, 001, 011,101 or 110 will mean an error has crept in. When three physical bits represent one logical digit, it is easy to figure out which bit has flipped and correct it suitably before the next step in the computation.\n\nSimilarly, one way to mitigate the effect of errors in a quantum computer is to correct them using additional qubits that keep track of errors creeping in during computations. This is a logical answer to the error problem, it is however unsuitable for qubits in superposed states. Creating exact copies of unknown superposed states is prohibited by the no-cloning theorem of quantum physics. On the other hand, error correction often requires redundancy, i.e. providing more qubits than what is needed to encode information. This makes it clear more than one physical qubit is needed to represent a single logical qubit. (Qubits also have another type of error called phase flip error, which presents similar challenges to error correction.)\n\nOne effective method to detect and correct errors in a quantum computer without also violating the no-cloning theorem is called surface code. Here, engineers arrange an array of qubits on a grid. The qubits are grouped into two categories, namely data qubits and measurement qubits. While the error in data qubits is what we wish to identify and correct, any attempt to measure them will force them out of superposition and whatever information they encode will be lost.\n\nTo avoid this, the surface code method provides the set of measurement qubits. These qubits are entangled with data qubits through suitable gate operations. (If two qubits are entangled, any measurement of one particle will instantaneously cause the other particle to lose its superposition state.) In this setup, the presence of errors in the data qubits is inferred by making suitable measurements of the measurement qubits, while using the gates to prevent the data qubits from being affected, and thus correcting inconsistencies in the data qubits.\n\nThe error rate\n\nAccording to Google, its new quantum processor Willow has significantly better error correction and is thus significantly faster than other quantum computers, not to mention classical computers as well. The researchers who developed it tested it by using it to solve a computationally hard problem.\n\nWillow houses 105 physical qubits and operates at temperatures close to the theoretically possible lowest temperature (0 K, -273.15\u00b0 C). Nearly half of these are data qubits and the remaining are measurement qubits. The superconducting qubits are not strictly two-state systems. When performing gate operations, the physical system can get excited or \u2018leak\u2019 to states other than 0 and 1. These excited states can subsequently interfere with the computations and introduce errors. So a few qubits \u2014 i.e. the measurement qubits \u2014 are reserved to correct such leakage errors.\n\nCoherence time is the duration over which an intended state (typically, superpositions) of a qubit can survive without being changed due to interactions with the environment or with other parts of the computer. The coherence time of data qubits on Willow is about 100 microseconds, which is more than the coherence time of the physical qubits. This is a consequence of the error correction protocols used. This in itself is an interesting result because it means the information-holding time can be improved by external manoeuvring.\n\nThe next milestone for researchers to achieve is to lower the error rate \u2014 calculated as the ratio of the number of qubit errors to the number of gate operations \u2014 as they build ever-larger quantum computers with more physical qubits and more error correction operations. Google alone has progressed from 3-by-3 to 5-by-5 to 7-by-7 arrays of data qubits, and the error rate has decreased by more than half in each step.\n\nWhat one expects for a collection of qubits on a circuit is that the error rate either remains the same or increases as the number of qubits is increased. That the error rate becomes smaller as more qubits are added is the below-the-threshold capability of Willow\u2019s architecture and operation. This is vital to achieve quantum processors with enough qubits that perform almost error-free computations of problems of practical relevance \u2014 the ultimate goal.\n\nNo dead-ends\n\nThe particular computationally difficult task with which Google tested Willow is called random circuit sampling (RCS). In the RCS task, Willow has to calculate the probability of occurrence of possible strings of 0s and 1s in the output when the quantum gates that act on the qubits are chosen randomly. If there is no noise, RCS is a computationally hard task, meaning that the number of calculations required to make the prediction increases exponentially with the input size.\n\nWillow completed the RCS task for random gate operations realisable on Willow in a few minutes. The researchers estimated that the same task on the most powerful classical computer available today would take 10 septillion years (i.e. 1 followed by 24 zeroes). To compare, the universe\u2019s age in years is approximately 1 followed by 10 zeroes. It is plausible that classical computers running better algorithms may eventually match Willow\u2019s feat, although researchers are not aware of such improvements today.\n\nResearchers are still a long way away from realising quantum processors of reasonable size to be useful in practical contexts. This said, it\u2019s only natural that Willow created the sort of buzz that it did: it has shown that the major issues in realising a reliable quantum computer can be addressed and surmounted, that they are not dead-ends. The work of the Google team provides hope that quantum computers may soon help us unravel nature\u2019s mysteries and also solve computationally difficult problems in drug design, materials science, climate modelling, and optimisation, among others \u2014 all with deep societal impact.\n\nS.
