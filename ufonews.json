Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new study published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, unveils a novel approach to measuring public attention using reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The research bridges the gap between unconventional indicators and macroeconomic analysis, revealing surprising links between UAP sightings and economic conditions at multiple geographical levels in the United States.\n\nThe study highlights that UAP reports, often dismissed as a niche phenomenon, serve as a robust proxy for public attention. By analyzing daily-level data from NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center), the researchers show that UAP sightings are more frequent in wealthier regions but exhibit counter-cyclical patterns within those regions over time. These findings suggest that shifts in attention to extraordinary phenomena may reflect broader fluctuations in public focus.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nMacroeconomic correlation: UAP sightings are positively correlated with economic conditions across regions but display counter-cyclical patterns within regions over time.\n\nCausal evidence: A quasi-experimental design leveraging variations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions demonstrates a causal link between restricted mobility and increased UAP reports, further establishing the measure as an indicator of public attention.\n\nPolicy implications: Regions with higher UAP sighting levels show muted responses to monetary policy shocks, suggesting that attention variations can significantly influence economic outcomes.\n\nThe researchers compared UAP sightings to conventional attention metrics, finding strong correlations. This innovative measure offers unique advantages, including the ability to analyze attention at different geographical and temporal scales.\n\nImplications for policy and research\n\nGoldstein and Raveh's findings underscore the central role of public attention in economic dynamics. Their work not only enhances the toolkit for macroeconomic analysis but also provides policymakers with insights into managing public attention to mitigate economic shocks.\n\nThe study invites further exploration into how unconventional forms of attention, like UAP sightings, intersect with economic behaviors. \"We hope this work inspires future research to deepen our understanding of the connection between public attention and macroeconomic outcomes,\" the authors state.\n\nThe research uses comprehensive UAP sighting data from NUFORC, spanning over two decades, to construct a daily-level panel of reports across U.S. counties. The analysis integrates economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure robust conclusions.\n\nThis pioneering work highlights the value of thinking beyond traditional metrics, shedding light on the role of seemingly unrelated phenomena in understanding economic patterns.\n\nMore information: Nathan Goldstein et al, Looking up the sky: unidentified aerial phenomena and macroeconomic attention, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (2024).

            "article_content": "The FAA has placed temporary flight restrictions on the operation of drones over parts of New Jersey, according to a notice published on the agency\u2019s website. The ban on drone activity is likely related to the recent bout of mass hysteria over supposed \u201cdrone\u201d sightings, though the agency hasn\u2019t said so explicitly. The FAA told the New York Times the ban was enacted at the request of \u201cfederal security partners,\u201d without elaborating further.\n\nThe drone ban covers 22 different New Jersey communities and is set to expire on Jan. 17, 2025. It\u2019s not immediately clear why that end date was chosen. The FAA didn\u2019t address Gizmodo\u2019s questions about the specific timing of the flight restrictions and their relation to drone sightings in an email Thursday morning and directed us to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cWe continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,\u201d a spokesperson from DHS told Gizmodo over email. The spokesperson did not address our specific questions on the record.\n\n\u201cIn coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nPeople in New Jersey started reporting odd \u201cdrones\u201d in the sky to police around Nov. 18, according to NBC News, and there have reportedly been sightings every day since, aside from a conspicuous pause on Thanksgiving. The so-called drones have caused more and more people to post videos taken of what they believe to be unmanned aerial vehicles. And while some of the videos are difficult to explain, the vast majority appear to be regular commercial aircraft.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for internet cranks to get worked up about nothing, this drone panic has spread to areas that are unexpected. Several elected leaders have called for action by the federal government, including president-elect Donald Trump who\u2019s both claimed the government is trying to hide something and said they should be shot down.\n\nBut the concern has been bipartisan. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, has called for more action and played up the hype.\n\n\u201cSome of the drones are small. Some of the drones\u2019 flight patterns are erratic,\u201d Schumer said on Sunday, according to NBC News. \u201cMultiple drones flying together can confuse a traditional radar system and that\u2019s why, again, this new technology can really get us the answers that we need.\u201d\n\nPeople are also pointing lasers at commercial flights, an incredibly dangerous activity that can light up the inside of a cockpit and blind pilots. Laser strikes were already a serious problem, but have become so common during the current drone hysteria that the FAA was forced to issue a statement warning the public not to do it. Shining a laser at planes is a federal crime that can bring jail time and hefty fines.\n\nSome of the most difficult-to-believe theories about the drones are coming from elected leaders, including claims by a Republican congressman that they\u2019re actually being deployed by an Iranian mothership off the east coast of the U.S.\n\n\u201cKnow that Iran made a deal with China to purchase drones, motherships, and technology in order to go forward,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey on Fox News Dec. 11. \u201cThe sources I have are good. They can\u2019t reveal who they are because they are speaking to me in confidentiality. These drones should be shot down.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Iran has deployed a drone mothership, despite the fact that Van Drew has access to real power and should know things. Van Drew is a member of the U.S. House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. But nothing would surprise us at this point when it comes to weird sightings. With Trump taking power again in a month, things are shaping up to get so much weirder in the months and years ahead, drones or no drones."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

            "article_content": "Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Android 16 is introducing a new WritingTools API.\n\nThe WritingTools API lets apps opt out of writing tools that enable keyboards to replace the user\u2019s text with text generated by AI.\n\nApps might want to disable AI writing tools when the user is inputting text in certain text fields like for emails.\n\nGoogle rolled out the second developer preview of Android 16 the other day, bringing the platform a whole host of new developer features like better app control over haptics, search support for cloud media items in the photo picker, an adaptive refresh rate API, and more. As usual, it also includes changes that Google didn\u2019t highlight in its announcement, some of which we\u2019ve already covered. The latest change we\u2019ve spotted is a new Writing Tools API that seemingly lets apps opt out of having AI rewrite text for you.\n\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\n\nWhile digging through the documentation for Android 16 DP2, we notice that Google documented two new methods in the EditorInfo class: isWritingToolsEnabled() and setWritingToolsEnabled() . The EditorInfo class basically lets apps communicate information about an editable text field (like the type of text content it contains) to the current input method (i.e. an Android keyboard app).\n\nThe new isWritingToolsEnabled() method returns true when an Editor has AI writing tools enabled, which are enabled by default on all text fields. The documentation notes that \u201ctoolkits can optionally disable [AI writing tools] where not relevant e.g. passwords, number input, etc.\u201d\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nThe documentation under the new setWritingToolsEnabled() method explains how it can be used by apps to opt out of having writing tools rewrite text using generative AI.\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nSome keyboard apps like Gboard have AI writing tools that help you proofread or rewrite text using on-device or cloud-based generative AI models. Gboard has a proofread option on some Pixel devices, for example, that helps correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in any text that you\u2019ve typed, pasted, or dictated.\n\nMost apps should have no reason to opt out of AI writing tools in most text fields, but some apps may want to instruct the current keyboard app to not allow them in some situations. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allow AI writing tools to be used to replace text in fields where you have to input an email address, password, or phone number, for example.\n\nWhile Gboard already hides most irrelevant options when it\u2019s focused on a number or password field, some other keyboard apps might not, which seems to be the logic behind this new Writing Tools API. Regardless, it\u2019s going to be up to keyboard apps to respect this new API. Even if they do, though, it seems like it\u2019d be very easy to work around, as you could always just generate text in another app and then insert it into the text field where it\u2019s supposed to be blocked.\n\nWe\u2019re still digging through Android 16 Developer Preview 2 to find out what\u2019s new, so keep an eye out for more coverage on Android Authority.\n\nGot a tip?

Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe app had \"10+\" downloads on Google Play and one rating on the Apple App Store as of Wednesday. It is billed as a \"unique place where people from every background, race, and walk of life come together in a place of community and purpose\" and offers users prayer and spiritual guidance from an AI version of the 54-year-old Carpenter.\n\nA video demonstration shared online by Protestia features Carpenter using the app to request \"Pastor Ron\" to pray for recovery from an illness.\n\n\"I love to have my own personal pastor,\" Carpenter tells the camera as he demonstrates how the app responds with an automated message in Carpenter's voice. The pastor ended the short video by urging his followers to \"stay tuned\" to find out more information.\n\nPowered by Innovatix AI, the app also requires users to sign up for a $49 monthly plan to access \"unlimited\" calls and messages with the AI pastor.\n\nCarpenter's personal website also features an apparent link to the Advanced Archive app, which appeared broken as of Wednesday afternoon. The site does not reference the Advanced Archive app anywhere else.\n\nCP reached out to Carpenter for comment. This story will be updated if a response is received.\n\nThe mainstreaming of AI has already changed how some pastors approach their sermons, with some churches opting to try ChatGPT and other large language models to generate their messages for Sunday mornings.\n\nPastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills has warned against the rise of AI among churches, saying that the level of deception in the Church is set to rise exponentially in the coming years as technology rapidly advances.\n\n\"I don't say this to scare you; I say this to prepare you,\" Hibbs said in October 2023. \"There is a level of deception coming both in and out of the Church that is going to rock the world. It has to. God promised it would come. It would be an indicator of the last days.\"\n\nHibbs warned when it comes to AI, \"we are now starting to see things come to pass where you don't know if what you're looking at is true or not.\"\n\n\"You can't even tell anymore if that person's voice is assigned to the actual individual. Is that really Billy Graham's voice, or is that really this actor's voice or that singer's voice? Or is it artificial intelligence?\n\n\"How are you going to know truth from error?\" Hibbs asked.\n\nStressing the need for discernment among believers, Hibbs implored his congregation to \"more than ever, read the Bible.\"\n\n\"Pray to God. Stop listening to what people are saying. Judge everything you hear against the Bible.\""

            "article_content": "Yet realizing measurable business value from AI-powered applications requires a new game plan. Legacy application architectures simply aren\u2019t capable of meeting the high demands of AI-enhanced applications. Rather, the time is now for organizations to modernize their infrastructure, processes, and application architectures using cloud native technologies to stay competitive.\n\nThe time is now for modernization\n\nToday\u2019s organizations exist in an era of geopolitical shifts, growing competition, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. AI applications can help by supporting innovation, but only if they have the flexibility to scale when needed. Fortunately, by modernizing applications, organizations can achieve the agile development, scalability, and fast compute performance needed to support rapid innovation and accelerate the delivery of AI applications. David Harmon, director of software development for AMD says companies, \u201creally want to make sure that they can migrate their current [environment] and take advantage of all the hardware changes as much as possible.\u201d The result is not only a reduction in the overall development lifecycle of new applications but a speedy response to changing world circumstances.\n\nBeyond building and deploying intelligent apps quickly, modernizing applications, data, and infrastructure can significantly improve customer experience. Consider, for example, Coles, an Australian supermarket that invested in modernization and is using data and AI to deliver dynamic e-commerce experiences to its customers both online and in-store. With Azure DevOps, Coles has shifted from monthly to weekly deployments of applications while, at the same time, reducing build times by hours. What\u2019s more, by aggregating views of customers across multiple channels, Coles has been able to deliver more personalized customer experiences. In fact, according to a 2024 CMSWire Insights report, there is a significant rise in the use of AI across the digital customer experience toolset, with 55% of organizations now using it to some degree, and more beginning their journey.\n\nBut even the most carefully designed applications are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. If given the opportunity, bad actors can extract sensitive information from machine learning models or maliciously infuse AI systems with corrupt data. \u201cAI applications are now interacting with your core organizational data,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cHaving the right guard rails is important to make sure the data is secure and built on a platform that enables you to do that.\u201d The good news is modern cloud based architectures can deliver robust security, data governance, and AI guardrails like content safety to protect AI applications from security threats and ensure compliance with industry standards.\n\nThe answer to AI innovation\n\nNew challenges, from demanding customers to ill-intentioned hackers, call for a new approach to modernizing applications. \u201cYou have to have the right underlying application architecture to be able to keep up with the market and bring applications faster to market,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cNot having that foundation can slow you down.\u201d\n\nEnter cloud native architecture. As organizations increasingly adopt AI to accelerate innovation and stay competitive, there is a growing urgency to rethink how applications are built and deployed in the cloud. By adopting cloud native architectures, Linux, and open source software, organizations can better facilitate AI adoption and create a flexible platform purpose built for AI and optimized for the cloud. Harmon explains that open source software creates options, \u201cAnd the overall open source ecosystem just thrives on that. It allows new technologies to come into play.\u201d\n\nApplication modernization also ensures optimal performance, scale, and security for AI applications. That\u2019s because modernization goes beyond just lifting and shifting application workloads to cloud virtual machines. Rather, a cloud native architecture is inherently designed to provide developers with the following features:\n\nThe flexibility to scale to meet evolving needs\n\nBetter access to the data needed to drive intelligent apps\n\nAccess to the right tools and services to build and deploy intelligent applications easily\n\nSecurity embedded into an application to protect sensitive data\n\nTogether, these cloud capabilities ensure organizations derive the greatest value from their AI applications. \u201cAt the end of the day, everything is about performance and security,\u201d says Harmon. Cloud is no exception."

            "article_content": "OpenAI is setting the stage for an agentic AI future, making ChatGPT more capable and seamlessly integrated into users\u2019 daily workflow.\n\nOn the 11th day of \u201812 Days of OpenAI, \u2019 the company showcased advancements in ChatGPT\u2019s desktop capabilities, highlighting the evolution of ChatGPT from a conversational assistant to an agentic tool\u2014ready to take on tasks and collaborate seamlessly across your desktop environment.\n\nToday, the company announced support for apps like Apple Notes, Notion, Warp, Xcode, and 30 more. In a demo, OpenAI also demonstrated how ChatGPT can work with the Notion app, fetch content within a selected section of the document, and generate additional, relevant content.\n\nThe demo showed how ChatGPT helped analyse Git comments in Warp. The results were visualised in a holiday-themed bar graph. In another demo, ChatGPT worked with macOS accessibility APIs in Xcode.\n\nMoreover, OpenAI announced the integration of Advance Voice Mode with this feature. This lets ChatGPT work with apps based on your voice-based commands.\n\nFinally, the dream demo of talking to ChatGPT about stuff on your computer\n\n\n\nShipping today on macOS:\n\n\u2013 Advanced voice works with your apps\n\n\u2013 New tools like @warpdotdev\n\n\u2013 Extending beyond devs with Apple Notes, @NotionHQ, and more!\n\n\n\nNext:\n\n\u2013 More apps & capabilities\n\n\u2013 Windows pic.twitter.com/xgAMt8TOet \u2014 Alexander Embiricos (@embirico) December 19, 2024\n\nThis new development comes in the backdrop of OpenAI releasing the ChatGPT desktop version in November this year, marketing its first step into computer vision and agentic control.\n\nDrops Another AGI Easter Egg\n\nBut, the demo didn\u2019t compete with another AGI easter egg. In one of the presentation screens, AIM was able to spot a directory in an Xcode project titled \u201cAGI_Interface.swift\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time in the last twelve days, and OpenAI dropped another notable easter egg a few days ago, a calendar event titled \u2018Super Secret AGI\u2019. This further adds to the expectations that all the announcements of the 12 days could cumulatively give users a sense of general intelligence.\n\nOpenAI also mentioned that a Windows app for ChatGPT will be released soon. However, a bigger revelation is the confirmation of a new agent, who is said to be released in 2025.\n\n\u201cAs our models get increasingly powerful, ChatGPT will become more and more agentic,\u201d said OpenAI, and they also added that they will have more to say on it in 2025.\n\nA few weeks ago, reports surfaced that OpenAI is working on a new AI agent titled \u2018Operator\u201d \u2013 but all the company did in today\u2019s event was just to confirm the plans. Perhaps, OpenAI caved into the heat that it is facing from competitors.\n\nGoogle recently announced Project Mariner, which can navigate and take action on a web browser tab on your behalf. Similarly, Microsoft announced the Copilot Vision, which can see content on your web browser and provide relevant information. And, of course, there\u2019s Anthropic\u2019s Computer Use, released well before any other tool.\n\nThat said, there is just one day remaining in 12 Days of OpenAI, and it looks like they\u2019re saving the best for the last \u2014 which is a new and powerful frontier model. It will be interesting to see what OpenAI has in store or how different the model is going to be from o1.\n\nA few benchmarks have been suggesting that o1 is the most powerful AI model yet and even outperforms the Claude 3.5 Sonnet in coding tasks.\n\nO1 BLOWS EVERYONE ELSE AWAY \u2013 IT IS A BEAST IN REASONING AND IS ALSO THE BEST IN CODING!!\n\n\n\nThe new o1 model from 12/17 is #1 on Livebench AI and scores 91.58 in Reasoning!!\n\n\n\nFinally, OpenAI also BEATS Sonnet in Coding. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nPretty much the only drawback to o1 is that it takes too\u2026 pic.twitter.com/roMDMPckCR \u2014 Bindu Reddy (@bindureddy) December 19, 2024\n\nA few days ago, a user on X spotted the GPT-4.5 model with a limited preview capability.\n\nThat said, today\u2019s event follows the nature of developer-centric announcements from two days ago. On the ninth day, OpenAI launched the o1 model in the API and upgraded it with function calls, structured outputs, reasoning effort controls, developer messages, and vision inputs.\n\nWhile OpenAI unveiled other features like Projects, WhatsApp integration, and ChatGPT for Apple Intelligence, the highlights remain the launch of o1 Pro and Sora.\n\nHowever, Google was quick to respond with Veo 2, and the company\u2019s testing revealed that it outperforms competitors like Kling, Moviegen \u2013 and, of course, Sora. The buch doesn\u2019t end there. Just a few hours before today\u2019s event, the tech giant unveiled an advanced reasoning model, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.\n\nThe \u2018shipmas\u2019 battle is getting quite heated up, and for OpenAI, it all depends on what they\u2019re going to release on the last day of \u201812 Days of OpenAI\u2019 and the final day tomorrow."

Throughout his distinguished television career, Jonathan has rubbed shoulders with the creme de la creme of the entertainment industry. Yet, in his latest TV venture, Jonathan Ross: Haunted Homecoming, the beloved presenter revisits his childhood haunts for a spine-chilling journey into the past, engaging with entities far removed from his usual Hollywood guests - the supernatural. Known for his interest in horror and the macabre, Jonathan's return to his old East End neighbourhood takes a dark turn as he delves into its grim history and hunts for signs of paranormal activity, landing him in a real-life horror story. Accompanied by psychic medium Ian Lawman and paranormal investigator Dr Kate Cherrell, Jonathan recounts a horrifying childhood experience in the basement of his Leytonstone family home before venturing into the nearby Epping Forest, where things take a disturbing twist in the dead of night, reports the Mirror.\n\nJonathan Ross has filmed a new two-part series where he goes down memory lane\n\nThe tension escalates at the infamous Hitchcock Hotel on Wanstead Flats, as an ominous presence infiltrates its most daunting room and they unearth spectral secrets of one of his former local pubs. During a tense moment in the woods, the crew's concern is palpable as they fail to locate Jonathan. Dr Kate expresses her worry, saying: \"I don't want to make things worse but I think we've lost Jonathan. \"I've lost Jonathan, he's just walked into the woods and hasn't come back.\"\n\nJonathan's return to his old East End neighbourhood takes a dark turn as he delves into its grim history\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

To be honest with you, I was quite sad when they found us again, I was happy trying to feel the vibe. I enjoyed being there.\" He continued, sharing his feelings about leaving the area: \"I remember leaving and I felt very calm. When you're looking for a connection, you do have to investigate some really truly tragic stories, normally events where people's lives have ended when they shouldn't have ended.\"\n\nJonathan's disappearance left cast members panicking"

Kentucky Coal Museum\n\nA Coal Miner's Home exhibit at the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum features furnishings found in many coal miners' homes.\n\n231 Main St. Benham, 40807; Tuesday-Saturday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. and Sunday 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no place is more qualified to portray the realities of life in a coal mine than Benham, Kentucky. Once a coal camp, this tiny eastern Kentucky town is now home to the Kentucky Coal Museum. The museum encapsulates what life as a coal miner would have been like. Given the significance of coal mining in the commonwealth's history, the preserved history of the industry that countless Kentuckians devoted their careers to may be of interest to Kentuckians from all over.\n\n2. Vent Haven Museum\n\nA room filled from floor to ceiling with ventriloquist dummies at the Vent Haven Museum in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky. June 30, 2020\n\n33 West Maple Ave., Fort Mitchell; Open by appointment only May 1 through Sept. 30.\n\nIn the northern Kentucky city of Fort Mitchell resides the \"world's only museum dedicated to ventriloquism,\" according to the Vent Haven Museum's website. While many people may balk at the idea of entering a building occupied by more than 1,200 dummies and related memorabilia dating back to the 19th century, the museum's founder, W.S. Berger, spent decades collecting the items. Berger died in 1972, and the museum opened in 1973 after he formed a charitable organization to ensure his collection stayed intact.\n\n3. Great American Dollhouse Museum\n\n344 Swope Drive, Danville; Wednesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith more than 200 dollhouses, model buildings and box rooms that capture astonishing detail with their designs and furnishings, the Great American Dollhouse Museum is a window into worlds from several U.S. time periods and regions, including the Colonial period, the Old West, and modern eras, according to the museum's website. Other sections of the museum include a miniature scene mimicking a 1910s town, and a fantasy-inspired sections replete with mythical creatures like elves, witches and trolls.\n\n4. International Paranormal Museum and Research Center\n\nA section of the International Paranormal Museum and Research Center dedicated to aliens.\n\nClosed until spring of 2025 for relocation.\n\nThe International Paranormal Museum and Research Center in Somerset is a hub for people interested in the inexplicable phenomena that grip the imagination of humankind \u2014 from ghosts to cryptids to aliens. The organization investigates these subjects and collects artifacts found along the way to display to the public.\n\nThe museum is in the process of moving out of its home of seven years and anticipates reopening in Spring 2025, though its new location has not yet been announced. Rest assured, if you've yet to experience this attraction, the museum's management is confident they'll come back better than ever.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Dinosaur World Kentucky\n\n711 Mammoth Cave Road, Cave City; Open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nIf you're young or young at heart, you can help your imagination soar back to the time of the dinosaurs by heading to Cave City. Dinosaur World is an outdoor museum with hundreds of life-sized dinosaurs on display that also offers a host of educational activities that allow children to search for and examine fossils and minerals.\n\nContact reporter Killian Baarlaer at kbaarlaer@gannett.com or at @bkillian72 on X.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Weird museums: 5 unique Kentucky museums to visit in 2025"

            "article_content": "Composite images of A2744-GDSp-z4 show it has two large spiral arms stretching out of its center, despite appearing just 1.5 billion years after the dawn of time.\n\nResearchers just found an unexpected galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The large swirl of stars is known as a grand-design spiral galaxy, and its exceptionally advanced age could change what we know about galaxy formation.\n\nGenerally, the older a galaxy is, the farther away it is from us. Scientists can gauge the age and distance of galaxies through something called redshift \u2014 a phenomenon that occurs when light shifts to lower-frequency, redder wavelengths as it crosses large stretches of space. This happens for a couple of reasons; first, because the universe is expanding , older stars naturally end up further away. And second, because red is the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum of light, stars that are very far away tend to appear redder, having a higher redshift. JWST is designed to peer deeply into the red and infrared spectrum, allowing it to see old, distant galaxies more clearly than any previous telescope.\n\nBut spiral galaxies tend to be on the younger side, making the newly-discovered galaxy, designated A2744-GDSp-z4, an outlier. Grand-design galaxies like A2744-GDSp-z4 are characterized by their two well-defined spiral arms. Very few have ever been found with a redshift above 3.0 \u2014 meaning their light has been traveling for nearly 11.5 billion years, according to the Las Cumbres Observatory .\n\nThe newfound galaxy, meanwhile, has a redshift of 4.03, meaning the light JWST detected was emitted more than 12 billion years ago. According to the researchers who discovered it, that means A2744-GDSp-z4 came together when the universe was only about 1.5 billion years old \u2014 and it appears to have formed very rapidly. Given its estimated star formation rate, it accrued a mass of about 10 billion solar masses in just a few hundred million years.\n\nRelated: James Webb telescope confirms we have no idea why the universe is growing the way it is\n\nThis flies in the face of how scientists think spiral galaxies usually form.\n\n\"The rarity of high redshift spirals might be a consequence of galaxies being dynamically hot at those early epochs,\" the researchers, led by Rashi Jain at the National Center for Radio Astrophysics in India, wrote in the new study. \"Dynamically hot systems tend to form clumpy structures,\" rather than highly ordered spirals, the researchers added.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe team theorizes that A2744-GDSp-z4's formation may have been driven by the presence of a stellar bar \u2014 gassy structures found in a majority of galaxies, which fuel starbirth and channel gas between the inner and outer regions of a galaxy, contributing to the galaxy's size and shape. The ancient spiral could also have formed through the merger of two smaller galaxies, though this seems less likely given its orderly structure, the researchers wrote."

After digging a little deeper, they found two more teeth just below the surface. Realizing the find might be something special, the homeowner called in experts, and soon a full excavation was underway.\n\n\u201cWhen I found the teeth and held them in my hands, I knew they were something special,\u201d said the homeowner. \u201cI\u2019m so excited that our yard had something so important for science.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers uncovered a well-preserved jaw belonging to an adult mastodon, an ancient relative of today\u2019s elephants. The jaw will now be studied to figure out how old it is, what the mastodon ate and what its life was like during the Ice Age.\n\n\u201cThis jaw is an amazing discovery,\u201d said Dr. Robert Feranec, an expert from the New York State Museum. \u201cFossils like this help us learn about ancient ecosystems and give us clues about how the world has changed over time.\u201d\n\nA backyard in Orange County, New York, became the site of an incredible discovery of a complete mastodon jaw -- the first find like it in New York in more than 11 years. New York State Museum\n\nOrange County has been a great place to find mastodon fossils. In fact, about one-third of the 150 mastodon fossils found in New York have come from this area.\n\nDr. Cory Harris from SUNY Orange said they hope to keep digging in the area to see if there are more bones waiting to be found.\n\n\u201cThe jaw is the most exciting part, but the toe and rib fragments might also help us learn more about this animal,\u201d Dr. Harris explained.\n\nThe jaw will eventually be displayed at the New York State Museum in 2025, after scientists finish their research, according to Michael Mastroianni, a leader at the museum."

            "article_content": "NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nWith the holiday season upon us, many companies are finding ways to take advantage through deals, promotions, or other campaigns. OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post.\n\nAlso: I'm a ChatGPT power user - here's why Canvas is its best productivity feature\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and will occur daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches will be both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat's dropped so far?\n\nThursday, December 19\n\nOn the second to last day of '12 days of OpenAI,' the company focused on releases regarding its MacOS desktop app and its interoperability with other apps.\n\nUsers can now use the desktop app on MacOS to see and automate their work with ChatGPT. There will be more releases of this nature in 2025, but until then, OpenAI has been introducing the three features below.\n\nUsing the \"Work with Apps\" button, users can now work with many more coding apps. The list includes: BBEdit, MatLab, Nova, Script Editor, TextMate, Android Studio, AppCode, CLion, DataGrip, GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA, PHPStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, RustRover, WebStorm, Prompt, and Warp.\n\nFor users who use ChatGPT for writing, the desktop app now supports Apple Notes, Quip, and Notion.\n\nLastly, the desktop app for MacOS now supports Advanced Voice Mode while working with other apps.\n\nFeatures have already been shipped. All you have to do is have the latest version of the MacOS app and a Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu subscription.\n\nTo ease privacy concerns, OpenAI says ChatGPT will only work with apps when manually prompted. When the feature is active, users know what will be attached to the message.\n\n\"Day 12, we have something super special, so don't miss it,\" teased OpenAI about its upcoming Friday release.\n\nWednesday, December 18\n\nHave you ever wanted to use ChatGPT without a Wi-Fi connection? Now, all you have to do is place a phone call. Here's what OpenAI released on the 10th day:\n\nBy dialing 1-800-ChatGPT, you can now access the chatbot via a toll-free number. OpenAI encourages users to save ChatGPT in their contacts for easy access.\n\nUsers can call anywhere in the US; in other countries, users can message ChatGPT on WhatsApp. Users get 15 minutes of free ChatGPT calls per month.\n\nIn WhatsApp, users can enter a prompt via a text as they would with any other person in their contacts. In this experience, it is just a text message.\n\nThe phone call feature works on any phone, from a smartphone to a flip phone -- even a rotary phone.\n\nThe presenters said it is meant to make ChatGPT more accessible to more users.\n\nTuesday, December 17\n\nThe releases on the ninth day all focus on developer features and updates, dubbed \"Mini Dev Day.\" These launches include:\n\nThe o1 model is finally out of preview in the API with support for function calling, structured outputs, developer messages, vision capabilities, and lower latency, according to the company.\n\no1 in the API also features a new parameter: \"reasoning effort.\" This parameter allows developers to tell the model how much effort is put into formulating an answer, which helps with cost efficiency.\n\nOpenAI also introduced WebRTC support for the Realtime API, which makes it easier for developers \"to build and scale real-time voice products across platforms.\"\n\nThe Realtime API also got a 60% audio token price drop, support for GPT-4o mini, and more control over responses.\n\nThe fine-tuning API now supports Preference Fine-Tuning, which allows users to \"Optimize the model to favor desired behavior by reinforcing preferred responses and reducing the likelihood of unpreferred ones,\" according to OpenAI.\n\n\n\nOpenAI also introduced new Go and Java SDKs in beta.\n\nAn \"AMA\" (ask me anything) session will be held for an hour after the live stream on the OpenAI GitHub platform with the presenters.\n\nMonday, December 16\n\nThe drops for the second Monday in the 12 days of OpenAI series all focused on Search in ChatGPT.\n\nThe AI search engine is available to all users starting today, including all free users who are signed in anywhere they can access ChatGPT. The feature was previously only available to ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nThe search experience, which allows users to browse the web from ChatGPT, got faster and better on mobile and now has an enriched map experience. The upgrades include image-rich visual results.\n\nSearch is integrated into Advance Voice mode, meaning you can now search as you talk to ChatGPT. To activate this feature, just activate Advance Voice the same way you regularly would and ask it your query verbally. It will then answer your query verbally by pulling from the web.\n\nOpenAI also teased developers, saying, \"Tomorrow is for you,\" and calling the upcoming livestream a \"mini Dev Day.\"\n\nFriday, December 13\n\nOne of OpenAI's most highly requested features has been an organizational feature to better keep track of your conversations. On Friday, OpenAI delivered a new feature called \"Projects.\"\n\nProjects is a new way to organize and customize your chats in ChatGPT, meant to be a part of continuing to optimize the core experience of ChatGPT.\n\nWhen creating a Project, you can include a title, a customized folder color, relevant project files, instructions for ChatGPT on how it can best help you with the project, and more in one place.\n\nIn the Project, you can start a chat and add previous chats from the sidebar to your Project. It can also answer questions using your context in a regular chat format. The chats can be saved in the Project, making it easier to pick up your conversations later and know exactly what to look for where.\n\nIt will be rolled out to Plus, Pro, and Teams users starting today. OpenAI says it's coming to free users as soon as possible. Enterprise and Edu users will see it rolled out early next year.\n\nThursday, December 12\n\nWhen the live stream started, OpenAI addressed the elephant in the room -- the fact that the company's live stream went down the day before. OpenAI apologized for the inconvenience and said its team is working on a post-mortem to be posted later.\n\nThen it got straight into the news -- another highly-anticipated announcement:\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode now has screen-sharing and visual capabilities, meaning it can assist with the context of what it is viewing, whether that be from your phone camera or what's on your screen.\n\nThese capabilities build on what Advanced Voice could already do very well -- engaging in casual conversation as a human would. The natural-like conversations can be interrupted, have multi-turns, and understand non-linear trains of thought.\n\nIn the demo, the user gets directions from ChatGPT's Advanced Voice on how to make a cup of coffee. As the demoer goes through the steps, ChatGPT is verbally offering insights and directions.\n\nThere's another bonus for the Christmas season: Users can access a new Santa voice. To activate it, all users have to do is click on the snowflake icon. Santa is rolling out throughout today everywhere that users can access ChatGPT voice mode. The first time you talk to Santa, your usage limits reset, even if you have reached the limit already, so you can have a conversation with him.\n\nVideo and screen sharing are rolling out in the latest mobile apps starting today and throughout next week to all Team users and most Pro and Plus subscribers. Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe will get access \"as soon as we can,\" and Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next year.\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 on Wednesday. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, the live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams are held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. To make access easier, OpenAI will also post a link to the live stream on its X account 10 minutes before it starts, which will be at approximately 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET daily."

            "article_content": "ZDNET\n\nIBM is zooming along with new open-source Granite Large Language Models (LLM) releases every few months. Granite 3.1 is the latest generation model, building upon the success of Granite 3.0. The model offers enhanced capabilities and performance optimized for business applications.\n\nAlso: Gemini Advanced users can now access Google's most experimental model\n\nThe family of Granite 3.1 models boasts an impressive 128K token context window, a substantial increase from their predecessors. This expansion allows the models to process and understand much larger amounts of text -- equivalent to approximately 85,000 English words -- enabling more comprehensive analysis and generation tasks. By comparison, OpenAI's ChatGPT 3, which ignited the AI revolution, could handle only 2,000 tokens.\n\nOutperforming the competition\n\nBig Blue claims its new Granite 8B Instruct model outperforms its rivals, such as Google Gemma 2, Meta Llama 3.1, and Qwen 2.5, on HuggingFace's OpenLLM Leaderboard benchmarks.\n\nAlso: Want generative AI LLMs integrated with your business data? You need RAG\n\nThe Granite 3.1 family includes dense models and Mixture of Experts (MoE) variants. IBM states its Granite 2B and 8B models are text-only dense LLMs trained on over 12 trillion data tokens. The dense models are designed to support tool-based use cases and for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), streamlining code generation, translation, and bug fixing.\n\nThe MoE models are trained on over 10 trillion tokens of data. IBM claims these models are ideal for deployment in on-device applications with low latency.\n\nImproved graphics and language capabilities\n\nThe new release also introduces image-in/text-out functionality, broadening the models' applicability for businesses working with graphics.\n\nGranite 3.1 also offers improved foreign language proficiency. Alongside English, it can now work with a dozen languages, including German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic, Czech, Italian, Korean, Dutch, and Simplified Chinese. In short, if you have an international business, IBM has an LLM you can use.\n\nAs before, the new Granite LLMs are licensed under the Apache 2 open-source license. IBM also maintains its commitment to openness by disclosing the training datasets and providing comprehensive documentation on model development and performance.\n\nAlso: Generative AI brings new risks to everyone. Here's how you can stay safe\n\nIf you're worried about intellectual property issues and AI, IBM offers an uncapped indemnity for third-party IP claims related to the use of its models. You may not be concerned about such potential legal problems yet, but I assure you that you will be.\n\nPowerful, trustworthy AI for enterprises\n\nGranite 3.1 models are available on IBM's Watsonx platform; cloud service providers like Google Vertex AI; and AI platforms including Hugging Face, NVIDIA (as NIM microservices), Ollama, and Replicate.\n\nThe release of Granite 3.1 is poised to accelerate AI adoption in enterprise settings. By combining these models with proprietary data using techniques like IBM's InstructLab, businesses can potentially achieve task-specific performance rivaling larger models at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAs the AI landscape evolves rapidly, IBM's Granite 3.1 represents a significant step forward in providing enterprises with powerful, efficient, and trustworthy AI tools to drive innovation and solve complex business challenges."

            "article_content": "As OpenAI and Google joust this December, with the former\u2019s 12 Days of Innovation challenge, and the latter countering it with its Gemini 2 AI model, I look beyond these skirmishes to predict my Twelve Trends for AI going into 2025 and beyond.\n\nI will describe them over three columns. Each of these has a theme, and today\u2019s four predictions are around how humans and AI will draw closer to each other\u2014in work, life and relationships.\n\nAlso read: Indian software majors need a clear strategy to ride the AI wave\n\nPrediction One of Twelve\u2014English is the new coding: As our generation was growing up, we were told that learning English was the passport to success. We did that and were arguably successful in our careers and businesses. Our children in turn are told that learning how to code is the passport to success, thus coding is the new English.\n\nThis led to 10-year-olds being dragged to code camps to learn Python and JavaScript. With Generative AI, this changes: Every time we write an English prompt for ChatGPT or any of its ilk, we are actually \u2018coding: i.e., giving it a set of instructions to perform some task for us, whether it\u2019s a summarization, video-creation or a write-up.\n\nExcept that now we are doing it in our natural human language rather than the language of the machine. This is profound, as it has the potential to democratize coding and make eight billion of us code. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella declaimed that instead of learning the machine\u2019s language, machines would have to learn ours.\n\nJensen Huang of Nvidia joined the chorus saying that the true potential of AI is that none of us would have to learn how to code. Thus, English, or any other natural language, becomes the new coding language.\n\nPrediction Two of Twelve\u2014AI is the new UI: AI will become the new user interface. Bill Gates presciently wrote in November 2023 (bit.ly/3tSMNkB): \u201c\u2026you won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do.\"\n\nA UI has been how humans and machines have interacted with each other, as the difficult UIs of machine language and DOS (disk operating system) gave way to a GUI (graphical user interface), search bars, browsers and apps. Simpler UI led to a faster, intuitive and more productive interaction with a machine.\n\nThe AI-driven shift will lead to voice UI as the spoken word becomes the new way to interact with machines, similar to our interactions with other humans. We will chat with ChatGPT or Gemini to work with them on our day-to-day tasks.\n\nOur devices will morph, with voice becoming the primary interface rather than a large screen. The first proto-devices are already out, though not terribly successful, like the Rabbit R1 and AI Pin. An AI assistant becomes the UI.\n\nPrediction Three of Twelve\u2014AI and humans are the new creators: GenAI is a cognitive technology and can do creative tasks like writing, creating art and composing poetry. This has left many human creators deeply worried about their jobs as creativity was supposed to be a uniquely human skill. I believe, however, that Generative AI will boost human creativity.\n\nTake OpenAI\u2019s Sora, for instance, released last week. When Sam Altman had teased it a year back, he had invited creative prompts on X to instantly generate videos with it. Indian entrepreneur Kunal Shah famously gave \u2018A bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view\u2019 and Sora produced a spectacular video (bit.ly/3ZgGnHD).\n\nHowever, it was not Sora that was being creative, but Kunal, who would not have imagined a creation like this unless he had a tool like Sora or Runway to manifest his innate human creativity. Thus, I believe that a combination of humans and AI will give rise to a new era of creativity.\n\nPrediction Four of Twelve\u2014AI creates a new customer: The Industrial revolution brought with it the transactional Industrial customer who rarely used technology, and the internet brought the digital comparison-driven and social customer who searched and clicked her way through brands.\n\nAlso read: These 4 AI stocks could see incredible growth in 2025\n\nA new kind of customer will emerge in this age of AI\u2014someone who lives in the era of infinite hyper-personalized choice and has immersive and conversational interaction with brands, AI that anticipates her needs and brand relationships that are collaborative rather than functional or emotional (bit.ly/4ffrueN).\n\nThis will mean a big change in business and marketing as they adjust to this reality.\n\nThe next set of predictions will be around what I consider the biggest trend of 2025\u2014Agentic AI. Here is a video (bit.ly/4fnaJ1h) that offers more."

Since then, it has been rising steadily, with just one or two small reductions.\n\nThe overall index remains in a very good place, with prices historically high relative to 2023 and the pre-pandemic years.\n\nIn Europe, prices seemed to settle this week, particularly for butter, with the market nudging up by \u20ac55/t. When considering the decline in prices in recent weeks this is a really good result.\n\nAverage butter prices are now \u20ac7,185/t and while significantly lower than they were three weeks ago, it\u2019s a good price if it extends into the new year and beyond.\n\nWMP and cheddar are much more stable in Europe, with WMP up \u20ac10/t and cheddar down \u20ac10/t. SMP has been under a bit more pressure in the European market and at the GDT, as it fell by \u20ac30/t this week in Europe and is currently trading at \u20ac76/t behind the GDT price, indicating limited appetite in Europe for skim.\n\nAs dairy markets wind down for Christmas, next year\u2019s outlook is less certain, but futures are predicting prices to come down for almost all categories."

            "article_content": "Beef and lamb prices continue to rise in Northern Ireland. \\ Philip Doyle\n\nFinished cattle are ending the year on a positive note, with prices paid on prime steers and heifers up 2p/kg on last week.\n\nDemand for slaughter-fit cattle is also reflected in base prices jumping 6p to 8p/kg, with official quotes now on 508p/kg for U-3 grading animals.\n\nMost reports indicate 518p/kg is a realistic starting price for cattle this week, although regular finishers indicate deals of 520p and 524p/kg are widely available for in-spec animals.\n\nPrices at this level are easier to secure when prime heifers are available for slaughter.\n\nHigher prices are also being reported, but are dependent on the ability to supply bigger numbers on a weekly arrangement.\n\nYoung bulls meeting age and carcase weight specifications are moving in line with steer prices of 518p/kg.\n\nBulls falling outside of market specifications are moving much closer to prices in line with official quotes.\n\nWhere farmers are struggling to secure higher returns on finished cattle and not under movement restrictions, the live ring is returning prices well over 300p/kg for good-quality cattle, which equates to deadweight prices of over 520p/kg.\n\nPrices at local plants continue to lag well behind those in Britain, where 560p/kg is common place for prime cattle and highlights the strength of the current trade.\n\nChristmas holidays\n\nLooking to next week, prices look set to hold firm as plants will operate on a shorter kill week due to Christmas.\n\nFarmers should note all plants will operate as normal on Monday 23, Tuesday 24 and Friday 27 December.\n\nAll plants will close on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day. Marts will also close next week for Christmas holidays.\n\nCows\n\nAs with prime cattle, there is plenty of demand for good-quality cull cows, especially younger animals.\n\nBase quotes have moved up 4p/kg to 400p/kg for O+3 grading animals, with deals of 410p to 430p/kg on offer for good-quality suckler types.\n\nNI sheep: deals at 700p/kg for lambs\n\nThe live trade for fat lamb remains strong, with exporters and agents for Irish factories very active for heavy lots, pushing prices well above \u00a3160 and topping \u00a3171.\n\nAt the plants, the best quote is 680p/kg, but deals are being reported at 700p/kg to match the live ring.\n\nIn Gortin, heavy lambs were a strong trade, with 25kg to 27kg making \u00a3163 to \u00a3170, 24kg to \u00a3155.50 and 23kg to \u00a3143.\n\nKilrea sold a big show of 1,850 lambs from 630p to 684p/kg, no change on last week. Light lambs at 19kg made \u00a3130, 18.5kg at \u00a3126.50, 24kg sold to \u00a3161.50 and 23kg to \u00a3154.50.\n\nIn Markethill, 1,160 lambs sold from 630p to 687p/kg, little change on last week. Saintfield sold 600 lambs from 620p to 700p/kg in a steady trade. Texels at 32kg made \u00a3171, with 25.5kg Charolais at \u00a3160. There was a big run from \u00a3147 to \u00a3160. Lighter sorts at 20kg made \u00a3124.\n\nIn Ballymena, store lambs were a strong trade. Mules hit \u00a3162 and \u00a3140, with a run of Texels from \u00a3125 to \u00a3137.\n\nA big sale of 1,800 fat lambs were also a steady trade. Lambs at 24.5kg made \u00a3162.50, 24kg at \u00a3159.50, 22kg made \u00a3148 and 21kg at \u00a3147.\n\nFat ewes\n\nThe trade for fat ewes is strong this week. In Gortin, ewes topped \u00a3248, with a run from \u00a3134 to \u00a322. In Kilrea, top was \u00a3250. In Saintfield, the best Texels made \u00a3270 and \u00a3260, with a big run from \u00a3168 to \u00a3238.\n\nRead more\n\nSuckler cows in freefall as 50,000 gone"

The antimatter particle is the partner of a massive matter particle called hyperhelium-4, and its discovery could help scientists tackle the mystery of why regular matter came to dominate the universe, despite the fact that matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts at the dawn of time.\n\nThis imbalance is known as \"matter-antimatter asymmetry.\" Matter particles and antimatter particles annihilate on contact, releasing their energy back into the cosmos. That implies that if an imbalance between the two hadn't arisen early in the universe, then the cosmos may have been a much emptier and less interesting place indeed.\n\nThe LHC is no stranger to paradigm-shifting discoveries about the early universe. Running in a 17-mile (27-kilometer) long loop beneath the Alps near Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC is most famous for its discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, the \"messenger\" of the Higgs Field responsible for giving other particles their mass at the dawn of time.\n\nThe collisions that occur at the LHC generate a state of matter called \"quark-gluon plasma.\" This dense sea of plasma is the same as the \"primordial soup\" of matter that filled the universe around one-millionth of a second after the Big Bang.\n\nExotic \"hypernuclei\" and their antimatter counterparts emerge from this quark-gluon plasma, allowing scientists a glimpse at the conditions of the early universe.\n\nRelated: World's smallest particle accelerator is 54 million times smaller than the Large Hadron Collider, and it works\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

However, they are rarely found in nature and are difficult to create and study in the lab. This has made them somewhat mysterious.\n\nAn image of the ALICE detector taken during LHC upgrades in 2019 (Image credit: Robert Lea)\n\nThe discovery of the first evidence of the hypernuclei that is an antimatter counterpart of hyperhelium-4 was made at the LHC detector ALICE.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the nine experiments at the LHC, each with its own detector, generate their results by slamming together protons at near the speed of light, the ALICE collaboration creates quark-gluon plasma by slamming together much heavier particles, usually lead nuclei, or \"ions.\"\n\n\n\nThe collision of iron ions (try saying that ten times fast) is ideal for generating significant amounts of hypernuclei. Yet until recently, scientists conducting heavy-ion collisions had only succeeded in observing the lightest hypernucleus, hypertriton, and its antimatter partner, antihypertriton.\n\nThat was until earlier in 2024 when scientists used the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in New York to detect antihyperhydrogen-4, which is composed of an antiproton, two antineutrons, and a quark-containing particle called an \"antilambda.\"\n\nNow, ALICE has followed this with the detection of a heavier anti-hypernuclei particle, antihyperhelium-4, composed of two antiprotons, an antineutron, and an antilambda.\n\nAn illustration of antimatter particles entering the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. (Image credit: ORIGINS Cluster/S. Kwauka)\n\nThe lead-lead collision and the ALICE data that yielded the detection of the heaviest antimatter hypernucleus yet at the LHC actually date back to 2018.\n\nThe signature of antihyperhelium-4 was revealed by its decay into other particles and the detection of these particles.\n\n\n\nALICE scientists teased the signature of antihyperhelium-4 out of the data using a machine-learning technique that can outperform the collaboration's usual search techniques.\n\nIn addition to spotting evidence of antihyperhelium-4 and antihyperhydrogen-4, the ALICE team was also able to determine their masses, which were in good agreement with current particle physics theories.\n\nThe scientists were also able to determine the amounts of these particles produced in lead-lead collisions.\n\nThey found these numbers consistent with the ALICE data, which indicates that antimatter and matter are produced in equal amounts from quark-gluon plasma produced at the energy levels the LHC is capable of reaching.\n\nThe reason for the universe's matter/antimatter imbalance remains unknown, but antihyperhelium-4 and antihyperhydrogen-4 could provide important clues in this mystery."

            "article_content": "Composite images of A2744-GDSp-z4 show it has two large spiral arms stretching out of its center, despite appearing just 1.5 billion years after the dawn of time.\n\nResearchers just found an unexpected galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The large swirl of stars is known as a grand-design spiral galaxy, and its exceptionally advanced age could change what we know about galaxy formation.\n\nGenerally, the older a galaxy is, the farther away it is from us. Scientists can gauge the age and distance of galaxies through something called redshift \u2014 a phenomenon that occurs when light shifts to lower-frequency, redder wavelengths as it crosses large stretches of space. This happens for a couple of reasons; first, because the universe is expanding , older stars naturally end up further away. And second, because red is the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum of light, stars that are very far away tend to appear redder, having a higher redshift. JWST is designed to peer deeply into the red and infrared spectrum, allowing it to see old, distant galaxies more clearly than any previous telescope.\n\nBut spiral galaxies tend to be on the younger side, making the newly-discovered galaxy, designated A2744-GDSp-z4, an outlier. Grand-design galaxies like A2744-GDSp-z4 are characterized by their two well-defined spiral arms. Very few have ever been found with a redshift above 3.0 \u2014 meaning their light has been traveling for nearly 11.5 billion years, according to the Las Cumbres Observatory .\n\nThe newfound galaxy, meanwhile, has a redshift of 4.03, meaning the light JWST detected was emitted more than 12 billion years ago. According to the researchers who discovered it, that means A2744-GDSp-z4 came together when the universe was only about 1.5 billion years old \u2014 and it appears to have formed very rapidly. Given its estimated star formation rate, it accrued a mass of about 10 billion solar masses in just a few hundred million years.\n\nRelated: James Webb telescope confirms we have no idea why the universe is growing the way it is\n\nThis flies in the face of how scientists think spiral galaxies usually form.\n\n\"The rarity of high redshift spirals might be a consequence of galaxies being dynamically hot at those early epochs,\" the researchers, led by Rashi Jain at the National Center for Radio Astrophysics in India, wrote in the new study. \"Dynamically hot systems tend to form clumpy structures,\" rather than highly ordered spirals, the researchers added.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe team theorizes that A2744-GDSp-z4's formation may have been driven by the presence of a stellar bar \u2014 gassy structures found in a majority of galaxies, which fuel starbirth and channel gas between the inner and outer regions of a galaxy, contributing to the galaxy's size and shape. The ancient spiral could also have formed through the merger of two smaller galaxies, though this seems less likely given its orderly structure, the researchers wrote."

            "article_content": "In brief Pump.fun has made it so anyone can be a meme coin \u201cdev,\u201d lowering the barrier to crypto and opening the floodgates.\n\nAs a result, more tokens have been created, bought, and sold this year than ever before\u2014driving degens to Solana.\n\nLove it or hate, Pump\u2019s impact has been undeniable, and it\u2019s Decrypt\u2019s Project of the Year for 2024.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt started on a whim. Two devs, a laptop, and an idea to develop a platform for launching crypto tokens fairly, cheaply, and easily\u2014all while minimizing the risk of scams.\n\nThe product wasn\u2019t perfect\u2014far from it. And after launching in January, it arguably led to more crypto scams than would have existed without it; they just looked different. But by the end of the year, the Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun had become undeniably the most culturally significant crypto project of the year. Maybe of the last several years.\n\nFor better or worse, Pump.fun has lowered the barrier to entry in crypto. It\u2019s made it so anyone and everyone can create a new meme coin\u2014a token which derives its value from perceived cultural meaning, attention, and lulz. The platform is responsible for the creation of over 4.7 million new tokens this year alone, generated over $317 million in revenue, and has accounted for over 60% of all decentralized exchange transactions on the Solana network for the past three months.\n\nWe really contributed to empowering [degen] culture \u2014 Alon, Pump.fun co-founder\n\n\u201cI think meme coins are somewhat inevitable, but I don\u2019t think they would have been able to blow up without Pump.fun,\u201d the project\u2019s pseudonymous co-founder Alon told Decrypt. \u201cI think without that innovation of really permissionlessly and super frictionlessly creating coins, we wouldn't be here today.\u201d\n\nThough Pump.fun was not the first \u201cno-code\u201d token launchpad in crypto, it is the first to catch on in a big way. And that\u2019s had at least two significant outcomes for the industry this year: an explosion of meme coin trading unlike anything before in crypto\u2019s short history, and a realignment of the on-chain economy.\n\nmy ultimate goal is for pump dot fun to be the most fun place on the internet if I don't achieve this then I have failed \u2014 alon (@a1lon9) February 24, 2024\n\nEthereum, once the dominant network for all decentralized, tokenized things since launching in 2015, has given way to Solana, a rival network which launched in 2020. But it hasn\u2019t been without considerable controversy along the way.\n\nCritics decry the platform as emblematic of the worst of crypto, and regulators are now starting to pay closer attention as well.\n\nYou could argue, though, that Pump.fun has served as an unfiltered mirror of the crypto community as a whole this year\u2014all of its ambitions and anxieties. A contentious U.S. election, fears of war and global unrest, and endless degeneracy\u2014there\u2019s a meme coin for it all. It set crypto culture ablaze in 2024, at times even literally, and was responsible for some of the industry\u2019s wildest moments. For these reasons and more, Pump.fun is Decrypt\u2019s project of the year.\n\n\u201cWe really contributed to empowering [degen] culture,\u201d Alon said. \u201cThis is what the product is built for, to a certain extent. It\u2019s to capture these crazy moments, and be a moment in history. We want to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nthe normie mind cannot comprehend pic.twitter.com/po7yNDNY6B \u2014 pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) December 17, 2024\n\nMeme coin revolution\n\nPump.fun\u2019s appeal is simple: It\u2019s made it easier to create a crypto token than ever before, redefining the meaning of the word \u201cdeveloper\u201d\u2014or \u201cdev\u201d\u2014in the process. Creating a new cryptocurrency is no longer the domain of the technocratic elite, sophisticated programmers with years of coding experience and deep pockets. Anyone can do it.\n\nYour grandma can launch a coin. Your teenage son can create a token. And many of them have.\n\nThere are now tens of thousands of new tokens launched on Pump.fun every day, which means tens of thousands of more opportunities for crypto traders young and old to try to make money. And that\u2019s largely what drives demand for the product: the age-old desire to get rich quick.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a lucky trader turning a few dollars into millions, screenshots of crypto wallets posting mindbending monthly profits, or young teens pulling in thousands in SOL on an average morning before school, it\u2019s all been made possible because of Pump.fun.\n\nJust made $2k before school Lock in pic.twitter.com/CG9qkk9EiS \u2014 timothy (@SolanaPlays) November 18, 2024\n\nIn this sense, the product maps neatly onto what pundits and academics have long described as the onset of \u201cfinancial nihilism\u201d\u2014the latest wave in the slow disillusionment, primarily among young people, of the American Dream. The term gained popularity following the GameStop meme stock craze on Robinhood in late 2020, and essentially describes the growing sense that it\u2019s no longer possible to generate wealth the old-fashioned way. The system is rigged, all value is subjective, so might as well take your chances with memes\u2014so the idea goes.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it could help explain why young people are so drawn to the endless churn of meme coins. The trouble is the odds of hitting it big on a meme coin trade are still extremely slim, close to 99% of tokens go to zero, and insider trading still runs amok\u2014not to mention the countless outright scams and rug pulls. But that hasn\u2019t stopped crypto traders from dreaming, and as they rushed to Pump.fun this year in search of the next 1000X, their attention became tokenized.\n\nWhen the world swooned over a baby hippo, Moo Deng, Pump.fun traders turned it into one of the biggest meme coins of the year. When news broke of Donald Trump getting shot, or a celebrity died, or the U.S. election took a turn, there was a meme coin for it all within seconds. Meme coins are created so quickly on Pump.fun following cultural events, some degens now boast of getting their news primarily from the platform\u2019s front page.\n\nUnironically Pump Fun \u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) November 5, 2024\n\nAs pop culture became financialized, Gen Z joined in on the fun\u2014perhaps most notably when the viral TikTok meme \u201cChill Guy\u201d was turned into a Pump.fun token last month and soared to a market cap in the hundreds of millions within days. The frenzy marked payment service company MoonPay\u2019s single biggest day for Solana transactions, a sign of the times.\n\nA product like Pump.fun could not exist on the Ethereum network, which is comparatively slower and more expensive to use, especially when network activity spikes. It\u2019s largely considered more secure than Solana, but that appears to matter very little to the hordes of degens looking to trade memes. Pump.fun clones have been attempted on Ethereum-based layer-2 networks such as Base, which more closely match Solana\u2019s speed and cost efficiency, but have yet to garner the same kind of attention.\n\nAs a result, Solana is now suddenly the go-to place for all things crypto\u2014both culturally and financially. In September, Solana surpassed Ethereum in daily decentralized exchange volume and has been ahead ever since\u2014now with a comfortable $2.3 billion lead, according to Dune data.\n\nAnd since Pump.fun accounts for more than 60% of all Solana transactions over the past three months, it\u2019s safe to say that Solana\u2019s comeback this year\u2014suffering reputationally and its native token SOL losing 97% of its value in the wake of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s implosion\u2014likely isn\u2019t possible without Pump and its many, many memes.\n\nHow it began\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always like this. Way back in January, Pump.fun\u2019s pseudonymous co-founders Alon and Sapijiju were on a cold streak of launching products\u2014like an influencer fundraising tool and a self-described \u201cdumb\u201d project on top of crypto-based social network Friend.tech\u2014that didn\u2019t gain much traction.\n\nAfter noticing too many rug pulls and dodgy pre-sale token launches, the pair of trench warriors decided to fix the problem. They created a product that would let anyone launch a token for just a few bucks (eventually making it completely free), not allowing for malicious contracts or nefarious pre-sales, promising every token to be a \u201cfair launch.\u201d\n\nAll you have to do is fill in your token\u2019s desired name, ticker, description, attach a photo, and, if you\u2019d like, add social media links. There\u2019s no account creation process or ID checks, like most things in DeFi\u2014just connect your Solana wallet and off you go. Pump then naturally takes a cut of all trades on its platform, which is how it makes its money.\n\nWe never really mapped the market, to be honest. \u2014 Alon, Pump.fun cofounder\n\nThat said, with the token creation process becoming standardized, scams had to evolve and become more sophisticated.\n\nNow, malicious actors are hacking celebs' social media accounts, or buying up huge portions of the initial token supply from side wallets at launch to dump on unsuspecting degens. Entire underground economies have spawned to scam people on Pump.fun\u2014bundle tools, rug pull professionals, comment bots, and more. Degens may no longer have to worry about compromised smart contracts, or sending SOL to a pre-sale wallet and wonder if they\u2019ll actually get any tokens back in return, but trading meme coins is still certainly not safe.\n\n\u201cWe never really mapped the market, to be honest,\u201d Alon told Decrypt. \u201cWe were mainly thinking about solving this problem. And were just really deep in the trenches, trying to make it happen.\u201d\n\nIntroducing Pump: Launch a coin that is instantly tradeable without having to seed liquidity Pick a name, ticker, JPG & instantly begin trading on a bonding curve Coming Soon to @solana Keep reading to learn why it will forever change how coins launch\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/uaStnYQ3l0 \u2014 pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) January 10, 2024\n\nThere was no grand opening for Pump.fun, not even a beer cracked between friends. It was simply launched off a laptop, with the two founders not even in the same room and without much thought given to what would happen next.\n\nOn its first day, Pump generated a modest $7,000 in volume\u2014but even that surprised its creators, Alon said, and opened their eyes to the project\u2019s potential. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, every single coin on Solana shall launch on Pump,\u201d the Pump X account tweeted at the time. The duo then knuckled down and improved its \u201ckinda shit\u201d site, Alon explained, as their conviction started to grow.\n\nAlon claims to have DM\u2019d over 3,000 people from across the industry in the early days. It\u2019s become a running joke when people in crypto discover an ignored message from the founder.\n\npeople really think I made that stat up lmao \u2014 alon (@a1lon9) November 7, 2024\n\nYou could hardly blame them though. Most people in crypto ignored Pump.fun in the early going, as tokens launched on the platform back then were generally dismissed as low value and not worth traders\u2019 time.\n\nThat all changed in February when crypto influencer Ansem, who gained notoriety earlier this year for calling the Solana comeback, shouted out a Pump meme coin called Rosebot (ROSE), which then soared to $2.5 million market cap in just 12 hours. It might not sound like much, but it was \u201chuge\u201d at the time, says Alon. Other influencers then followed suit in March.\n\n\u201cEvery day after that day we doubled in volume, or something,\u201d Alon told Decrypt. \u201cI know for a fact that the only way they would have heard about us is through organic channels. I definitely [attribute] our success to that organic stuff and really speaking to people.\u201d\n\nI made a coin, I am shaking pic.twitter.com/1GhnZxegRT \u2014 Don Cryptonium \ud83d\udc51\ud83e\udd84 (@DonCryptonium) March 10, 2024\n\nPump.fun then grew, and grew, and grew. The meme coin Shark Cat launched on Pump in late March, hitting a $387 million market cap by the end of the month\u2014then Teh Epik Duck, then Michi, then Mini, and so on. Each one a massive success in its own right.\n\n\u201cPump.fun changed the game,\u201d pseudonymous trader and Shark Cat deployer 0xWinged, who also has the most followed profile on Pump.fun, told Decrypt. \u201cIt became a close knit community of degens who would ape sub $10,000 market cap shitters, as opposed to traditional meme coins like DOGE.\u201d\n\nBefore long, celebrities and pop culture icons would take notice of Pump and join the fun. Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner shocked crypto industry observers when, in May, she created a token on Pump.fun with the help of celebrity wrangler Sahil Arora.\n\nArora went on to launch countless tokens on the platform for the likes of R&B singer Jason Derulo as well as rappers Lil Pump and Rich the Kid\u2014all of whom claimed to have been scammed by Arora.\n\nSuddenly the platform was brimming with funny memes, goofy performance art stunts, and big celebrities like Iggy Azalea pushing the platform forward. But by the end of the month, a dark cloud cast a shadow over the launchpad.\n\nRecently, a guy created a token called $Hands and posed with a paper under his chin saying, \"I have no hands, I can't do a Rug Pull.\" But when it peaked, he pulled his hands out from behind his back and sold his tokens like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat pic.twitter.com/MalhNvz3Pb \u2014 Rizz God (@Hirizzy) May 6, 2024\n\nIs Pump still fun?\n\nThe so-called livestreaming meta marked another turning point for the platform. Pump.fun token deployers started livestreaming on third-party sites in early May to pump their tokens. It started with a young mom who livestreamed on Kick and promised to perform sexual acts if her son\u2019s meme coin \u201cLiveMom\u201d hit specific market cap milestones. The stunt didn\u2019t last long, and the pair then ghosted.\n\nIt was, again, shocking\u2014valuable currency in the attention economy. And it only seemed to encourage others to push the envelope further.\n\nMeanwhile in $SOL shitcoins... Kid launches coin and the utility is sexually exploiting his (supposed) mother\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/HwTkFDKSTo \u2014 Doonhamer (@DoonhamerNFT) May 2, 2024\n\nLater that same month, a Pump.fun dev doused himself in isopropyl alcohol while livestreaming and had fireworks shot at him, instantly going up in flames. The dev, Mikol, was rushed to hospital with third degree burns across 30% of his body, later enduring months of rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when you combine the attention economy with the degeneracy of 4chan and crypto, you get a very unpredictable landscape of people willing to do literally anything to garner more attention,\u201d Richard Podgurski, who claims to have been the first person to create a livestream token with LiveTwitch, told Decrypt.\n\nPump.fun leaned into it, quickly adding a native livestream feature to its platform and establishing it where the the fringes of society gathered to create and comment on culture\u20144chan with meme coins.\n\nAnd in typical 4chan fashion\u2014where posting is anonymous and just about anything goes\u2014the lines between what was real and what was not soon became blurred. The vibe shifted. Things got dark. More socially conscious degens began questioning whether things were getting out of hand. All the while, Pump.fun\u2019s revenue figures kept soaring.\n\nIt was around this time that a disgruntled Pump.fun employee, Jarett Dunn (also known as Stacc), hacked the platform, draining it of around $2 million worth of funds. Dunn initially claimed to have acted as a whitehat, of sorts, and aimed to \u201ckill\u201d Pump for the harm he believed it was causing.\n\nAnd now; Magick: everybody be cool, this is a r o b b e r y. What it do, staccattack? I'm about to change the course of history. n then rot in jail. am I sane? nah. am I well? v much not. do I want for anything? my mom raised from the dead n barring that: /x \u2014 based birdman stacc (@STACCoverflow) May 16, 2024\n\nBeyond the immediate financial hit that Pump suffered, the reputational damage that came with the hack would prove costly, even if just temporarily. According to a statement from a Pump.fun co-founder in a police report obtained by Decrypt, the company failed to close a $20 million funding round as a result of the hack, due to concerns with company management.\n\nCourt documents associated with the charges against Dunn would also reveal that Pump.fun is tied to Baton Corporation Limited, a company registered in the United Kingdom, which would later become very relevant. Pump.fun cofounders, however, dispute that the company is registered in the U.K. \u201cPump.fun never was and is still not a U.K. company,\u201d the pseudonymous Sapijiju told Decrypt.\n\nIn the months that followed the hack, the stunts on Pump would only escalate, with the company\u2019s daily revenue gains marking highs of more than $5 million by November. Over just a week period in November, users on the platform livestreamed themselves harming animals, recklessly firing of guns, and one even faked a suicide. That was the tipping point. Things had indeed gotten out of hand, even for Pump.fun, which responded by shutting down its livestream feature.\n\nStill, the attention economy cuts both ways, and earlier this month the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. issued a warning against the platform. In response, the team decided to geo-fence the platform, restricting access from those in the UK. Experts claim this could be just the start of the legal troubles for the platform.\n\n\u201cPump.fun must brace for potential legal liabilities tied to its content moderation under Section 230 CDA, including civil lawsuits from harmed users,\u201d said Cyber Attorney and Reputation Management Consultant Andrew Rossow. \u201cIt also faces risks of potential criminal investigations for wire fraud and potential violations of the U.S. Securities Act and EU data regulations.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a lot for a couple trench warriors who had no idea what they\u2019d be getting into just 11 months ago. But it comes with the territory. As Pump.fun grows, so too will the risks and responsibilities.\n\nWhere does it go from here? Critics will say it\u2019s unsustainable. The music will eventually stop. But, for now, if 2024 has taught degens anything, it\u2019s that you\u2019ve gotta respect the Pump."

            "article_content": "Rohan Doctor was a managing director at Goldman Sachs when he founded Louisa AI.\n\nThe startup uses AI to feed deal ideas and networking prompts to bankers and investors.\n\nHere's why he wants to bring the dealmaking playbook to startups.\n\nCold call after cold call, Rohan Doctor wasn't getting as far as he would've hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs managing director had emailed a list of digital strategy execs at banks and private equity firms to try to sell them on his startup, Louisa AI. But he only got a handful of replies back.\n\nTwo years since its launch, Louisa AI has secured about a dozen clients, including some of the biggest names in corporate America. They include Goldman Sachs, VC firm Insight Partners, and, more recently, one of the biggest AI chipmakers and a top consulting firm. But he didn't secure those contracts from cold outreach. He used his own startup's technology, which proactively prompts deal ideas based on people's personal and professional connections, to get in through the front door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Doctor wants to bring his dealmaking playbook to other startups ahead of an anticipated M&A boom.\n\n\"If we're able to close more deals through warm relationships this way, then other startups can, too,\" he said.\n\nThe near-term outlook for M&A activity has gotten brighter, with lower interest rates reducing the cost of borrowing. Wall Street execs are optimistic that Trump's return to the White House, and any business-friendly regulations that may come with it, will be a tailwind for dealmaking. Also, companies resetting their valuations could spur more transactions to close as price expectations align between buyers and sellers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in Silicon Valley, VCs and founders are hopeful about the anticipated looser environment, which could boost tech building and dealmaking. VCs, which rely on selling startups in M&A deals for many of their returns, have been dampened by the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust stance on M&A.\n\nLouisa AI was built to suggest potential deals based on the data it's exposed to. It ingests information about who and what employees know by plugging into company CRMs, messaging platforms like Slack and Symphony, and email providers. Since spinning out of Goldman Sachs in 2023, Louisa AI has raised $5 million in seed funding. It suggests about $1 billion in deal values per quarter, Doctor said.\n\nIt also highlights mutual connections to establish a warm introduction, which can make all the difference in the multi-billion investment banking industry built on relationships. While running the bank-solutions group at Goldman Sachs, Rohan Doctor used his network to close transactions worth tens of millions of dollars. As a startup founder, it's been a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've tried the cold outreach and just emailing,\" Doctor said, adding that the startup stopped doing that after it didn't yield good results. What has worked for Doctor is realizing he knows someone who knows someone.\n\nLouisa AI scored the chipmaker contract after the AI flagged that one of Doctor's staff used to work for someone who now worked at the chip manufacturer. With the consultancy, one of Louisa AI's investors connected Doctor with the consulting firm they used to work for. He declined to name these firms due to non-disclosure agreements.\n\n\"Everything needs to be warm when it comes to big companies doing big things with other people. It has to rely on trust,\" he said."

Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nAs the world races towards 2025, Developer examines what lies ahead for software development in the new year.\n\nAmong the most pressing trends for 2025 are AI development simplification, the integration of cross-functional engineering teams, and the evolution of DevSecOps practices. These shifts promise to redefine how companies approach innovation, security, and efficiency in their development pipelines.\n\nAI-powered development simplification\n\nAvthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale, predicts a significant transformation in the tech stack landscape by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe traditional tech stack will continue to collapse,\u201d Sewrathan notes, highlighting advancements driven by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development. This shift is anticipated to empower engineers of all skill levels to create impactful AI applications with ease.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, the traditional tech stack will continue to collapse, fueled by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development,\u201d Sewrathan explains. \u201cCompanies that deliver frictionless, accessible solutions with low barriers to entry will empower engineers to create impactful AI apps, no matter their level of expertise.\u201d\n\nThis democratisation of AI app creation is expected to increase competition within the industry as more developers gain access to advanced capabilities. Consistency and reliability in AI applications are also set to become paramount.\n\n\u201cAs AI apps become central to everyday interactions in 2025, consistency and reliability will take precedence,\u201d Sewrathan observes.\n\nDeveloper role evolution\n\nIndu Keri, General Manager and Head of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud at Nutanix, envisions a new era of software development starting in 2025.\n\n\u201cSoftware development and engineering is already being democratised with tools like Copilot,\u201d Keri says.\n\nBy combining GenAI with low-code solutions, code will be abstracted to the point of irrelevance. AI will generate applications rather than code, enabling developers to step into strategic roles.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day for developers will change drastically,\u201d Keri notes. \u201cNo longer hamstrung by grunt work, developers will step into an up-leveled, strategic role\u2014communicating with decision-makers about how tech can solve business problems.\u201d\n\nThis evolution, Keri argues, complements developers\u2019 best qualities \u2013 creativity and innovation \u2013 and challenges them to grow into leadership roles within their organisations.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, engineers at any level will be able to create an AI app through the widespread availability of APIs and models,\u201d Sewrathan adds. \u201cBut the differentiators will be consistency, usability, and customer impact.\u201d\n\nAgentic AI and DevOps automation\n\nThe hype around agentic AI will reach boiling point in 2025 as organisations bundle specialised agents for different stages of software delivery, including code generation, testing, and quality assurance. This orchestrator-driven approach will drive a more intelligent approach to DevOps automation.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, says: \u201cInstead of having one, basic GenAI assistant, organisations will bundle together specialised agents for the different stages of software delivery\u2014such as code generation, testing, and quality assurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne agent will act as the orchestrator, directing the others and producing more accurate insights into the end-to-end process.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Coutinho of OutSystems highlights that agentic AI will answer many, but not all, business problems: \u201cFor the last few years, businesses have tried to throw GenAI at all of their problems. The result: GenAI is a remarkable solution for many use cases, but not everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn AI tool is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. Just because tech titans are pushing agentic AI right now doesn\u2019t mean you should scrap simpler solutions. Align your AI strategy with your organisation\u2019s needs, rather than the latest shiny object.\u201d\n\nIntegration of cross-functional engineering teams\n\nMoving beyond AI development, the prediction for cross-functional engineering teams is another area of significant change. Reynolds outlines a future where standalone DevOps teams are phased out in favour of more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, organisations will move away from standalone DevOps teams towards more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines,\u201d Reynolds explains.\n\nThis shift towards unified cross-functional teams is expected to eliminate the remaining silos between software delivery teams and accelerate innovation at a whole new level. To support these integrated teams, organisations will increasingly adopt unified platforms providing capabilities across the entire software delivery lifecycle\u2014from CI/CD to chaos engineering and cloud cost management.\n\nIn line with these platform shifts, Reynolds emphasises the importance of Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) that enable engineers to self-serve the solutions and data they need.\n\n\u201cTo maximise the value of these platforms,\u201d Reynolds advises,\u201c[organisations] will expose these capabilities through IDPs.\u201d\n\nEvolution of DevSecOps practices\n\nThe software development landscape is also witnessing a significant evolution in DevSecOps practices.\n\nDylan Thomas, Senior Director of Product Engineering at OpenText Cybersecurity, predicts that, by 2025, DevSecOps will evolve beyond the \u201cshift-left\u201d paradigm to embrace a more mature \u201cshift everywhere\u201d approach.\n\nThis shift will require organisations to apply the right tools at the right stages of the DevSecOps cycle, improving efficiency and effectiveness in security practices.\n\n\u201cLightweight analysis in IDEs will help developers catch issues early,\u201d Thomas elaborates. \u201cAutomation integrated into pull requests and CI/CD pipelines will ensure a cohesive \u2018integrate once\u2019 approach for core functions such as SAST, SCA, and increasingly DAST, particularly for API security testing.\u201d\n\nThis integration is expected to streamline the development process while enhancing overall security.\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) maturity\n\nOne of the critical components in this evolving landscape is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).\n\nGovernment mandates are driving organisations to adopt SBOMs at scale, requiring them not only to generate these documents but also to make them actionable.\n\nWhile producing SBOMs in standard formats is now routine, the real challenge lies in translating raw data into meaningful risk-based insights.\n\nDevSecOps practices will mature, leveraging tools like VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) to add critical context to SBOMs\u2014reducing inefficiencies in vendor-consumer relationships and enhancing overall security posture.\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s role in managing complex data types\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s extension capabilities are also anticipated to play a significant role in managing complex data types in one place.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, PostgreSQL will solidify its position as the go-to \u2018everything database\u2019\u2014the first to fully integrate AI functionality like embeddings directly within its core ecosystem,\u201d says Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale.\n\n\u201cThis will streamline data workflows, eliminate the need for external processing tools, and enable businesses to manage complex data types in one place.\u201d\n\nAs companies move towards integrated solutions that can handle diverse datasets without relying on standalone or specialised databases, PostgreSQL is leading the charge towards this future state.\n\nDiverse app stores will reshape mobile distribution\n\nThe app store ecosystem is poised for a significant shift as mobile carriers are expected to regain their influence over app distribution.\n\nMatt Tubergen, EVP of Global Strategy & Partnerships at Digital Turbine, said: \u201cThe app store ecosystem is set to shift away from an Apple and Google duopoly to an open landscape as mobile carriers regain the power to connect consumers with apps.\u201d\n\nEmerging regulatory changes are also playing a critical role in leveling the playing field. These include bans that prevent tech giants like Google from incentivising app store preloads, which allow carriers and device manufacturers to preload their own apps on new devices.\n\nThis newfound autonomy positions carriers as pivotal players in alternative app distribution.\n\n\u201cThis renewed autonomy positions carriers as critical players in alternative app distribution, enabling organic growth for alternative app stores,\u201d Tubergen notes.\n\nCarriers are expected to offer developers better revenue opportunities than those provided by Apple and Google, while consumers will benefit from a more diverse selection of apps.\n\nTubergen points out that \u201cthe new, open app store economy will prioritise the needs of developers and users, shifting away from the current model that only serves Apple and Google.\u201d This shift promises a competitive and decentralised landscape where developers gain more control over their revenue streams.\n\nConsumers are expected to enjoy access to a wider variety of apps curated and tailored to their preferences. With third-party app stores gaining influence and major players like Epic Games and Microsoft advocating for inclusivity, the global app distribution model is likely to expand and mirror the thriving alternative stores seen in Asia.\n\nThis evolution promises an inclusive, innovative, and consumer-focused mobile distribution ecosystem.\n\nEmergence of xOps\n\nThe convergence of DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps into a new \u201cxOps\u201d paradigm is expected as more traditional applications adopt AI capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u2018AI-aware\u2019 Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities,\u201d explains Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai.\n\nIncreasing security challenges\n\nWhile AI-generated code can significantly increase developer efficiency, it also introduces security risks due to increased volume of code that must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors.\n\n\u201cWhile research has shown that generative AI can halve the time it takes developers to complete coding tasks, the increased volume of code being produced must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors,\u201d warns Holt.\n\n\u201cThis will increase security risk and lead to additional toil in the later stages of delivery, wiping out any efficiency gains from AI-generated code.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable increase in supply-chain attacks. This is likely to continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nAaron Costello, Chief of SaaS Security Research at AppOmni, observes: \u201cThe past few years, we\u2019ve seen a steady uptick in supply-chain attacks on SaaS through compromised third-party applications. As a result, organisations are placing these integrations and their requested access levels under far more scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy research into data exposures has shown that often no initial foothold is needed for threat actors to gain access to the sensitive data they want. The combination of undocumented legacy API endpoints, over-privileged public access, and gaps in vendor logging capabilities will continue to provide a dangerously effective option for threat actors to execute hit-and-run style attacks.\u201d\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny\n\nDespite the increasing security challenges, a failure to secure software could have ever more serious repercussions. In light of increasing awareness and demand for reliable software systems, developers must prepare for heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, comments: \u201cIn the wake of the CrowdStrike outage, there will be an increase in regulatory pressure around poor-quality software.\u201d\n\nGlobal regulators are expected to introduce more stringent standards that extend beyond existing frameworks like the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). This response is driven by a growing sentiment among consumers; a recent survey conducted by Harness found that ~74% of consumers believe there should be regulations holding companies accountable for poor-quality software updates leading to IT outages.\n\nTo navigate these impending regulatory changes, organisations supporting critical infrastructure \u2013 such as banking, healthcare, and energy services \u2013 must proactively enhance their software testing protocols.\n\n\u201cThey will need well-defined response plans to ensure they can recover quickly when the unexpected happens,\u201d Reynolds notes. Implementing modern software delivery practices is crucial, including feature flags and canary deployments, which enable continuous improvement in code quality and more stable release cycles.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, organisations not only bolster software resilience but also enhance trust and brand loyalty among consumers. As regulations evolve to emphasise software reliability akin to cybersecurity standards, being proactive will be key to supporting business growth and staying ahead of regulatory measures. This approach not only mitigates risks but positions companies favorably in a landscape where quality is increasingly synonymous with competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the predictions for 2025 paint a picture of an industry bracing for radical transformation\u2014driven by advancements in AI development, cross-functional engineering teams, and mature DevSecOps practices. These changes promise to accelerate innovation while enhancing security and user experience across industries.\n\nSee also: PostgreSQL becomes developers\u2019 choice for AI and real-time apps\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?

In my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.\"\n\nReuters reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO.\n\nPutin said on Thursday that Russia had no conditions to start talks with Ukraine and was ready to negotiate with anyone, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBut he said any deal could only be signed with Ukraine's legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nZelenskyy, whose term was due to expire earlier this year but has been extended due to martial law, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin.\n\nPutin dismissed the idea of agreeing to a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice.\n\nAny talks should take as their starting point a preliminary agreement reached between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the early weeks of the war at talks in Istanbul, which was never implemented, he added.\n\nSome Ukrainian politicians regard that draft deal as akin to a capitulation which would have neutered Ukraine's military and political ambitions.\n\nRussia-Ukraine war\n\nRussia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nRussia, which casts the conflict as a defensive special military operation designed to stop dangerous NATO expansion to the east, controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has taken several thousand square kilometers of territory this year.\n\nDetermined to incorporate four Ukrainian regions into Russia, Moscow's forces have taken village after village in the east and are now threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.\n\nPutin said the fighting was complex, so it was \"difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead... (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.\"\n\nDiscussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv's troops would be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.\n\nThe war has transformed the Russian economy and Putin said it was showing signs of overheating which was stoking worryingly high inflation. But he said growth was higher than many other economies such as Britain.\n\nAsked if he'd do anything differently, he said he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and that Russia should have been better prepared for the conflict.\n\nUKRAINIAN OFFICIAL TAKES CREDIT AFTER RUSSIAN GENERAL IGOR KIRILLOV KILLED BY EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN MOSCOW\n\nAsked by a BBC reporter if he'd looked after Russia, something that Boris Yeltsin had asked him to do before handing over the presidency at the end of 1999, Putin said he had.\n\n\"We have moved back from the edge of the abyss,\" Putin said.\n\n\"I have done everything to ensure that Russia is an independent and sovereign power that is able to make decisions in its own interests.\"\n\nRussia, Putin said, had made proposals to Syria's new rulers about Russia's military bases there. He said most people Moscow had spoken to on the issue favored them staying.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRussia would need to think about whether the bases should remain or not, he added, but rumors about the death of Russian influence in the Middle East were exaggerated.\n\nPutin touted what he said was the invincibility of the \"Oreshnik\" hypersonic missile that Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organize another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defense systems could shoot it down.\n\nIn Brussels, Zelenskyy addressed Putin's missile suggestion during a press conference at a European Council meeting, remarking of Putin, \"Do you think he is a sane person?\""

            "article_content": "Sudan\u2019s civil war has attracted various foreign actors to support one side against the other. In some cases, historically known allies are divided between the main warring sides. More than ten countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia are known to have taken part in Sudan\u2019s war, making it one of the region\u2019s many proxy conflicts.\n\nThese countries are Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, Algeria, Libya, the UAE, Turkey, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Russia, China, Chad, and South Sudan. Saudi Arabia has hosted several peace talks between the two warring sides in the city of Jeddah, but it is said that Riyadh is supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in this war, contrary to its ally, the UAE, which supports the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and UAE\n\nSudan\u2019s African neighbors also have considerable sway over the situation. To the east, Ethiopia and Eritrea are now supporting the paramilitaries of the RSF, which recently fought alongside Ethiopia against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which in turn is supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). Other former rebel groups in Darfur and armed groups in eastern Sudan are fighting alongside the RSF. The head of the Beja Conference, Mussa Mohamed Ahmed, the advisor to former president Omer El-Basher, is backing the SAF. He recently just returned from Eritrea after spending months among his remaining troops and recruits; most hail from his ethnic group of El-Beja tribes.\n\nEgypt, for historical reasons, has always supported the Sudanese army, which was founded during the British-Egyptian colonial administration more than 100 years ago. At the time, the Sudanese and the Egyptian armies were founded as one body. Now, the Egyptian air force has been accused of intervening in Sudan by the head of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo Hemedti, in his latest speech on 10 October following the group\u2019s defeat in Jabel Moyia in the province of Sennar.\n\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam \u2014fiercely opposed by Egypt\u2014further complicated the issue. Cairo is standing with the SAF because it reportedly supports the TPLF rebels.\n\nTo the west, Chad, sharing more than 20 ethnic groups with Sudan, was accused of facilitating and delivering weapons from the United Arab Emirates using its eastern airports in the cities of Abeche and Um-Djaras, the hometown of the former president Idress Debye\u2019 of the RSF; the two countries have denied the accusations. However, Sudanese army leaders and officials kept publicly repeating these accusations. Media reports and the United Nations have independently confirmed weapons are coming from the UAE to Sudan\u2019s RSF.\n\nThe UAE also built a hospital in Abeche in eastern Chad for free medical services to the Sudanese refugees and Chadian people. Reports have suggested medical facilities in Eastern Chad have been used for military activities and smuggling weapons\u2014doctors working there have told me that they have no idea about such military operations going on inside their medical facility.\n\nSouth Sudan, which is entirely economically dependent on Sudan, has finally agreed with the two sides to guarantee the flow of its oil exports. Oil, which only passes through Sudan, represents about 90% of national income. The country received hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees fleeing the latest Khartoum war, the third after Chad and Egypt.\n\nRussia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Iran\n\nRussia and Ukraine paradoxically take the same sides in the war in Khartoum. Both support the SAF diplomatically and militarily. Russia continues to support Sudan\u2019s regime as it has historically done at the UN Security Council. Ukraine\u2019s backing of the SAF came in light of its opposition to the Wagner group, which supported the RSF before and after the war. The Wagner Group's involvement in the Ukraine conflict is evident.\n\nA source at the army\u2019s airbase in Omdurman, the twin city of the Sudanese capital, said that early in the war, Ukrainian teams came to their base to fix some of the fighter jets damaged by RSF weapons. The air force is the only advantage that the SAF has over the RSF, which has increased the number of its soldiers during the course of this war; its leaders alleged that they are now over a million strong.\n\nUkrainian and Russian fighters were seen in different parts of Sudan, both in Omdurman in government-controlled areas and Russian fighters were seen in El-Geneiana, the capital of West Darfur State.\n\nTurkey has reportedly offered its famous Bayraktar drones to the army, and Qatar is also supporting the SAF. It is quite understandable why these two countries are backing the army, which now has Islamist factions fighting alongside it, such as the Al-Baraa Ibn Malik brigade . The former Omer El-Basher regime, which the Islamists backed, came to power in a coup and ruled for 30 years.\n\nIran, Sudan\u2019s old ally, is back again after a few years of boycotting relations while El-Basher was still in power, but has since been restored by the SAF leader, Abdul Fattah Al-Burhan. Now, they are back to support the regular army, offering the Muhajir-6 drones, which helped push the RSF out from Omdurman\u2019s strategic locations towards North Khartoum last year. Iranian elements are walking around in the stifling heat of Port Sudan hotels, Sudan\u2019s new capital city, after the army and the sovereign council lost control of most of Khartoum at the beginning of the war last year.\n\nAlgeria has also offered fighter jets to the Sudanese army. It said that the country supports the SAF because the UAE, which supports the RSF, supports Morocco.\n\nThe impact of foreign intervention\n\nAs a result of interventions and support to Sudan\u2019s warring parties, 11 million Sudanese people have been displaced from their homes, making it the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed . Sudan is now facing the most significant famine in the world, making it currently the most catastrophic humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The warring sides were both accused of committing ethnic cleansing and genocide, especially the RSF in West Darfur State\u2019s El-Geniena.\n\nApart from the humanitarian impact, there is also a political impact; the interests of the different sides in this conflict have complicated the situation further and made any diplomatic or peaceful solution to the war more difficult.\n\nFor example, the SAF refused to participate in any talks in which the UAE was a mediator or even a supervisor, accusing the country of supporting its rivals. It also filed a complaint against that country and Chad at the UN Security Council.\n\nThe SAF has also rejected all the African initiatives to stop the war proposed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (representing the east and horn of Africa), African Union, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia after accusing them of supporting their rivals.\n\nThe RSF is more flexible in this matter. It has accepted every initiative by any country wanting to stop the war in Sudan through peaceful and diplomatic discourse, except Hemeti's last speech , in which he accused Egypt of supporting the SAF and demanded that the country stop importing Sudanese products to its northern neighbor.\n\nPeople believe that the harsh position of the Sudanese army comes from its Islamist elements, who believe that they can get rid of the RSF. Unless Abu Dhabi and Riyadh agree on how to end this conflict, many see it as prolonging war. All negotiations have failed so far because different countries have different interests and agendas.\n\nThe international community\u2019s role has been very weak. The United States facilitated a temporary ceasefire to evacuate diplomats, their families, and other foreigners living in the country but ignored the issue of the war itself. Only then did it suggest peace talks in Jeddah with the Saudis. When talks failed, the United States insisted on having peaceful humanitarian corridors to deliver the aid, which, once secured, caused the Sudan issue to fade from the spotlight.\n\nNotably, the two US presidential candidates never mentioned Sudan in their speeches during the campaign. The Sudanese and the African people now fear the Trump administration will ignore Sudan as it did in the past.\n\nPeople in Sudan and the broader Middle East and Africa believe that the international community has totally ignored them and that the US outsourced its foreign policy in the region to its allies, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabis, to deal with the urgent issues on their behalf.\n\nThe views represented in this piece are those of the author and do not express the official position of the Wilson Center."

            "article_content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was ready to make a compromise regarding ending the war in Ukraine in possible talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nPutin said he had not spoken with Trump for years.\n\nPutin dismissed the idea of agreeing to a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on ending the war and had no conditions for starting talks with the Ukrainian authorities.\n\nTrump, a self-styled master of brokering agreements and author of the 1987 book \"Trump: the Art of the Deal\", has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, but has not yet given any details on how he might achieve that.\n\nPutin, fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, told a reporter for a U.S. news channel that he was ready to meet Trump, whom he said he had not spoken to for years.\n\nUS SLAPS SANCTIONS ON COMPANIES TIED TO NORD STREAM 2 IN BID TO SQUEEZE RUSSIA\n\nAsked what he might be able to offer Trump, Putin dismissed an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had got much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises,\" Putin said, after saying that Russian forces, advancing across the entire front, were moving towards achieving their primary goals in Ukraine.\n\n\"Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out. In my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.\"\n\nReuters reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO.\n\nPutin said on Thursday that Russia had no conditions to start talks with Ukraine and was ready to negotiate with anyone, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBut he said any deal could only be signed with Ukraine's legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nZelenskyy, whose term was due to expire earlier this year but has been extended due to martial law, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin.\n\nPutin dismissed the idea of agreeing to a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice.\n\nAny talks should take as their starting point a preliminary agreement reached between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the early weeks of the war at talks in Istanbul, which was never implemented, he added.\n\nSome Ukrainian politicians regard that draft deal as akin to a capitulation which would have neutered Ukraine's military and political ambitions.\n\nRussia-Ukraine war\n\nRussia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nRussia, which casts the conflict as a defensive special military operation designed to stop dangerous NATO expansion to the east, controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has taken several thousand square kilometers of territory this year.\n\nDetermined to incorporate four Ukrainian regions into Russia, Moscow's forces have taken village after village in the east and are now threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.\n\nPutin said the fighting was complex, so it was \"difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead... (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.\"\n\nDiscussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv's troops would be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.\n\nThe war has transformed the Russian economy and Putin said it was showing signs of overheating which was stoking worryingly high inflation. But he said growth was higher than many other economies such as Britain.\n\nAsked if he'd do anything differently, he said he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and that Russia should have been better prepared for the conflict.\n\nUKRAINIAN OFFICIAL TAKES CREDIT AFTER RUSSIAN GENERAL IGOR KIRILLOV KILLED BY EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN MOSCOW\n\nAsked by a BBC reporter if he'd looked after Russia, something that Boris Yeltsin had asked him to do before handing over the presidency at the end of 1999, Putin said he had.\n\n\"We have moved back from the edge of the abyss,\" Putin said.\n\n\"I have done everything to ensure that Russia is an independent and sovereign power that is able to make decisions in its own interests.\"\n\nRussia, Putin said, had made proposals to Syria's new rulers about Russia's military bases there. He said most people Moscow had spoken to on the issue favored them staying.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRussia would need to think about whether the bases should remain or not, he added, but rumors about the death of Russian influence in the Middle East were exaggerated.\n\nPutin touted what he said was the invincibility of the \"Oreshnik\" hypersonic missile that Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organize another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defense systems could shoot it down.\n\nIn Brussels, Zelenskyy addressed Putin's missile suggestion during a press conference at a European Council meeting, remarking of Putin, \"Do you think he is a sane person?\""

            "article_content": "On Thursday the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has announced they will keep interest rates at 4.75%, in yet another blow for Labour.\n\nOn Wednesday official figures released shows inflation rose in November and the consumer prices index increased by 2.6% year-on-year, up from 2.3% the previous month, this is above the BoE\u2019s 2% target.\n\nRob Morgan, Chief Investment Analyst at Charles Stanley said the bank is now \u201cwary of loosening too much too soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially now fiscal policies revealed in the Budget could add fuel to the inflationary fire into the New Year.\n\n\u201cThe additional costs for employers in the form of higher National Insurance and minimum wage rises looks set to reinforce the trend of escalating costs in the services sector.\n\n\u201cAlthough employers might take some of the hit with lower corporate margins, much of the impact could take the form of higher consumer prices.\u201d\n\nLily Megson, Policy Director at My Pension Expert, said: \u201cThe decision to hold the base rate comes as no surprise following consecutive months of rising inflation. So, where does that leave us as the year comes to an end? Undoubtedly, the economic landscape is a lot more predictable than 12 months, but it\u2019s not without challenges. Inflation is proving sticky, and while the base rate is predicted to drop throughout 2025, the Bank of England will not rush these decisions.\n\n\u201cSavers, especially those nearing retirement, will need to look to the year ahead and factor in shifting interest rates as they pursue their financial goals. Taking advantage of higher interest rates in the short-term will likely be on some people\u2019s agenda, while others will be considering longer-term options for building their pension pots. Crucially, however, these are not decisions they should have to make alone.\n\n\u201cConsumers should not be left exposed to changing macroeconomic headwinds. Instead, the government must step up to ensure people are supported in their financial planning by delivering better access to financial support, education, guidance and advice.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, independent financial advice will remain essential for millions of people, but policymakers have a key role to play in encouraging the UK public to engage with their retirement plans, and ultimately empowering people to achieve their financial goals.\u201d\n\nBen Nichols, Managing Director at RAW Capital Partners, said: \u201cNo early Christmas present, but a cut was largely out of the question given the ongoing inflationary concerns. Fortunately, the outlook for further rate cuts in 2025 is far more promising. Governor Bailey recently suggested that the MPC is preparing to implement up to four reductions to the base rate next year.\n\n\u201cGiven that inflation is unlikely to rise as sharply or for as long as it did two years ago, another rate cut could be on the cards as early as February, which would provide the property market with a welcome shot in the arm.\n\n\u201cThat said, higher borrowing costs will naturally weigh on property investors\u2019 minds, even if underlying data relating to buyer demand and transaction levels is positive. Therefore, the onus remains on lenders and brokers to better support borrowers as they wait for the Bank of England to relax the monetary policy environment.\n\n\u201cI expect that flexible financial products, firm commitments, and transparent communication will continue to be vital qualities for lenders to provide in the months ahead as a result.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Yet realizing measurable business value from AI-powered applications requires a new game plan. Legacy application architectures simply aren\u2019t capable of meeting the high demands of AI-enhanced applications. Rather, the time is now for organizations to modernize their infrastructure, processes, and application architectures using cloud native technologies to stay competitive.\n\nThe time is now for modernization\n\nToday\u2019s organizations exist in an era of geopolitical shifts, growing competition, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. AI applications can help by supporting innovation, but only if they have the flexibility to scale when needed. Fortunately, by modernizing applications, organizations can achieve the agile development, scalability, and fast compute performance needed to support rapid innovation and accelerate the delivery of AI applications. David Harmon, director of software development for AMD says companies, \u201creally want to make sure that they can migrate their current [environment] and take advantage of all the hardware changes as much as possible.\u201d The result is not only a reduction in the overall development lifecycle of new applications but a speedy response to changing world circumstances.\n\nBeyond building and deploying intelligent apps quickly, modernizing applications, data, and infrastructure can significantly improve customer experience. Consider, for example, Coles, an Australian supermarket that invested in modernization and is using data and AI to deliver dynamic e-commerce experiences to its customers both online and in-store. With Azure DevOps, Coles has shifted from monthly to weekly deployments of applications while, at the same time, reducing build times by hours. What\u2019s more, by aggregating views of customers across multiple channels, Coles has been able to deliver more personalized customer experiences. In fact, according to a 2024 CMSWire Insights report, there is a significant rise in the use of AI across the digital customer experience toolset, with 55% of organizations now using it to some degree, and more beginning their journey.\n\nBut even the most carefully designed applications are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. If given the opportunity, bad actors can extract sensitive information from machine learning models or maliciously infuse AI systems with corrupt data. \u201cAI applications are now interacting with your core organizational data,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cHaving the right guard rails is important to make sure the data is secure and built on a platform that enables you to do that.\u201d The good news is modern cloud based architectures can deliver robust security, data governance, and AI guardrails like content safety to protect AI applications from security threats and ensure compliance with industry standards.\n\nThe answer to AI innovation\n\nNew challenges, from demanding customers to ill-intentioned hackers, call for a new approach to modernizing applications. \u201cYou have to have the right underlying application architecture to be able to keep up with the market and bring applications faster to market,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cNot having that foundation can slow you down.\u201d\n\nEnter cloud native architecture. As organizations increasingly adopt AI to accelerate innovation and stay competitive, there is a growing urgency to rethink how applications are built and deployed in the cloud. By adopting cloud native architectures, Linux, and open source software, organizations can better facilitate AI adoption and create a flexible platform purpose built for AI and optimized for the cloud. Harmon explains that open source software creates options, \u201cAnd the overall open source ecosystem just thrives on that. It allows new technologies to come into play.\u201d\n\nApplication modernization also ensures optimal performance, scale, and security for AI applications. That\u2019s because modernization goes beyond just lifting and shifting application workloads to cloud virtual machines. Rather, a cloud native architecture is inherently designed to provide developers with the following features:\n\nThe flexibility to scale to meet evolving needs\n\nBetter access to the data needed to drive intelligent apps\n\nAccess to the right tools and services to build and deploy intelligent applications easily\n\nSecurity embedded into an application to protect sensitive data\n\nTogether, these cloud capabilities ensure organizations derive the greatest value from their AI applications. \u201cAt the end of the day, everything is about performance and security,\u201d says Harmon. Cloud is no exception."

It didn\u2019t look like much, but these heirlooms were a part of his daily life and these objects could help me tell his story.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, when I looked at the heirlooms I could see a sequential timeline. He had bought a new wallet before he died, so I had found his old one, a gift I made for him at an arts and crafts class in elementary school. The pocketknife in the cupholder reminded me of one he had given me in middle school, his Giants hat was torn and smashed but held memories of my dad attending a few of my track meets in high school and wearing a similar hat. The thermos represented his love of coffee that followed a lifetime of drinking booze.\n\nAfter I wrote about collecting the keepsakes from his car, I let the heirlooms guide me through my writing journey and started with the wallet and pocketknife. The more I thought about my father using these keepsakes and the memories that resonated off them, the more questions I had about his life.\n\nI regrettably never asked enough questions when he was alive. I knew very little about his family tree and upbringing. I knew he was estranged from his father, and his mother was not a stable figure in his life, and he was not close to his other family members.\n\nMy dad spent the last years of his life recovering from a life of instability and alcohol addiction and had experienced homelessness. After I graduated high school in the Syracuse area, I moved to Manhattan, and we saw each other maybe twice a year. We had a \u2018phone relationship,\u2019 that is when he had a phone. I had some letters and cards he sent me that shared a different address to write him back each time. We didn\u2019t have special memories besides our short visits that took place usually at the bus station.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had to sleuth to find answers to supplement my memories.\n\nDWI Records\n\nThe first artifact I gathered was his DWI records.\n\nAfter he died and before I started writing, I had an impulse to gather his DWI records from the county where I grew up. After I started writing, I understood why my mind went directly to the records, they were a way to understand the mistakes he carried with him throughout his life. These memories are in the Pocketknife chapter that\u2019s based on seeing a pocketknife in my father\u2019s car and how the pocketknife looked similar to the one he gave me in middle school, right before he was arrested and went to prison because of his drinking problems.\n\nAs his life spirals downward, the heart of the chapter is healing our relationship, when I wanted to walk away. I enjoyed incorporating my searching for artifacts into the story.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c...two and half months after my father died, I sent my payment to the Onondaga County Clerk, with a copy of his death certificate and a letter, asking for any information that was on file under my father\u2019s name. When I read the convictions in these files, my shoulders sink and my heart opens more with what has been left unsaid. I\u2019m making peace while staring at these documents that hold the reasons why I hadn\u2019t always wanted him in my life.\u201d\n\nThe DWI records also helped my writing process for the Wallet chapter, which held my best memories of us running on a dirt track near my childhood home the summer before I turned 10. Running together would become a core memory of us in the story, the glue of our relationship. I wrote about my father timing me and sharing racing techniques and the togetherness that would soon end because of his alcoholism. This is where the dates from the DWI records helped me see that my father was falling apart during the time I admired him most.\n\nHealth Records\n\nI did not know my father\u2019s health records would be so important to my writing process.\n\nI had stalled on gathering this significant artifact from the clinic. It would turn out to be a goldmine for storytelling. It shared over 100 pages of insight on my dad\u2019s health, mental wellbeing, and his depression, the pages are full of sessions with counselors about his livelihood and his rehab plans. The pages share his time in foster care, his academic path, where he lived and when. I could compare these dates with my own path.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could weave these facets into the story in my own words and share my adult perspective while braiding the narrative with emotions of my younger self. Mostly, reading the records that span 20 years of his life helped me have empathy for my father as a person despite his obvious flaws.\n\nReading about the darker days of his life made me wonder: Where did he experience joy? Who was he before he drank so much?\n\nI wanted to include facets of my dad\u2019s younger self, to entwine my adolescence with his in the story.\n\nHigh School Transcripts\n\nSince his health records confirmed he was a foster child in high school, I looked at his yearbook I gathered after he died from one of his old roommates. Then I reached out to the high school\u2019s records department by email.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s high school\u2019s transcripts revealed his home address and the last name of the family he lived with. A girl in his grade in the yearbook had the same last name. In the Internet age, it wasn\u2019t hard to find her. She was happy to talk with me about my dad. Our conversation was a gift and helped me fill in the gaps to the questions I had and helped me envision where my father had spent happier days in his life. The yearbook showed photos of him on the track team in high school and later I connected with one of his track buddies through email to ask questions about his time as a runner.\n\nWhen I found a pocket-sized New Testament in my dad\u2019s car, I was surprised. I had only heard him swear about life being hell. In this chapter I try to see my father in a new light. In a box stored away and rediscovered after a move, there were letters my father wrote while doing time in a correctional facility. The letters were over 20 years old. I used the letters within the story, transcribing parts of each one. In one of the letters, he had expressed conversations he had with a Reverend and wrote about reclaiming his life. These letters would help me write the chapter about how my dad\u2019s faith had been restored and his hope that he too could be forgiven.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have only 43 days left here after you receive this card. One month and one week; so not forever but it feels like eternity. I\u2019ll have been sober for almost 9 months when I get out and want to do something important with the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nDuring our last visit, he appeared to be happier than I had ever seen him, just three months before the fire. He gave me some of his writings that day from a small journal. His thoughts on these pages would later be part of the Clipboard chapter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen I wrote about his rings, I remembered a conversation with my father about the night he lost his rings at the homeless shelter, but I wanted further proof of his time there. I turned to the health records, and I emailed the shelter to gain some information about his stay.\n\n\u201c\u2026while looking at his health records, the counselor notes show he was evicted from a home he was living\u2026I\u2019d see the three days he spent at the Rescue Mission following an eviction. It reads that he was planning to apply for public assistance. In capital letters it reads he is homeless and unemployed.\u201d\n\nPiecing Together Clues\n\nWhen I was writing about the challenges my dad went through, every little email, document, and transcript was like a clue. Every discovery while writing about my father\u2019s troubles was like having a conversation with him, as though he was alive.\n\nIn the Giants hat chapter, I reminisce about my own high school track accomplishments by using my binders full of racing stats that coincide with my father\u2019s health records, so I could compare what I was achieving when my father was on probation and failing to get a grip on his life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo gain a fuller understanding of my father\u2019s young adult life, I needed more information: his military records, his college transcripts, and a copy of his diploma, then I found articles he wrote for a college newspaper that were archived online.\n\nAll of these documents improved the story I wanted to tell about our special connection and finding healing after sudden loss. Every artifact helped my grief tremendously along the way too.\n\nAfter the memoir was published in 2023, I kept searching for more artifacts. When I gathered a copy of my father\u2019s birth certificate it was added to a memory box I can share with my kids. Other keepsakes will wait and will be shared when they are older.\n\nThe pages of my story are filled with sorrow, grief, and hardship. I know my father was an imperfect person, but I don\u2019t see him that way; the artifacts showed me who he was beyond his struggles and mistakes."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new study published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, unveils a novel approach to measuring public attention using reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The research bridges the gap between unconventional indicators and macroeconomic analysis, revealing surprising links between UAP sightings and economic conditions at multiple geographical levels in the United States.\n\nThe study highlights that UAP reports, often dismissed as a niche phenomenon, serve as a robust proxy for public attention. By analyzing daily-level data from NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center), the researchers show that UAP sightings are more frequent in wealthier regions but exhibit counter-cyclical patterns within those regions over time. These findings suggest that shifts in attention to extraordinary phenomena may reflect broader fluctuations in public focus.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nMacroeconomic correlation: UAP sightings are positively correlated with economic conditions across regions but display counter-cyclical patterns within regions over time.\n\nCausal evidence: A quasi-experimental design leveraging variations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions demonstrates a causal link between restricted mobility and increased UAP reports, further establishing the measure as an indicator of public attention.\n\nPolicy implications: Regions with higher UAP sighting levels show muted responses to monetary policy shocks, suggesting that attention variations can significantly influence economic outcomes.\n\nThe researchers compared UAP sightings to conventional attention metrics, finding strong correlations. This innovative measure offers unique advantages, including the ability to analyze attention at different geographical and temporal scales.\n\nImplications for policy and research\n\nGoldstein and Raveh's findings underscore the central role of public attention in economic dynamics. Their work not only enhances the toolkit for macroeconomic analysis but also provides policymakers with insights into managing public attention to mitigate economic shocks.\n\nThe study invites further exploration into how unconventional forms of attention, like UAP sightings, intersect with economic behaviors. \"We hope this work inspires future research to deepen our understanding of the connection between public attention and macroeconomic outcomes,\" the authors state.\n\nThe research uses comprehensive UAP sighting data from NUFORC, spanning over two decades, to construct a daily-level panel of reports across U.S. counties. The analysis integrates economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure robust conclusions.\n\nThis pioneering work highlights the value of thinking beyond traditional metrics, shedding light on the role of seemingly unrelated phenomena in understanding economic patterns.\n\nMore information: Nathan Goldstein et al, Looking up the sky: unidentified aerial phenomena and macroeconomic attention, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (2024).

The antimatter particle is the partner of a massive matter particle called hyperhelium-4, and its discovery could help scientists tackle the mystery of why regular matter came to dominate the universe, despite the fact that matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts at the dawn of time.\n\nThis imbalance is known as \"matter-antimatter asymmetry.\" Matter particles and antimatter particles annihilate on contact, releasing their energy back into the cosmos. That implies that if an imbalance between the two hadn't arisen early in the universe, then the cosmos may have been a much emptier and less interesting place indeed.\n\nThe LHC is no stranger to paradigm-shifting discoveries about the early universe. Running in a 17-mile (27-kilometer) long loop beneath the Alps near Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC is most famous for its discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, the \"messenger\" of the Higgs Field responsible for giving other particles their mass at the dawn of time.\n\nThe collisions that occur at the LHC generate a state of matter called \"quark-gluon plasma.\" This dense sea of plasma is the same as the \"primordial soup\" of matter that filled the universe around one-millionth of a second after the Big Bang.\n\nExotic \"hypernuclei\" and their antimatter counterparts emerge from this quark-gluon plasma, allowing scientists a glimpse at the conditions of the early universe.\n\nRelated: World's smallest particle accelerator is 54 million times smaller than the Large Hadron Collider, and it works\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

However, they are rarely found in nature and are difficult to create and study in the lab. This has made them somewhat mysterious.\n\nAn image of the ALICE detector taken during LHC upgrades in 2019 (Image credit: Robert Lea)\n\nThe discovery of the first evidence of the hypernuclei that is an antimatter counterpart of hyperhelium-4 was made at the LHC detector ALICE.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the nine experiments at the LHC, each with its own detector, generate their results by slamming together protons at near the speed of light, the ALICE collaboration creates quark-gluon plasma by slamming together much heavier particles, usually lead nuclei, or \"ions.\"\n\n\n\nThe collision of iron ions (try saying that ten times fast) is ideal for generating significant amounts of hypernuclei. Yet until recently, scientists conducting heavy-ion collisions had only succeeded in observing the lightest hypernucleus, hypertriton, and its antimatter partner, antihypertriton.\n\nThat was until earlier in 2024 when scientists used the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in New York to detect antihyperhydrogen-4, which is composed of an antiproton, two antineutrons, and a quark-containing particle called an \"antilambda.\"\n\nNow, ALICE has followed this with the detection of a heavier anti-hypernuclei particle, antihyperhelium-4, composed of two antiprotons, an antineutron, and an antilambda.\n\nAn illustration of antimatter particles entering the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider.

            "article_content": "A recent groundbreaking experiment in which anesthesia was administered to rats has convinced some scientists that tiny structures in the rodents\u2019 brains are responsible for the experience of consciousness. To pull it off, microscopic hollow tube structures called \u201cmicrotubules\u201d perform some advanced physics; the experts believe microtubules perform incredible operations in the quantum realm. Citing the work of earlier researchers, the study infers that the same kinds of quantum operations are likely happening in the human brain.\n\nDuring their rat brain experiments, scientists at Wellesley College in Massachusetts gave the rodents isoflurane, a type of inhaled general anesthetic used to induce and maintain unconsciousness for medical procedures. One group of drugged rats also received microtubule-stabilizing drugs, while the other did not. The researchers discovered that the microtubule-stabilizing molecules kept the rats conscious for longer than the nonstabilized rats, which more quickly lost their \u201crighting reflex,\u201d or the ability to restore normal posture, according to the group\u2019s findings, which were published in the peer-reviewed journal eNeuro in August 2024.\n\nThe Wellesley study is significant because the physical source of consciousness has been a mystery for decades. It\u2019s a major step toward verifying a theory that our brains perform quantum operations, and that this ability generates our consciousness\u2014an idea that\u2019s been gaining traction over the past three decades.\n\nThe notion that quantum physics must be the underlying mechanism for consciousness first emerged in the 1990s, when Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Roger Penrose, PhD, and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, popularized the idea that neural microtubules enable quantum processes in our brain, giving rise to consciousness. Specifically, they postulated in a 1996 paper that consciousness may operate as a quantum wave passing through the brain\u2019s microtubules. This is known as Orch OR theory, referring to the ability of microtubules to perform quantum computations through a mathematical process Penrose calls \u201cobjective reduction.\u201d\n\nIn quantum physics, a particle does not exist in the way classical physics observes it, with a definite physical location. Instead, it exists as a cloud of probabilities. If it comes into contact with its environment, as when a measuring apparatus observes it, then the particle loses its \u201csuperposition\u201d of multiple states. It collapses into a definite, measurable state, the state in which it was observed. Penrose hypothesized that \u201ceach time a quantum-wave function collapses in this way in the brain, it gives rise to a moment of conscious experience.\u201d\n\nIf this quantum theory of consciousness tied to microtubules turns out to be correct, it could revolutionize our understanding of consciousness and even strengthen the trailblazing theory that consciousness, on a quantum level, is capable of being in all places at the same time. In other words, it can exist everywhere simultaneously, suggesting that your own consciousness can hypothetically connect with quantum particles beyond your brain, maybe entangling with consciousness all across the universe.\n\nMany scientists disregard the Orch OR theory because quantum effects have only been produced in the lab under extremely cold conditions. For example, our technology now includes quantum computers, but their operations rely on temperatures near absolute zero (around minus 273 degrees Celsius) to maintain their quantum states. The warm brain falls well outside those limits, at about 32 to 40 degrees Celsius (about 90 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the deepest regions of the brain, according to a 2022 study. Yet scientists have collected a promising set of data over the years indicating that certain quantum-level operations in animals and plants may actually be responsible for life\u2019s functions.\n\nFor example, scientists theorize that plants, which live at temperatures far warmer than absolute zero, probably use quantum processes to efficiently convert light into energy. First, plants transform photons, or light particles, into a form of matter called excitons, transporting them to the plant\u2019s chloroplasts to start photosynthesis. During this journey, the excitons must navigate around other internal plant structures\u2014fast enough to preserve their energy all the way to their destination. Scientists suggest that plants must use the quantum property of superposition in order to try all possible paths simultaneously. That way, excitons can arrive at their destination in the most efficient way possible.\n\nSimilarly, it may make sense for the billions of neurons firing simultaneously in the human brain to work under the \u201caction over a distance\u201d property of quantum entanglement\u2014the potential for two particles that are very far away from each other to be connected. Scientists have observed this phenomenon in atomic particles before. When they studied one particle, another very distant particle changed its properties as well, even though the two were not apparently connected in any way. An August 2024 study in the journal Physics Review E proposes that a fatty material called myelin, which sheathes the brain cell\u2019s axon, provides the ideal environment for this entanglement. Since the brain appears to be capable of performing quantum operations to facilitate our thoughts, some scientists surmise that this process gives rise to our consciousness.\n\nTwo earlier landmark studies also support a quantum perspective on consciousness. Both involved experiments shining light particles into microtubules and observing that the signal did not degrade. In fact, according to these studies, the experiments demonstrated that quantum states in microtubule signaling can and probably do exist.\n\nOne of the studies, an experiment by physicist and oncology professor Jack Tuszy\u0144ski, PhD, used ultraviolet photons to create quantum reactions for up to five nanoseconds. This quantum coherence lasted thousands of times longer than researchers had expected in a microtubule. Similarly, at the University of Central Florida, researchers shined visible light into one end of microtubules and measured how long the microtubules took to emit that light. They observed re-emission of this light over hundreds of milliseconds to seconds\u2014more than enough time for the brain to perform all of its functions.\n\nThis observation provides concrete evidence that neurons are able to work at speeds that allow quantum operations. It brings us another step closer to understanding exactly how our brain\u2014and perhaps our very consciousness\u2014is linked to a quantum universe.\n\nThe mind \u201cas a quantum phenomenon\u201d would \u201cshape our thinking about a wide variety of related questions, such as whether coma patients or nonhuman animals are conscious,\u201d neuroscientist and Wellesley College professor Mike Wiest, PhD, says in a press release about his team\u2019s recent anesthesia study. In addition to the new work helping us understand more about how to treat brain-related health issues, he says \u201cwe will have entered a new era in our understanding of what we are.\u201d"

            "article_content": "By Cina LAWSON\n\nFor too long, African countries have been sidelined from the digital revolution due to limited technical capacity and inadequate infrastructure. Artificial intelligence promises to bridge the digital divide, but realizing its potential requires international support and significant investment in critical infrastructure.\n\nAs the world enters an era shaped by artificial intelligence, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expected to capture just 10% of the economic growth generated by AI technologies. But by forming strategic partnerships and making large-scale infrastructure investments, LMICs can harness these technologies to foster inclusive, sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRapidly evolving AI systems have immense potential to revolutionize public-service delivery and alleviate poverty, unlocking economic opportunities for developing economies like Togo. But fully realizing the promise of these new tools requires adequate infrastructure, such as a reliable electricity supply and broadband connectivity. Without these foundations, the world\u2019s most advanced technologies will remain out of reach for communities that could benefit from them the most.\n\nOn November 13-15, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation organized an international AI conference in Lom\u00e9, bringing together government officials, researchers, civil-society leaders, international experts, and students to discuss the potential of emerging technologies to improve public services in the developing world. Togo is a prime example.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched Novissi, one of the world\u2019s first fully digital cash-transfer programs. Initially designed to support low-income urban residents, Novissi rapidly expanded to cover rural areas in Togo\u2019s 200 poorest cantons, enabling more than 920,000 informal-sector workers \u2013 roughly 25% of the country\u2019s adult population \u2013 to enroll.\n\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form\n\nBy combining machine learning with mobile-phone metadata, satellite imagery, and phone surveys, the Novissi program ultimately identified and supported more than 150,000 households, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can help governments deliver essential services quickly and equitably.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. In recent years, we have leveraged data science and digital technologies to improve our emergency response capabilities and make government services more efficient, cost-effective, and responsive to citizens\u2019 needs.\n\nConsider the agriculture sector, which employs two-thirds of Togo\u2019s population and accounts for 40% of its GDP. Using satellite imagery and machine-learning tools like Mosaiks, Togolese policymakers can forecast crop yields, anticipate poor harvests, and craft targeted agricultural policies. But the real strength of these technologies is their versatility: a single investment enables policymakers to make evidence-based decisions on a wide range of issues, from electrification to deforestation.\n\nBy bolstering local ownership, African governments can drive inclusive growth. In Togo, we are working to build a sustainable ecosystem of local expertise through initiatives like the newly launched Togo Data Lab, a collaboration between the Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation and the Center for Effective Global Action at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe project joins other prominent African institutions working to position Africa at the forefront of digital development, such as the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. In Togo, the Lab will assist the Togolese government in building sustainable data-science capabilities, thereby enabling us to use AI tools like large language models (LLMs) to accelerate progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Togolese data scientists trained at the Lab will then collaborate with international experts, thereby ensuring that solutions are driven by local talent.\n\nIn its first year, the Togo Data Lab will focus on agriculture, training staff to use Mosaiks to measure crop yields more precisely. But we have much higher ambitions. We see the Lab as a scalable platform capable of addressing major challenges in health, education, and climate policy.\n\nWe imagine a health-care system transformed by data science, with AI tools improving disease surveillance and enabling policymakers to predict outbreaks of preventable illnesses, and classrooms where LLM-assisted tutors handle administrative tasks, freeing teachers to do what they do best: teaching and connecting with students. We have made remarkable progress, but there is much more to be done.\n\nFor too long, African countries have been sidelined from the digital revolution due to limited technical capacity and inadequate infrastructure. That must change, and now is the time to change it. I urge the international community to join this vital effort. By engaging the private sector and making targeted investments, Africa could become a leader in the global digital economy, not just a participant.\n\nInvesting in local capacity not only empowers policymakers in developing countries like Togo to make smarter, data-driven decisions. It also lays the groundwork for a vast global network of problem solvers, ready to harness cutting-edge technologies to tackle the world\u2019s biggest challenges."
