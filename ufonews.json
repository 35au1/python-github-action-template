While it\u2019s certainly not the first time someone reported seeing strange flying objects in the sky over San Antonio, it\u2019s an unusually clear video of what folks believe to be a UFO.\n\nA TikTok user shared a video of a mysterious rotating object hovering in the sky off North Alamo Street in Downtown San Antonio. While it appeared metallic or white in the video, the TikTok poster, Justin Delgado, says it nearly blended in with the darkest part of the sky.\n\nWhen the video was shared on Reddit, several commenters noted they\u2019ve been seeing mysterious objects in the sky more frequently as of late. Some said reports or quickly cropping up in New Mexico, Arizona and across the globe while other say they\u2019ve seen suspicious activity in Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI seen it all the way from Lacoste,\u201d Reddit user Historical_Wish_7627 commented. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing lots of weird stuff in the sky lately.\u201d\n\nAnother Reddit poster who lives in a rural area outside San Antonio reported seeing what looked like a satellite moving across the sky one night that faded into the night sky. The same poster says they saw a pair of mysterious lights, which they say wasn\u2019t a helicopter or airplane, hovering over the Alamo City.\n\nOthers were quick to quips on the speculation of aliens visiting San Antonio. In reference to a recent video of a mattress flying down a highway in the city, having dislodged off the back of a fast-moving pickup truck, Reddit users joked the mattress had made it into airspace.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe highway mattress has breached containment,\u201d Reddit user audientix posted, with many responding with their own jokes about the mattress being the sources of the conspiracy. There were plenty of other jokes to be made on the thread without reference to a mattress, though.\n\n\u201cThat was abuela\u2019s chancla after whooping you so hard it was sent into orbit,\u201d Reddit user Chiken_97 wrote."

While many users appreciate the feature\u2019s convenience, many others prefer to turn off AI overviews because AI results need to be double-checked for accuracy, often defeating the purpose of a Google Search. Google understands the need to make it easier to cross-check and verify AI overview results, and it could soon make it easier to do so by listing all the sources and related content that make up the AI overview summary in Gemini results.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhen you search using Gemini in the Google app and receive an AI Overview response, you can check the AI result for its sources. However, doing so involves using the Google \u201cG\u201d icon at the bottom of every answer, which then uses Google Search to find similar content. This is what this process looks like at the moment:\n\nThe latest Google app v15.47.28 beta appears to be testing the addition of links to relevant web pages directly within the text result of AI Overviews in Gemini results. Google had mentioned this change for AI Overviews in August but did not mention it for the Google app. We managed to activate the feature in the Google app, and here\u2019s how it would appear.\n\nThe expand icon at the bottom right (next to the Source and Related Content section) shows a list of all the sources and related content from different websites, as seen in the third screenshot above.\n\nThis is similar in approach to how Google\u2019s AI overviews on the web appear on your mobile device, which is shown below for reference:\n\nAamir Siddiqui / Android Authority\n\nThis UI for additional sourcing is not currently live within the Google app for Android. We don\u2019t know if and when Google will go ahead with the change. However, given how the approach aligns with the mobile-web version of AI overviews, we hope to see it go live on Android very soon.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

In the last few years, the startup launched Arc on Mac and Windows and Arc Search on iOS and Android, but the company is beginning work on a new product with a broader appeal.\n\nThe browser is set to launch in early 2025. The startup has launched a new website that shows a video about the browser and lists different open roles in the company.\n\n\u201cAI won\u2019t exist as an app. Or a button. We believe it\u2019ll be an entirely new environment \u2014 built on top of a web browser,\u201d the browser\u2019s site reads.\n\nIn the video, the Browser Company CEO, Josh Miller, showed some early prototypes of some of its features. One demo showed a tool that works at the insertion cursor, which will help you write the next sentence or fetch facts from the internet when writing about a known subject, such as the original iPhone\u2019s launch and specs. The tool also seems to understand your browser window and can fetch Amazon links that you have opened to insert them in an email with a basic description.\n\nThe second demo shows that users can type in commands in the address bar to perform various actions, like fetch a document based on the description, email it to someone based on your preferred email client that you use in the browser, and schedule a calendar meeting through a natural language prompt.\n\nSome of these features sound like what any browser-based writing tools or calendar tools might already do, and we won\u2019t know their usefulness or uniqueness until we actually get to use Dia.\n\nThe third demo is more ambitious: It shows the browser doing actions on your behalf, like adding items from promotional emails to your Amazon cart. Dia does it by browsing Amazon on its own, finding these items, and adding them to your cart. In the demo, the list has \u201can all-purpose hammer,\u201d and the auto-browsing function adds an Amazon listing with two hammers with a grip. I have no idea if that is the right choice, but it\u2019s likely that it isn\u2019t going to make the perfect decision every time right out of the gate \u2014 we have already seen that with the Rabbit R1.\n\nAnother example shows the browser looking at a Notion table filled with details of members for a video shoot. Dia can email each participant separately.\n\nThe Browser Company is not unique in thinking about building an AI assistant that will understand the interface and do tasks for you. Multiple startups have demos, concepts, and visions of AI models and tools that can control your screen.\n\nIn a video last month, Miller hinted about building new products for the masses, while assuring current users that it is not planning to meddle a lot with Arc\u2019s design and workings. Miller admitted that while Arc has a passionate and growing user base, its complexity might not appeal to all users. The challenge for the company would be to produce a browser that has AI features that work seamlessly and that could possibly create revenue sources for the company."

            "article_content": "Have you ever wanted to be a paranormal detective? Not like those History Channel ghost hunters, but an actual supernatural sleuth? Your wish has come true with Enigma of Fear, a charming and mystery-packed pixel art and 3D indie game that\u2019s soaring on Steam following a great debut.\n\nJust days after its release, Enigma of Fear is in the runnings to be one of the best puzzle games of the year and certainly one of the best detective games \u2013 an unfortunately small genre.\n\nYou play as Mia, a young paranormal detective on the trail of her missing father. This inevitably drags her into the Perimeter, an unnatural realm between realms. What makes Enigma of Fear really shine is that you have to investigate clues as a detective would. That means deduction and inspection are your best friends. It sounds simple enough but it\u2019s rare to have puzzles that truly encourage you to think like a detective. You\u2019ll be sifting through documents and taking accounts from other characters to piece together the narrative in Mia\u2019s mental map. Note that the Perimeter is an open-world, non-linear location, so you\u2019ll use your deductions to decide your next steps.\n\nBetween solving the mysteries surrounding the Perimeter and recent disappearances, you\u2019ll be facing off against horrifying creatures and bosses. It\u2019s not a horror game, so to speak, but \u2013 drenched in atmosphere and oozing creative creatures \u2013 it\u2019s a haunting and engrossing location to search and slice your way through.\n\nIt\u2019s also impossible to ignore Enigma of Fear\u2019s beautiful art design, seamlessly blending pixel art sprites with old-school-style 3D environments. These visuals go a long way in making the Perimeter and the mystery at its heart that much more engrossing.\n\nEnigma of Fear is currently available at a 10% discount, costing just $22.49 / \u00a318.89 on Steam until Thursday, December 5. Currently sitting at 93% \u2018very positive\u2019 reviews, Enigma of Fear is well on its way to reaching the prestigious \u2018overwhelmingly positive\u2019 tag, too.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking to pick up one of the best indie games this year, then you\u2019d be remiss not to grab Enigma of Fear during this introductory offer. Alongside this sale, tons of the best PC games are currently on sale as part of the Steam Autumn Sale, so there\u2019s no better time to bulk up your library.\n\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains."

            "article_content": "It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nVan Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.\n\nNone has ever been seen alive at sea.\n\nThe list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.\n\nResearchers studying the 16-foot-long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin are hoping to find that out this week.\n\n\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d\n\nOnly six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.\n\nNew Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.\n\nGet a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news. Sign up for NBC Bay Area\u2019s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.\n\nDNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.\n\nOn Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.\n\nThe dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.\n\nMembers of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.\n\n\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d\n\nThe iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.\n\n\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nIt\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.\n\nThe assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.\n\n\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

Scientists say only subconscious breathing mechanisms in the brainstem have been thoroughly understood so far.\n\nNeurons in mouse brain behind breathing regulation ( Salk Institute )\n\nIn the new study, researchers set out to find conscious top-down mechanisms connecting emotional regulation and breathing.\n\nThey first assessed a brain connectivity database to probe connections between different brain areas. The analysis revealed a potential breathing circuit connecting a frontal region, called the anterior cingulate cortex, to an intermediate brainstem area, which then connected to the medulla just below.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the medulla, when active, initiates breathing but signals coming down from a brainstem region are known to inhibit this activity and slow down breathing.\n\nResearchers hypothesised that certain emotions or behaviours could lead to the activation of the brainstem region, which in turn could lower activity in the medulla and slower breath.\n\nHow Breathing Exercises Can Reduce Anxiety\n\nTo test the theory, they recorded brain activity in mice when their breathing was altered during activities like sniffing, swimming, and drinking as well as during conditions inducing fear and anxiety.\n\nResearchers found that when the connection between the cortex and the brainstem region was activated, mice were calmer and breathed more slowly.\n\nThis communication decreased when they were in anxiety-inducing situations, and breathing rates went up.\n\nBy following this pathway, researchers discovered a group of neurons in the frontal cortex of the mice brain that connects to the brainstem and governs essential functions like breathing.\n\n8 Foods That Help With Anxiety According To Experts\n\nThis connection, researchers say, enables mice to coordinate their breathing with their current behaviour and emotional state.\n\nFurther analysis of the connection revealed a new set of brain cells and molecules which scientists believe can be targeted with drugs.\n\nResearchers say the findings may lead to long-term solutions for people with anxiety, stress, and panic disorders.\n\n\u201cOur findings got me thinking: could we develop drugs to activate these neurons and manually slow our breathing or prevent hyperventilation in panic disorder?\u201d study co-author Jinho Jhang said.\n\n\u201cI want to use these findings to design a yoga pill. It may sound silly, and the translation of our work into a marketable drug will take years, but we now have a potentially targetable brain circuit for creating therapeutics that could instantly slow breathing and initiate a peaceful, meditative state,\u201d Sung Han, another author of the study, said."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Mac security provider Moonlock, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u2019\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

Once you\u2019ve committed to that, it\u2019s important to figure out if you want to purchase a lifetime/one time only deal or if you\u2019re fine paying each year. There are pros and cons here as the yearly subscriptions tend to give you more updates and new features, but you\u2019ll be paying for it.\n\nAlongside that, you need to think about how many people you need a license for. Are you just buying for yourself or do you need to support the whole family? You need a license for each person using Microsoft Office at any one time, so make sure you buy something that works for everyone. Also, think about extras like how much cloud storage is bundled in.
