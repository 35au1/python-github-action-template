            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

            "article_content": "If you\u2019re seeing and hearing drones or other such flying things flashing in the sky, it\u2019s absolutely certain that you are not imagining it and you are not alone. However, what remains troublingly uncertain is what is actually going on and it\u2019s a question that government has done a lousy job answering.\n\nThe future head of that government, Donald Trump, said yesterday: \u201cThe government knows what is happening. For some reason, they don\u2019t want to comment. And I think they\u2019d be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows.\u201d\n\nWe often disagree with Trump, but his call for transparency is sound.\n\nWhat do the sightings mean? Hopefully not a real life \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d invasion copying Orson Welles\u2019 1938 fictional radio show Martian attack, also in New Jersey. The unsatisfying answer is we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll venture that it\u2019s unlikely that this is some sort of sophisticated foreign intelligence operation that federal officials are somehow unaware of.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s some kind of undisclosed military program that Trump mentioned, or coordinated pranks or, as is may be the case with these things, a phenomenon that\u2019s taken a life of its own when there\u2019s no there there.\n\nA few experts and officials have already pointed out that at least some of the sightings seem to be commercial planes. One Jersey resident claimed to have shined a laser pointer at a \u201cdrone\u201d that seems to have really been a FedEx plane. Needless to say, do not do this; risking plane crashes is the opposite of helpful as we try to figure out what\u2019s going on.\n\nThis is all representative of a broader and more acute reality than whatever is going on with these particular sightings: we have more or less lost the ability to contend with and clarify things like this as a society. Conspiracy theories are nothing new, and neither is distrusting official sources of information. Some of our greatest advances as a society and moments of public accountability and reform have come from people going against and questioning narratives.\n\nInstead, we\u2019re faced with something like a choose-your-own-adventure for reality, where every amateur sleuth and social media voice gets a chance to run wild and potentially cause significant damage with their laser pointer exploits.\n\nThe culture of secrecy at the nation\u2019s law enforcement and military entities has left them tight-lipped in a way that the public just takes as confirmation that there\u2019s something nefarious going on, as Trump suggests, and the news media\u2019s cautious reporting, responsive to what we know to be true, is seen as evasive and dismissive.\n\nPeople want there to be clear-cut answers, now. The idea that this could be a series of misidentifications of commercial planes, faraway planets and hobbyists drones (or probably all of the above) even if that turns out to be the correct answer, may not be welcomed by a public that seems hungry for something else.\n\nSo, let\u2019s just go through each sighting, one by one, and determine its cause. The Martians patiently planned their attack in \u201cThe War of the Worlds;\u201d will Americans have the same level of patience?"

Photo: RTHK\n\nThe University of Hong Kong has developed a new AI-powered mobile app that it says can reliably assess the oral health of patients in seconds.\n\n\n\nOver the next three months, volunteers are hoping to use the app to help hundreds of elderly patients who have difficulty visiting a dentist \u2013 by making home visits or at three service locations in Lam Tin and Kwun Tong.\n\n\n\nStudents from HKU\u2019s dentistry faculty are partnering up with legislators and district councillors to identify elderly people in need of help.\n\n\n\nThe volunteers would then do a quick test simply by taking photos of the patients\u2019 mouths and running it through the app \u2013 called GUM AI \u2013 which would then make an accurate assessment of the state of their teeth and gums.\n\n\n\nNo professional training is needed \u2013 the app simply displays red for poor oral health, yellow when caution is required, and green means everything looks fine.\n\n\n\nThe service teams would then give advice to the patients, or refer them to a dentist if needed.\n\n\n\nHKU researcher Walter Lam says the technology could make a real difference.\n\n\n\n\"We hope the GUM AI can raise health awareness among those elderly, so that they can have a regular dental visit, and they can self-care their hygiene, which is quite important to prevent any oral diseases,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDevelopers of the app say it has proven to be highly reliable, with a 90-percent accuracy rate.\n\n\n\n\"The accuracy of our AI system is comparable to experienced dentists,\" Lam said.\n\n\n\nThe team is aiming to expand the use of the app to other age groups after the end of the three-month pilot project. They say the technology promises to reduce waiting times for oral check-ups, and can help people better monitor their oral health and get treatment early."

He said he was trying to track a mystery drone but his drone was shut down while the mystery thing remained airborne.\"There was a drone just hanging out,\" he told FOX 5 New York. \"I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.\"He said he saw a warning flash across the screen of his controller and the battery died with the drone coming down. He understood that his drone was probably shot down because it was a restricted flight area but the thing that he was trying to approach continued to fly. The paranormal investigator lives near the Picatinny Arsenal, an Army facility near where dozens of sightings have been reported in recent weeks. Since it was an Army area, it was possible that his drone was shut down but the other one continuing to fly seems to establish speculation theories that these mystery drones are probably sanctioned by the government and the Feds are well aware of them.As Michael B shared his horrifying experience with MSNBC, he said the issue, to him, seems more serious than just misidentified aircraft. \"At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,\" he said adding that he could not figure out what it was.Michael B added that it's clear to him that these mystery drones are capable of flying in restricted zones. He said he can usually detect what other objects are on the sky by using his radar, none of these mystery things are on flight radar."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

'At one point, it even asked for my phone number and I said, 'Nah. I think we're good at this point.''\n\nWitt asked Michael B: 'What do you think that is? What do you think people are seeing in the sky? And why only at night?'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' Michael B responded.\n\nThe Terror Talk host also noted that he has technology to detect objects in the sky, 'none of these things that we go after are on flight radar.'\n\nTo demonstrate the government's drone deterrence capabilities, the pilot brought a DJI brand drone to a parking lot near Morristown Airport, a local flight corridor that's achieved national prominence due to Trump's use.

The mystery drone was 'unaffected'\n\nMichael B told MSNBC that he believes the government is keeping the truth about New Jersey's unidentified drones a mystery on purpose.\n\nThe real answers, he said, are likely to be 'secrets that the government don't want us to know [...] either that or aliens.'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' he told the station.\n\n'What they could be \u2014 I have no idea,' the paranormal investigator admitted, although he emphasized that he was taking it as a personal mission to keep monitoring the state's mystery drones to get answers.\n\nThe FBI has fielded over 5,000 complaints in the course of this drone UFO wave, in progress, but noted that only 100 of these cases now warrant further investigation.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security official has also noted that sightings due to mass concern over the drones has led to many false positives.\n\n'We're confident that many of the reported drone sightings are, in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones,' DHS officials said.\n\nBut the cases above sensitive military bases and US Coast Guard ships off the Jersey shore continue to worry state officials, federal investigators and the US military.\n\nThe FBI and other agencies are investigating the strange activity, but a representative from the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday, Dec. 11: 'We have no more information as to where these drones are coming from, where they're launching from, where they're landing'\n\nOfficials and residents have also seen truly odd, well-lit drones that do not resemble fixed-wing aircraft (example above) deepening the mystery of the craft's origins and intent\n\nPicatinny Arsenal told press that sightings of the unidentified drones, capable of beating their counter-drone defenses, has now climbed to 11 confirmed cases.\n\n'While the source and cause of these aircraft operating in our area remain unknown,' Picatinny's garrison commander, Lt Col Craig A. Bonham II, said, 'we can confirm that they are not the result of any Picatinny Arsenal-related activities.'\n\nAmid the uncertainty, the president-elect called for answers from the US Government as he slammed the Biden administration and urged them to shoot down the UFOs.\n\nBut this was rejected by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who said that the government does not have the authority to neutralize the drones."

The stellar pairing in question orbits the cosmic titan at the heart of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*.\n\nThe binary stars, designated D9, were found in data collected by the Very Large Telescope (VLT), located atop Cerro Paranal, an 8,645-foot-tall (2,635-meter) mountain in Chile's Atacama Desert. By measuring their velocity, the team behind the discovery was surprised to find they were two stars, not one.\n\n\n\nThe fact that these binary stars so near Sgr A* have survived the tremendous gravity of this black hole indicates that these environments may actually be stable enough to allow for the birth of planets, the scientists behind this discovery say. \"Black holes are not as destructive as we thought,\" research lead author and University of Cologne scientist Florian Pei\u00dfker said in a statement.\n\nThe team's findings were published on Tuesday (Dec. 17) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nLet's stick together...\n\nEven though this discovery shows there may be more stability around supermassive black holes than previously suspected, the turbulent environment around Sgr A* means that although binaries can exist, these partnerships are probably fleeting.\n\nThe stars of D9 are estimated to be just 2.7 million years old, and while that may seem like an intimidatingly long time, considering the sun is an estimated 4.6 billion years old, it's really just the blink of a cosmic eye.\n\nAstronomers probably caught these stars at an opportune time. Eventually, the stars of D9 will be forced together, triggering a stellar merger.\n\n\"This provides only a brief window on cosmic timescales to observe such a binary system \u2014 and we succeeded!\", team member and University of Cologne researcher Emma Bordier said.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Pei\u00dfker et al.)\n\nThe discovery of such young stars around Sgr A* has told scientists something else new about these turbulent black hole-dominated environments, too.\n\nNamely, the regions around supermassive black holes aren't so chaotic that stars cannot be birthed there, as scientists had previously believed.\n\n\"The D9 system shows clear signs of the presence of gas and dust around the stars, which suggests that it could be a very young stellar system that must have formed in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole,\" team member Michal Zaja\u010dek from Masaryk University and the University of Cologne said.\n\nThe first image of Sgr A* as seen by the Event Horizon Telescope, released in 2022. (Image credit: EHT Collaboration.)\n\nThe D9 binary system exists within a fascinating group of stellar bodies called the S-star cluster. These stars whip around at incredible speeds thanks to the immense gravity of Sgr A*, which has a mass equivalent to that of around 4.3 million suns.\n\nArguably, the most intriguing objects in the S-cluster are bodies that appear like clouds of gas and dust but behave like stars called the \"G objects.\"\n\nD9 was discovered as astronomers were attempting to discover what these the strange and \"puffy\" G objects actually are.\n\nOne current theory suggests that they may have once been binary stars like D9, which have been forced to merge, leaving a cloud of material surrounding other, as yet unmerged stars.\n\n\n\nAs such, the G objects may offer a glimpse of D9's future.\n\nThe nature of objects around Sgr A* remains a mystery, but astronomers are diligently uncovering new clues.\n\nThe GRAVITY + upgrade to the VLT and the forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) should make this picture even clearer in the future.\n\n\"Our discovery lets us speculate about the presence of planets since these are often formed around young stars,\" Pei\u00dfker concluded. \" It seems plausible that the detection of planets in the galactic center is just a matter of time.\""

The cross lines in the background were used to measure each movement exactly. The image is from plates copyrighted in 1887 by Eadweard Muybridge.\u201d\n\n1975\n\nThunder Crack or Thunder Rumble\n\n\u201cA lightning flash lasts only a few tenths of a second. Why does the resulting sound persist for half a minute or even longer? A typical lightning discharge consists of three strokes through a channel extending some 10 kilometers. The light from all parts of the channel reaches the observer almost instantaneously. The sound from the various parts, however, reaches the observer at different times. If the lightning channel is generally at right angles to the line of sight, the sound will reach the observer at almost the same time: an abrupt, loud crack. If the channel is generally parallel to the line of sight, the sound from the farthest part will reach the observer many seconds later than the sound from the nearest part: a long rumble.\u201d\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nJ Particle May Be Charmed Quark\n\n\u201cThe most puzzling aspect of the recent discovery of a new kind of subnuclear particle at two high-energy-\u00adphysics laboratories is the particle\u2019s extra\u00adordinarily long lifetime of 10\u201320 second. This unexpectedly \u2018slow\u2019 decay sets the comparatively massive new particle apart from hundreds of other unstable sub\u2013nuclear species that have been created with particle accelerators. Most of the latter particles have life\u00ad\u00adtimes on the order of 10\u201323 second. The new particle is called the J particle by one group of experimenters and the psi particle by the other. Another possibility being discussed is that the particle represents a \u2018bound state\u2019 consisting of a \u2018charmed\u2019 quark and its cor responding antiquark.\u201d\n\n1925\n\nDoes Lactic Acid Cause Muscle Fatigue?\n\n\u201cWhat happens when we get out of breath or become ex\u00ad\u00adhaust\u00ad\u00aded? Dr. A. V. Hill, professor of physiology at University College London, recently discovered that there was a very close relation between the fatigue caused by exercise and the production of a certain chemical called lactic acid in the muscles that are being used. Dr. Hill discovered that fatigue was accompanied by an increase in the amount of lactic acid in the muscles, whereas recovery from fatigue was always marked by a de\u00ad\u00adcrease in lactic acid.\u201d\n\nScientists discredited the lactic acid idea more than two decades ago, but it persists today. They suspect that inorganic phosphate contributes to skeletal muscle fatigue.\n\n1875\n\nChromosphere Cloaks the Sun\n\n\u201cThe edge of the sun\u2019s visible disk is surmounted to an elevation of between 8,000 and 10,000 miles by an envelope of rose-\u00adcolored gases, to which Mr. Norman Lockyer has given the name of chromosphere. The scarlet flame clothes the whole surface of the sun, and here and there rises in cloudlike forms that ascend to enormous heights. The spectroscope has shown that uprising jets are nothing but heated clouds of gas, largely hydrogen. Their spectrum exhibits conspicuously the bright lines of that element, yet another very prominent line as well. To this hypothetical element the name of helium has been assigned by Lockyer and Edward Frank\u00adland, though with rather doubtful propriety.\u201d\n\nWanted: A Nitroglycerin Engine\n\n\u201cM. Champion, a French chemist, states that the heat developed by a given quantity of nitroglycerin when exploded is capable of exerting, when converted into motion, a maxi\u00b7 mum energy five times that produced by the explosion of the same amount of gunpowder, and 3,000 times more than that of combustion of an equal quantity of coal. A quart of nitroglycerin, it is asserted, has the potential energy of 5,500 horsepower working during 10 hours. It remains to invent a machine in which the gigantic force can be harnessed and controlled.\u201d\n\nMonorail, with Leather Brakes\n\n\u201cThe Turkish government has recently commenced the construction of a railway, termed the Steam Caravan, between Alexandretta and Aleppo, Syria, a distance of 94.2 miles. A single rail is employed, raised on a wall 28 inches high and 17.5 inches broad. The vehicles straddle both rail and wall. The locomotives are provided with horizontal, leather-\u00adcovered wheels, which rest against the sides of the masonry and serve as brakes, and the last vehicle of each train has similar arrangements. Each side of each carriage contains two persons, and the complete train is calculated to accommodate 96.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Experts provide insight into the rise of FinOps, how APIs will force a rise in DevSecOps, and how low-code, no-code is here to stay.\n\nThe Rise of FinOps\n\nTzvika Zaiffer, Director, Solutions, Spot by NetApp:\n\nThe DevOps landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, particularly in response to the growing demands of enterprise AI initiatives and competitive market pressures. A key development has been the rise of FinOps\u2014the integration of financial accountability into DevOps practices. DevOps teams now regularly collaborate with finance experts, making decisions that balance technical requirements with cost considerations. This evolution reflects a broader shift toward cost-conscious infrastructure management. Organizations increasingly expect DevOps teams to implement sophisticated cost visibility tools, automated provisioning systems, and real-time monitoring capabilities. These practices help control expenses while maintaining the high-performance infrastructure needed for AI workloads and other complex applications.\n\nLooking ahead, this convergence of DevOps and financial stewardship will become even more critical. Successful DevOps strategies will need to demonstrate not just technical excellence, but also clear financial viability through mature cost controls and efficient resource utilization.\n\nAPI Boom Will Yield Transition to DevSecOps Teams\n\nMoshe Lipsker, VP of Global Product Development, Imperva, a Thales company:\n\nAs we head into 2025, we\u2019ll be four years into application programming interfaces (APIs) taking over the world. As it stands, the Economic Impact of API and Bot Attacks study from the Imperva Threat Research Team found that the average enterprise managed 613 API endpoints last year. APIs enable seamless integration and user experience but, consequently, attract hacker interest as these endpoints provide direct access to sensitive data. On average, API-related security issues cost organizations $25-87 billion annually. This massive loss begs the question: are IT security teams and DevOps teams ready to work together to balance the speed of business development with security?\n\nAs more organizations continue to adopt APIs in 2025, these increasing risks will force their hand in strengthening security posture at the point of development so that they can provide widespread protection of their software. Though it\u2019s not easy, we will continue to see the transition to DevSecOps teams to ensure that security is effectively built into product development from the start. With these transitions, organizations will adopt automated solutions such as runtime application self-protection to increase security without adding overhead to development processes.\n\nLow-code/no-code: Hype or Real Value?\n\nShomron Jacob, Head of Applied Machine Learning & Platform, Iterate.ai:\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen firsthand for years now, low-code strategies are very efficient and effective at bringing AI, the IoT, data connectivity and more into production applications\u2014and doing so without facing the exorbitant cost and technical hurdles of otherwise hardcoding (and exhaustively learning) those technologies. By distilling the complexity of those technologies into modules ready to be connected to build out complete applications, businesses are achieving innovative functionality and delivering breakthrough capabilities with less direct expertise, time, and expense. That simplicity also translates into speed, from initially testing applications, to iteratively optimizing and perfecting them (both capabilities and user experiences). Those advantages will continue to drive greater low-code adoption in the coming year as organizations seek to debut applications with competitive features at an even more accelerated pace."

            "article_content": "NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iStock, a leading e-commerce platform providing premium content to SMBs, SMEs, creatives, and students everywhere, has released its 2025 Marketing Trends Report, packed with practical strategies to help businesses thrive in today\u2019s trust-driven marketplace.\n\nThe report comes at a critical time when consumer trust in social media\u2014a key tool for small businesses\u2014is declining. According to iStock\u2019s VisualGPS research platform, 81% of consumers don\u2019t trust social media content, citing concerns over misinformation. However, trust in businesses remains high, with 64% of people favoring businesses over celebrities or influencers, or even politicians, and 58% preferring brands whose values align with their own. For small businesses, this is a powerful opportunity to leverage their local ties and authentic engagement to build stronger connections and outpace larger competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rebecca Swift, Senior Vice President of Creative for iStock, emphasizes the need for a bold shift: \u201cAs we enter 2025, trust will define success, and visual content will be a critical tool in forging genuine connections with audiences. For small businesses, the advantage lies not in chasing polished perfection but in creating visuals that feel human, honest, and deeply relevant. By telling real stories and reflecting diverse experiences, small businesses can establish deep, lasting trust with their audiences\u2013proving that it\u2019s not about looking perfect but about feeling real and relatable.\u201d\n\nHere are iStock\u2019s key marketing trends to help SMBs build trust in 2025:\n\nReal Talk: Less Influencer, More Real-User Content\n\nThe genuine feel that made influencer content connect with people is disappearing. VisualGPS revealed, 67% of people believe traditional ads are more authentic than sponsored influencer posts. Even if you don\u2019t use influencers, this shift matters. People are tired of content that looks too perfect and want visuals that feel genuine and honest. A few years ago, User-Generated Content (UGC), like selfies and vertical videos, was seen as the most real and authentic. But in 2025, people expect more. This is where Real-User Content (RUC) comes in, a new concept from iStock experts which encourages businesses to move from \"generated\" content to images and videos that show \u201creal.\u201d\n\nThis change is affecting how people interact with visual content, especially on social media. Despite people\u2019s lack of trust, they still find these platforms valuable, 82% of users still go to places like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts for video content to learn something new or get inspiration. In other words, people want the benefits of social media, without the negative effects. This shift has also made video-driven social search more popular, where platforms focused on video are no longer just for scrolling \u2014they\u2019ve become places to search and discover. In 2025, to succeed, you need to speak directly to your audience, this approach will always be more effective than a flood of generic posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonesty: The New Face of Authenticity\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to marketing trends, you\u2019ve probably seen the word \u201cauthenticity\u201d everywhere. But what does it truly mean? For consumers, it means being real, truthful, and original, according to VisualGPS research. And in 2025, it will still be key to building trust\u201498% of people say authentic images and videos are important for earning trust. However, authenticity is changing. In 2025, it\u2019s will be about radical honesty. People don\u2019t want perfect images\u2014they want to see what makes your business human, imperfections and all.\n\nSharing raw moments, real customer stories, and the messy, behind-the-scenes parts of running a business can create strong emotional connections. Being honest is important\u2014whether it's showing how your processes work to teach your audience or admitting when things don\u2019t go as planned. Even humor, when used carefully, can turn simple interactions into memorable moments. In a world full of overly polished content, honesty will help your brand stand out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Frontier: Trust-Centric AI for Forward-Thinking Businesses\n\nText-to-image Generative AI is a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. However, in 2025, its successful use will depend on being transparent. While consumers are open to AI-generated ads, 86% believe it should be clearly labeled, and 74% are okay with AI-generated content IF used ethically. This means using AI to empower, not to mislead. Also, as ethical AI becomes the standard, using tools that offer commercially safe AI images with legal protection\u2014just like any other royalty-free image\u2014not only gives you peace of mind but also positions your business as a leader in responsible AI use, aligning with the values your audience expect.\n\nOn top of that, beyond creating images from scratch think of AI as a virtual studio that helps your team create flexible, cost-effective content. AI tools like iStock\u2019s AI generator, allow businesses to not only generate custom images from creative prompts but also modify visuals, remove or change elements, and expand canvases to fit specific formats\u2014all without needing expensive software or design skills. This tool even lets businesses upload reference images and product photos to build a personalized library of assets, making it quicker and easier to align visuals with your business needs, pace, and budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs 2025 approaches, the key to success for SMBs is embracing trust-first strategies. By focusing on Real-User Content, being radically honest, and using AI transparently, small businesses can not only stay ahead of the curve but also lead the way in making trust the foundation of modern marketing.\n\nTo inspire and elevate your visual marketing strategy ahead of 2025 with related imagery and videos, visit https://www.istockphoto.com/.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nIlse Noguez\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement are available at:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9508cf80-f5a7-403f-819b-68c62617e25c\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f9cc203d-5c67-45a0-8e84-a6e001ad7acb\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/80078fc0-f37b-4b57-b58b-55c54c396f5a\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ef7c3bb1-ca44-4d03-83f5-0d5f80c8af52\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f860a42a-50ab-413a-b17e-75d09e83934c"

            "article_content": "Is AI going to steal your job \u2013 or will you be able to use it to your advantage? And is the recent decrease in job listings a good or a bad thing for freelancers? It\u2019s an interesting time for freelancers and contractors and that\u2019s set to continue into 2025.\n\nWondering what could be coming up for your business next year? Keep reading to see six predictions about the state of freelance work.\n\n1. An urgent need to embrace AI?\n\nAI has been a hot topic for several years now, but recent developments suggest that 2025 is a year for change. AI has come a long way \u2013 and with easy access to tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, as well as Apple\u2019s new inbuilt Apple Intelligence, there are less barriers to introducing it into your professional life too.\n\nAs a busy freelancer, you can use generative AI to lighten your workload for things like drafting proposals, transcribing notes, and summarising emails. You can also use it to help with areas outside of your expertise, such as marketing or copywriting.\n\nA recent study from Fiverr also found that AI was the top missing skill in UK businesses \u2013 with 18 per cent of business leaders surveyed saying they hire freelancers who have AI skills full time employees don\u2019t.\n\nLooking to upskill in this area? Read our guide to AI for small businesses for some ideas.\n\n2. An end to late payments?\n\nThe new Labour government\u2019s Fair Payment Code launched in December 2024, so will start affecting the self-employed in 2025. This voluntary code of practice gives larger businesses who work with freelancers and contractors an award based on their payment record.\n\nBusinesses can be categorised one of three ways: Gold \u2013 for businesses that pay 95 per cent of their suppliers within 30 days\n\n\u2013 for businesses that pay 95 per cent of their suppliers within 30 days Silver \u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of their small business suppliers within 30 days and all other suppliers within 60 days\n\n\u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of their small business suppliers within 30 days and all other suppliers within 60 days Bronze \u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of suppliers within 60 days\n\nAdditionally, the Small Business Commissioner will be given greater enforcement powers to ensure small businesses and freelancers are getting paid on time. And with our own research showing that small businesses were owed an estimated \u00a332 billion in late payments in 2023, this is sure to be a positive change in the freelance world.\n\n3. More clarity for contractors under umbrella companies?\n\nThe 2024 Autumn Budget revealed plans to crack down on exploitative umbrella companies who fail to comply with IR35 regulations. This means that the responsibility for paying the correct income tax and National Insurance contributions will fall on the employer and not the contractor.\n\nWhile this new legislation won\u2019t come into effect until April 2026, HMRC recently published an online tool designed to help contractors better understand payment from umbrella companies. This new tool was published in December 2024, meaning freelancers will be able to use it for their 2025 contracts.\n\n4. Higher day rates for freelancers?\n\nThe new year could be the time to increase your day rate, according to a recent study from the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed. The study revealed that the average day rate of UK freelancers increased from Q2 to Q3 2024, from \u00a3457 to \u00a3576.\n\nThe same study revealed that the freelancers surveyed expected their day rates to further increase 12.2 per cent in the next year.\n\nIf you think it\u2019s time to increase your earnings, our guide to setting a freelance rate can help.\n\n5. Increased costs for freelancers outside IR35?\n\nFiverr\u2019s recent data also reveals that 83 per cent of businesses believe Labour\u2019s Budget will impact their business. This is largely in part to the increase of Employer National Insurance contributions \u2013 which are set to rise to 15 per cent from April 2025.\n\nThis increase, combined with a lower earnings threshold and an increase in corporation tax, could affect both umbrella contractors and limited company contractors. Umbrella contractors could see a reduction in their take home pay, while limited company contractors may find it harder to negotiate contracts.\n\n6. Less job vacancies?\n\nJob vacancy website Reed recently reported the number of job vacancies posted on its website had fallen 13 per cent between October and November \u2013 and is now 26 per cent lower than a year ago.\n\nThis is supported by recent data from the Office of National Statistics, which also revealed that the number of job vacancies fell by 31,000 between September and November.\n\nWhile this accounts for the job market as a whole and isn\u2019t limited to just freelance and contract work, it suggests changes for the self-employed.\n\nEither businesses will be unable to hire full time staff and will instead look to contractors, meaning more employment opportunities, or the decrease in overall opportunities will include freelancers too.\n\nDo you have any other predictions that may affect freelancers and contractors in 2025? Let us know what you\u2019ve heard in the comments below.\n\nHelpful guides for freelancers"

            "article_content": "For the past nine months, Inbal Shani has been the Chief Product Officer and Head of R&D at Twilio, a customer engagement platform (CEP). She's already working hard to build a trusted platform that leverages AI to support a constantly shifting customer engagement market.\n\nShani previously worked at Github, where she was responsible for what is now called Copilot (along with other platform elements). She has over twenty years of experience in AI/ML and has been through every phase of AI growth, from neural networks to deep learning, predictive, and now generative AI. Shani's experience spans industries including aerospace, automotive, robotics, retail, cloud developer tools, and now communications and data. In all her work, she has looked at how AI can improve the business.\n\nTwilio has created trends and followed trends. But as it looks to the future, it's all about building \"one platform that is trusted, simple, and smart.' Shani argue that every company has to leverage AI, but many are taking the wrong approach.\n\nThe questions companies do ask focus more on AI and how to monetize it. The questions they should be asking are: what is the value-add that automation or having a conversational agent brings to the customer experience, and how are you using AI as a tool? How will AI make you more productive, remove friction, or provide a better customer experience?\n\nIt\u2019s the difference, she says, between successful and less successful companies. If you are grounded by the customer problem you're trying to solve and figuring out how AI can help solve that problem, you will realize ROI and see successful adoption. Companies that sprinkle a little generative AI on something that doesn't materialize into a product or feature that customers want to adopt and buy will struggle.\n\nThe other challenge she sees is that the AI strategy doesn't necessarily align with the company strategy.\n\nI think that's the biggest kind of difference in terms of perspective on AI; AI is a very useful tool. It's a very powerful tool. And you need to know how to use these tools to solve problems. But it's not a magic solution for everything, and it's not a magical solution that is going to solve everything. So, knowing how to use it in a smart way to really focus on the customer. If it's better user experience, if it's better productivity, if it's creating shorter time to value because of automation, then you have a successful AI strategy.\n\nShani says Twilio is successful because it uses AI as a tool to improve customer engagement, security, and customer satisfaction.\n\nHow Twilio CEP uses AI\n\nTwilio is not for one department. It provides the tools to support the customer end-to-end. The CDP (customer data platform) gives them customer data, and the CPaaS (communications platform as a service) provides the \"last mile connection\" - email, SMS, and voice interactions. Bringing them together creates customer engagement across the entire customer lifecycle. AI is used throughout the CEP. Shani cites the example of Fraud Guard, Twilio\u2019s first product to market, which provides SMS protection. They developed predictive AI models for this product, which they continually tune:\n\nIn Twilio, for example, in our Fraud Guard product that I mentioned before. It was never about, okay, how do we monetize predictive AI? We were grounded in solving a problem that was real and increasing, especially now in the age of AI, of spam, and impersonation. So when we built Fraud Guard, it was always the intention: how do we protect our customers, how do we create these secure communications, and we see real value? We see real savings for our customers who are using the product. And they never once asked us, are you using LLMs? Are you using predictive AI? It was not even a question. So, it was not about how you're monetizing it. But it's more in terms of what is the value that I'm getting?\n\nBut Shani is also looking into leveraging AI in the Segment business, focusing on customer data and engagement. Here, predictive audiences help companies understand what their customers are trying to do, how they will behave, and what the next best action for them is.\n\nIn addition, Twilio has launched generative AI products across communications, including their personalized IVR and Flex contact center product with a copilot agent. In this product, an AI assistant helps agents be more helpful to customers by providing advice and recommendations, sentiment analysis, and summarizing conversations.\n\nWhat\u2019s changing for developers\n\nWith a ten-million-strong developer community, it makes sense that Shani would have a strong view of how AI is affecting developers.\n\nWe are hearing more and more that in the next five years, everyone will be a developer. Shani doesn\u2019t agree. She reckons there is a big difference between a developer and a builder. Yes, everyone can use an AI tool and build something, she said. You can write better content and better code, but that doesn\u2019t make you a software developer:\n\nIt's kind of a new language that developers need to learn how to use and how to use it well.\n\nShani pitches that AI is a productivity and assistant tool, with rhe caveat that you need to know what questions to ask to get the right answer.\n\nYou see the evolution of software development languages all the time. And I think when I'm looking from a software developer perspective, what we see right now, with all these copilot assistants to write code, is really about making a developer much more productive so they can focus on getting the full value out of their time writing code which is something that they didn't have before.\n\nShani sees three themes in how AI is impacting software development. First, developers need enough software skills to validate that the AI-generated code is good and does what they want it to.\n\nSecond, AI uses data to create code, but there\u2019s a creative aspect to people that Shani doesn\u2019t see AI replacing in the near future.\n\nFinally, Shani believes there will be a shift in how developers think about code. Before, it was all about generating code to solve a problem. Now, it\u2019s thinking about systems design and overall architecture from the start. And it\u2019s about user experience, something that is becoming very critical in the world of AI, she said.\n\nWhat does this mean for developers exactly?\n\nShe explains:\n\nIf we're using an AI tool to write a document, we don't just copy, paste, and call it done. The same needs to be done in code. You have to validate whatever the AI assistant has been generating. I think that's one element. And the second thing that I advise computer science students asking me similar questions is you need to learn the basics without AI. You need to learn how to be a software developer before you earn the right to use an AI tool because you need to be able to look into the code. You need to be able to look into the product that you have generated and know if it's good or not. Because, if not, and that goes back to then, we don't really need you because that's the validation that is missing if you delegate the entire creation of a code to an AI assistant.\n\nThe key to consider here is how students are taught computer science today. Not all universities have embraced AI trends\u2014not for developers, marketers, or writers. Shani said she is seeing some effort to figure it out. But there is a balance to find. You want students to learn to code without AI first, but you also want them to learn to leverage AI tools to help them be more productive and efficient.\n\nAt the same time, these schools also need to devote more teaching time to the thinking and designing aspects of systems development. There aren't likely many schools teaching user experience in computer science courses\u2014at least not as a core subject.\n\nMy take\n\nI appreciated Shani's perspective on how organizations should think about AI. By focusing on the customer and creating better experiences, it's easy to find ways to leverage AI. Incorporating AI into a product without thinking about what benefits it truly brings may have been okay at first, but it isn't the right approach today.\n\nI also liked how she talked about developers' use of AI. This is very similar to how content marketers and writers can use AI\u2014as an assistant, as another tool. It doesn't replace the need to understand the work; it's simply a way to take more of the basic operations out of the hands of developers so they can spend more time designing products and experiences that customers will love.\n\nDoes this mean companies won't replace developers? Not necessarily. As I have said before, with AI and writers, some will get replaced. It's just the way things go. What developers want to do is find the companies that understand the true value of AI in the toolkit. And it sounds like Twilio is one of those companies."

The stellar pairing in question orbits the cosmic titan at the heart of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*.\n\nThe binary stars, designated D9, were found in data collected by the Very Large Telescope (VLT), located atop Cerro Paranal, an 8,645-foot-tall (2,635-meter) mountain in Chile's Atacama Desert. By measuring their velocity, the team behind the discovery was surprised to find they were two stars, not one.\n\n\n\nThe fact that these binary stars so near Sgr A* have survived the tremendous gravity of this black hole indicates that these environments may actually be stable enough to allow for the birth of planets, the scientists behind this discovery say. \"Black holes are not as destructive as we thought,\" research lead author and University of Cologne scientist Florian Pei\u00dfker said in a statement.\n\nThe team's findings were published on Tuesday (Dec. 17) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nLet's stick together...\n\nEven though this discovery shows there may be more stability around supermassive black holes than previously suspected, the turbulent environment around Sgr A* means that although binaries can exist, these partnerships are probably fleeting.\n\nThe stars of D9 are estimated to be just 2.7 million years old, and while that may seem like an intimidatingly long time, considering the sun is an estimated 4.6 billion years old, it's really just the blink of a cosmic eye.\n\nAstronomers probably caught these stars at an opportune time. Eventually, the stars of D9 will be forced together, triggering a stellar merger.\n\n\"This provides only a brief window on cosmic timescales to observe such a binary system \u2014 and we succeeded!\", team member and University of Cologne researcher Emma Bordier said.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Pei\u00dfker et al.)\n\nThe discovery of such young stars around Sgr A* has told scientists something else new about these turbulent black hole-dominated environments, too.\n\nNamely, the regions around supermassive black holes aren't so chaotic that stars cannot be birthed there, as scientists had previously believed.\n\n\"The D9 system shows clear signs of the presence of gas and dust around the stars, which suggests that it could be a very young stellar system that must have formed in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole,\" team member Michal Zaja\u010dek from Masaryk University and the University of Cologne said.\n\nThe first image of Sgr A* as seen by the Event Horizon Telescope, released in 2022. (Image credit: EHT Collaboration.)\n\nThe D9 binary system exists within a fascinating group of stellar bodies called the S-star cluster. These stars whip around at incredible speeds thanks to the immense gravity of Sgr A*, which has a mass equivalent to that of around 4.3 million suns.\n\nArguably, the most intriguing objects in the S-cluster are bodies that appear like clouds of gas and dust but behave like stars called the \"G objects.\"\n\nD9 was discovered as astronomers were attempting to discover what these the strange and \"puffy\" G objects actually are.\n\nOne current theory suggests that they may have once been binary stars like D9, which have been forced to merge, leaving a cloud of material surrounding other, as yet unmerged stars.\n\n\n\nAs such, the G objects may offer a glimpse of D9's future.\n\nThe nature of objects around Sgr A* remains a mystery, but astronomers are diligently uncovering new clues.\n\nThe GRAVITY + upgrade to the VLT and the forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) should make this picture even clearer in the future.\n\n\"Our discovery lets us speculate about the presence of planets since these are often formed around young stars,\" Pei\u00dfker concluded. \" It seems plausible that the detection of planets in the galactic center is just a matter of time.\""

If the lightning channel is generally at right angles to the line of sight, the sound will reach the observer at almost the same time: an abrupt, loud crack. If the channel is generally parallel to the line of sight, the sound from the farthest part will reach the observer many seconds later than the sound from the nearest part: a long rumble.\u201d\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nJ Particle May Be Charmed Quark\n\n\u201cThe most puzzling aspect of the recent discovery of a new kind of subnuclear particle at two high-energy-\u00adphysics laboratories is the particle\u2019s extra\u00adordinarily long lifetime of 10\u201320 second. This unexpectedly \u2018slow\u2019 decay sets the comparatively massive new particle apart from hundreds of other unstable sub\u2013nuclear species that have been created with particle accelerators. Most of the latter particles have life\u00ad\u00adtimes on the order of 10\u201323 second. The new particle is called the J particle by one group of experimenters and the psi particle by the other. Another possibility being discussed is that the particle represents a \u2018bound state\u2019 consisting of a \u2018charmed\u2019 quark and its cor responding antiquark.\u201d\n\n1925\n\nDoes Lactic Acid Cause Muscle Fatigue?\n\n\u201cWhat happens when we get out of breath or become ex\u00ad\u00adhaust\u00ad\u00aded? Dr. A. V. Hill, professor of physiology at University College London, recently discovered that there was a very close relation between the fatigue caused by exercise and the production of a certain chemical called lactic acid in the muscles that are being used. Dr. Hill discovered that fatigue was accompanied by an increase in the amount of lactic acid in the muscles, whereas recovery from fatigue was always marked by a de\u00ad\u00adcrease in lactic acid.\u201d\n\nScientists discredited the lactic acid idea more than two decades ago, but it persists today. They suspect that inorganic phosphate contributes to skeletal muscle fatigue.\n\n1875\n\nChromosphere Cloaks the Sun\n\n\u201cThe edge of the sun\u2019s visible disk is surmounted to an elevation of between 8,000 and 10,000 miles by an envelope of rose-\u00adcolored gases, to which Mr. Norman Lockyer has given the name of chromosphere. The scarlet flame clothes the whole surface of the sun, and here and there rises in cloudlike forms that ascend to enormous heights. The spectroscope has shown that uprising jets are nothing but heated clouds of gas, largely hydrogen. Their spectrum exhibits conspicuously the bright lines of that element, yet another very prominent line as well. To this hypothetical element the name of helium has been assigned by Lockyer and Edward Frank\u00adland, though with rather doubtful propriety.\u201d\n\nWanted: A Nitroglycerin Engine\n\n\u201cM. Champion, a French chemist, states that the heat developed by a given quantity of nitroglycerin when exploded is capable of exerting, when converted into motion, a maxi\u00b7 mum energy five times that produced by the explosion of the same amount of gunpowder, and 3,000 times more than that of combustion of an equal quantity of coal. A quart of nitroglycerin, it is asserted, has the potential energy of 5,500 horsepower working during 10 hours. It remains to invent a machine in which the gigantic force can be harnessed and controlled.\u201d\n\nMonorail, with Leather Brakes\n\n\u201cThe Turkish government has recently commenced the construction of a railway, termed the Steam Caravan, between Alexandretta and Aleppo, Syria, a distance of 94.2 miles. A single rail is employed, raised on a wall 28 inches high and 17.5 inches broad. The vehicles straddle both rail and wall. The locomotives are provided with horizontal, leather-\u00adcovered wheels, which rest against the sides of the masonry and serve as brakes, and the last vehicle of each train has similar arrangements. Each side of each carriage contains two persons, and the complete train is calculated to accommodate 96.\u201d"

            "article_content": ">>\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\nARCHITECTURE AND INTERIOR DESIGN\n\nThe housing market is evolving rapidly, and so are the preferences of homeowners. New build homes in 2025 are no longer just about functionality\u2014they're about making bold statements, embracing sustainability, and integrating technology seamlessly into everyday living. Modern homeowners demand more than just a house; they seek a home that reflects their personality, values, and aspirations.\n\nOne essential tool for bringing these innovative designs to life is Australian construction estimating software. This technology ensures that creative ideas can be realized without breaking budgets or causing unnecessary delays. With precise cost estimates and resource management, builders can focus on crafting homes that embody these forward-thinking trends.\n\nSmart Homes with Integrated Technology\n\nThe concept of a \"smart home\" has taken a giant leap forward. Builders are now incorporating technology that enhances convenience, security, and energy efficiency. Voice-controlled lighting, advanced thermostats, and security systems with AI capabilities are just the beginning. Home automation is now about anticipating needs and simplifying life, making tech integration a priority for new build homes. Multifunctional Spaces\n\nAs remote work and hybrid lifestyles become the norm, homeowners value versatility in their living spaces. The trend of multifunctional rooms is gaining traction, with designs that allow for easy transitions between work, play, and relaxation. Think hidden office nooks, modular furniture, and rooms that can transform into home gyms or entertainment areas with minimal effort. Biophilic Design\n\nBringing the outdoors inside is no longer a luxury; it\u2019s a growing necessity for creating healthier living environments. Biophilic design focuses on incorporating natural elements such as indoor gardens, large windows for ample natural light, and materials like wood and stone. These features not only enhance aesthetic appeal but also promote well-being by connecting residents with nature. Energy-Efficient Features\n\nSustainability is a major focus in 2025, with new build homes prioritizing energy efficiency. Solar panels, energy-efficient windows, and advanced insulation materials are now standard features in many designs. Builders are also exploring the use of recycled materials and renewable resources, helping homeowners reduce their environmental footprint while cutting energy costs. Bold Color Palettes and Textures\n\nNeutral tones have long been a staple in home design, but 2025 is shaking things up with bold, vibrant color schemes. Statement walls, colorful cabinetry, and striking accent pieces are making their way into new build homes. Textures like exposed brick, polished concrete, and woven textiles are also being used to create visually engaging spaces that feel warm and inviting. Outdoor Living Spaces\n\nOutdoor areas are becoming extensions of the home, offering functional spaces for relaxation and entertainment. From expansive decks to outdoor kitchens and fire pits, builders are designing homes that seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor living. These spaces are particularly appealing in regions with favorable climates, as they allow homeowners to enjoy their surroundings year-round. Smaller, Smarter Footprints\n\nThe demand for efficient use of space has led to a trend of \"smaller but smarter\" homes. Compact designs prioritize functionality and creativity, ensuring that every square foot is utilized effectively. Custom storage solutions, open floor plans, and innovative layouts cater to those seeking minimalism without compromising on style or comfort. Wellness-Oriented Designs\n\nHomeowners are increasingly prioritizing wellness in their living environments. Features like home spas, meditation rooms, and air-purification systems are becoming common in new build designs. These elements cater to the growing interest in self-care and health-focused living.\n\nThe Role of Technology in Bringing Ideas to Life\n\nTo successfully implement these innovative design trends, builders rely on tools that streamline planning and execution. For instance, Australian construction estimating software helps builders accurately forecast costs and allocate resources efficiently. By leveraging such tools, construction teams can ensure that cutting-edge designs are both feasible and cost-effective.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe new build homes of 2025 are defined by creativity, functionality, and sustainability. From energy-efficient features to smart home integrations and wellness-oriented spaces, today\u2019s homeowners are seeking designs that elevate their living experience. For builders, tools like Australian construction estimating software are invaluable in turning these visionary concepts into reality. By embracing these trends and leveraging technology, the construction industry is setting the stage for homes that inspire and endure."

            "article_content": "Elon Musk\u2019s escalating legal feud with Sam Altman could act as a drag on OpenAI\u2019s rocket-like ascent to the top of the artificial intelligence world.\n\nThe two one-time collaborators are now locked in a simultaneous battle to advance artificial intelligence and prevail in a courtroom fight over the future of OpenAI, the organization Musk and Altman founded together in 2015 before parting ways.\n\nMusk, who now runs a competing AI company called xAI, is trying to convince a federal judge to issue an injunction that would stop the creator of chatbot ChatGPT from converting to a for-profit company.\n\nThe lawsuit Musk filed in August also accuses OpenAI of putting profits before its initial nonprofit mission of advancing AI in a way that benefits all of humanity.\n\nTesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk listens as US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with House Republicans in Washington, DC, on Nov. 13. ALLISON ROBBERT/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"I think the fact that Musk has asked for a preliminary injunction ups the ante,\" Rob Rosenberg, former general counsel for Showtime Networks and founder of Telluride Legal Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"Because if he were successful it would definitely throw a major wrench into the current plans for OpenAI.\"\n\nAltman, OpenAI, and its biggest backer Microsoft (MSFT), which is also named as a defendant in the case, last week shot back at Musk's request for the judge to step in on an emergency basis, calling his allegations \"false\" and claiming he has no legal basis for blocking OpenAI\u2019s for-profit conversion.\n\nDividing up the spoils\n\nThe legal fight is unfolding while OpenAI and Microsoft discuss how to divide up the spoils of the artificial intelligence upstart when and if OpenAI becomes a for-profit company.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft hired Wall Street investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to advise them on these discussions after OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round valuing it at $157 billion. Microsoft has invested $14 billion since 2019.\n\nAltman has said OpenAI needs to become a for-profit to help it attract additional investment capital. In September, the charity projected a $5 billion loss for 2024.\n\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO. of OpenAI, speaks during the New York Times annual DealBook summit on Dec. 4, in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nMusk's suit could introduce perilous delays. According to the New York Times, the terms of the charity's latest investment round require it to shed its nonprofit status within two years or have those investments convert to debt.\n\nMusk is not the only rival that could slow things down for OpenAI. AI competitor Meta (META) on Thursday sent a letter to California's Attorney General Rob Bonta asking the state to block OpenAI from becoming a for-profit business.\n\nIt said that allowing the change would set a dangerous precedent, with nonprofit donors simultaneously benefiting from government-allowed tax deductions and profits from traditional investments.\n\nHow things unraveled\n\nTo understand the current feud between Musk and Altman, it helps to know the origins of their onetime partnership and how things unraveled.\n\nThe two men started OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of safely and transparently developing AI to advance humanity instead of pursuing profits.\n\nMusk left in 2018. There are now disagreements in court about the reasons for that departure and what led up to it.\n\nMusk has alleged that Altman \"deceived\" him into co-founding and funding OpenAI by promising that it would remain a nonprofit and then took steps to unlawfully enrich himself by partnering OpenAI with companies in which he held financial interest, including Reddit (RDDT) and Stripe.\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman speaking in 2015, the year they co-founded OpenAI. (Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Vanity Fair) (Michael Kovac via Getty Images)\n\nMusk has also accused Altman of forming and operating for-profit businesses in multiple parts of the AI market that entered into contractual relationships with OpenAI \u2014 including processor manufacturer Rain AI and energy provider Helion Energy \u2014 and of seeking to form an OpenAI-powered device company with former Apple chief designer Jony Ive.\n\nMusk said in court documents that he wrote to Altman and another OpenAI executive on Sept. 20, 2017, with an ultimatum: \"Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a non-profit.\" He left in February 2018.\n\nMusk's complaint names more than a dozen OpenAI-affiliated companies as defendants.\n\nOpenAI, however, claims Musk agreed prior to leaving the startup that for-profit status was the next step to completing OpenAI's mission, according to a blog post last week.\n\nMusk even made a failed demand to gain majority equity in the organization and be named its CEO, according to OpenAI.\n\nMusk stepped down as OpenAI's co-chair after OpenAI rejected his proposal to turn OpenAI into a for-profit by attaching it to Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI added in court filings.\n\nMicrosoft's involvement\n\nIn 2019 Altman and his team did create a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital \u2014 including the billions eventually gained from Microsoft.\n\nIt was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power.\n\nThe inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023 when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later.\n\nIn the aftermath, Microsoft executive Deannah Templeton took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI\u2019s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMusk has alleged that agreements between OpenAI and Microsoft, which is also a competitor to OpenAI, violated federal and state antitrust laws. Other claims include breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, unlawful self-dealing, and unfair business practices.\n\nThe contracts, Musk said, threaten fair competition in the market for AI products, specifically, by requiring investors not to fund the companies' mutual competitors, including xAI.\n\n\"Plaintiffs, consumers, investors, and the generative AI market will suffer irreparable harm if defendants\u2019 conduct continues unabated,\" Musk said in his request for an injunction.\n\n\"The development of generative AI technology presents profound implications for society, making preservation of competitive markets in this sector uniquely important to the public interest.\"\n\nMicrosoft has rejected those claims.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella stands between logos for OpenAI and Microsoft during the OpenAI DevDay event on Nov 6, 2023 in San Francisco. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\n\"Microsoft never agreed to avoid funding OpenAI\u2019s competitors or agreed that other investors would do so \u2014 full stop,\" the company said in a court document. \"Not as part of the latest round of OpenAI funding, nor at any other time.\"\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, Altman said had he known OpenAI would need so much capital he would have founded it using a different business structure.\n\nAltman said he was \"tremendously sad\" about his legal dispute with Musk, saying that \"I grew up with Elon as like a mega hero.\"\n\nHe said he was not concerned that Musk could use his close ties with President-elect Donald Trump to make things more difficult for OpenAI once the new administration takes power.\n\n\"I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon would hurt competitors and advantage his own businesses,\" he said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

            "source": "The Motley Fool",
            "article_content": "Market leaders of next-big-thing trends are known for their parabolic climbs -- as well as their inevitable retracements.\n\nIt's been a phenomenal year for Wall Street and investors. Whereas the stock market's major indexes have historically averaged annual returns that range from the high single digits to around 10%, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-propelled Nasdaq Composite have respective rocketed higher by 16%, 27%, and 33% on a year-to-date basis, as of the closing bell on Dec. 13.\n\nWhile the latest leg of this bull market rally has been fueled by Donald Trump's November victory, the lion's share of this two-year ascension for the major stock indexes can be attributed to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nThe ability for AI-fueled software and systems to become more proficient at their tasks over time, as well as evolve to learn new skills, should give this technology utility in virtually all industries around the globe. It's why the analysts at PwC are forecasting a $15.7 trillion addressable market for artificial intelligence by 2030.\n\nThough Nvidia has been the most front-and-center beneficiary of the rise of AI, it's actually been outshone by another AI stock recently: data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.32%).\n\nShares of Palantir have soared 343% on a year-to-date basis and are up a scorching-hot 935% over the trailing-two-year period. In fact, Palantir has done so well that it's being added to the Nasdaq-100.\n\nHowever, Wall Street is a forward-looking entity. This means the million-dollar question is: \"Can these monstrous gains can hold up in 2025 and beyond?\"\n\nBased on what history tells us, this unabashed optimism may soon come to a screeching halt.\n\nPalantir's unique positioning drives investor excitement\n\nIf there's a prevailing catalyst that's most responsible for Palantir's enormous outperformance of Wall Street's major stock indexes over the last two years, it's the company's irreplaceability at scale.\n\nThough there are other businesses that tackle bits and pieces of what Palantir's platforms and services cover, there is no one-for-one replacement for what this company provides. Businesses with a secure moat tend to command a hearty valuation premium on Wall Street, and they typically enjoy predictable operating cash flow.\n\nPalantir's core operations are broken into two segments: Gotham and Foundry. The former is driven by AI and helps federal governments collect data, as well as plan and execute missions. Meanwhile, Foundry is the company's enterprise-focused segment that relies on AI and machine learning to help businesses make sense of their data.\n\nPalantir's Gotham platform has primarily been responsible for lifting the company to recurring profitability, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Government contracts with the U.S. often span four or five years, resulting in transparent operating cash flow and steady double-digit sales growth.\n\nBut there's also plenty of excitement for Foundry. This platform is still in its early stages of growth, with Palantir's commercial customer count surging 51% on a year-over-year basis in the latest quarter to 498. As businesses shift their data (and that of their customers) online and into the cloud, making sense of big data to streamline operations should become increasingly important. In short, the table is set for Foundry to deliver a superior growth rate to Gotham moving forward.\n\nLastly, investors have to be impressed with Palantir's treasure chest. The company closed out the third quarter with $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, with no debt. This capital provides financial flexibility in any economic climate and may allow Palantir's board to reward shareholders via buybacks from time to time.\n\nHistory weighs in on Palantir's parabolic climb\n\nWhile there's no denying that a lot has gone right for Palantir, it's also hard to ignore the historic precedent that it's contending with.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, the internet began changing the corporate landscape and growth trajectory much in the same way we're witnessing artificial intelligence alter corporate growth strategies for businesses today. However, every next-big-thing technology and innovation that's followed in the internet's footsteps over the last three decades has endured an early innings bubble-bursting event.\n\nInvestors have consistently overestimated the adoption and utility of game-changing technologies since the mid-1990s. Regardless of whether or not these trends went on to be successful over the long-term doesn't change the outcome that businesses leading next-big-thing trends have lost 80% to 99% of their value on a peak-to-trough basis.\n\nThe silver lining for Palantir is that its multiyear contracts with the U.S. government and select allies may potentially soften the blow if an AI bubble took shape and eventually burst. But history bluntly suggests the decline expected in Palantir's stock would still be significant.\n\nTo make matters worse, Palantir's valuation is at a level that's historically consistent with market leaders of next-big-thing trends reversing course. Prior to the dot-com bubble bursting, Amazon and Cisco Systems peaked in the neighborhood of 40 times trailing-12-month sales. We've also witnessed Nvidia recently hit a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 40.\n\nPalantir has them all beat, with a P/S ratio of more than 69 on a trailing-12-month basis. History clearly shows that market-leading businesses -- even those with sustainable moats -- haven't been able to maintain this much of a valuation premium for an extended period.\n\nThough it's not history-specific, the other issue for Palantir is that its most-profitable segment, Gotham, has a natural ceiling. As I've pointed out in the past, Gotham is only available to the U.S. government and its immediate allies. Palantir's management team isn't going to allow foreign governments, such as China or Russia, access to its AI-driven software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. This limits the long-term growth runway for Gotham and places the burden of future profit growth squarely on Foundry's shoulders.\n\nTo reiterate, there's no question that Palantir deserves some level of valuation premium given its successful integration of AI, its push to recurring GAAP profits, and its irreplaceability. But with market leaders of next-big-thing innovations continually failing to live up to expectations in the early going, a halving in Palantir's stock, if not a larger percentage decline, would be par for the course, historically speaking."

NIO stock made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on September 12th, 2018, at $6.26 per share.\n\nWithin 3 years of trading, NIO stock hit an all-time high of $62.84 in February 2021 before plummeting 92.92% to today\u2019s price of $4.45per share.\n\nWhile the share price run-up in early 2020 was purely a momentum push, NIO brand in the EV market was not tarnished. In fact, the car company is still seen as a premium EV player and one of the first companies to address range anxiety issues by creating battery swap technology as a supplement to charging.\n\n24/7 Wall Street aims to provide readers with our assumptions about the stock\u2019s prospects going forward, what growth we see in NIO stock for the next several years, and what our best estimates are for NIO\u2019s stock price each year through 2030.\n\nKey Points in this Article:\n\nNIO is the 3rd largest EV company in China\n\nNIO is the first EV to pioneer swappable battery packs.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report.

The company added six new stations today, bringing the total count to 2,802. So far, NIO has installed 62 new stations this month, with the aim of meeting an ambitious target of 200 battery swap stations by the end of December.\n\n12/13/2024\n\nNio\u2019s shares dropped more than 2% in U.S. trading and nearly 4% in Hong Kong and Singapore today. Yesterday, NIO hosted a media event in Shanghai, but it appears it was not as successful with investors as planned.\n\n12/12/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s third plant, F3, is scheduled to commence operations in the third quarter of 2024. This aligns with NIO\u2019s ambitious goal of delivering 44,000 vehicles in 2025, a large increase from its projected output for this year.\n\n12/11/2024\n\nNIO shares were down 6.6% yesterday, trading as low as $4.80. The number of shares traded was also down 51% below average.\n\n12/9/2024\n\nNIO experienced a large gap up at the market open today. After closing at $4.61 on Friday, NIO\u2019s stock opened at $4.94 (a 7.16% increase). In addition to the price surge, NIO also saw unusual options activity today, with 294,778 purchased call options, a 53% increase compared to the average volume of 193,100 call options.\n\n12/6/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s new partnership with Mastercard includes many new experiences and innovative payment solutions. Mastercard cardholders will gain access to exclusive NIO benefits like charging, battery swapping, maintenance, car rental, and business travel privileges. In addition, NIO users will have the option to make contactless payments directly from their vehicle.\n\n12/5/2024\n\nNIO is teaming up with Mastercard to enhance user experiences and expand its global reach. The partnership will focus on improving payment solutions, user services, and international business growth.\n\n12/3/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s shares surged today by 3.9%, peaking at $4.60.\n\n11/27/2024\n\nGoldman Sachs has taken a bearish stance on NIO, downgrading its rating from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201csell\u201d and lowering the price target to $3.90. This decision is primarily driven by concerns over NIO\u2019s product pipeline, production ramp-up, and financial performance.\n\n11/26/2024\n\nNIO declined significantly 5.8% today, dipping to a low of $4.32. However, despite this downward trend, NIO\u2019s management remains optimistic about the future. They anticipate positive developments from the launch of new brands, an inflection point in cash flow, and increased sales.\n\n11/22/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s shares increased 2.6% today, trading as high as $4.84.\n\nNIO Stock Early Stage Growth\n\nThe following is a table of NIO\u2019s revenues, operating income, and share price for the first few years as a public company.\n\nHere\u2019s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018.\n\nShare Price\n\n(End of Year) Revenues (CNY) Operating Income 2018 $5.39 4,951.2 (9,595.6) 2019 $3.45 7,824.9 (11,079.2) 2020 $40.00 16,257.9 (4,607.6) 2021 $16.70 36,136.4 (4,496.3) 2022 $7.87 49,268.6 (15,640.7) 2023 $4.71 55,617.9 (22,655.2)\n\nRevenue and operating income in Billion CNY (1CNY=.14 USD)\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) the first few years it was a publicly traded company (here is Rivian\u2019s stock price forecast):\n\nShare Price\n\n(End of Year) Revenues Operating Income 2021 $50.24 $55.0 ($4,220.0) 2022 $19.30 $1,658.0 ($6,856.0) 2023 $10.70 $4,434.0 ($5,739.0) TTM $15.35 $4,997.0 (5,790.0)\n\nThe revenue growth for both firms is similar but Rivian\u2019s operating loss is more than double the yearly operating loss of NIO.\n\nNIO formerly contracted its manufacturing to Jianghuai Automobile Group, paying a fee for each vehicle produced in addition to fixed cost. They have since acquired the factory from JAC. This agreement is beneficial for a young start-up in a very capital-intensive market. However, when scale is reached, the variable cost model has its downsides.\n\n2023 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images\n\n3 Key Drivers of NIO\u2019s Stock Performance\n\nProduct Portfolio Expansion and Growing Market Share New Model Launches : Similar to Tesla, NIO started off with a higher-end roadster and used the higher-end models to re-invest into more affordable, mass-market vehicles. NIO aims to push further into price-conscious markets while also adding options for its more premium customers. Add-On Services: With NIO\u2019s battery swap technology, the company plans to roll out an innovative battery-as-a-service solution for its customer base. The company plans on building over 4,000 swap stations worldwide by the end of 2025.\n\nIncreased Vehicle Deliveries and Market Penetration Growing NEV Adoption : The market for new market vehicles (NEVs) is on the rise in China. NIO expects vehicle deliveries in 2025 to double the output from 2023 (roughly 165,000 units). This still only makes up about 2% of the Chinese NEV market and gives NIO plenty of roadway to grab market share for years to come. International Expansion : NIO\u2019s strategy includes expanding its market presence outside China. The company built its first overseas battery-swap station in Hungary in 2022 and has several service centers and NIO accessory businesses throughout Europe.\n\nAdvancements in Technology and Customer Experience Battery and Charging Solutions : NIO\u2019s advancements in battery technology and charging solutions aim to alleviate range anxiety among consumers and help lower the overall cost of the vehicle by 15% to 30%. Focus on Younger Consumers : NIO\u2019s leadership in EV technology will provide brand equity to younger generations of drivers who value enhanced technology packages.\n\n\n\nNIO Stock Forecast Through 2030\n\nYear Revenue Shares Outstanding P/S Est. 2025 97,052 2,050 mm 1x 2026 114,172 2,050 mm 1x 2027 134,643 2,050 mm 1.5x 2028 257,634 2,050 mm 1.5x 2029 176,533 2,050 mm 1.5x 2030 189,548 2,050 mm 2x\n\nRevenue in CYN millions\n\nCompared to Rivian and Tesla, NIO\u2019s price-to-sales valuation will be moderately discounted. While NIO is in solid financial standing and has a premium brand image, it\u2019s still uncertain how much competition the company will face in China and expanding overseas. The company is already spending a quarter of revenues on R&D and if NIO can\u2019t capitalize on this spend, the stock price will be sluggish compared to North American EV manufacturers.\n\nNIO Share Price Estimates 2025-2030\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nHow NIO\u2019s Next 5 Years Could Play Out\n\nWall Street analysts have NIO\u2019s stock price over the next year to be $6.94 which gives the stock a 55.97% upside over today\u2019s price of $4.45. Of the 26 analysts covering the stock, the consensus recommendation is a 2.07 \u2018Outperform\u2019 Score.\n\nWe expect to see a revenue growth of 60% for 2025, with a price-to-sales multiple of 1x, which puts our price target at $6.63, an upside of 49.01%.\n\nGoing into 2026, we estimate the price to be $7.80, with another strong 50%+ revenue bump. However, with EBITDA still well in the negative, we see the market not rewarding the stock as much and giving it a lower valuation multiple, resulting in an upside of 75.30%.\n\nHeading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase to leap forward to $13.80 with another strong 50%+ revenue growth year-over-year. That is a 97% year-over-year gain and up 210.15% from today\u2019s stock price.\n\nWhen predicting more than 3 years out, we expect NIO\u2019s P/S ratio in 2028 to be 1.5x and top-line growth of 50%. In 2028, we have NIO\u2019s revenue coming in around $36 billion, suggesting a stock price estimate at $26.39 or a gain of 493.10% over the current stock price.\n\n24/7 Wall Street expects NIO\u2019s stock to continue its revenue growth and to generate $25 billion in revenue. The stock price in 2029 is estimated at $18.08, or a gain of 306.34% over today\u2019s price.\n\nNIO Stocks Price Target for 2030\n\nWe estimate NIO\u2019s stock price to be $25.89 per share. Our estimated stock price will be 481.86% higher than the current stock price.\n\nYear Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $6.94 Upside of 55.97% 2025 $6.63 Upside of 49.01% 2026 $7.80 Upside of 75.30% 2027 $13.80 Upside of 210.15% 2028 $26.39 Upside of 493.10% 2029 $18.08 Upside of 306.34% 2030 $25.89 Upside of 481.86%\n\nJenoche / Shutterstock.com\n\n100 Million Americans Are Missing This Crucial Retirement Tool The thought of burdening your family with a financial disaster is most Americans\u2019 nightmare.

Yes, according to new internal data that enterprise SEO platform shared today with Search Engine Land.\n\n\u201cFor the first time we can see a trajectory where ChatGPT could cross the magic 1% market share threshold sometime next year,\u201d according to Jim Yu, founder and executive chair of BrightEdge.\n\nWhy we care. AI search is evolving quickly. It is important to watch how people adopt AI search because it may alter the way people discover you, your brand, or your website. We\u2019re watching it happen, month after month, right now. And with ChatGPT search now available to all free users, this growth could further accelerate.\n\nChatGPT vs. Perplexity. ChatGPT is now 6x larger than Perplexity, according to an LLM referral analysis of November traffic by BrightEdge. Also, search traffic from ChatGPT (up 44%) and Perplexity (up 71%) continues to grow month over month.\n\nBut. Google is still far and away the leader, with 92.4% of referral traffic coming from Google. Meanwhile, Microsoft Bing\u2019s market share was 4.2% in November.\n\nWait\u2026 Maybe you heard that Rand Fishkin, CEO and co-founder of SparkToro, last month estimated ChatGPT\u2019s search market share was 4.33%, based on data from SimilarWeb and Datos (a Semrush company)? How is there such a big difference and confusion over the market share numbers?\n\nWell, this BrightEdge analysis is based on referral data. Also, Fishkin later downplayed the 4% figure during his BrightonSEO keynote, because not every prompt/chat is a \u201csearch.\u201d\n\nSo if you heard that ChatGPT\u2019s search market share is 4%, you can safely call that stat wrong and disregard it."

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nRumor mill: Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, which spearheaded a recent push to promote Arm-based Windows, have exclusively powered laptops so far. However, new reports suggest that the company's next-generation lineup will fulfill its promise to expand into desktops following its canceled mini PC.\n\nEstablished leaker Roland Quandt believes the previously leaked follow-up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite series of CPUs is intended for desktops. Numerous laptops featuring the chips launched earlier this year running an Arm-based version of Windows, and the company aims to expand into other form factors.\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Elite (or possibly X Elite 2), codenamed Project Glymur, initially appeared in international import-export databases in late September, according to WinFuture. Hardware details are scarce, but Qualcomm previously used special housing to test the NAND and RAM chips for a new flagship processor with the model number SC8480XP.\n\nI think Qualcomm is coming for the desktop with Snapdragon \"X Elite 2\". They're testing \"Project Glymur\" SC8480XP with an AIO liquid cooler feat 120mm fan(s?), just like what you'd use in a (gaming) desktop \u2013 Roland Quandt (@rquandt.bsky.social) December 9, 2024 at 8:26 PM\n\nQuandt reports that the company has begun testing the CPU with AIO liquid coolers resembling those typically used for gaming desktops, suggesting Qualcomm is aiming for higher-end sectors. Snapdragon X Elite laptops have demonstrated modest gaming performance thus far, but seeing what they can accomplish with higher power budgets could be intriguing.\n\nThe company announced plans to bring Snapdragon to all PC form factors at a July Computex presentation but has since remained silent on the subject. Qualcomm unveiled a Snapdragon X Elite mini PC for use as a dev kit earlier in the year but abruptly ceased selling and supporting the device in October.\n\nGeekom might become the first company to release a Snapdragon X desktop. The mini PC manufacturer hasn't formally announced the device, but a leaked promo image reveals that it will be called the QS series and house the top-end X Elite CPU in an aluminum chassis.\n\nAlthough various laptop manufacturers released new models featuring Qualcomm's chips, they haven't amassed a significant presence in the overall PC market yet. Lower prices, which the company promises will come next year, could help attract customers.\n\nGenAI is a primary selling point of Snapdragon X Elite and other \"AI PC\" processors, but users have shown little interest in the technology. Instead, Qualcomm's main advantage might be longer battery life, with some laptops featuring the company's chips lasting a whole day on a single charge.\n\nThe likelihood of desktops running Windows on Arm is expected to increase with the emergence of Arm CPUs from other manufacturers. Nvidia has teased plans for one in 2025, and Arm previously stated that more clients are preparing chips."

In the latest leak, a graphics OEM spoiled the names of the top five Nvidia cards, including the monstrous RTX 5090. The top-end card in the codenamed Blackwell series could take up a ton of space inside your PC. At the same time, it demands enough juice to make your next itemized electrical bill as big as the card itself.\n\nCard manufacturer Zotac leaked the SKUs for Nvidia\u2019s next slate of cards. VideoCardz picked up on the Google Search listings CSI tools before Zotac could pull the results. The screenshotted listings mention the 5090 with 32GB of GDDR7 memory at the top end, which confirms an 8GB increase from the RTX 4090\u2019s 24 GB.\n\nThese cards are big suckers. The RTX 5090 will supposedly take up three to four slots on your motherboard. The current RTX 4090 takes up three slots on most boards. That doesn\u2019t account for length, however. Nvidia\u2019s cards are also a massive power hog. The card manufacturer recommends having a PSU between 650W and 750W. Past rumors hinted the card itself could have a 600W TGP. Rumormonger Kotike7kimi, who normally has a good track record for GPU leaks, wrote on Twitter that the card may demand slightly less than the total 600W. Either way, the 5080 is somewhat more manageable, supposedly demanding 400W. The current RTX 4090 has a 450W total graphics power.\n\nThe Zotac leak showed five cards, including the GeForce RTX 5090, the RTX 5090D (a model made for Chinese markets), the RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti, and the RTX 5070. If you\u2019re wondering where the 5060 or 5050 are, it\u2019s safe to assume they may not arrive at the same time as these higher-end cards. It\u2019s another matter whether Nvidia announces them at CES 2025 but later releases them.\n\nBeyond the need for a separate baby carriage inside your PC case to keep it cradled without toppling your tower, the confirmed VRAM gives more credence to past rumors that the 5090 will have 21,760 FP32 CUDA cores, more than double the number of the RTX 4090.\n\nWe\u2019d also like to hear from Nvidia itself why it decided to release the 5070 Ti \u201cTitanium\u201d edition simultaneously with its other cards. Nvidia normally drops these versions later as a sidegrade to existing GPUs, as with the 4070 Ti. Nvidia seems to be focusing on the high-end GPUs, while leaving the lower-end cards for later.\n\nFor the budget builders, it doesn\u2019t leave much room to hope the lower-end 50-series will be inexpensive. There\u2019s been much less to go on with the 5060 or supposed 5060 Ti. There have been even fewer hints about any kind of RTX 5050. Intel just released its budget cards like the B580, with claims it can top the RTX 4060 in most games, plus it comes with 12GB of VRAM. So far, rumors hint the non-Ti 5060 may have 8GB."

The wise men brought gold, cadbury creme, and myrrh.'\n\nOthers appeared triggered by the early arrival of Easter chocolate, with one person writing: 'Utter woke nonsense.'\n\nLiberty Lester, from Jersey, spotted an aisle full of seasonal chocolate after visiting her local Alliance supermarket on December 16\n\nAnother commented: 'Our shop got them yesterday....'\n\nA third quizzed, 'Did we sleep through Christmas?' while a fourth raged: 'Ridiculous!!!'\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Brits voiced support over the idea of Easter chocolate being available to buy year-round.\n\nOne person wrote, 'Hey man I get your point, but I\u2019ll take a mini egg any day,' while another said, 'Chocolate is chocolate and mini eggs slap so I don't even care.'\n\nA third wrote: 'Y'all wouldn\u2019t judge if I got the kilo bag of mini eggs for Christmas, perks of my dad working retail.'\n\nFinally, another commented: 'Creme egg and mini eggs should be available all year round!'\n\nIt comes as Cadbury has revealed it has axed a popular treat from its festive range, leaving fans resorting to drastic measures as they claim Christmas is 'ruined.'\n\nThe chocolate confectioner is facing backlash after confirming Festive Friends will not be returning to supermarket shelves in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nThe post has since sparked a debate among Brits on social media, as people argue as to whether Easter chocolate should be available to buy throughout the year\n\nSimilar to Cadbury's beloved Animals biscuits, Festive Friends are bite sized biscuits half covered in milk chocolate and shaped in a variety of traditional Christmas characters, such as Santa, snowmen and reindeer.\n\nCadbury fans have been looking forward to stocking up on the seasonal treat ahead of the festive season, but were left scratching their heads after failing to spot the beloved biscuits in shops across the UK.\n\nFans took to social media in September to search for answers, but have since been left 'heartbroken' after the chocolate giant confirmed their decision to discontinue the product.\n\nOne dedicated fan wrote, 'Have Cadbury's stopped selling Festive Friends? Because I haven't seen any anywhere and I'm disappointed,' to which another responded, 'You and me both!!!'\n\nIn response, a Cadbury spokesperson wrote: 'Hi there, we can confirm that Festive Friends are being replaced by Festive Animals this Christmas."

            "article_content": "In 2018, in the north of the Alps, archaeologists unearthed an ancient silver amulet, which they later recognized as the oldest known Christian artifact to be found in the region. What they couldn\u2019t crack, however, was a scroll tucked into the small relic\u2014one that could not be unrolled for fear of crumbling the brittle paper. Now, six years on, researchers in the German city of Frankfurt have gotten an unprecedented glimpse into the mysterious artifact, thanks to state-of-the-art technology.\n\nMeasuring a mere 1.3 inches, the amulet itself was found on a burial ground in the Roman city of Nida, now known as Frankfurt, and is thought to date back to between 230 and 270 C.E. The scroll it contained was already evident during excavation, but because it had spent centuries rolled up, any attempts to unfurl it would cause it to fall apart, researchers believed. Microscopic analyses and X-rays, too, proved unable to offer further insight into the scroll\u2019s contents.\n\nThe best of Artnet News in your inbox. Sign up for our daily newsletter.

You have successfully subscribed to Artnet News.\n\nAn answer ultimately arrived in the form of cutting-edge computer tomography developed by the Leibniz Center for Archaeology (LEIZA) in Mainz, which allowed researchers to \u201cdigitally unroll\u201d the brittle silver foil earlier this year\u2014not unlike the type of technology used in the efforts to decipher the Herculaneum scrolls. What it yielded was a high-resolution 3D model of the scroll\u2019s 18-line-long inscription.\n\nThe inscription is written in Latin, an unusual choice for Christian amulets of the time. It contains invocations to Jesus Christ and Saint Titus, a Greek missionary who lived during the 2nd century C.E. More typical of early Christian amulets, it celebrates the power of Heavenly Father while referencing passages from the Bible. Unlike other early Christian artifacts, however, the amulet bears no mention of the Judaic and pagan traditions that influenced the still-evolving religion.\n\n\u201c[In the name?] of Saint Titus / Holy, holy, holy! / In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of God! / The Lord of the world / resists with [strengths?] all attacks(?)/setbacks(?) / The God(?) grants / entry to well-being,\u201d the inscription reads in part.\n\n\u201cSometimes it took weeks, even months before I had the next idea,\u201d Markus Scholz of Frankfurt\u2019s Goethe University, who led the research project, said in a statement. \u201cI called in experts from the history of theology, among others, and we approached the text together, piece by piece, and finally deciphered it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unusual,\u201d he continues, \u201cis that the inscription is written entirely in Latin. Such inscriptions in amulets were usually written in Greek or Hebrew.\u201d The quality of the inscription, not to mention its minuscule size, suggests it was made by a trained scribe or craftsman.\n\nThe amulet provides direct evidence of Christian communities living in Upper Germania and Gaul, a region of modern-day France, during the late 2nd and 3rd centuries C.E. Most other evidence dates from the early 4th century C.E., after emperor Constantine\u2019s Edict of Milan turned Christianity from a persecuted cult into an officially recognized, tolerated faith.\n\nThe find is not only significant to research into early Christianity but also to the cultural and historical heritage of the city of Frankfurt.\n\n\u201cThis discovery,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor, Mike Josef, remarked in the wake of the inscription\u2019s deciphering, \u201cis a scientific sensation. It will force us to turn back the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond by around 50 to 100 years. The first Christian find north of the Alps comes from our city: we can be proud of that, especially now, so close to Christmas. Those involved have done a great job.\u201d\n\nThe inscription\u2019s deciphering is sure to resurrect debate among scholars of early Christianity and Roman history, two deeply interconnected subjects with muddled but culturally relevant origins."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

Now, even as sightings have expanded to New York and Maryland, government officials haven\u2019t been able to put people\u2019s minds at ease.\n\nSo who (or what) is behind the mysterious drone sightings? And can you shoot them down in California?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This has gone too far': Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says\n\nBecause the sightings aren't confirmed to be connected, it's possible different sightings have different explanations.\n\nFederal authorities have tried to reassure residents that the objects don\u2019t appear to be operating nefariously. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey lawmakers say they believe there is more to the story than federal officials have shared publicly.\n\nCan you shoot down drones in California? What to know after mystery NJ sightings\n\nAnd President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to demand government give answers, writing: \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" On Nov. 22, the FAA issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones over Trump's National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., criticized the Biden administration for being \"dismissive\" about the reported sightings arguing the White House team has failed his \"obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of clear answers has fueled rampant speculation and sometimes bizarre or joking theories.\n\n\u201cThe drones in New Jersey can easily be explained. Teams are clearly spying on the Jets and Giants practices which is why they have struggled this season,\u201d former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cFirst, a Chinese spy balloon drifted across U.S. airspace for a week. Now, unidentified drones are flying over New Jersey, avoiding radar detection. Gaps in our airspace are being exploited, and because of it, the safety of Americans is at risk,\u201d New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew posted.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some possible explanations for the sightings \u2013 and the evidence for or against the theories.\n\nFor the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents. These photos were taken on Dec. 8 in Toms River, N.J.\n\nIs it really drones?\n\nGovernment officials have said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s aren\u2019t actually drones in many of the sightings. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said many of the sightings are actually of piloted aircraft flying legally.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Direen, an electronic and software engineering expert at DireenTech, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people were seeing drones at first, but that once the notion of drones took hold, people assumed any aircraft they couldn\u2019t identify was a drone.\n\n\u201cAfter what were likely valid sightings of possibly hobbyist drones, every aircraft can then become suspicious,\u201d he said.\n\nHoaxes, UFOs, witches, drones: NJ is no stranger to strange happenings\n\nKirby said during a news conference that authorities haven\u2019t been able to corroborate \u201cany of the reported visual sightings\u201d \u2014 despite using \u201cvery sophisticated electronic detection technologies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FBI, DHS and our federal partners, in close coordination with the New Jersey State Police, continue to deploy personnel and technology to investigate this situation and confirm whether the reported drone flights are actually drones or are instead manned aircraft or otherwise inaccurate sightings,\u201d the agencies said in the statement.\n\nForeign government surveillance?\n\nU.S. government officials this week assured the public that the spotted aircraft do not appear to be sent by a foreign government, quashing a theory posed by Van Drew, who said the drones could be controlled by Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence the drones pose a national security threat, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The sightings may actually be piloted aircraft operating legally, the agencies said. Also worth noting: the craft haven\u2019t flown in restricted airspace, they said.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, they have uncovered no such malicious activity or intent at this stage,\u201d a joint statement from the agencies said. \u201cWhile there is no known malicious activity occurring in New Jersey, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight the insufficiency of current authorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said they were briefed by State Police and told authorities don\u2019t know where the drones are coming from, and are unable to detect them.\n\n\u201cListen, I hope it\u2019s no big deal, but the federal government needs to be more truthful.\u201d New Jersey Assemblyman Greg Myhre said.\n\nUS government drones?\n\nGovernment officials including the Pentagon said the drones spotted by residents for the last few weeks are not operated by the U.S. government or military.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that a government organization would be flying the drones over public locations, Direen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cClearly they are not being very stealthy if they are,\u201d he said.\n\nKids playing a prank, or hobbyists?\n\nCould the drones people keep seeing be someone playing a prank, or drone hobbyists just out having a good time? It\u2019s not illegal to fly drones in New Jersey, but you have to meet certain requirements depending on the size of the drone and the reason you\u2019re flying it, according to federal and state laws.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it should be pretty easy for officials to figure out, Direen said.\n\n\u201cIf the drones are being flown legally, the ADS-B transponder on the drone should make it easy for authorities to identify the drone and the operator,\u201d he said.\n\nUFOs?\n\nCould the drones be the work of aliens? At this point, officials have given no evidence to suggest that, but also no evidence to debunk it. (And many UFO sightings are believed to have natural explanations.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI suppose some alien kids could be flying their toy drones while their parents are busy out abducting humans and performing experiments on them,\u201d Direen said.\n\nIs it legal to shoot down a drone in California?\n\nNo. It is illegal to try to shoot down or destroy a drone that trespasses on private property or above public spaces because it may cause safety risks.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones are registered in the U.S., according to the Federal Aviation Administration, including 396,746 commercial drones and 387,746 recreational drones.\n\nRegardless of the drone's classification, however, the FAA considers them aircraft \u2014 meaning that you could be charged with shooting at an aircraft, a federal crime if you take a shot at one.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you believe a drone is violating the law, your best bet is to contact law enforcement.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information, correct a misspelling/typo and to change or add a photo or video.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Mass drone sightings prompt worries, but there may be an explanation"

            "article_content": "The location of D9 the first binary stars ever seen around the Milky Way's supermassive black hole\n\nAstronomers have discovered the first binary stars orbiting a supermassive black hole. The stellar pairing in question orbits the cosmic titan at the heart of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*.\n\nThe binary stars, designated D9, were found in data collected by the Very Large Telescope (VLT), located atop Cerro Paranal, an 8,645-foot-tall (2,635-meter) mountain in Chile's Atacama Desert. By measuring their velocity, the team behind the discovery was surprised to find they were two stars, not one.\n\n\n\nThe fact that these binary stars so near Sgr A* have survived the tremendous gravity of this black hole indicates that these environments may actually be stable enough to allow for the birth of planets, the scientists behind this discovery say. \"Black holes are not as destructive as we thought,\" research lead author and University of Cologne scientist Florian Pei\u00dfker said in a statement.\n\nThe team's findings were published on Tuesday (Dec. 17) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nLet's stick together...\n\nEven though this discovery shows there may be more stability around supermassive black holes than previously suspected, the turbulent environment around Sgr A* means that although binaries can exist, these partnerships are probably fleeting.\n\nThe stars of D9 are estimated to be just 2.7 million years old, and while that may seem like an intimidatingly long time, considering the sun is an estimated 4.6 billion years old, it's really just the blink of a cosmic eye.\n\nAstronomers probably caught these stars at an opportune time. Eventually, the stars of D9 will be forced together, triggering a stellar merger.\n\n\"This provides only a brief window on cosmic timescales to observe such a binary system \u2014 and we succeeded!\", team member and University of Cologne researcher Emma Bordier said.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Pei\u00dfker et al.)\n\nThe discovery of such young stars around Sgr A* has told scientists something else new about these turbulent black hole-dominated environments, too.\n\nNamely, the regions around supermassive black holes aren't so chaotic that stars cannot be birthed there, as scientists had previously believed.\n\n\"The D9 system shows clear signs of the presence of gas and dust around the stars, which suggests that it could be a very young stellar system that must have formed in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole,\" team member Michal Zaja\u010dek from Masaryk University and the University of Cologne said.\n\nThe first image of Sgr A* as seen by the Event Horizon Telescope, released in 2022. (Image credit: EHT Collaboration.)\n\nThe D9 binary system exists within a fascinating group of stellar bodies called the S-star cluster. These stars whip around at incredible speeds thanks to the immense gravity of Sgr A*, which has a mass equivalent to that of around 4.3 million suns.\n\nArguably, the most intriguing objects in the S-cluster are bodies that appear like clouds of gas and dust but behave like stars called the \"G objects.\"\n\nD9 was discovered as astronomers were attempting to discover what these the strange and \"puffy\" G objects actually are.\n\nOne current theory suggests that they may have once been binary stars like D9, which have been forced to merge, leaving a cloud of material surrounding other, as yet unmerged stars.\n\n\n\nAs such, the G objects may offer a glimpse of D9's future.\n\nThe nature of objects around Sgr A* remains a mystery, but astronomers are diligently uncovering new clues.\n\nThe GRAVITY + upgrade to the VLT and the forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) should make this picture even clearer in the future.\n\n\"Our discovery lets us speculate about the presence of planets since these are often formed around young stars,\" Pei\u00dfker concluded. \" It seems plausible that the detection of planets in the galactic center is just a matter of time.\""

            "article_content": "Dark Matter Is Dead, Long Live Dark Matter\n\nIn the search for the invisible components of the universe, dark matter reached a discouraging milestone. (Fuzzy on the difference between dark energy and dark matter? Read our Fundamentals newsletter from May.) Experimenters hunting for hypothesized dark matter particles known as WIMPs \u2014 heavy, inert particles that were long considered the top candidate for the nonreflective stuff floating in and around galaxies \u2014 hit a limit. Detectors have become so sensitive that they\u2019re now picking up the glow of neutrinos from the sun, which blinds them to any subtler signals. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of the end of the WIMP detection era,\u201d the Stanford University physicist Natalia Toro told us.\n\nShe and other dark matter hunters have switched gears and now seek new dark matter candidates, especially lightweight but abundant particles that would come in multiple species. \u201cThe most common hypothesis is that this is somehow simple. Why on Earth should we expect that?\u201d said Philip Schuster, also a Stanford physicist, voicing an increasingly common sentiment among specialists.\n\nLest you suspect that dark matter is the Ptolemaic epicycle of the 21st century \u2014 a long-believed but convoluted and ultimately erroneous model of the universe \u2014 astronomers discovered a new reason to think it\u2019s really out there. The finding, an object called MACS J0018.5, has proved so compelling that people are referring to it as the new Bullet Cluster. In the original Bullet Cluster \u2014 long considered one of the single most persuasive pieces of evidence for dark matter\u2019s existence \u2014 we see two enormous clusters of galaxies crashing together. The colliding gas glows brightly in the center of the crash site, but most of the matter has sailed right through, forming heavy, light-distorting blobs on either side. That\u2019s how dark matter particles would behave, because they don\u2019t (or barely) interact.\n\nMACS J0018.5 is similar, except the galaxy clusters are merging along our line of sight. Researchers effectively pointed a radar gun at them and found that their visible gas has slowed as it collides while the majority of the mass moves faster, unimpeded by the collision.\n\nThese merging clusters are hard to explain without invoking the kind of invisible particles we\u2019re looking for."

            "article_content": "QUESTION: Why was antimony so prized by alchemists?\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), the towering genius of the Scientific Revolution, was dubbed \u2018the last of the magicians\u2019 by John Maynard Keynes. It is often forgotten that Newton was obsessed with alchemy, having written more than a million words on the subject.\n\nAlchemy was an ancient practice that combined elements of science, philosophy and mysticism. It aimed to transform base metals like lead into noble ones such as gold, discover a universal elixir of life, and understand the fundamental nature of matter and existence.\n\nAntimony\u2019s very reactivity with usually inert elements made it fascinating to alchemists.\n\nNewton held that antimony, along with quicksilver (mercury), was the foundation of alchemy: \u2018That other (and properly named) chalybs is antimony for it is created from nature of itself (without art) and it is the beginning of the work.\u2019 (In alchemy the chalybs was a foundation chemical of \u2018the Art\u2019.)\n\nOutside its supposed alchemical properties, antimony is a chemical element belonging to the nitrogen group. It has the atomic number 51 and is a lustrous, silvery-grey semi-metal with a flaky texture. Unlike typical metals, antimony is not malleable but hard and brittle and can be crushed to a powder.\n\nA unique property of antimony is that, because its solid form is less dense than its liquid form, it expands as it freezes (like water).\n\nThe word antimony comes from the Greek anti and monos: \u2018a metal not found alone\u2019 and it can be found in more than 100 different minerals. Its chemical symbol is Sb, which comes from the element\u2019s historical Latin name, stibium.\n\nAntimony became widely used in Medieval times, mainly to harden lead, although some was taken medicinally as a laxative pill. Today about half of all antimony is used to make antimony trioxide for flame-proofing.\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), English Mathematician And Physicist. Colored English Line And Stipple Engraving, 19th Century\n\nCharles Rees, Warwick\n\nQUESTION: What became of New Zealand\u2019s Moriori people?\n\nThe Moriori were an indigenous Polynesian people who settled the Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand, around the 14th century. They had a relatively peaceful hunter-gatherer lifestyle, relying on seal meat and seafood and adapting to the Chatham Islands\u2019 harsh and cold environment.\n\nTomorrow's questions:\n\n\n\nQ: It took 24 years for Gladiator II to be released after Gladiator. What are the longest time gaps between original feature films andtheir first sequel? John Rutherford, Sevenoaks, Kent Q: What did the Keeper of the King\u2019s Conscience do? Martine Garner, Norwich Q: Was a postbox installed in a crematorium? What was it for? Will Livesy, Truro, Cornwall Advertisement\n\nThey developed a pacifist, collectivist culture known as the law of Nunuku, based on the teachings of the 16th-century Moriori leader Nunuku-whenua.\n\nMeanwhile, the main islands of New Zealand were settled by the Maori, who developed an agricultural and warlike society, with fortified villages and organised tribal structures.\n\nIn 1835, Maori tribes from mainland New Zealand invaded the Chatham Islands, seeking new resources and territory. The Moriori, adhering to their principle of nonviolence, did not resist. They were enslaved and killed. The Moriori population fell from around 1,600 to fewer than 100 within 30 years.\n\nA Moriori survivor recalled: \u2018[They] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed.\u2019\n\nThe Moriori suffered injustice after injustice; after 30 years of slavery, the Chatham Islands were awarded to their invaders in an 1870 Native Land Court decision.\n\nThere was a systematic portrayal of Moriori as a \u2018lazy, stupid people\u2019 genetically distinct from Maori and Polynesians. This description could be found in a 1916 copy of School Journals, a series of educational magazines used across New Zealand elementary schools. The last known full-blooded Moriori, Tommy Solomon (Tame Horomona Rehe), died in 1933.\n\nEmilia Turner, London SE27\n\nQUESTION: Is Valiasr Street in Tehran the longest residential street in the world?\n\nValiasr Street, the longest in the Iranian capital (and in the Middle East), spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north. Built in the 1920s under Reza Shah Pahlavi, it was originally called Pahlavi Street. It was renamed Valiasr or Vali-e Asr following the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\n\nValiasr Street is the longest in the Iranian capital, Tehran (pictured) and it spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north\n\nYonge Street in Toronto, Canada, is the longest street in the world. Measuring 34 miles, it connects Lake Ontario in the south to Lake Simcoe in the north.\n\nThe longest street in Britain is disputed, with both Duke Street in Glasgow and King Street in Aberdeen commonly claiming to be two miles long.\n\nSteven Lewis, Coventry"
