Lee said Andrews half expected her Majesty to get out of the car, only to find out it was actually her chief scientific advisor.\n\nRetired CID officer John Hanson, who is a UFO researcher and author said there was \u2018undoubtedly\u2019 a link between crop circles and UFOs.\n\nHe said: \u201cParticularly the early crop circles were just circular, burnt formations in the grass or in the fields. I think they described them as UFO nests back in the olden days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to witnesses who have more or less seen these things appear and then gone over and then ended up with some quite terrifying experiences.\u201d\n\nThe doc also claims that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were hugely interested in the Rendlesham UFO case from 1980 - which has been dubbed the British Roswell.\n\nThe case allegedly saw a UFO land in the forest at Rendlesham over Christmas weekend in 1980. Numerous airforce personnel, from nearby RAF Bentwaters, which was a US NATO base at the time, went to investigate and saw strange orbs and beams of light shining through the forest.\n\nThe film also investigates wild claims that, the then, Prince Charles piloted an experimental UFO type craft in 1975, and explores what he can do now as King to aid UFO disclosure.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhat I wanted to show in this film is how passionate and serious the senior royals were on the subject of UFOs. They had to keep this mostly a secret because of possible ridicule but if such high standing, balanced people, took them seriously why can\u2019t we?\n\n\u201cThere is something that pilots and police officers are seeing in the skies that can\u2019t be explained so why can\u2019t the British government take them seriously?\u201d\n\nJoin the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

He added: \u201cHere is somebody who could pick up the phone and say look here what\u2019s going on in the United States. He could ask for a full classified briefing.\u201d\n\nThe film includes footage from John Hanson, taken in 2000, of the alleged UFO sighting Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk.\n\nThe \u2018sighting\u2019 became known as the British Roswell - in reference to the 1947 crash of a United States Army Air Forces balloon near Roswell, New Mexico which birthed a conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nLee claims Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, was the first member of the Royal Family to have a UFO experience in around 1875. Lee said: \u201cHe wrote an entry in his journal saying he saw strange, dazzling lights in the sky, like orbs flying past and he couldn\u2019t describe them. It was powerful enough for him to make an entry in his diary and the basis of modern, royal UFOlogy.\u201d\n\nLee said Lord Mountbatten, Prince Phillip\u2019s uncle had a passion for UFO\u2019s. Nick Pope, a retired member of the Ministry of Defence, also claims the Royals have been interested in UFO\u2019s for decades.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut this was always a matter of extreme sensitivity because in some ways it was counter to the government\u2019s public position on this. Or if not directly counter to it, certainly difficult to gel with it.\n\n\u201cPrince Phillip was very much at the forefront of Royal interest in this, though arguably he was introduced to that subject by Lord Mountbatten.\u201d\n\nThe film also looks at the story that the the Prince Charles flew a prototype UFO in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1975. Lee said: \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t extra terrestrial, it was a saucer shaped craft. But the funny thing is it has some strange magnetic propulsion system which was unknown.\u201d\n\nThe craft was said to have emitted a blue ionic flame and was controlled magnetically by a larger craft behind it.\n\nBut the film does acknowledge Prince William is not known to have had any UFO experiences.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhoever is King is going to have an important role to play on the world stage with disclosure being imminent that we are not alone.\u201d\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

        "category": "ufo",
        "date": "43m",
        "source": "Polygon",
        "article_content": "Polygon\u2019s Editor\u2019s Letter is a column from Editor-in-Chief Chris Plante that reflects on the video game and entertainment industries, their communities, and Polygon itself. New editions appear in the first week of each month.\n\nLast month, I wrote about how the endless stream of \u201ctoo many games\u201d has caused existential problems for game makers. This month, I\u2019ll focus on the other side of the equation: the audience. The people who play all of these new games. Or, as a recent survey tells us, the people who don\u2019t play them.\n\nAbundance should be a boon for the average video game fan. Unfettered competition pushes prices down, particularly on PC, where each month players can grab bundles containing dozens (sometimes hundreds) of games for less than $20. And even the fanciest, freshest games often get discounted within weeks of launch.\n\nBetter still, as creators seek untouched corners of the market, their target audiences can be more varied. Wish to build a cozy castle diorama? Want a hardcore SWAT simulator or an anime Stardew Valley-like? Crave an ode to Brazilian bootleg boomer shooters of the 1990s built on actual 1990s tech? If you have an itch, odds are it can be scratched.\n\nAnd yet, a diminutive portion of the overall gaming audience plays new games. According to a report from Newzoo, in 2023 players spent 77% of their playtime on games three years or older. Much of the time players spent on new games went to annualized franchises, like Call of Duty, Madden, and EA FC. A paltry 8% of overall playtime in 2023 went to new games not tied to big, yearly IP.\n\nIn 2024, when someone sits down to play a video game, they can either spend money on a promising but unknown new game, or they can choose from their massive backlog of owned games. Or, they might return to a live-service game like League of Legends or Fortnite that continues to provide a familiar dopamine surge week after week, year after year. To play a new game is to willingly take a risk in terms of one\u2019s money, time, and happiness.\n\nThus, we have 8% of total playtime going toward new games: a tiny slice of pie from which the thousands of developers each year fight for a bite. Ryan Rigney, gaming comms veteran and author of the illuminating Push to Talk newsletter, has been digging into this problem (and this unsettling data) for the past few weeks. I strongly recommend you read his piece \u201cAre Old Games Killing New Games?\u201d\n\nIn that newsletter, Rigney uses Arco, his personal favorite game of the year, which at the time of writing this piece has a modest 623 reviews on Steam, as an example of how a truly great game can fall through the cracks. The example hit me like a rock to the forehead. Despite Arco being one of my most anticipated games, despite receiving advance code from a publicist, despite having a weekly video game podcast that requires me to sample dozens of new games a year, I only now have gotten around to playing this game.\n\nAnd frankly, even with everything going for it, Arco could have just as easily collected dust indefinitely on my exponentially elongating to-do list.\n\nHow to enjoy new video games in the Age of Abundance\n\nSlackers - Carts of Glory is one of the many great games of 2024 that you\u2019ve likely never played. Image: Falling Saints\n\nWhat does this mean for you? As the headline promised (or threatened?), you too won\u2019t play many of 2024\u2019s best games. Time is against you. The number of hours can\u2019t fit the surplus of great new releases.\n\nAssuming we all accept that to be true, I thought it might help if I shared some strategies I\u2019ve learned over the years for making the most of my video game time. As someone professionally expected to have a grasp on the vast majority of video games released, plus the entirety of gaming history, I\u2019ve been wrestling with this challenge for some time.\n\nBe mindful of where your gaming time goes: This is my number one tip when people ask me how I play so many games. The answer is that I play the stuff I like, and I skip or bail on the stuff I don\u2019t. For the past decade, major video game publishers have worked tirelessly to create \u201cforever\u201d games that use habit-forming hooks to lock in players indefinitely. If you want to play the same game every day for years on end, that\u2019s fine and your prerogative! Alternatively, if you want to play new games more, then take a break from your \u201cforever\u201d game of choice. You might find, with some distance, it had become a chore rather than a treat.\n\nWatch streams and playthroughs: Ashley Bardhan recently argued that watching a video game isn\u2019t so different from playing it. I agree. This guidance won\u2019t surprise anyone under the age of 30. But many gamers in the millennial demographic (or older) have yet to make a habit of watching streams on Twitch or playthroughs on YouTube. If this is your first time, search for a playthrough of a new game that interests you on YouTube, skim the headlines and thumbnail images for a style that matches your own, and give it a try!\n\nFind communities that match your pace: Similar to watching games, reading about games is a great way to follow games. Just be sure to find a community that moves at your tempo. If you want a trillion messages and the latest info, a game\u2019s official or unofficial Discord can be great. Want the highlights, try a subreddit. And if you prefer to keep up to date on the games community as a whole, rather than one game, I recommend Polygon.com. Naturally.\n\nAccept that you can\u2019t know everything: For the first few decades of video game culture, the most hardcore gamers took pride in having an encyclopedic knowledge of the industry. Not only had they played every game, but they also knew its developer, publisher, and \u2014 if it came from Japan \u2014 the original title and release date. Because game developers of the \u201980s and \u201990s only released so many games, exhaustive knowledge could be cultivated. The NES had 1,377 games. But then the PS4 had 3,399 games. Steam laps both those numbers each year. In 2024, acquiring an all-encompassing knowledge of video games isn\u2019t possible. And the pursuit of it is like trying to catch every fish in the ocean.\n\nImage: Mossmouth via Polygon\n\nBefore I wrap, let\u2019s talk about one more game.\n\nLast month, developer Mossmouth published what Game File author Stephen Totilo wrote \u201cmight be the most 2024 game anyone can play this year.\u201d If you can even call it a game. UFO 50 is a package carrying 50 stand-alone, complete games from some of the most brilliant game designers alive.\n\nUFO 50\u2019s a masterpiece and the vast majority of gamers will never play it. A tiny fraction of those who do will manage to play all 50 games. And an infinitesimal percentage of the people on Earth will finish the game in its entirety.\n\nThe project is a microcosm of the problem that faces players. With so many good games in UFO 50, its players must approach the game as they would the entire video game ecosystem. Be mindful of your time and your priorities. Dabble! Don\u2019t like a game? Drop it! Be comfortable knowing you don\u2019t have to play all 50 games to completion to enjoy UFO 50. In fact, you don\u2019t have to play any of them.\n\nWeeks after its release, fans have come together to solve its mysteries and celebrate their favorite games within the game on Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube. They\u2019ve created lore explainers, role-played within its fictional history, and carried the experience of the game beyond the confines of the software."

In order to put his abilities to the test, Paranormal Specialist Steve Mera joined Don on numerous of his paranormal projects and claimed that he witnessed his conversations with the spirit on the recording device. Despite Don being the focal point of the majority of the episode, Steve still manages to invoke several questions in the minds of the viewers.\n\nSteve Mera Has Accomplished a Lot in the Field of UFOs and Paranormal\n\nThe subject of UFOs and the Paranormal has fascinated Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera from his early childhood, so much so that he ended up making a career out of it. However, before he made a name for himself in the community, he earned a degree in Electrical Engineering from North Trafford College and GEC Electrical after passing out from Wellington Boys Secondary School. Meanwhile, he ensured that he gave some time to his passion and carried out consistent research on UFOs and the Paranormal, which would prove to be vital in his future. By 1989, his efforts got him a job at NATO as a Telecommunications Officer before working at MAPIT (Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team) and BUFORA (British UFO Research Association).\n\nA few years later, Steve created the BITC (British Investigators Training Course) in Anomalous Phenomena, which turned out to be a huge success across the United Kingdom. The 1990s were quite productive in his professional career as he reformed MAPIT and helped in the launch of MARA (Merseyside Anomalies Research Association) and NUFORA (The National UFO Research Association). Around 1996, he also launched the SEP (Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology) and worked in the para-psychological departments. By 1998, he had completed the Pre-Degree Psychology at South Trafford College, Manchester, and the BSY Parapsychology Course. He has also worked with Parkway Green Housing Association and Zohar Entertainment Group as a UAP Geological Research and Paranormal Specialist.\n\nIn 2017, he also co-founded ONSTELLAR. Steve also earned his degree in Human Behavioral Psychology from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Steve has also been a part of more than 90 TV shows and radio stations throughout his career, thanks to his expertise in the field of UFOs and the Paranormal. Not only that, he has worked with more than 300 different publications across the world and written for numerous TV shows. Some of the shows he has worked on are \u2018Conspiracy Corner,\u2019 \u2018The X-Files,\u2019 \u2018The Late Night Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018The Scream Team,\u2019 \u2018The Great Unexplained Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018UFO Hunters,\u2019 The Afterlife,\u2019 and more. As for the magazines that have featured his articles, some of them are \u2018UFO Review,\u2019 \u2018UFO News UK,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Voices,\u2019 \u2018Naro Minded,\u2019 \u2018Fate,\u2019 \u2018UFO Magazine,\u2019 \u2018Alien Encounters,\u2019 \u2018Sightings,\u2019 and many more.\n\nWhile he is currently handling his responsibilities as the owner and editor of Phenomena Magazine, Steve also stays busy with running MAPIT and SEP. Having written three books \u2014 \u2018The A-Z of the Unknown,\u2019 \u2018Strange Happenings: Memoirs of a Paranormal Investigator,\u2019 and \u2018Paranormal Insight: A Concise Study of the Strange and Profound\u2019 \u2014 the Paranormal Specialist is also reportedly working on a couple of new books, which would revolve around the UFO Phenomena. On September 30, 2024, he conducted a Birmingham UFO Group meeting at the Hot Shots Snooker Club function room at 100 Crosswells Road in Oldbury, Birmingham. In the same month, Steve also featured as a guest in a podcast called \u2018Paranormal Pendle.\u2019\n\nSteve Mera is Also a Dedicated Partner and Friend\n\nOriginally from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, England, Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera leads a content life on the personal front. After all, he has been navigating life\u2019s ups and downs with his one true love, Jackie Heighway, for over a decade now. Though neither of the two has shared when they fell in love, we know that their paths crossed in 2011 in Bolton, and it was in the same year, on November 28, that they turned their fondness for each other into a full-fledged relationship. Together, the two have seemingly built a beautiful world of their own in Greater Manchester, UK, with trust, care, understanding, and loads of love. Jackie is a Salford native who has been self-employed since 2018. Steve has her biggest cheerleader in Jackie, who makes sure she has his back every step of the way.\n\nWhether it is accompanying Steve on his research trips or sharing details about his talks, Jackie does everything to showcase her support for her partner. From what we can tell, Steve seemingly has a daughter named Jenny from a previous relationship. However, not much is known about her. For the uninitiated, Steve is also a huge animal lover and got his first pet in 1997. Losing a pet leaves a huge void in the lives of pet parents and sadly, Steve and Jackie had to experience that pain and grief when their beloved cat, Lucy, crossed over the rainbow bridge in August 2024. \u201cWe will never forget you. You were a huge part of our family. We will meet again one day,\u201d wrote Jackie announcing Lucy\u2019s departure from this world. Though they\u2019ll always miss Lucy, Steve and Jackie are grateful they got to create so many beautiful memories with her.\n\nWhen Steve is not investing his time in furthering his passion, the paranormal specialist enjoys spending time with his family and friends. Even today, he continues to impart all the knowledge he has gathered from his decades of extensive research with the world by setting up meetings and talks every now and then. He also keeps his admirers updated and captivated by sharing his insights on a regular basis on his YouTube channel. Apart from spending time with the love of his life, Jackie, and embarking on trips with her, Steve also looks forward to hanging out with his friends.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

Learn More\n\nAs the generative AI continues to progress, having a simple chatbot may no longer be enough for many enterprises.\n\nCloud hyperscalers are racing to build up their databases and tools to help enterprises deploy operational data quickly and efficiently, letting them build applications that are both intelligent and contextually aware.\n\nCase in point: Google Cloud\u2019s recent barrage of updates for multiple database offerings, starting with AlloyDB.\n\nAccording to a blog post from the company, the fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible database now supports ScaNN (scalable nearest neighbor) vector index in general availability. The technology powers its Search and YouTube services and paves the way for faster index creation and vector queries while consuming far less memory.\n\nIn addition, the company also announced a partnership with Aiven for the managed deployment of AlloyDB as well as updates for Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase.\n\nUnderstanding the value of ScaNN for AlloyDB\n\nVector databases are critical to power advanced AI workloads, right from RAG chatbots to recommender systems.\n\nAt the heart of these systems sit key capabilities like storing and managing vector embeddings (numerical representation of data) and conducting similarity searches needed for the targeted applications.\n\nAs most developers in the world prefer PostgreSQL as the go-to operational database, its extension for vector search, pgvector, has become highly popular. Google Cloud already supports it on AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, with a state-of-the-art graph-based algorithm called Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) handling vector jobs.\n\nHowever, on occasions where the vector workload is too large, the performance of the algorithm may decline, leading to application latencies and high memory usage.\n\nTo address this, Google Cloud is making ScaNN vector index in AlloyDB generally available. This new index uses the same technology that powers Google Search and YouTube to deliver up to four times faster vector queries and up to eight-fold faster index build times, with a 3-4x smaller memory footprint than the HNSW index in standard PostgreSQL.\n\n\u201cThe ScaNN index is the first PostgreSQL-compatible index that can scale to support more than one billion vectors while maintaining state-of-the-art query performance \u2014 enabling high-performance workloads for every enterprise,\u201d Andi Gutmans, the GM and VP of engineering for Databases at Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGutmans also announced a partnership with Aiven to make AlloyDB Omni, the downloadable edition of AlloyDB, available as a managed service that runs anywhere, including on-premises or on the cloud.\n\n\u201cYou can now run transactional, analytical, and vector workloads across clouds on a single platform, and easily get started building gen AI applications, also on any cloud. This is the first partnership that adds an administration and management layer for AlloyDB Omni,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase?\n\nIn addition to AlloyDB, Google Cloud announced enhancements for Memorystore for Valkey, the fully managed cluster for the Valkey in-memory database, and the Firebase application development platform.\n\nFor the Valkey offering, the company said it is adding vector search capabilities. Gutmans noted that a single Memorystore for Valkey instance can now perform similarity search at single-digit millisecond latency on over a billion vectors, with more than 99% recall.\n\nHe also added that the next version of Memorystore for Valkey, 8.0, is now in public preview with 2x faster querying speed as compared to Memorystore for Redist Cluster, a new replication scheme, networking enhancements and detailed visibility into performance and resource usage.\n\nAs for Firebase, Google Cloud is adding Data Connect, a new backend-as-a-service that will be integrated with a fully managed PostgreSQL database powered by Cloud SQL. It will go into public preview later this year.\n\nWith these developments, Google Cloud hopes developers will have a broader selection of infrastructure and database capabilities \u2014 along with powerful language models \u2013 to build intelligent applications for their organizations. It remains to be seen how these new advancements are deployed to real use cases, but the general trend indicates the volume of gen AI applications is expected to soar significantly.\n\nOmdia estimates that the market for generative AI applications will grow from $6.2 billion in 2023 to $58.5 billion in 2028, marking a CAGR of 56%."

However, the episode also acquaints them with various other professionals in the field of the paranormal and the unknown, such as Barry Fitzgerald. As he talks about his views on the subject, questions about his whereabouts arise in the minds of the viewers.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald\u2019s Expertise in the Field of Paranormal Has Allowed Him to Explore Other Avenues\n\nBorn in 1972 in the city of Lisburn in Northern Ireland, Barry Fitzgerald allegedly experienced supernatural occurrences in his early days, leading him to form an interest in the unknown. After completing his education, he reportedly worked at the Southern Education and Library Board as the warden. Given his affinity towards the paranormal, he got into the field of paranormal research and worked for a couple of paranormal groups in Northern Ireland. With more than thirty years of experience as a paranormal investigator, he has encountered all kinds of cases, including ancient tombs, myths, hidden spiritual doorways, and legends.\n\nMoreover, Barry has been featured on several TV shows over the years, including \u2018Destination Truth,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Hunters,\u2019 and SyFy\u2019s \u2018Ghost Hunters International.\u2019 In 2016, rumors about him disappearing during his search for a Neolithic doorway to another world were spread. However, he denied these to be true when he featured on the podcast \u2018Stirring the Cauldron.\u2019 Thanks to his expertise in the field, he started writing books based on the paranormal and the unknown, such as \u2018The Influence,\u2019 \u2018Banshee,\u2019 \u2018Searching the Sidhe,\u2019 and \u2018The Mist of Gods.\u2019 He has also co-authored a book with Brian Allan \u2014 \u2018The Deception Of Gods And Men.\u2019\n\nGiven his experience as a television personality, Barry Fitzgerald co-hosts \u2018Project Doorway\u2019 with Steve Mera, another renowned paranormal investigator. When he is not busy with that, he spends his time researching new investigative techniques. The paranormal investigator also has other hobbies, like cooking. In February 2024, he traveled to Albert Halls Bolton in Manchester to attend the Awakenings event, where the attendees discussed the dark side of ufology.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald and His Loving Wife Are Proud Dog Parents\n\nFrom what we can tell, Barry Fitzgerald knows how to strike a balance between his personal and professional life. He shares a great bond with his loving wife, Donna, and is committed to nurturing the fulfilling life they have built together in the quaint town of Sligo in the northern part of Ireland. The duo loves to embark on trips across the globe to feast their eyes on stunning landscapes and have amazing experiences. When they\u2019re back home, they often stop by their local pub to sip on a large glass of cold Guinness and share some laughs with friends. Even after so many years of being together, Donna and Barry still appear to be deeply in love with each other. They haven\u2019t welcomed any kids of their own into the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean their love for their furry babies isn\u2019t unconditional.\n\nAn avid animal lover and a dog dad, Barry went on multiple adventures with his snowy white baby, Max, for several years until his passing. The \u201cmystery legend seeker\u201d passed into the land of rainbows a few years ago, leaving a giant hole in the hearts of the pair. Though one can\u2019t truly move on from the loss of a dear one, in a post he shared in January 2024, Barry revealed that he has found a companion as precious as Max to accompany him on his adventures. Alongside an adorable picture of his furry baby, Barry wrote, \u201cMeena has crept into the hole left by Max, I\u2019ll be forever broken by his death but Meena is a ball of life and mischief to keep me distracted.\u201d The heartwarming caption is a testament to his love for Meena and how she has impacted his life.\n\nBarry\u2019s love for canines runs so deep that he doesn\u2019t hesitate to show up for them in any part of the world if needed. In fact, he flew to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in March 2024 to attend Pawtographs Parafest 5, a paranormal convention held by Pawtographs for Pooches to raise money for a local animal shelter. Interestingly, exploring the realm of the paranormal to unearth new claims is not the only thing that sparks joy in Barry Fitzgerald\u2019s life. Aside from the purported elements of the unknown, nature\u2019s beautiful gifts also pique the interest of the paranormal investigator, and he regularly shares his findings with the world via his social media profiles. Accompanying him on his escapades in the peaceful embrace of nature is, of course, his baby, Meena.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

In order to put his abilities to the test, Paranormal Specialist Steve Mera joined Don on numerous of his paranormal projects and claimed that he witnessed his conversations with the spirit on the recording device. Despite Don being the focal point of the majority of the episode, Steve still manages to invoke several questions in the minds of the viewers.\n\nSteve Mera Has Accomplished a Lot in the Field of UFOs and Paranormal\n\nThe subject of UFOs and the Paranormal has fascinated Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera from his early childhood, so much so that he ended up making a career out of it. However, before he made a name for himself in the community, he earned a degree in Electrical Engineering from North Trafford College and GEC Electrical after passing out from Wellington Boys Secondary School. Meanwhile, he ensured that he gave some time to his passion and carried out consistent research on UFOs and the Paranormal, which would prove to be vital in his future. By 1989, his efforts got him a job at NATO as a Telecommunications Officer before working at MAPIT (Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team) and BUFORA (British UFO Research Association).\n\nA few years later, Steve created the BITC (British Investigators Training Course) in Anomalous Phenomena, which turned out to be a huge success across the United Kingdom. The 1990s were quite productive in his professional career as he reformed MAPIT and helped in the launch of MARA (Merseyside Anomalies Research Association) and NUFORA (The National UFO Research Association). Around 1996, he also launched the SEP (Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology) and worked in the para-psychological departments. By 1998, he had completed the Pre-Degree Psychology at South Trafford College, Manchester, and the BSY Parapsychology Course. He has also worked with Parkway Green Housing Association and Zohar Entertainment Group as a UAP Geological Research and Paranormal Specialist.\n\nIn 2017, he also co-founded ONSTELLAR. Steve also earned his degree in Human Behavioral Psychology from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Steve has also been a part of more than 90 TV shows and radio stations throughout his career, thanks to his expertise in the field of UFOs and the Paranormal. Not only that, he has worked with more than 300 different publications across the world and written for numerous TV shows. Some of the shows he has worked on are \u2018Conspiracy Corner,\u2019 \u2018The X-Files,\u2019 \u2018The Late Night Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018The Scream Team,\u2019 \u2018The Great Unexplained Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018UFO Hunters,\u2019 The Afterlife,\u2019 and more. As for the magazines that have featured his articles, some of them are \u2018UFO Review,\u2019 \u2018UFO News UK,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Voices,\u2019 \u2018Naro Minded,\u2019 \u2018Fate,\u2019 \u2018UFO Magazine,\u2019 \u2018Alien Encounters,\u2019 \u2018Sightings,\u2019 and many more.\n\nWhile he is currently handling his responsibilities as the owner and editor of Phenomena Magazine, Steve also stays busy with running MAPIT and SEP. Having written three books \u2014 \u2018The A-Z of the Unknown,\u2019 \u2018Strange Happenings: Memoirs of a Paranormal Investigator,\u2019 and \u2018Paranormal Insight: A Concise Study of the Strange and Profound\u2019 \u2014 the Paranormal Specialist is also reportedly working on a couple of new books, which would revolve around the UFO Phenomena. On September 30, 2024, he conducted a Birmingham UFO Group meeting at the Hot Shots Snooker Club function room at 100 Crosswells Road in Oldbury, Birmingham. In the same month, Steve also featured as a guest in a podcast called \u2018Paranormal Pendle.\u2019\n\nSteve Mera is Also a Dedicated Partner and Friend\n\nOriginally from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, England, Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera leads a content life on the personal front. After all, he has been navigating life\u2019s ups and downs with his one true love, Jackie Heighway, for over a decade now. Though neither of the two has shared when they fell in love, we know that their paths crossed in 2011 in Bolton, and it was in the same year, on November 28, that they turned their fondness for each other into a full-fledged relationship. Together, the two have seemingly built a beautiful world of their own in Greater Manchester, UK, with trust, care, understanding, and loads of love. Jackie is a Salford native who has been self-employed since 2018. Steve has her biggest cheerleader in Jackie, who makes sure she has his back every step of the way.\n\nWhether it is accompanying Steve on his research trips or sharing details about his talks, Jackie does everything to showcase her support for her partner. From what we can tell, Steve seemingly has a daughter named Jenny from a previous relationship. However, not much is known about her. For the uninitiated, Steve is also a huge animal lover and got his first pet in 1997. Losing a pet leaves a huge void in the lives of pet parents and sadly, Steve and Jackie had to experience that pain and grief when their beloved cat, Lucy, crossed over the rainbow bridge in August 2024. \u201cWe will never forget you. You were a huge part of our family. We will meet again one day,\u201d wrote Jackie announcing Lucy\u2019s departure from this world. Though they\u2019ll always miss Lucy, Steve and Jackie are grateful they got to create so many beautiful memories with her.\n\nWhen Steve is not investing his time in furthering his passion, the paranormal specialist enjoys spending time with his family and friends. Even today, he continues to impart all the knowledge he has gathered from his decades of extensive research with the world by setting up meetings and talks every now and then. He also keeps his admirers updated and captivated by sharing his insights on a regular basis on his YouTube channel. Apart from spending time with the love of his life, Jackie, and embarking on trips with her, Steve also looks forward to hanging out with his friends.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA student's drawing and theory of how a Portuguese Moth Fly was found in their Australian schoolyard. Credit: CSIRO\n\nMore than 60% of Australia's known insects are unnamed and a mystery to science. Of an estimated 500,000 Australian species, roughly half are insects, but many aren't categorized.\n\nA group of sharp-eyed school students from Queensland is changing that. With the guidance of their dedicated teachers and enthusiastic experts, they've helped lift the lid on the secrets of two more insect species.\n\nThe Year 4 students from Yeronga State expected to find various insects in their Malaise insect trap. A tiny fly, first identified in a botanical garden in Portugal and unrecorded in Australia, was not one of them.\n\nExpert analysis found that some of the fly's DNA sequences were nearly identical to a moth fly species, Alepia viatrix. They sent specimens to Germany for testing, where scientists confirmed the fly's Alepia viatrix identity. It was far from home.\n\nThe students sketched and labeled the insect, and discussed their theories of how this fly came to be in their backyard. Popular theories included it swimming the distance, stowing away on a shipping container, or attempting world domination.\n\nThis work became part of a paper published in the journal Check List. The authors suggest the fly likely made its 18,000-km journey to Australia by hitchhiking in a bromeliad.\n\nFortunately, experts expect the fly to be harmless for Australia's environment. Its discovery highlights the importance of community involvement and citizen science.\n\nTaking the sting out of armyworm invasion\n\nMore recently, students from Yeronga and five other schools each collected a new wasp species in their Malaise traps. The discovered wasp is a natural enemy to the fall armyworm, a destructive cereal crop pest that entered Australian agriculture in 2020.\n\nBecause their wasp was unnamed and undescribed, students got to workshop potential names for the newly recognized species. Researchers credit the students and described the shared naming process in a journal article published in Austral Entomology.\n\nThe students' wasp discoveries and information gathered will be useful to the Queensland Government's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Knowing the wasps' locations will assist scientists researching solutions to armyworm population control, aiding Australian agriculturalists and farmers.\n\nOpening doors to science\n\nThe learning opportunities came from a partnership between teacher Clare Triggell from Yeronga State School and entomologist Dr. Andy Howe from the University of the Sunshine Coast. Thanks to their collaboration, students got a unique chance to learn about insect taxonomy, biodiversity, conservation and biosecurity.\n\nTriggell and Howe have been working as partners for more than three years through our STEM Professionals in Schools program. The initiative pairs Australian teachers with science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) professionals, connecting curriculum and real-life industry and research.\n\nDr. Howe helped make learning activities even more meaningful by basing some exercises on the citizen science projects of Insect Investigators. This school-based program teams up scientists with schools to discover, document and describe Australia's biodiversity. Through the program, Yeronga State School students have joined other emerging scientists around Australia. Together, they've named 17 new insect species and documented 5,000 species using DNA.\n\nThe Australian Museum celebrated Insect Investigators' efforts with a Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science in 2024. Dr. Howe says the enthusiasm of all the teachers and students involved drove the Eureka's shared achievement.\n\n\"Working with Clare is wonderful. She eagerly facilitates hands-on learning and has taught me how it works best in schools,\" Dr. Howe says.\n\n\"The partnerships to increase teacher capability, as well as the students, in a new STEM area, and I've seen that here. Last year, teachers ran their own insect trapping and monitoring exercise with minimal input from me. I can't wait to learn what they discover next.\"\n\nMore information: Santiago Jaume-Schinkel et al, The hitchhiker's guide to Australia: the 18,000-km-long journey of Alepia viatrix Jaume-Schinkel, Kvifte, Weele & Mengual, 2022 (Diptera, Psychodidae) discovered through citizen science, Check List (2023).

The vast majority of yachts rely on dirty energy for power and to supply the massive amounts of electricity they consume. Some superyachts, The Guardian reported, emit more planet-overheating air pollution per year by themselves than many small countries.\n\nSocial scientist Gregory Salle labeled superyachts a form of \"ecocide\" in his book, Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Superyachts, Salle wrote, display, \"the capacity of the wealthiest individuals to exonerate themselves from the social and environmental cost of their activities and behaviours.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the yacht that took Maroni to Svalbard was not a superyacht but a regular yacht, meaning that it merely creates a large amount of planet-overheating air pollution instead of a mind-boggling amount of planet-overheating air pollution.\n\nThe positive to take away from the story is that more ocean research can be used to better protect our oceans \u2014 largely from the threats caused by the very pollution that yachts create every day.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

The app is already equipped with an AI assistant and is piloting an enterprise product offering.\n\n\"The battle for offline attention is the next big thing in consumer,\" Dunn told Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid a loneliness epidemic declared by US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and social-media users growing jaded with online life, startups like Posh (a sort of TikTok feed for events) and 222 (a way to meet strangers via dinners or events) have also raised venture capital this year with apps aiming to help people find friends.\n\nPie recently announced that it raised a $11.5 million Series A led by Forerunner Ventures' Kirsten Green. The round also included participation from Chicago-based fund Origin Ventures and Twitter cofounder Ev Williams. Its latest round puts Pie's total capital raised at $24 million, per the company.\n\nBuilding and growing an app for making friends\n\nLike many startups, Pie has had to pivot. It launched in 2020 as a friend matchmaking app, akin to a Bumble Friends experience.\n\n\"We got a lot of matching, a lot of profile browse, but no one would reach out to the other person,\" Dunn said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter reading Dr. Marisa Fanco's book \"Platonic,\" Dunn said he went back to the drawing board. Scrolling through potential friends wasn't going to cut it \u2014 it had to be recurring group hangouts to help people meet and stay connected.\n\nWith a team of 10 Chicago-based staffers, Pie doubled down on building an IRL app and using the city as a testing ground.\n\n\"Chicago doesn't have the saturation of consumer apps you have in New York City, Los Angeles, or San Francisco,\" Dunn said.\n\nIn February and March, the startup began testing local, curated events, dubbed \"Pie Originals,\" in Chicago, such as a monthly silent book club or a bi-monthly \"Dudes Getting Pancakes\" hangout. Dunn credits the app's growth to this strategy. It hit 20,000 monthly active users in six months of testing the Pie Originals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal event creators, like Mary Doctor, who hosts a show-and-tell event for adults, have used Pie to gather people and make money.\n\n\"There's this whole creator economy of people who want to bring people together in person,\" Dunn added.\n\nWith its Series A capital, Pie is rolling out a creator fund for event hosts, which pays $5 to the creator for every RSVP to an event (all of which are free for attendees).\n\nThe startup plans to experiment with different monetization models, eyeing a potential freemium model that apps like Bumble and Hinge have opted for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is venture-backed startups,\" Dunn said, adding that by the time of Pie's Series B, it will have a monetization engine locked down. \"You have costs, and then you figure out revenues later.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dunn is betting on Pie's Gen-Z staff and the app's user growth, which stands at 40% month-over-month.\n\nRead the 31-page pitch deck that Andy Dunn used to raise Pie's Series A:\n\nNote: Pie has redacted details and amended some pages so that the document could be shared externally."

        "article_content": "The occasional risks associated with downloading beta releases have been highlighted by Apple\u2019s decision on Wednesday to pull the watchOS 11.1 beta 3 update following user reports that it had bricked their Apple Watch. The company took the decision just hours after releasing it to developers for testing.\n\nA MacRumors reporter noted the development in a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that Apple had pulled watchOS 11.1 beta 3 update after users on various online forums started complaining about their watches \u201clocking up\u201d until they were rebooted, though in some cases even rebooting was met with limited success.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA comment spotted on Reddit by 9to5Mac said that after installing the beta software, their Apple Watch was \u201ccompletely locking up every single boot.\u201d It continued: \u201cI hold the side button and crown to restart it, it reboots, and not even a minute later is completely frozen. Time won\u2019t update, nothing. It happened right when someone had text me and it\u2019s nonstop since. It\u2019s currently locked up for the 7th time and it just started 15 minutes ago.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first device to experience problems with new Apple software. The company recently pulled HomePod Software 18.1 beta 2 over bricking concerns, and even paused access to iPadOS 18.0 (which wasn\u2019t a beta but a full public release) for M4 iPad Pros following similar bricking reports.\n\nThe latest development is a reminder to always tread carefully when it comes to downloading beta software, regardless of whether it\u2019s from Apple. While the Apple Watch beta is for developers to test, Apple often releases a public beta prior to a full public release, and even these will likely have some disruptive bugs.\n\nThe general advice is to avoid installing beta software on a device that you rely on for daily use. Indeed, on its website, Apple reminds folks that beta software often contains bugs and the whole point of offering it as a download is so that it get can get feedback to squash those bugs.\n\n\u201cPlease note that since the beta software has not yet been commercially released by Apple, it may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not function as well as commercially released software,\u201d the company says, adding, \u201cWe strongly recommend installing on a secondary system or device, or on a secondary partition on your Mac.\u201d"
