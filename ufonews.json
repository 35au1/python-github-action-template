An eagle-eyed mariner was able to capture it on film - seemingly leaving the minds behind the new series at a loss.\n\nFootage filmed by an expedition commissioned by Netflix's Investigation Alien appears to show an unidentified flying aircraft descending into the English Channel\n\nThe brief clip appears to show an unidentified 'flying' object transforming into an unidentified 'submerged' object in real-time, experts said\n\n'[This was] with everybody sleeping, with the exception of our night watch guy,' underwater archaeologist Rory Kremer tells Knapp of the clip, which appears to an unidentified 'flying' object transforming into an unidentified 'submerged' object in real-time\n\n'Don't tell me it's going to go in the water,' Knapp says in response, as the orb descends.\n\n'I'll be damned,' he adds after it happens, showing real confusion.\n\nThe series' main investigator and narrator, Knapp proceeds to ask for Kremer's professional opinion.\n\nThe archaeologist with over 20 years of experience admits he is equally stumped, despite his crew being the ones to capture the clip,\n\n'So this is what it does when it thinks that nobody is watching?' Knapp asks before turning to Kremer. 'Have you ever seen anything like this?'\n\n'A willy peter flare is the only thing I know like that that will hang up in the air, but that's not a flare, because there's no smoke going off of it,' the archaeologist says, admitting he has no real answers - at least ones that involve human technology.\n\n'Look at that. It's under the water,' he goes on to exclaim, conceding to Knapp he does not know the craft's nature.\n\nUnderwater archaeologist Rory Kremer is seen speaking about the footage his crew caught off the Channel Islands with journalist and ufologist George Knapp, the series' main investigator\n\n'I don't got any answers - do you?' he asks - leaving Knapp to posit that it could be evidence of a subterranean base.\n\n'You think it's got a base down there?' Knapp asks his friend.\n\n'It could be. It could be.'\n\nThe two begin to speak about previous sightings in the region, which stretch back hundreds of years.\n\n'Archaeology is your thing,' Knapp asks Kremer at this point. 'What do you think?'\n\nKremer responds by pointing to the native tribes that once inhabited the region - and their tales of unknown objects flying.\n\n'All have oral histories of lights they cannot explain,' the expert said, telling Knapp how these sightings off the Channel Islands were 'usually attributed it to gods.'\n\n'It has gone on a long time,' he continued, before touting the clip's importance.\n\n'Archaeology is your thing,' Knapp asks Kremer at this point. 'What do you think?' Kremer responds by pointing to the native tribes that once inhabited the region - and their tales of unknown objects flying.\n\n'I think we really scratched the surface here. There could very well be something underwater.'\n\nKnapp, in a narration provided after the exchanged, agreed.\n\nPointing to previous reports of undersea anomalies seen skirting the skies as well, he accused the government of keeping similar evidence under wraps, despite them likely being extraterrestrial in natured.\n\n'I'm going to share this with some insiders I know [to] hopefully get more videos like this released to the public, to get to the bottom of what non human intelligence might be doing in our oceans,' Knapp said of the footage, which has yet to be released to the public.\n\n'This is not us. It's from somewhere else,' he maintained.\n\nThe video, meanwhile, does not show the unidentified craft exiting the water after seemingly lowering in.\n\nInvestigation Alien - a 'paranormal docuseries [where] renowned UFO reporter [Knapp] investigates new evidence, interviews an array of experts and meets with emerging witnesses who are finally willing to go on the record' - released Friday.\n\nIt's now streaming on Netflix."

One individual claimed to have witnessed strange lights over 100 times since mid-2020, many of which seemed to head toward the base.\n\nThese lights-described as red, green, or white-often moved erratically, hovered for extended periods, or displayed flashing patterns inconsistent with typical aircraft.\n\nIn one of the most unique reports, a witness detailed seeing an amber-orange, cube-shaped object that appeared \"playful\" and seemed to interact with the observer.\n\n\"They always seem to head towards Nellis [AFB],\" the witness noted, adding, \"I don't believe they are man-made.\"\n\nThe sightings near Nellis are not isolated. At Virginia's Joint Base Langley-Eustis, swarms of unidentified drones invaded restricted airspace nightly for nearly three weeks in December 2023.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck of NORAD described the phenomenon as unprecedented and urged the Pentagon to deploy advanced tools to investigate.\n\n\"We weren't prepared for the sheer volume of incursions,\" added General Gregory Guillot, VanHerck's successor, highlighting the rising frequency of such incidents across U.S. bases.\n\nAre These Drones or Something Beyond?\n\nWhile many attribute these sightings to advanced military technology or drones, the unexplained behavior of these objects has raised eyebrows.\n\nAlejandro Rojas, a UFO expert with Enigma Labs, explained, \"Given the proximity to experimental aircraft hubs like Area 51, these sightings are often linked to classified projects. But the erratic movements and prolonged hovering suggest something more.\"\n\nHowever, the U.S. military faces challenges in addressing these incidents. Legal and safety restrictions limit the use of anti-drone technology, such as lasers or signal jamming, over domestic airspace.\n\nAccording to Jason Mayes of NORTHCOM, balancing defensive measures with civilian safety remains a significant hurdle. As sightings increase, so does the urgency for transparency and scientific analysis.\n\n\"The Pentagon is scratching its head over these,\" Rojas said. \"Civilian reports and videos are essential for piecing together what's happening. Whether these objects are terrestrial or something entirely new, they deserve a closer look.\"\n\nWhile skepticism persists, the growing frequency of sightings near military sites ensures this mystery will remain a focal point for researchers and the public alike. The question lingers: Are we witnessing cutting-edge technology-or something far more enigmatic?"

Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.\n\nHuawei, at the centre of the US action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licences to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any licence that could aid Huawei\u2019s AI efforts would likely be denied.\n\nTSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters in October.\n\nReuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.\n\nThe latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the US to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.\n\nAs a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting on Nov 11, the person said.\n\nThe Commerce Department declined comment.\n\n\u201cTSMC has had regular discussions with the government on export control issues and has made it clear that it will comply with domestic and international regulations,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Economy Ministry said in a statement to Reuters, referring specific questions to TSMC.\n\nA spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying that it was a \u201claw-abiding company... committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls\u201d.\n\nThe Commerce Department communication \u2013 known as an \u201cis informed\u201d letter \u2013 allows the US to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.\n\nThe action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department\u2019s enforcement of them.\n\nIn 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA, to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.\n\nThe restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.\n\nThe US has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. Reuters reported in July that the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department\u2019s restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers and related companies.\n\nBut despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules have still not been issued.

This new standalone app, however, provides a more direct and integrated experience.\n\nOne of the most notable features of this standalone app is the inclusion of \u201cGemini Live,\u201d a voice-driven AI experience not yet available in the integrated version. Screenshots reveal Gemini Live in action, utilizing a Live Activity to remain active even when users switch to other apps. This suggests a more seamless and interactive AI experience on iPhones.\n\nWhile the app has only been sighted in the Philippines, its appearance suggests a broader rollout may be on the horizon. The dedicated app could allow Google to deliver faster updates and improvements to Gemini on iOS, potentially bringing it closer in functionality to the Android experience.\n\nThis move mirrors Google\u2019s approach with Google Assistant, which also exists as a standalone app on iOS. By separating Gemini from the main Google app, Google could provide a more focused and streamlined experience for iPhone users, further solidifying its presence in the competitive AI landscape."

The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond, according to newspaper reports from that time.\n\nThe Lindenmuths traveled about two hours from Ambler with other family members, to participate in the festival, which drew hundreds of people to Main Street. Most were decked out in fluorescent green, some with extra eyes or antennae sprouting from their heads.\n\nSome of those attending were simply out for an afternoon of fun with family, while others are true believers in UFOs and other supernatural phenomena.\n\nAdrian and Maria Johnson, of Kingston, were among the latter. Both are familiar with the history of UFO sightings, including the Roswell incident in 1947, which many believe was the crashing of a UFO near the town in New Mexico.\n\nAdrian Johnson pointed out President Harry Truman addressed the possibility of UFOs with reporters in the early 1950s.\n\n\u201cWe believe,\u201d said Maria Johnson.\n\nSasha Podunajec, of Waymart, attended the event with her mother Diane Gallagher, Moscow; and son Rowan, age 3.\n\nGallagher said the event was a great opportunity for Carbondale to celebrate its history and host a robust community event.\n\nCandace and Thomas Deblasio moved to the area recently and heard about the event at a senior presentation last week.\n\nThe two went \u201call out,\u201d with Thomas decked in a green inflatable costume and Candace in shimmering silver and slanted glasses.\n\n\u201cThese weren\u2019t our Halloween costumes; we bought them especially for today,\u201d Candace Deblasio said, laughing.\n\nChana Manarchuck was part of the committee that organized the event and said it exceeded expectations of planners.\n\n\u201cI think we should have it every year,\u201d she said. \u201cMy motto is \u2018bloom where you\u2019re planted.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTodd Pousley, of NeighborWorks, said the event provided the chance to chat with residents and visitors about their vision for Carbondale.\n\nIt was also an opportunity to encourage people to complete a survey aimed at documenting their suggestions for Carbondale for future projects.\n\nBradford May, part of the event committee, said the event exceeded expectations.\n\nOriginally, when the event was scheduled for Nov. 9, there was a question about whether cold weather might interfere with attendees\u2019 enjoyment of the day.\n\nBut moderate temperatures and clear skies were the perfect setting for vendors who offered everything from good food to home goods and information.\n\nThe day included an immersive \u201cThe Russell Park Experience,\u201d with transportation to the park, which was sold out early in the day, as well as a citywide scavenger hunt and special speakers.\n\nIt concluded with an after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite featuring \u201cParanormal State\u201d star Heather Taddy."

It can be frightening for some and enticing for others.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about \u201cstigmatized properties,\u201d which the National Association of Realtors describes as being \u201cpsychologically impacted by events such as murder, suicide, alleged hauntings or [a] notorious previous owner.\u201d It might also include homes known for criminal activity. A natural death can sometimes create a stigma as well.\n\nDon't miss\n\nAccredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger \u2014 and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here\u2019s how\n\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year\n\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nIf there are whispers between neighbors of a home for sale that\u2019s host to the paranormal, or even if the owner died recently, it can place sellers in the tricky situation of whether or not they\u2019re required to disclose such details to prospective buyers. That\u2019s not always the case \u2014 we\u2019ll explain below \u2014 but word of mouth might be enough to affect sales prospects.\n\nHere\u2019s how to handle a stigmatized property sale if you land in a similar situation.\n\nWhat sellers need to know\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how a haunting can be confirmed, but according to an analysis by Zillow, four U.S. states have real estate disclosure laws that mention paranormal activity.\n\nNew York courts can rescind a home sale if the owner previously established a reputation that the house was haunted and then sold it to an unwitting buyer. Similarly, in New Jersey, a seller must disclose \u201ca property purportedly being haunted\u201d if asked by the buyer. Massachusetts and Minnesota, on the other hand, simply mention paranormal or supernatural activity as a \u201cpsychologically affected\u201d attribute that doesn\u2019t require disclosure.\n\nThe disturbing news of a death in a home can give some potential buyers the jitters, and eight states have laws that compel sellers to disclose a death on the property, per the analysis.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nCalifornian sellers must disclose a death on the property, natural or otherwise, within three years, per the analysis. In Alaska, a murder or suicide within one year must be disclosed. In South Dakota, a seller must disclose if a homicide or suicide occurred on the property. In New Hampshire, a homicide or suicide on the property must be disclosed if asked. Georgia and New Jersey sellers must disclose any deaths if asked.\n\nStory Continues"

        "article_content": "Hyderabad: Come December, unlike in any other State in the country or in the world, Telangana will be the first state in India that officially treats Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims in general under the caste category.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that the State government has initiated a comprehensive door-to-door household survey covering the \u201csocio-economic, educational, employment, political, and caste\u2019 status of the people in the entire State. The State government said the survey is meant to plan and implement various socio-economic, educational, employment and political opportunities \u201cfor the amelioration of Backward Classes, SC and ST citizens of the state and other weaker sections of the state.\u201d\n\nThe instructional manual given to the enumerators gave them a tough time, not knowing that the Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists fall under only the religious category or both the religious and caste categories.\n\nSpeaking to The Hans India, an enumerator from Malkajgiri said, \u201cIt is not known if it is an unintended mistake that rolled while printing in the instructional manual or there is an unspelt reason for the government.\u201d\n\nThe page-6 of the instructional manual given to the enumerators of the survey prescribes them to enter the codes of the religions as Hindu (01), Islam (02), Christian (03), Sikh (04), Bauddha (05) and Jain (06). However, there is no code given to the Parisis or people belonging to Zoroastrians, who are the minuscule minority of the country grouped under the others category (00). This is in-gross negligence of not recognising their contribution to different fields, the country\u2019s economy, and charitable activities for centuries deserves no religious code other than the others category.\n\nA separate code number-085 is allocated for the BC-E category, falling under the Scheduled Castes converted to Christianity and their progeny.\n\nSimilarly, the BC-E category is given codes from 121 to 134. This is to cover various sub-castes of people of the religious denomination Muslims.\n\nHowever, page 46 springs a surprise with its Anexory-D of \u2018Other Castes\u201d.\n\nUnder the new category, besides the mentioned several castes considered as \u2018OCs\u2019 of the Hindu fold, there are separate codes given to different religions. This includes: the castes code for Buddhists-003, Christians (other than BC-C)- caste code-004,Jains caste code-005,\n\nMuslims (Other than BC-E) caste code-013, Sikhs caste code-016, and other religions caste code-000. However, Hindus have only been given a religious code and are not mentioned in the \u201cOther Castes\u201d category under the Anexory-D of the instructional manual of the survey."

        "article_content": "One of the most anticipated new smartphones has been announced: the OnePlus 13. This device will eventually replace the highly regarded OnePlus 12, one of the year\u2019s top phones. How do these two models compare? If you own a OnePlus 12, should you consider upgrading to the newer version? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: specs\n\nOnePlus 13 OnePlus 12 Size 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5 mm 164.3 x 75.8 x 9.2 mm (6.47 x 2.98 x 0.36 inches) Weight 210 grams 220 grams (7.76 ounces) Screen size and resolution 6.8-inch 1440p OLED with 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate 3168 x 1440 pixels at 510 pixels per inch 800 nits typical, 4,500 nits peak 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED (Dynamic 1-120Hz) 3168 x 1440 resolution at 510 pixels per inch 600 nits typical, 4,500 nits peak Operating system Android with OxygenOS Android with OxygenOS Storage 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB 256GB, 512GB Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 RAM 12GB, 16GB, or 24GB 12GB or 16GB Cameras 50-megapixel main 50MP ultrawide 50MP 2X zoom Front: 32MP Rear: 50MP primary, 48MP ultrawide, and 64MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom Front: 32MP Water resistance IP69 IP65 Battery 6,000mAh Fast charging 100W (TBA in the U.S.) Fast wireless charging (50W) Reverse wireless charging (10W) 5,400mAh Fast charging 100W (80W in the U.S.) Fast wireless charging (50W) Reverse wireless charging (10W) Colors White Dawn, Blue Moments, Obsidian Black Flowy Emerald, Silky Black Price TBA worldwide From $800 Review To be released OnePlus 12\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: design and display\n\nOnePlus is recognized for its innovative phone designs, evident in the OnePlus 13. While the new phone maintains the distinctive OnePlus identity, it introduces several noteworthy differences compared to the previous model. One significant change is the phone\u2019s flat sides, reminiscent of the Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy phones, and Google Pixel. This design contrasts with the OnePlus 12, which features curved sides, potentially offering improved grip. Additionally, the OnePlus 13 boasts a slightly slimmer and lighter body, and its IP69 rating indicates enhanced resistance to water and dust.\n\nThe differences in display between the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 are subtle but noteworthy. Both phones feature a 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a sharp 1440p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering vibrant colors and deep blacks.\n\nOne key improvement in the OnePlus 13 is its typical brightness, which reaches 800 nits, compared to 600 nits on the OnePlus 12. Additionally, the OnePlus 13 utilizes the newer BOE X2 OLED panel technology, promising enhanced visual quality. However, both models maintain the same peak brightness of 4,500 nits.\n\nRegarding protection, the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 are equipped with Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The OnePlus 13 also features an additional \u201ccrystal shield super-ceramic glass layer.\u201d\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: performance\n\nIt will be a while before we can try the OnePlus 13, but the specifications indicate that it will offer a significant performance boost over its predecessor.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the OnePlus 12. This updated chipset has an Adreno GPU, which promises smoother gaming and faster graphics.\n\nEarly benchmarks from AnTuTu show that the OnePlus 13 delivers 58% better overall performance, while GeekBench 6 indicates a 36% improvement in single-core performance. This improvement should result in noticeable enhancements for everyday tasks and general usage.\n\nThe question remains: how much better performance can we expect on the new phone? The OnePlus 12 already demonstrated impressive capabilities during daily tasks such as checking email, browsing social media, and watching videos. With its dual cryo-velocity cooling system, it also excelled in handling graphically intensive gaming sessions without any issues. We can likely anticipate similar performance from the OnePlus 13, with even greater enhancements expected for the models equipped with 24GB of RAM.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: battery and charging\n\nAnother noticeable change made on the OnePlus 13 is its larger battery. Where the OnePlus 12 includes a 5,400mAh battery, the one on the OnePlus 13 is 6,000mAh. The larger battery capacity is thanks to silicon-carbon battery technology that allows for more energy storage in a smaller space. This should mean longer battery life, although that depends on what you\u2019re doing.\n\nDepending on your display settings and usage, the OnePlus 12 can probably last up to two full days on a single charge. When more intensive tasks are added to the mix, that drops to around a day of use between charges.\n\nThe OnePlus 13\u2019s larger battery capacity should allow it to outperform its successor, offering improved performance in demanding tasks, potentially better longevity since the battery will undergo fewer charging cycles, and more. Again, it\u2019s a little bit too early to determine just how much the improvements will be.\n\nOne area where you won\u2019t see a difference between the two phones is when it comes to actual charging. OnePlus did not enhance the charging speeds for wired or wireless charging. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 13 supports 100W fast charging, 50W wireless charging, and reverse charging up to 10W. The OnePlus 12 was restricted to 80W charging speeds in the U.S. though, and it remains to be seen whether the OnePlus 13 echoes this limitation.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: cameras\n\nHistorically, the camera systems on OnePlus phones have been sound but often ranked below those of industry leaders like Samsung and Google. This trend began to shift in recent years, particularly following the company\u2019s strategic partnership with Hasselblad, which kicked off with the OnePlus 9 series. This collaboration aimed to elevate OnePlus\u2019 photographic capabilities by leveraging Hasselblad\u2019s expertise in color science and imaging technology. As a result, each subsequent release has demonstrated consistent improvements in camera performance and overall imaging quality.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 features an impressive triple-camera setup, each boasting a high-resolution 50-megapixel sensor. At its core is a state-of-the-art 50MP primary sensor from Sony, known for its exceptional light-gathering abilities and sharp image reproduction. Complementing this is a 50MP ultrawide sensor, which offers a remarkable 120-degree field of view, allowing users to capture expansive landscapes and group photos without compromising on detail. Finally, the setup includes a 50MP telephoto lens that provides 3x optical zoom, enabling users to get closer to their subjects without losing image fidelity.\n\nThese enhancements not only contribute to a broader field of view but are also geared toward improving image quality in various lighting conditions, especially low-light scenarios, thanks to advanced sensor technologies and algorithms that enhance dynamic range and reduce noise.\n\nActual testing will be crucial in determining just how much better the camera experience is on the OnePlus 13 compared to its predecessor, which already had an impressive camera setup.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: software and updates\n\nThe OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 both operate on OxygenOS, OnePlus\u2019 custom Android interface. However, their software and update policies differ significantly.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 comes with OxygenOS 15, based on Android 15, meaning you will have access to the latest Android features and security updates right from the start. In contrast, the OnePlus 12 requires an upgrade to obtain the same features.\n\nA major distinction lies in software support. OnePlus guarantees four major Android updates and five years of security updates for the OnePlus 13. In comparison, the OnePlus 12 is supported with three major Android updates and four years of security updates.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: price and availability\n\nThe OnePlus 13 will launch first in China, with a worldwide release likely to begin at the beginning of the year. The phone is expected to start at $799 in the U.S., which is similar to the OnePlus 12\u2019s launch price. However, this hasn\u2019t been confirmed. The phone comes in White-Dawn, Blue Moments, and Obsidian Black.\n\nThis year\u2019s phone has 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage and 12GB, 16GB, or 24GB of RAM, respectively. The OnePlus 12 has 256GB or 512GB of storage and 12GB or 16GB of RAM. It is available in Silky Black and the now iconic Flowy Emerald.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: Is it worth the upgrade?\n\nThe OnePlus 12 is an outstanding smartphone that current owners can enjoy for many years due to its powerful performance and robust features. With its sleek design, high-resolution display, and impressive camera capabilities, the OnePlus 12 meets the needs of a wide range of users, from casual consumers to tech enthusiasts.\n\nWhether to upgrade to the OnePlus 13 depends largely on your preferences and priorities. If you value having the latest chipset \u2014 such as a more advanced Snapdragon processor \u2014 along with ever-improving battery life and cutting-edge camera systems, then the OnePlus 13 is a compelling upgrade. The new model promises enhancements in processing power and efficiency and offers features like upgraded night mode photography and advanced computational photography, which could significantly enhance your photography experience. Additionally, it features a fresh design that brings a modern aesthetic to the table.\n\nHowever, if you typically do not upgrade your phone yearly, waiting this time might be perfectly reasonable. While you may not have the best-performing OnePlus available on the market, and the camera system will not be as advanced as the new model, the differences between the OnePlus 12 and 13 are mostly incremental. The OnePlus 12 still excels in everyday tasks, gaming, and multitasking, and its functionality remains top-notch. Therefore, while the upgrades are excellent and can enhance user experience, they are optional for everyone. If your OnePlus 12 meets your needs and performs well, holding off on an upgrade might be your best option."

        "article_content": "Widely-liked open source group OpenUK this week detailed more of its State of Open: The UK In 2024 analysis.\n\nAs the non-profit organisation representing the UK\u2019s open technology sector, OpenUK says that it has looked at the factors in any given industry market that shape the success of open source. It has also concentrated on analysing what enables community development around open source public sector releases and the role of procurement in successful development work.\n\nThe report covers the UK\u2019s current position in the global open source marketplace \u2013 after many years leading the European contribution to open source software in general, that position is now under threat.\n\nWhy so?\n\nBecause governments in France and Germany have expanded their investment and support for open source software development and contributions in recent times.\n\n\u201cThe UK has contributed a huge amount to the technologies and infrastructure that underpin today\u2019s economy. But markets do not stand still \u2013 other countries in Europe have increased their level of investment and incentives, putting the UK\u2019s leadership position in jeopardy in future,\u201d explained Amanda Brock, CEO at OpenUK.\n\nBrock says that in this year\u2019s report, the organisations details the considerations to be dealt with for the new UK government to support open source more effectively generating better returns on investment from any new projects, whether those are public sector organisations using open source or releasing new software as open source for others to use and importantly ensuring its adoption and maintenance.\n\nThis, she says, is particularly vital for public sector AI developments that aim to deliver on digital public good goals.\u201d\n\nGovernance & regulatory understanding Dr. Jennifer Barth, research director at OpenUK and founder of Symmetry thinks that as open source software reshapes industries, it also presents challenges that require careful governance and regulatory understanding. \u201cUnlike proprietary software, open source software operates through open licensing, decentralised contribution and community-driven management, which can create complexity in legal and operational standards,\u201d said Barth. \u201cSuccessful open source software adoption is contingent on comprehending the interplay of governance, technology, and community. For legislators and market participants alike, a nuanced understanding of open source software is essential, as this ecosystem relies on transparency, the protection of intellectual property, and an ethos of equitable use.\u201d"
