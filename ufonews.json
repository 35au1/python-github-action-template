For the day that aliens reveal themselves may very well become the beginning of the end of life on Earth as we know it!\u201d\n\nA flying saucer crashes deep in the mountains of Japan. Wary of the hyper-intelligent beings they find inside, the government hides from the public all news of the alien craft. But it's not the strange visitors themselves that they should be afraid of\u2015the real danger is the parasitic spores smuggled aboard! Will Earth survive the UFO MUSHROOM INVASION ?!\n\nOriginally published in 1976, Shirakawa Marina's UFO MUSHROOM INVASION is a masterpiece of sci-fi horror. Drawing on his deep knowledge of Japanese folklore and the supernatural, Shirakawa created one of manga history's cult classics and an unforgettably creepy entry in the canon of spore-horror. With an essay by weirdologist Udagawa Takeo, UFO MUSHROOM INVASION is the second volume of SMUDGE, a line of vintage horror, occult, and dark fantasy manga, curated and translated by award-winning historian Ryan Holmberg .\n\nUFO Mushroom Invasion has a story and art by Marina Shirakawa , with English translation by Ryan Holmberg . This volume was lettered by Ozzy van Eschen and Sean Michael Robinson . Published by Living the Line (September 17, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs It Worth Reading?\n\n2024 \u00a9 estate of Shirakawa Marina\n\nDo mushrooms make you uncomfortable? Is there something unpleasant about their odd shapes and strange, spongy texture? If the answer is yes, UFO Mushroom Invasion is the manga of your nightmares, because its plot involves alien fungi being brought to Earth in a flying saucer crash and taking over the world. People are colonized by the mushrooms, becoming human versions of insects infected by zombie fungus, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Even if mushrooms aren't the stuff of your nightmares, this is a genuinely unsettling book.\n\nIt's also an interestingly written one. The late Marina Shirakawa , who created manga during the 1970s and 80s, has a style that feels like a combination of Junji Ito , Kazuo Umezz, and Shigeru Mizuki , with creepy, stylized art and a penchant for breaking into folkloric tangents. The book combines traditional manga and illustrated story pages, with the latter covering the history of UFO sightings (primarily in Japan and the U.S.) and \u201cbizarre mushroom tales,\u201d which are retellings of various Japanese stories where mushrooms are the antagonists. It's odd but it does ultimately work, and I found myself enjoying the style mixing much more than anticipated \u2013 it creates an intimacy between author and reader that works to make the manga segments hit harder.\n\nThe science fiction/horror blend is in the classic vein of stories that predict that humans will become the authors of their own downfall. In this case, Professor White's greed to keep the information about an alien to himself allows the spores to spread; had he not silenced Aoki and Sado-sensei early on, the entire tragedy may have been at least partially preventable. But Shirakawa also leaves us room to wonder if maybe the mushrooms reclaiming the earth for nature isn't the best ending, anyway \u2013 it's an environmental message that makes a little bit of sense and one that you've probably seen before in the genre.\n\nAlongside the well-translated story, this also has an essay about Shirakawa's place in the mangaverse as well as a retrospective of some of his works, both of which are interesting and very readable. Fans of 1970s manga (this was published in 1976, set in 1978, which allowed his original readers to wonder if it could happen in two years) or horror shouldn't pass this by.\n\n2024 \u00a9 estate of Shirakawa Marina\n\nUFO Mushroom Invasion does exactly what it says on the tin. Mushrooms from a UFO invade. This isn't as daft as it sounds, and despite its age (it was originally published in 1976) and very dated art style, UFO Mushroom Invasion is genuinely unsettling and creepy. Author Marina Shirakawa intersperses his chapters with relevant factual titbits about biology and folklore that helps to build a sense of looming dread, of inescapable catastrophe.\n\nAoki and his teacher are mere ciphers, headstrong student and stoic teacher. We learn almost nothing about them, their function is to be generic everyman witnesses to extraordinary events. I can't help but compare the opening chapters to the cheesy 1950's movie version of The War of the Worlds , though we soon enter far darker, weirder territory.\n\nAnyone familiar with videogame/TV franchise The Last of Us will know how this goes \u2013 there's even a reference here to a Cordyceps-like fungus that controls its hosts, and the later appearance of fungal-infected zombie people, complete with mushrooms growing from their bodies.\n\nWhat's different about UFO Mushroom Invasion compared to its later equivalents is in its nilhilsm. Even The Last of Us contains a seed of hope for humanity, not so here. In one particularly powerful scene, Aoki is told by a mushroom-infected adult to give in to the fungal invaders, to surrender his body to the soil of the warm Earth. This is a dark fable, an early musing on the Dark Forest hypothesis recently popularised by Cixin Liu's Three Body Problem . If aliens really are out there, we don't want them to know about us, because the moment they do, all life on Earth will change (end)."

This means processing power is not solely concentrated in massive data centres. It is increasingly moving to the edge of the network: your laptop, in this case,\u201d says Mr Derek Chen, vice-president of Global Business and Marketing of Taiwanese computer maker MSI.\n\nWith AI, personal computers like laptops have evolved from being useful tools for work and play into smart assistants capable of boosting productivity, enhancing gaming experiences and unlocking creativity.\n\nHaving an AI-powered edge\n\nAI laptops are not your typical computers. Built to handle AI tasks efficiently, all of MSI\u2019s AI laptops come with a neural processing unit (NPU), a specialised chip dedicated solely to managing AI processes.\n\nWhile standard computers can run AI applications, they lack an NPU. This means that the computer\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) must juggle both routine computing tasks and AI ones. This can overload the system and lead to slower performance.\n\nOn AI laptops, the addition of an NPU works very much like giving the computer a \u201csecond brain\u201d. With the NPU dedicated to processing AI functions, the CPU is free to focus on everyday computing tasks.\n\nThanks to this \u201cdual brain\u201d setup, AI laptops can deliver complex AI functions quickly while giving users a faster and smoother computing experience at the same time."

Since Applovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nPositive sentiment is prevailing in the market after strong bank earnings and increasing hopes of a soft landing. Ryan Detrick, Carson Group chief market strategist, said while talking during a recent program on CNBC that he sees more runway for the current bull market.\n\n\u201cThis is a bull market. Now we\u2019re in the third year of a bull market. My friend Sam Stovall said once you get to 65 years old, the odds of getting to 85 are really, really high. Bull markets work that way. Going back 50 years, there\u2019s five other bull markets that made it into their third year, like this one is right now. The worst any of them went was another three years. A five-year total. The average was eight years. I\u2019m not saying we have another six years of a bull market but what we\u2019re saying is this is an economy that keeps surprising to the upside.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nHowever, the analyst said large-cap tech stocks are \u201cpricey.\u201d He believes small- and mid-cap stocks are cheap and labeled financials and industrials as fairly valued.\n\nThere are some top AI stocks that are seeing insider selling activity. In this article, we take a look at those stocks and analyze their fundamentals and market sentiment. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nInsiders Selling AppLovin (APP) Despite AI Growth Potential and Stock Surge\n\nA close-up of a mobile device, showing an advertiser reaching out to a consumer via a software-based platform.\n\nAppLovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 54\n\nOn September 12, 2024, AppLovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP) Corp CEO and Chairperson Arash Adam Foroughi sold 200,000 shares at $107.80 per share, reducing his ownership by 2% to 9,243,217 shares. The sale was valued at approximately $21.6 million. The stock is up 35% since then.\n\nAnkur Crawford, Alger executive VP, while talking to CNBC in a latest program said that in about 3 to 5 years AI is going to provide us with superhuman intelligence.\n\n\u201cAll of the CapEx being spent today is whole-heartedly justifiable because the opportunity to monetize that AI by that time is beyond what anyone has contemplated in the market so far.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnkur Crawford believes Applovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP) is one of the top underappreciated AI stocks.\n\nShe said that AppLovin is a gaming advertising platform.\n\n\u201cThey are using AI to basically make you download more games and they can monetize inventory better than anyone else can. They have 70% market share, and they are going into ecommerce as well. So, instead of serving you up a game, they will serve you up a product and monetize their inventory better than they were able to before,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nCrawford said Applovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP) is \u201cinteresting\u201d because their cost structure is already \u201cembedded.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor every dollar they get, they get a almost a 100% fall through on the margin line. So, massively cash-flow generative. The Street has $6 in earnings (estimate) in 2026,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) was another top contributor. The advertising technology platform, focused on mobile applications, reported strong earnings results in early May. Its AI-driven Axon 2.0 mobile advertising platform continues to produce strong returns for customers, which is leading to more than expected spending on the platform. Although the one-year anniversary of Axon 2.0\u2019s release occurs this year, the company is already working to expand beyond mobile applications with opportunities in e-commerce and connected television. We believe AppLovin\u2019s valuation, free cash flow, and leading market share remain attractive.\u201d\n\nOverall, APP ranks 9th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Insiders are Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Applovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "article_content": "The smartphone industry is banking on AI to reaccelerate device sales after years of slowing growth. But to do that, it\u2019ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) is aiming for its latest smartphone chips to do just that, adding a number of new on-board AI capabilities it says will allow you to do things like virtually adjust the lighting in your video calls in real-time and allow your device to recognize real-world objects without having to access the web.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm\u2019s latest top-of-the-line mobile processor and includes improved performance and power efficiency thanks to the company\u2019s use of what it calls Prime Cores, which are designed for high-end applications, and Performance Cores, for more casual tasks.\n\nQualcomm says the chips will make their way into smartphones from companies including Samsung, Xiaomi, ASUS, OnePlus, Honor, Oppo, and more in the coming weeks.\n\nThe chipmaker is promising some big performance gains from the Snapdragon 8 Elite, saying its central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) should save 44% and 40% more energy than its predecessor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen. 3, which Samsung used in its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones.\n\nBut the chip\u2019s biggest feature is its ability to power onboard AI functions. Qualcomm says the chip will allow for things like erasing unwanted objects in videos, rather than just photos, without having to upload your movie to the cloud for processing. Instead, your phone will be able to simply remove that person who walked into the background of your shot.\n\nPresident and CEO of Qualcomm Cristiano Amon delivers his keynote speech at Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 3, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nThe company also says OEM partners can use the NPU to expand photos beyond their borders by, for instance, increasing the background of a shot, and use the camera to interact with the world around you. For instance, you\u2019ll be able to point your phone at an object and ask the onboard voice assistant about objects in your shot without the need to connect to the web.\n\nQualcomm unveiled its first-generation Snapdragon X Elite in late 2023, and Microsoft (MSFT) eventually chose the processors for its Surface line of laptops and processors, debuting the new PCs in May this year.\n\nOnboard AI is the major common denominator between the two generations of chips. Qualcomm is working to ensure that users don\u2019t need an internet connection to use generative AI apps and services, which could prove to be a major differentiator for new smartphones and PCs versus their predecessors.\n\nBoth the PC and smartphone industries believe AI will be the next big feature to get consumers to upgrade their devices to newer systems in the coming months and years. Still, outfitting devices with the ability to run AI apps isn\u2019t going to get the vast majority of customers interested in spending a few hundred dollars on a new laptop or smartphone. The only thing that will do that are intriguing new apps that take advantage of AI.\n\nSure, more intelligent digital assistants are helpful, and improving photo and video capabilities is impressive, but there\u2019s still no single killer app or app category that\u2019s got people talking about wanting an AI device. My own friends and family are certainly interested in the marketing around AI products, but none of them, outside of a few early adopters and people who need the latest and greatest devices, are interested in paying up for AI just yet.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s still early in the consumer AI lifecycle, meaning there\u2019s plenty of time for a slick new app that takes advantage of AI to come along. And when it does, we\u2019ll finally get a sense of the appetite for AI-powered hardware.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "article_content": "BALTIMORE -- The Lord Baltimore Hotel is known for its historic charm, however, it has a reputation as one of the most haunted hotels in the country.\n\nThe hotel's paranormal activity has enticed skeptics and believers near and far.\n\nWJZ reporter Dennis Valera and photographer Cory Sellgren spent the night at the hotel to find out if the haunted stories are true.\n\nA ghostly history\n\nWhen you enter the hotel, the stories begin. Guests and staff have seen figures on the mezzanine above the lobby, also sitting in the LB Tavern.\n\n\"[People] mention the fact they're dressed out of fashion, period inappropriate clothing,\" said Vince Wilson, the hotel's entertainment producer. \"They'll point back over and those customers will disappear into nothing.\"\n\nWilson leads ghost tours at the hotel, as does the Mystical TeAnna, who co-owns the hotel's Poe's Magic Theatre.\n\nThey led Valera and Sellgren on a personal tour of some of the hotel's hotspots.\n\nOne of them was the Versailles room, a ballroom at the hotel. People have seen crystals on the chandeliers sway slightly back and forth, according to Wilson.\n\nPeople have also seen a couple dancing and they're believed to be the parents of Molly.\n\nWho is Molly?\n\nMolly is a spirit said to roam the hotel's halls. A painting of her hangs on the 19th floor, which is considered to be the hotel's most active floor.\n\nNo one has ever really seen her face, but people who have seen her say they've seen her dress or her shoes.\n\nShe's most notably known for playing with her ball.\n\nMore than 20 people are confirmed to have died by suicide by jumping off the 19th floor back when the stock market crashed, triggering the Great Depression.\n\nIt's not clear if Molly is one of those who died that way.\n\nTalking with Molly\n\nWith the help of Wilson, Valera attempted to talk with Molly twice at the hotel.\n\nFirst in the Maryland Room in the hotel's lower level. Wilson used a spirit bell, which to the naked eye looks like glass held up by a string.\n\nWilson said it's a method that originated in the 19th century. It's believed spirits will communicate with the living by \"pinging\" the glass with the string.\n\nValera first asked, \"Molly, are you here with us?\"\n\nAlmost immediately after, a loud ping was heard. Wilson said that was a resounding yes.\n\nValera also asked if Molly had her ball with her, and if it was OK that he was there with her. Both got a ping in response.\n\nThe group then took it to modern-day communication with an electromagnetic field detector, or an EMF meter.\n\nOriginally, [an EMF meter] was used for scientific measurements,\" Wilson said. \"Modern-day ghost hunters, or technospiritualists, have repurposed it for ghost hunting.\"\n\nTaking it to the 19th floor, Valera tried talking to Molly again. While there were moments when the device went off, there was no confirmation he was talking to Molly.\n\nHaunted or not haunted?\n\nWhen they called it a night, Valera and Sellgren set up an overnight camera in their rooms to see if they'd catch anything while they were sleeping.\n\nNeither camera caught anything of note. It's hard to definitively say if anything experienced at the hotel during Valera and Sellgren's stay was paranormal.\n\nBut, whether you're a believer or not, reflections of the hotel's past can't be ignored.\n\nFirst built in 1929, much of the hotel's decor and style now still looks very much like it was nearly 100 years ago.\n\nWilson said that can create a spooky feel of its own.\n\n\"Their memories are embedded in the walls of this hotel,\" he said.\n\nAs long as the stories live on, so does the paranormal -- the paranormal reputation, that is.\n\n\"I'm certain there are people who won't go to a haunted hotel,\" Wilson said. \"But I think the people that will far outnumber that.\""

        "article_content": "The Fenton History Center is helping community members get into the Halloween spirit with two Halloween Spirit Tours set for Oct 26.\n\nThe tours are presented and run by Kaycee Colburn, a Fenton board member, artist, paranormal investigator and spiritual intuitive. Colburn comes from a background of working with the paranormal community, including at places such as the Dunkirk Lighthouse, other similar museums to the Fenton, and recreational locations such as the Haunted Hinsdale House.\n\nThe first tour will take place from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Fenton, 67 Washington Street. The cost for the first tour is $30 for members and $35 for non-members. The second tour is a special Halloween tour from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. for adults 18 and up. The cost for the second tour is $40 for members and $45 for non-members. Additionally, guests are encouraged to come in costume for the second tour, which Colburn said helps to bring people into a different mindset.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the paranormal vibe to the area, see if we can trigger any spirits and enhance the experience for the guests,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say the Fenton is haunted, we leave that up to the guests and hope to give them a fun experience.\u201d\n\nColburn said the paranormal is something that is very popular these days and the tour can help give people insights into what they might see on television, along with allowing them to choose for themselves if the paranormal is or is not for them. She added that the tour is good for this time of year when the paranormal is already popular and people are looking for Halloween related things to do.\n\n\u201cPeople are already interested in the Fenton on its own and now they can come in the dark and see it in a different light, which gives a cool Halloween feeling,\u201d Colburn said.\n\nColburn encouraged participants to bring a flashlight, dress warmly, and be open minded, saying that there are a lot of theories surrounding the paranormal and that it is not for everyone. She said the tours are for people to come have fun and are very educational about the paranormal.\n\nThe Fenton has done other Spirit Tours throughout the year, and Colburn thought it was something that could possibly be done again next year after having received good responses this year to previous tours. She said some participants have requested the tours be longer or be overnight, which is something she said they are not currently able to do, but that overall there has been a positive response.\n\n\u201cIt gets people out of the house,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else quite like it locally.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit Tours are set to offer a safe Halloween, family friendly, fun event to let people learn more about the paranormal and spiritualist movement. Colburn said the tours are a way to bring information in and discuss the paranormal where in today\u2019s society that cannot always happen as it is labeled as creepy.\n\n\u201cThere was a time where the paranormal was not seen as creepy, including right here in Jamestown,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cSo being able to talk about it this way is cool.\u201d\n\nRegistration for both Oct 26 Spirit Tours is available on the Fenton History Center\u2019s website, fentonhistorycenter.org, under the events tab."

        "article_content": "This spooky season, which brings with it Fear the Spotlight\u2019s release as the first in a very cool slate out of Blumhouse, feels like quite a culmination of a tremendous year for horror video games. After sampling the game\u2019s horrific opening chapter back at Summer Game Fest, I was left wanting more. Fear the Spotlight really does feel like a tribute to so many of the classic games that paved the way for it, from its lo-fi, dithering graphics that leave enough doubt in your mind to jump at shadows, to its tactile, hands-on puzzle solving.\n\nFear the Spotlight, which is an expanded upon iteration of its release only a year ago, begins on a stormy night as Vivian, the player-character, and Amy break into Sunnyside High to perform a seance in the school\u2019s library. Quite predictably, things go haywire as the supernatural descends upon their night, leading to far more trouble than a simple breaking and entering should. Amy is found in a fugue state before she\u2019s drawn in by a powerful light, forcing Vivian to descend deeper into the belly of the school, which has cracked upon a portal to its past which, it seems, has plenty of skeletons in its closet to unearth after a fire decimated the campus in 1991.\n\nAlthough they spend relatively no screen time together, it is the burgeoning relationship of the two schoolgirl leads that drives events forward. While I won\u2019t divulge where the game goes, having seen where the original release rolled credits, I do think the direction of the expanded content is a genius move and undeniably builds out other characters within the game\u2019s lore while servicing the story at large. The entire game might only be four hours, however not one, singular second is wasted.\n\nUnlike Crow Country, another low-fi survival horror game that released this year, which gives its player the option to leave combat at the door entirely, Fear the Spotlight sensibly decided against turning Vivian into a super soldier who mows down ghosts and ghouls while trawling the locker bays. Although she\u2019s resourceful, she is young, in over her head, and she\u2019s absolutely terrified, which I think is evident through several of the design choices in the game\u2014particularly the one to not give Vivian any offensive firepower, whatsoever.\n\nThe character\u2019s fear and vulnerability is integral to not only the game\u2019s overarching themes, it also plays into the tense, hide and seek encounters with the fearsome titular antagonist, Spotlight. Leaving embers in his wake, he has sure but uncertain ties to the 1991 fire. He\u2019s a tall, slender figure with an ominous, oscillating light for a head, which strikes a horrifying picture whenever he shows unexpectedly, forcing you to sneak behind and underneath desks toward the nearest door. Seeing the ashen ghouls, who I presume are symbolic of the students lost, peering around corners and watching you is unsettling as it is, but Spotlight\u2019s sudden and heart-pounding appearances teeter at the periphery of being iconic.\n\nWhere other games might equip you with herbs or bandages to patch your cuts up with, Fear the Spotlight once again leans full bodied into Vivian\u2019s anxiety which can spike during these panicked chases. All it takes is a quick puff of her one-and-done inhalers with each hit serving as a calming cure-all for these moments of dread.\n\nShe\u2019s able to make use of her book smarts to solve several of the game\u2019s riddles which, in keeping with genre tropes, often involve scouring the immediate areas for key items before backtracking and piecing the whole picture together. I enjoyed all of the puzzles in Fear the Spotlight, even if they do lean ever-so-slightly towards being too simple, there\u2019s a satisfying flow that sees each problem Vivian faces snowball into the next, and it really helps keeping a great pace up.\n\nAs I mentioned in the opening, there\u2019s a wonderful, tactile feel to this game\u2019s world and its objects. You mightn\u2019t be able to thoroughly examine and turn items in-hand, however there\u2019s an interactivity to everything that kept me locked in throughout. Whether it\u2019s prying nails out of boarded windows, thumbing open the latch on a toolbox, or dialling in a phone number on a pay phone, you\u2019re charged with every input and it\u2019s a cool, albeit simple, touch.\n\nDespite an obvious, and deliberate, lack of fidelity due to the developer\u2019s pursuit of the in vogue retro, lo-fi aesthetic, everything still has a surprising amount of detail. Obviously it carries with it the warts of the style, with plenty of clipping and blocky textures, however it\u2019s one that lends itself so well to horror. The environment design is excellent, with the school itself getting extra credit for twisting its everyday halls into something dark and worthy of the tragedy that the school faculty swept under the rug. Darkness and shadow is used to great effect, as the dithering, the grain effect that helps cement the dated appearance Fear the Spotlight is shooting for, helps in creating optical illusions.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no real danger through so much of the game, you still second guess what the hard-to-see hallucination at the end of the hall could be. I also love that the game doesn\u2019t resort to jump scares to unsettle its audience, relying solely on a slow, steady build to keep the player on edge.\n\nUnlike some of its contemporaries, Sunnyside High\u2019s map isn\u2019t an open one. This creates a feeling of linearity throughout, which itself feels like a guiding hand showing the way. By solving small, self-contained zones one at a time, it minimises the laborious, time-consuming backtracking that often plagues games like this, but it certainly shines a spotlight, so to speak, on both the game\u2019s overall lack of difficulty and brevity.\n\nFear the Spotlight might only clock in at around four hours, but it\u2019s so well-paced and its puzzles, for the most part, feel as though they make sense in-world, which cements Sunnyside High, in my mind, as a horror spot that read the brief and passed with flying colours. It\u2019s staggering what a team of two has been able to achieve with Fear the Spotlight, it\u2019s a sublime survival-horror title that delivers in story and tone.\n\nAlong with being a tremendous first blow for Blumhouse\u2019s slate of smaller-scoped horror games, Fear the Spotlight could very well be my horror game of the year. I knew there was a reason I kept out of the library when I wasn\u2019t to school, nothing good ever comes of it."

With the first microbes likely appearing a good billion years following the planet\u2019s initial formation, the history of life is filled with long periods of seemingly unchanging stability punctuated by moments of immense destruction or practically exponential growth. One of the best known examples of that latter phenomenon is the Cambrian Explosion\u2014the geologic period some 530 million years ago when Earth saw an immense uptick in the complexity of life in its oceans.\n\nHowever, complex life was well underway even before this \u201cexplosion,\u201d and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than at the 150,000-acre Nilpena Ediacara National Park in South Australia. Located on the western fringe of the Flinders Range\u2014the largest mountain range in the Australian state\u2014this national park (as its name suggests) contains the richest collection of fossil specimens from the Ediacaran period (a 96 million-year-long geologic span that follows the Cryogenian period and is known to some as \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d) and the aforementioned Cambrian period. Since this fossil bed\u2019s discovery in 1946, paleontologists have uncovered 40 species embedded in the rock of what was once an ancient seafloor.\n\nRelated Story A New Study Unravels a Major Microfossil Mystery\n\nNow, an international team of scientists lead by Scott Evans\u2014assistant professor of geology at Florida State University\u2014has uncovered what could be one of the earliest (and strangest) forms of animal life to date at the site. Called Quaestio simpsonorum (pronounced kways-tee-oh), this ancient marine animal likely lived around 555 million years ago, and looked like a flattened pancake with a question mark shape in the middle of its body.\n\nWhile that\u2019s puzzling in itself, the more shocking piece of this discovery is evidence that Q. simpsonorum could move on its own\u2014it would have shifted around sort of like a robotic vacuum cleaner, slowly hoovering up all kinds of microscopic algae and bacteria. The results of this study were published in the journal Evolution & Development .\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t other fossils from this time that have shown this type of organization so definitively,\u201d Evans, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. \u201cThis is especially interesting as this is also one of the first animals that was capable of moving on its own.\u201d\n\nAccording to the researchers, as Q. simpsonorum puttered around this ancient seafloor gobbling up microbes, it left behind an organic mat of nutrients, which they describe as a kind of slime. These left-behind trails became trace fossils, which the team also uncovered in its discovery of Q. simpsonorum.\n\nRelated Story Life Might\u2019ve Had a Pretty Electrifying Beginning\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the most exciting moments when excavating the bed where we found many Quaestio was when we flipped over a rock, brushed it off, and spotted what was obviously a trace fossil behind a Quaestio specimen\u2014a clear sign that the organism was motile; it could move,\u201d Harvard University\u2019s Ian Hughes, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.\n\nThe importance of this discovery extends far beyond just one species that\u2019s been extinct for half a billion years. It gives researchers a glimpse at the gene expressions necessary to create these first forms of complex life, all while adding context to how complex life can form\u2014whether on Earth or some other planet.\n\nOf course, it also gives hope to experts who continue excavating the area that something else might be waiting to be discovered. \u201cWe\u2019re still finding new things every time we dig,\u201d Hughes said in a press statement. \u201cEven though these were some of the first animal ecosystems in the world, they were already very diverse. We see an explosion of life really early on in the history of animal evolution.\u201d"

(The other half went to Rosalyn S. Yalow, a medical physicist, for unrelated work.) Dr. Guillemin died in February.\n\nDr. Schally\u2019s discovery was a feat of industrial-style research. Because the brain contains only tiny amounts of hormone, Dr. Schally needed thousands of brains to obtain thimblefuls of the substance to study. A donation of one million pig brains from Oscar Mayer allowed him to put more money into building his scientific team."
