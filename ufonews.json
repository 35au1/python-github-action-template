            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

            "article_content": "C. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nAt CES 2025, the term \u201cAI\u201d was everywhere. All the major brands were pushing it, including Samsung, TCL, Roborock, and more. Even the signage throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center featured AI-generated artwork.\n\nWhen I heard about a new personalized AI wearable at the show called Bee, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the AI fatigue we\u2019ve seen ever since the failures of the Rabbit R1 (which debuted at last year\u2019s CES) and the Humane AI Pin. Those products over-promised and under-delivered, solidifying the idea that most AI hardware probably just needs to be an app.\n\nHonestly, when I walked into the demo suite with the two co-founders of Bee \u2014 Maria de Lourdes Zollo and Ethan Sutin \u2014 I thought I was going to see another Humane or Rabbit fiasco. What I got instead was a nuanced, well-thought-out device that just might make personalized AI a real thing.\n\nWhat is the Bee AI wearable?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nBee is a relatively inexpensive wrist wearable, about the same size and shape as a typical fitness tracker. However, it doesn\u2019t have health sensors, a touch screen, or even a display. Instead, it has a single multi-function button and a pair of microphones.\n\nBee is a fitness-tracker-esque wearable that listens to you all day, every day.\n\nThe purpose of Bee is to listen to your voice all day, every day. The device transcribes that audio in real-time on your connected smartphone and then learns from it through a suite of various large language models (LLMs). Bee didn\u2019t list out which ones it specifically uses, but it said it has its own in-house model as well as models from OpenAI and Google.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nWith this constant stream of data, Bee can learn all about you. It knows where you go, what you do, and what you say. It can then use this data for various purposes. For example, you can get a summary of your day, almost like a journal written by someone who\u2019s followed your every move. You can also communicate with a personal chatbot trained on you and you alone, allowing you to ask questions like, \u201cWhat did Maria tell me to wear to the party tonight?\u201d It will scour through your data and give you a response.\n\nThe wearable hardware is incredibly simple and sips on power. It charges with a standard USB-C cable and can last up to seven days. You can wear it on your wrist, as you see in the photos above, but you can also remove the device from the yellow silicon strap and put it into a black shirt clip that comes in the retail box.\n\nWould you wear an AI assistant that listens constantly? 133 votes Yes 43 % No 57 %\n\nWhat can you do with Bee?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nIn the image above, you can see an AI-generated daily summary for Ethan, one of Bee\u2019s co-founders. It says, \u201cFrom finalizing media schedules to coordinating partner meetings, the day was filled with preparations for the journey to CES in Las Vegas.\u201d It shows a map of Ethan\u2019s locations (he traveled from San Francisco to Las Vegas that day) and tells him he had seven conversations.\n\nTapping any one of these bits of info will allow you to dive deeper into the data. In the image below, you can see a much more detailed summary of what Ethan did on January 7, 2025. You can read it if you want (Ethan gave me permission to share it), but I\u2019ll save you the time: it\u2019s AI slop. However, the core idea is quite interesting. Myself, I tend to use Google Calendar to figure out where I\u2019ve been and what I\u2019ve done when I can\u2019t remember a date or location, but this is much better than that.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThe chatbot aspect is also fascinating. Remember that Bee learns only from you, so the chatbot will be able to relate your feelings, actions, opinions, and more to whatever you ask it about.\n\nBee creates a personalized AI chatbot that you can ask questions to about, well, you.\n\nAs an example of what I mean, let\u2019s say you want to go out to eat somewhere. You can ask your personal chatbot to find a restaurant in Las Vegas. Instead of just scouring for good places to eat, though, it will look for places you would want to eat. If it knows you\u2019re trying to eat healthier, it will take that into account, as it would if it knows you\u2019re a vegan.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nBee is also an automatic task scheduler; it can create tasks and reminders for you based on your conversations. For example, if you said to someone, \u201cOh yeah, I really want to investigate more into an African vacation,\u201d Bee would automatically create a task for you and schedule it for sometime soon.\n\nUnfortunately, Bee only works with iOS at the moment, but Ethan and co-founder Maria assured me that Android support will be available within the next few weeks.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t this just an app?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThe \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this just an app?\u201d question will likely dog every AI startup over the next few years. But Bee actually has a good answer to the question: because your smartphone would run out of battery too quickly.\n\nIn order for Bee to be most effective, it needs to be listening as much as possible. If you did this with your phone or smartwatch, the power draw would simply be too great. The Bee hardware solves this problem by always listening in and then letting your phone worry about the rest.\n\nBee is an app, but it's not just an app because your phone battery would melt if it needed to be on and recording you 24/7.\n\nOf course, the next logical question is: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this a smartwatch app?\u201d It does seem a bit incongruous that the Bee wearable needs to exist at all, considering that most people tech-savvy enough for something like this are already wearing a smartwatch or fitness tracker 24/7 anyway.\n\nEthan and Maria explained to me that Bee is already on the Apple Watch. However, Apple makes watchOS so limiting for developers that the app could never fully replicate what the standalone Bee wearable does. The pair told me they hope their eventual planned move to Wear OS will have better results. So, in the future, you might not need the wearable at all.\n\nHowever, for now, to use Bee, you need the wearable. It currently costs $49 for early adopters.\n\nIsn\u2019t Bee a privacy nightmare?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThis was the first question I asked Ethan and Maria. Won\u2019t people who aren\u2019t wearing Bee be pretty upset about being secretly recorded all the time? What do they do about certain states that require at least two parties to sign off on a recording before that recording becomes legal? Where are all the recordings stored? How does it get from Bee to your phone and then to the cloud?\n\nThese are all valid questions, and Bee explained most of them: Bee only records you. Bee has two microphones on it, which helps with audio isolation. You train the software on your own voice, and so it only cares about what you say. You can go even further with this and have it completely ignore all other voices, but that will make all your conversations seem one-sided, which could negatively affect the efficacy of Bee.\n\nBee has two microphones on it, which helps with audio isolation.

The company doesn\u2019t care about your data. Ethan and Maria are selling hardware and a subscription, which is how they plan to earn a profit with Bee. It is not collecting your data because it is not interested in it.\n\nEthan and Maria are selling hardware and a subscription, which is how they plan to earn a profit with Bee. It is not collecting your data because it is not interested in it. Your data is encrypted, regardless. Even if Ethan and Maria changed their minds down the road, your data is encrypted on your phone, so they couldn\u2019t touch it anyway. Additionally, your LLM is encrypted and siloed from all other LLMs on Bee\u2019s servers. Ethan told me that the hope one day is to have Bee exist completely on the edge \u2014 meaning on your devices exclusively and never going to the cloud at all. He pointed out that, six months ago, you couldn\u2019t do any AI stuff on-device, but now you can do quite a bit. Eventually, LLMs will be smaller and more efficient, and everything Bee does will happen on your device alone. However, they don\u2019t want to wait for that day, so they are relying on cloud-based solutions for now.\n\nGranted, Bee\u2019s security promises are just that \u2014 promises. Still, it was nice to hear from both co-founders that privacy was of utmost importance, and they were coming at Bee with the right principles in mind.\n\nHands-on with Bee: I\u2019m excited to give it a shot\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nMaria and Ethan promised to send me a Bee wearable when Android support rolls out. Honestly, I\u2019m excited to give it a shot. I\u2019ve been told by numerous people in my life \u2014 therapists, friends, and family \u2014 that keeping a daily journal is important. But I\u2019ve just never been able to set the time aside to keep one. Having a digital personal assistant who does all the leg work for me is an ideal compromise, allowing me to reflect on my day/week/month without needing to actually keep a journal.\n\nAlso, staying organized and on-task has always been a big part of my work life, and it seems like Bee could be very good at helping me be even better at that.\n\nOnce I have Bee, I\u2019ll do a full review. But in the meantime, let me know in the comments what you think about this new product. If you want to learn more about Bee, check out the Bee website.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

Professor Chris French is keen to know why. His research focus is \u201canomalistic psychology\u201d: bizarre experiences that many people have and why they believe in events that do not have a scientific base.\n\n[2] French, a professor emeritus at Goldsmiths College at the University of London in the United Kingdom, explores examples of \u201csupernatural activity\u201d in his research, and in his book The Science of Weird S**t: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal. He investigates ghost sightings, fortune-tellers, clairvoyants and psychics. Alien abductions are also in his scope. If it is a strange thing, French is interested.\n\n[3] Ghost sightings take up most of his time. There are many reasons people think they have seen one. One is a well-proven phenomenon called sleep paralysis, little known outside scientific circles. It can convince even cynics that they are in the presence of a \u2013 usually malicious \u2013 ghost.\n\n[4] \u201cSleep paralysis is a temporary period of paralysis between sleep and wakefulness,\u201d French said. \u201cIt can come with a range of additional symptoms that can make it absolutely terrifying. These include a strong sense of an evil presence and hallucinations like hearing voices or footsteps and seeing demons. Other symptoms include experiencing difficulty in breathing, feeling pressure on the chest and intense fear.\u201d\n\n[5] People go through several different stages during a regular night\u2019s sleep. One is REM, or rapid eye movement, sleep \u2013 the stage associated with vivid dreams. \u201cThe muscles of the body are actually paralysed during this phase, presumably to stop us from acting out the actions of the dream,\u201d French said.\n\n[6] Sometimes, REM sleep dream imagery gets mixed up with feelings of being awake, and we mistakenly believe we are having a supernatural experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a glitch in the normal sleep cycle. It\u2019s as though the brain wakes up, but the body doesn\u2019t \u2013 and all of that imagery spills over into waking consciousness,\u201d said French. Many artistic representations of ghosts and demons from the past probably stem from sleep paralysis, he added.\n\n[7] How about Ouija boards? This apparent way to communicate with the dead involves asking questions and having a form of marker seemingly move across a board of letters and numbers to spell out answers on its own. \u201cWhen people experience the planchette or an upturned wine glass moving around during a Ouija board session, the illusion that some external force is causing the movement is powerful,\u201d French explained. \u201cIn fact, those taking part are making unconscious muscular movements, known as the ideomotor effect.\u201d\n\n[8] Sometimes, ghost stories are cons to make a dollar. But while scammers do exist, our desire to believe is the bigger culprit. \u201cThe single most powerful cognitive bias that we all suffer from is confirmation bias,\u201d said French. \u201cWe pay more attention to evidence that is consistent with what we already believe or would like to be true. And we either ignore evidence [that does not match what we believe] or make up reasons it can be dismissed.\u201d If you believe in ghosts, it is more likely you will think you see one, he said.\n\nSource: South China Moring Post, December 29\n\nQuestions\n\n1.

            "article_content": "Jenny Agutter has hit back at fellow cast members who think the set of Call the Midwife is haunted - but admits she sometimes feels she could be \u201cswallowed up\u201d by the ancient ground in Cornwall.\n\nAnd the veteran actress, 72, believes the BBC drama\u2019s enduring success is down to being rooted in realism - calling out so-called \u201creality\u201d shows as being anything but. Rebecca Gethings, who plays the drama\u2019s Sister Veronica, admitted before Christmas that she has to be accompanied on bathroom breaks during filming on the Surrey set because she finds the corridor to the toilets so spooky.\n\nThe actress also told how, during filming of series 14 last year, the show\u2019s medic took a photo into the darkness having heard a bang. \u201cIf you zoom in, it's a lady in an Edwardian kind of costume, holding what looks to be a pig,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cI've seen the photo and it's pretty compelling.\u201d\n\nImage: BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay) BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay)\n\nBut Jenny, who has been in the drama since it launched in 2012 as head nun Sister Julienne, said she is not convinced. \u201cI don't feel spooked. I've been to much, much spookier places, to tell you the truth,\u201d she told the Mirror. \u201cWhen I'm in Cornwall, which I absolutely love, I'm in a house that's very old.\n\n\"The house doesn't spook me - but what does is a sense that I could turn around and everything might have disappeared. That I'm back in an ancient time where the rocks and the place belong and I don't any longer; that it's all gone. And that's not ghosts or spirits. It's a sense of the ground being so ancient that it can swallow me up.\u201d\n\nJenny and her Swedish husband Johan Tham have lived in Cornwall for more than 30 years. She first visited the county in 1976 to make The Eagle Has Landed alongside Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland. Agreeing that when it comes to paranormal activity she is a skeptic, Jenny explained there are usually rational explanations.\n\n\u201cI do think that we have very, very strong imaginations,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe that the sense of time can slip and warp. I think that with the paranormal, there are things that we can't explain - but I don't see them as being ghosts, spirits and those things. We all love a good ghost story. We love to be made to feel, \u2018Oh, there's something else that goes on.\u2019 But I like to actually know what's real and what's not and draw a line somewhere.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage: BBC/Neal Street Productions) BBC/Neal Street Productions) Image: BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston) BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston)\n\nShe said one of the reasons for Call the Midwife\u2019s ongoing success, with a loyal audience of 7million regularly tuning in, was that writer Heidi Thomas always roots her stories in realism. \u201cReality shows are so unreal,\u201d she complained. The people in those are so unreal and the way they look at life is completely unreal. What we have [on Call the Midwife] is something that is dealing with reality, but it heightens it and the drama's there.\u201d\n\nThis current series has seen the action in Poplar move into the 1970s and Jenny, 72, said it felt very different to when the series kicked off, based on the memoir of Jennifer Worth, set in 1957. \u201cIt\u2019s moving forward in time and there's new stories and the new times and new fashions and new music. It's always feeling different, we\u2019re not just repeating things.\u201d\n\nThe actress said that her own memories of 1970 - just as she was signed up as a teen to appear in her breakthrough film Walkabout - are a world apart. \u201cMy memory of 1970 is very, very different,\u201d she said. Walkabout, filmed in South Africa, was released in 1971 and includes a famous scene in which her character swims nude.\n\nIn the upcoming episodes, Sister Julienne is having to battle once again to save Nonnatus House, with officials arguing that nuns delivering babies are no longer relevant, thanks to the NHS. \u201cI don't think she ever questions what they can do. She just questions that they're allowed to do it,\u201d Jenny explained. Realising that she, as a nun, needs help from outside the religious order, she enlists nurse Trixie Franklin (Helen George) to spearhead the campaign to secure Nonnatus\u2019 future.\n\n\u201cShe knows that Trixie is someone who can move and change things and to make it clear to her what the reality is. She still finds it hard that they\u2019re being pushed aside. She's faced all these problems, they've gone through the wars, they've done all these things. And suddenly, when they seem to have a lot, everything's being taken away. So she's very surprised by that.\u201d\n\n- Call the Midwife continues on Sunday, BBC1, 8pm\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads ."

            "article_content": "The discovery of nanobubbles, also known as ultrafine bubbles (UFBs), dates to the late 1990s when researchers, equipped with advanced microscopy tools, began to notice the presence of tiny, seemingly stable bubbles in ocean water and streams.\n\nThis observation was initially met with skepticism, as traditional understanding suggested that such small bubbles would quickly dissolve due to high internal pressure. However, persistent investigations and refinements in analytical techniques gradually confirmed their existence.\n\nForming a structure that traps gases and other molecules inside, UFBs were found to be unique in their ability to transport nutrients and gases to cells much more effectively given their immense surface area, negative charge, and high pressures inside.\n\nThe field of UFBs is growing massively. Publications citing research into ultrafine bubbles have skyrocketed to over 3,500 annually, up from just a few hundred in 2005. Similarly, the applications are growing.\n\nEarly experiments demonstrated the potential of ultrafine bubbles in enhancing water quality, leading to their use in water treatment and agriculture which allowed plants to grow faster and healthier with less pesticide. This sparked a wave of interest in exploring other uses, including personal care, beverages and even medicine, where microfine bubbles are being investigated for drug delivery.\u00b9\u207b\u00b3\n\nThe applications of UFBs can be appropriate anywhere where nutrients need to penetrate cells more effectively and efficiently. But not all UFBs are created equal.\n\nNext generation UFBs\n\nIn efforts to drive product performance through better, cleaner and faster delivery of active ingredients, researchers at Hydrosome Labs have developed some of the smallest UFBs ever detected.\n\nHydrosome Labs' unique ultrafine bubbles, called \u2018Hydrosomes\u2019, have significantly higher surface area compared with bubbles in regular water (one trillion fit in one champagne bubble) making them superior transporters to cells. And their patented process creates bubbles that are stable in solutions for at least two years (versus six months for other technologies).\n\n\u201cWater is second only to oxygen as the most essential substance for survival, yet we take for granted that it will always function the same,\u201d said Nick Jackowetz, Chief Science Officer at Hydrosome Labs.\n\n\u201cHistory is filled with natural substances improved upon for the benefit of society \u2013 carbon into carbon fiber, silica into computer chips and more. What if water itself could be improved in a natural and sustainable way? That\u2019s what our technology is all about,\u201d adds Jackowetz.\n\nThe company says it is taking the nascent ultrafine bubble industry in new directions by expanding the technology into categories where it has not previously been applied. In essence, Hydrosome Labs is helping create and expand a category that has profound potential to improve lives. The industry is currently focused on agriculture and sanitation.\n\nHydrosome Labs is bringing innovation to white spaces including:\n\nSignificantly enhancing the speed and yield of precision fermentations used to create everything from cow-free dairy products to variety of alternative proteins\n\nFurthering the development of clean beauty products, delivering nutrients to the skin more deeply, efficiently and naturally\n\nAchieving faster, longer-lasting, and enhanced hydration in functional beverages\n\nSolving problems: Fermentation production and capacity\n\nHydrosome Labs is poised to usher in a new era in precision fermentation and biomanufacturing. It aims to solve multiple industry problems faced in fermentation, a process that involves the customization of yeast and/or bacteria to produce specific molecules for use in a wide variety of applications including food, ingredients, biofuels, industrial enzymes, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThis new technology has the potential to help solve a global industry bottleneck in fermentation capacity and equipment, allowing for the production of dramatically higher yields in the same size or previously unsuitable tanks. A recent study at the Integrated Bioprocessing Research Laboratory (IBRL) at the University of Illinois found that the Hydrosome Labs process doubles precision fermentation yields while decreasing production time.\u2074\n\nHydrosome test unit\n\nScott Jacobson, Associate Director of Strategic Operation at IBRL says the technology has major potential to drive the industry forward.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been significant advances in synthetic biology resulting in a tremendous number of new products capable of being made through fermentation, we have seen very little innovation in the fermentation process or equipment to assist in scaling these discoveries.\n\n\u201cThis technology has the potential to positively impact the economics of new products in a wide range of industries and can also be applied to existing processes or retrofit last generation fermentation equipment currently unsuitable for these new products,\u201d adds Jacobson.\n\nIn addition to its work with IBRL, the company recently received a grant from the Illinois Science & Technology Coalition to explore how UFBs can be employed to benefit the industry, resolve global capacity bottlenecks and provide better products for consumers.\n\nInnovation in food and beverage\n\nHydrosomes have been shown in multiple clinical and in-vitro studies to drive faster and better hydration by improving the delivery of water to cells.\u2075 In-vitro testing by Inotox, an independent lab, showed faster rehydration of red blood cells when exposed to Hydrosomes.\u2076\n\nA double blind, crossover clinical trial on male athletes run by KGK, a CRO known for its work in the nutritional space, showed longer lasting hydration for athletes consuming Hydrosome H2O. Other emerging applications include:\u2077\n\nSensory benefits When filled with different gasses like CO2, O2, or even N2O, the high surface area and concentrations of Hydrosomes have the ability to modulate flavors in beverages\n\nWhen filled with different gasses like CO2, O2, or even N2O, the high surface area and concentrations of Hydrosomes have the ability to modulate flavors in beverages Sugar reduction The ability to modulate sweetness and flavors means manufacturers can use less sugar\n\nThe ability to modulate sweetness and flavors means manufacturers can use less sugar Gut microbiome health A recent 12-week pre-clinical trial found that the consumption of water containing ultrafine bubbles was found to have positive impacts on the health of the gut microbiome\u2078\n\nBecause of emerging patent protection, Hydrosome Labs enjoys competitive advantage in a number of areas. The technology is \u2018cell friendly\u2019 as Hydrosome Labs uses a gentle process called hydrodynamic cavitation to create its Hydrosomes.\n\nWoman drinking sports drink\n\nChemical and sustainability challenges\n\nSome consumers in beauty care and other categories have grown tired of chemical-filled beauty products driving a trend towards clean beauty. With Hydrosome H2O\u2019s ability to improve the permeation of active ingredients, it can help eliminate the need for other chemical-based penetration enhancers \u2013 simplifying formulas and ingredient lists, while boosting the efficacy of existing formulations.\n\nFormulators can now create a cleaner formula, with improved performance. It also And because it can be formulated with less of the active ingredient, while still achieving the same benefit, it can result in significant ingredient cost savings across industries.\n\nManufacturers are looking for a natural and more sustainable supply chain. Hydrosomes allow manufacturers to do more with less, while using fewer chemicals, reducing environmental impact, and streamlining supply chains.\n\nUnique team and approach\n\nThe team at Hydrosome Labs has PhDs or advanced degrees with experience in chemistry and technology from everywhere from Constellation Brands to Argonne National Labs.

            "article_content": "San Francisco: Close to two months ago, 26-year-old OpenAI Whistleblower, Suchir Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment under mysterious circumstances; while initially his death was termed as a suicide, his family and some investigative journalists believe it to be a murder. Suchir Balaji's mother, Poornima Rao, in a recent interview, has claimed that her son was not okay with OpenAI becoming \u2018for-profit\u2019. Her interview has been reshared by Elon Musk who has also reacted to it amid his feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n\u2018He Was Not Okay with OpenAI Becoming For-Profit\u2019: Suchir Balaji's Mother\n\nPoornima Rao, Suchir Balaji's mother who has been raising her voice against OpenAI and claiming her son's death to be a murder, has recently made shocking claims in a fresh interview. In a conversation with Mario Nawfal, the OpenAI whistleblower's mother said that her son had joined OpenAI with the belief to help humanity and was not okay with the organisation becoming for-profit.\n\nSuchir Balaji's mother said, \u201cThe reason he joined OpenAI was his belief that AI will help humanity. He was very impressed with OpenAI initially because they were nonprofit. That's when his concern started to arise, and he started questioning himself.\u201d\n\nElon Musk Reshares Interview of Suchir Balaji's Mother, Reacts To Her Shocking Claims\n\nPoornima Rao's interview clip where she is claiming that her son was not happy with OpenAI becoming for-profit, reached Elon Musk as well who shared it on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly known as Twitter). Along with the reshare, he reacted to it with two exclamation marks, \u2018!!\u2019.\n\n\u2018Suchir Balaji Was A Genius\u2019: OpenAI Whistleblower's Mother\n\nIn the same interview, Suchir Balaji's mother talked about how her son was a genius. She said, \u201cWhen he was in high school, for 2 years, every weekend, day and night, he was practicing algorithms. He downloaded data related to machine learning from many different universities. Way before anyone else knew about AI, he was already a champion in machine learning and algorithms. At the age of 11, he started programming. Within 6 months, he used to ask me questions that I could not answer on algorithms.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Acknowledgement from OpenAI of His Contributions\u2019\n\nIn her interview, Suchir Balaji's mother also expressed her sadness because OpenAI never recognised or appreciated her son for his work and contribution to the company, not even after his unfortunate death. She said, \u201cHe did something to fine-tune ChatGPT that made it faster and more efficient. But what bothered him was that there was no recognition for his work until he passed away. Even now, there's no acknowledgement from OpenAI of his contributions. That's very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji's Mother Alleges Murder of Her Son\n\nAmid reports about Suchir Balaji Death Case being a suicide, the 26-year-old boy's mother Poornima Rao has claimed her son's death to be a \u2018cold-blooded murder declared by authorities as suicide\u2019. She further claimed that there was a stark difference between the initial police report and a private autopsy report, that her son's apartment was ransacked and that there were signs of struggle in the bathroom suggesting he was hit and this is not a suicide, but a case of murder.\n\n\u2018This Doesn\u2019t Seems A Suicide': Elon Musk\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has responded to the plea made by the mother of OpenAi Whistleblower Suchir Balaji saying that, \u201cThis doesn't seems a suicide\u201d, in which she called for an FBI investigation following her son's death. Balaji accused the AI gaint of copyright violations, and he was found dead a month after the allegations surfaced.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, his mother, Poornima Ramarao, revealed that they had hired a private investigator and conducted a second autopsy to further investigate the cause of death. According to Ramarao, the private autopsy did not confirm the police's conclusion. In her post, she tagged billionaire Elon Musk and Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom will join the incoming Donald Trump administration and are key ally of president-elect. Mr. Musk, known for his ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, replied to her post, stating, \u201cThis doesn't seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji Case: Controversy Surrounding Indian-American's Death\n\nIndian-American tech researcher Suchir Balaji, 26, who openly criticized the use of copyrighted data in artificial intelligence (AI), was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Balaji, a computer science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, had interned with OpenAI and Scale AI during his college years. He joined OpenAI in 2019 and during his four years at the company, he worked on several projects, including GPT-4 training and improving ChatGPT\u2019s performance. He left OpenAI in August this year, expressing concerns over the potential harm OpenAI could cause. During his tenure, he played a significant role in data collection for OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT. On his personal website, Mr. Balaji elaborated on his concerns, claiming that OpenAI's method of copying data for training its models potentially amounted to copyright infringement.\n\nJust a day before his death, Balaji\u2019s name was mentioned in a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. Though details about his involvement remain unclear, his public criticism of the company\u2019s data usage practices likely drew attention to his stance on ethical AI development. Suchir Balaji had accused OpenAI of training its AI models on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without proper authorization, a practice he argued was detrimental. \"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,\" Mr. Balaji said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. The Indian-origin tech professional resigned from OpenAI in October 2023 after nearly four years with the company."

            "article_content": "Several prominent tech leaders are planning to attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration this month, the latest sign that the industry is trying to bolster its relationship with the president-elect ahead of his return to the White House.OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman plans to go to the swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20, said a company spokesperson. Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also plans to go to the event, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private information. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will be at some of the surrounding festivities, according to the company. Uber also plans to host an inauguration party in Washington with Elon Musk\u2019s X social media firm and The Free Press, a media company.Coinbase Global Inc. CEO Brian Armstrong has been invited to events around the inaugural including a presidential dinner, the company said.The prospect of a second Trump term has raised a new set of uncertainties for the rapidly evolving AI market and the wider tech industry. During his first term, Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on issues such as immigration and online content moderation. He has also previously directed his ire at executives such as Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos.In recent weeks, Meta and Amazon pledged to donate $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Zuckerberg and Bezos have also dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. And Zuckerberg has been pivoting his stable of social networking apps to become more Trump-friendly, including by eliminating outside fact-checking and loosening the rules around what people can say on the service.Altman, meanwhile, personally donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund after having previously given money to President Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 reelection campaign.\u201cI think AGI will probably get developed during this president\u2019s term, and getting that right seems really important,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg Businessweek in a recent interview, referring to a hypothetical, advanced form of AI. \u201cSupporting the inauguration, I think that\u2019s a relatively small thing. I don\u2019t view that as a big decision either way. But I do think we all should wish for the president\u2019s success.\u201dTrump\u2019s party pledged in its platform to undo Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, saying that it \u201cimposes Radical Leftwing ideas\u201d on the field. With Trump\u2019s win, Musk has also gained newfound influence in Washington. That\u2019s sparked concerns Musk could pursue policies that favor his own companies, including his artificial intelligence startup xAI. Altman, whose company is in a legal battle with Musk, recently said he does not think the billionaire will use his political power against rivals like OpenAI.In addition to Altman, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also plan to be at the inauguration, according to a company spokesperson. OpenAI also has hired a lobbying firm run by a well-known figure in Trump world, Jeff Miller, according to a filing."

            "article_content": "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info\n\nWith staycations steadily becoming a thing of the past, experts pinpointed the cheapest hidden gems across Europe that offer return flights for under \u00a375. Money-saving experts at Savoo delved into the details of upcoming flights and travel trends for 2025 to find the cheapest flights, and the top tips for getting your holiday in under budget.\n\nSpain\n\nDespite holding some of the most popular cities for Brits to vacay in, Spain earned not one but two spots on the list of cheapest return prices. In first place is the seaside Costa del Sol, with return flights going as low as \u00a351.\n\nIt takes roughly the same amount of time to fly to Costa del Sol from London as it does to get you to Manchester via train, only with a hefty price difference as the money-saving experts noted an average one-way train up north costs \u00a354.50. Mallorca also made the list with potential return flights from \u00a362 if you pick your times and dates right.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nOne of the more high profile destinations on the list is the capital city of the Czech Republic, Prague, with return flights starting at \u00a357. Including average hotel prices, cheap and mid-range food to keep you going as well as some beers and coffees over a weekend trip will set you back \u00a3254.27 according to the money experts.\n\nPoland\n\nKrakow comes in third place at \u00a359.50 for return flights and the alternative in Warsaw has a slightly higher premium at \u00a364.30. But both areas also earned a spot on Savoo\u2019s cheapest long weekend getaways in second at \u00a3231.57 and third place with \u00a3242.60 respectively including hotels, food and drinks.\n\nSlovakia\n\nRounding out the top five is Barislava in Slovakia with \u00a363.40 return flights available. The historic city also came in just under Prague for the cheapest weekend getaway, costing roughly \u00a3267.89 for three days and two nights.\n\nFinally, Budapest in Hungary, Vilnius in Lithuania, Riga in Latvia and Lisbon in Portugal rounded out the latter part of the top 10 with return flights ranging between \u00a365 and \u00a371. The experts warned that while hidden gems and lesser-known destinations like Bratislava are likely to have cheaper flights all-year round, there are some ways to bag a bargain on even the most popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe experts shared their top five money-saving tips while booking flights. Starting with the most obvious in avoiding popular dates like Fridays or school holidays when trips are likely to be more expensive due to increased demand.\n\nIf you can be even more flexible with dates, the experts recommended: \u201cLast-minute deals can save you a ton of money. So if you\u2019re brave, try to hold off booking until a couple of weeks before you want to go.\u201d\n\nJust like avoiding popular travel dates, avoiding the popular airports can save some change for your getaway. The experts explained: \u201cConsider an airport close by. For example, if you\u2019re headed to Orlando, you don\u2019t just need to fly into Orlando International Airport. Both Melbourne and Tampa have airports with flights from the UK, which can cost a lot less.\u201d\n\nLayovers generally tend to be cheaper than direct flights, up to 50% in some cases, they claimed, although it is more time-consuming. Using voucher codes, discounts and comparison sites can also earn back some cash for your trip.\n\nOne subtle way to ensure you\u2019re not getting priced out of a getaway is to look for flights using an incognito mode browser tab, the experts recommended. This avoids installing permanent cookies on your browser so you\u2019re less likely to be shown inflated prices sometimes given to people who are consistently browsing some flights."

Whether that power shift will translate into seismic change in what we wear is a different question.\n\nThere has been much speculation as to the source of the turmoil. Much blame has focused on a slowdown in luxury spending (especially in China), as well as global political and economic uncertainty, which has led to a game of Blame the Designer (when in doubt, blame the designer), which led to Change the Designer.\n\nThere is a tendency, in such an environment, to play it safe. To fall back into the comfort of a camel coat and assume that what sold well in the past will sell well in the future. To focus on the commercial over the creative."

            "article_content": "Get ready for round two of this corporate thriller. Apple\n\nIt's a long-awaited moment for fans of the dystopian thriller Severance, which premiered on Apple TV Plus in 2022. At last, the second season of this unsettling and irresistible drama is slated to drop. Let the countdown begin.\n\nSeverance follows Mark Scout (Adam Scott) and his colleagues at a fictitious biotech company called Lumon, who have undergone a brain surgery that separates their work and personal lives. When they're in the office, they have no recollection of their lives outside and vice versa. But strange things start to happen, including the sudden axing of a longtime colleague, which pushes Mark and his colleagues to question the company they work for and its motives. It's a riveting commentary on work-life balance (or the lack thereof), made stronger by understated yet memorable characters and a focused storyline.\n\nSeason 1 ends on such a compelling cliffhanger that you'll be desperate to jump right into season 2 at the earliest chance. And at last, the wait is almost over. So without further ado, here's everything you need to know about the next season of Severance, including how to watch the highly anticipated show with a VPN.\n\nHow to Watch Severance Season 2 on Apple TV Plus\n\nThe second season of Severance lands on Apple TV Plus on Friday, January 17. There are 10 episodes, which will be released on a weekly basis -- likely leaving viewers on the edge of their seats in between airings.\n\nYou also now have the option to access Apple TV Plus through another streamer: Prime Video. The retail and tech giants have struck a deal to offer Apple's streaming service as a $10 monthly add-on for Prime Video customers. That can make it easier to access the platform and give it added visibility -- therefore simplifying the process of binging Severance Season 2 (or whatever you're watching).\n\nAnd if you'd like to catch up on Season 1 before activating an Apple TV Plus subscription, you can do so for free on the Roku Channel (though you'll have to sit through ads).\n\nJames Martin/CNET Apple TV Plus Home of Severance Subscribe to Apple TV Plus for $10 a month. If you'd like to give it a try before committing, you can sign up for a 7-day free trial. And if you've purchased a new Apple device, you'll get three months of Apple TV Plus free, as long as you redeem the offer within 90 days. See at Apple TV Plus\n\nHow to watch Severance from anywhere with a VPN\n\nWhat if you're traveling abroad and want to stream Severance while away from home? With a VPN, you can virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the series from anywhere in the world. There are other good reasons to use a VPN for streaming, too.\n\nA VPN is the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds by encrypting your traffic. Using a VPN is also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. Streaming TV can be a bit smoother with a reliable, quality VPN that's passed our tests and security standards.\n\nYou can use a VPN to stream content legally as long as VPNs are legal in your country and you have a valid subscription to the streaming service you're using. The US and Canada are among the countries where VPNs are legal, but we advise against streaming or downloading content on illegal torrent sites. We recommend ExpressVPN, but you may opt for another provider from our best list such as Surfshark or NordVPN.\n\nFollow the VPN provider's instructions for installation and choose a country where Severance is streaming on Apple TV Plus. Before you open the streaming app, make sure you're connected to your VPN using your selected region. If you want to stream Severance on more than one device, it's possible you'll need to configure each one to ensure you are signed in. Go to settings and check your network connections to verify you're logged in and connected to your VPN account. Now you're ready to open Apple TV Plus to stream.\n\nIf you run into issues with streaming, first make sure your VPN is up and running on its encrypted IP address. Double-check that you've followed installation instructions correctly and you've picked the right geographical area for viewing. If you still encounter connection problems, you may need to reboot your device. Close all apps and windows, restart your device and connect to your VPN first. Note that some streaming services have restrictions on VPN access."

            "article_content": "Dissent within the State Department over U.S. role in Israel-Hamas war | 60 Minutes\n\nAs the Biden administration prepares to leave the White House, it is making a final push to secure a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas that began on October 7th, 2023 when Hamas-led militants stormed Israel killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Ninety five of them remain in captivity \u2013 it is unknown how many are still alive.\n\nIn a study published late this past week, the medical journal the Lancet said the death toll in Gaza has likely surpassed 70,000 people\u2026\n\nThe war has led to charges of genocide against Israel -- and has been fueled by American weapons and billions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nTonight, you will see graphic images from inside Gaza.\n\nYou will also hear from State Department officials who quit their jobs \u2013 and their concerns about how far Washington is willing to go to support an ally who, they say, has conducted a war that runs counter to American values and threatens national security.\n\nThis is the scene filmed in May by CBS News in Gaza.\n\nChildren on top of rubble\u2026 playing with ammunition casings \u2026the same casings used to prop up these tent cities.\n\nA close look reveals where they come from -- printed on the side: USA... DOD for the Department of Defence.\n\nAcross this now decimated 25 mile long strip of land\u2026 America's stamp is everywhere.\n\nHala Rharrit: What is happening in Gaza would not be able to happen without U.S. arms. That's without a doubt.\n\nHala Rharrit was an American diplomat who spent nearly two decades posted in Asia, Africa and the Middle East\u2026 where she worked on human rights and counterterrorism.\n\nHala Rharrit 60 Minutes\n\nShe was stationed in Dubai on October 7th, where part of her job was to monitor Arab press and social media to document how America's role in the war was perceived in the Middle East. We've obtained daily reports Rharrit sent to senior leadership in Washington containing gruesome images and her warnings:\n\nHala Rharrit: I would show the complicity that was indisputable. Fragments of U.S. bombs next to massacres of-- of ch-- mostly children. And that's the devastation. It's been overwhelmingly children.\n\nCecilia Vega: When you tried to speak out, vocalize what you saw--\n\nHala Rharrit: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: --happening in Gaza, you feel--\n\nHala Rharrit: Yes.\n\nCecilia Vega: --like you were told to shut up?\n\nHala Rharrit: Yes. I would show images of children that were starved to death. In one incident, I was basically berated, \"Don't put that image in there. We don't wanna see it. We don't wanna see that the children are starving to death.\"\n\nCecilia Vega: Who told you that?\n\nHala Rharrit: A colleague.\n\nCecilia Vega: A superior?\n\nHala Rharrit: Yeah\u2026 I was told the contrary by others. \"Keep them in. We need to see it.\"\n\nThree months into the war, Rharrit says she was told her reports were no longer needed. She resigned last April.\n\nAfter October 7th, President Biden became the first U.S. leader to visit Israel during war time, reiterating America's unwavering support.\n\nThe U.S. has sent $18 billion in American military assistance to Israel since the war began, largely in the form of taxpayer-funded weapons.\n\nJosh Paul: Most of the bombs come from America. Most of the technology comes from America. And all of the fighter jets, all of Israel's fixed-wing fleet-- comes from America.\n\nJosh Paul 60 Minutes\n\nJosh Paul spent 11 years as a director in the State Department's Bureau of Political - Military Affairs\u2026.one of the officials in charge of signing off on major weapons deals to U.S. allies.\n\nJosh Paul: There is a linkage between every single bomb that is dropped in Gaza and the U.S. because every single bomb that is dropped is dropped from an American-made plane.\n\nCecilia Vega: These Israeli air strikes, you could say, are made in America.\n\nJosh Paul: They are.\n\nTen days after the October 7th attacks, Paul became the first person in the Biden administration to publicly resign in protest\u2026\n\nJosh Paul: After October 7th, there was no space for debate or discussion. I was part of email chains where there were very clear directions saying, \"Here are the latest requests from Israel. These need to be approved by 3:00 p.m.\"\n\nCecilia Vega: Expedited?\n\nJosh Paul: Correct.\n\nCecilia Vega: Where were these orders to green-light weapons transfers coming from? How high up did this go?\n\nJosh Paul: This came from the president, from the secretary and from those around them.\n\nCecilia Vega: There are people who might argue that this isn't a time for debate. Particularly in those immediate days in the aftermath of October 7th.\n\nJosh Paul: I would argue exactly the opposite. I think the moment of October 7th was a moment of incredible worldwide solidarity with Israel. And had Israel leveraged that moment to press for a real, just and lasting peace, I think we would be in a very different place now in which Israel would not be facing this increasing isolation around the world and in which its hostages would be free.\n\nAmong the weapons Israel requested from the United States \u2013 2,000-pound bombs \u2013 one of the most powerful in the U.S. arsenal \u2013 typically used to destroy large targets like weapons depots.\n\nNearly three weeks after the October 7th attacks, the Israeli military posted a video on social media of an airstrike in Gaza City, saying it targeted a Hamas tunnel.\n\nMore than 100 people were also killed \u2014 including 81 women and children, according to Airwars, a British nonprofit that monitors civilian harm in conflict\u2026\n\nThis is what the neighborhood looked like before the strike\u2026\n\nAnd this is the aftermath \u2013 several sources we spoke to say Israel likely used multiple 2,000-pound American bombs.\n\nTwo months later, President Biden warned that Israel was losing support for what he called indiscriminate bombing. Last May, he halted a shipment of the 2,000-pound bombs.\n\nAndrew Miller: The Israelis were using those bombs in some instances to target one or two individuals in densely packed areas. And in enough instances, we saw that was in question, how Israel was using it. And those weapons were suspended.\n\nAndrew Miller 60 Minutes\n\nAndrew Miller was the deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian affairs.\n\nHe resigned last June not in protest but because he said he wanted to spend more time with his family. Miller has since become the highest ranking Biden administration official to go public with his concerns about the U.S. role in the war.\n\nCecilia Vega: Did the U.S. ever say to Israel, \"We support you, but these are our red lines; we are not going to support certain things\"?\n\nAndrew Miller: There were conversations from the earliest days about U.S. desires and expectations for what Israel would do. But they weren't defined as a red line.\n\nCecilia Vega: The United States has supplied billions of dollars in weapons to Israel. You're saying the government did that without setting any red lines as to how those weapons would be used?\n\nAndrew Miller: I'm unaware of any red lines being imposed beyond the normal language about complying with international law, international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict.\n\nCecilia Vega: What's the message the U.S. has sent to the Netanyahu government?\n\nAndrew Miller: I believe the message that Prime Minister Netanyahu received is that he was the one in the driver's seat, and he was controlling this, and U.S. support was going to be there, and he could take it for granted.\n\nCecilia Vega: The push is, if the U.S. stops supplying these weapons to its ally, that our own adversaries would not only go after that ally, it would make the region significantly less safe.\n\nAndrew Miller: There is a danger-- that if the U.S. was not providing support to Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran would see that as an opportunity to go after Israel. However, we could have said, we are taking this step because we believe this class of weapons-- is being used inappropriately. But if you use this moment to accelerate your attacks against Israel, then we are going to immediately lift our prohibition.\n\nIn May, the State Department issued a report saying it is \"reasonable to assess\" that Israel may have used American weapons in violation of international law. But it also said it could not definitively connect American weapons to specific cases.\n\nAndrew Miller said the investigation relied heavily on Israel for answers.\n\nAndrew Miller: It is difficult to acquire that information in an active combat zone\u2026 but I would also say we didn't exactly work very hard to try to acquire the information.\n\nCecilia Vega: Does Israel get the benefit of the doubt from the United States when other allies might not?\n\nAndrew Miller: Yes. I think it's fair to say Israel does get the benefit of the doubt. There is a deference to Israeli accounts of what's taken place.\n\nU.S. law prohibits military assistance from being sent to countries that restrict American aid like food and medicine.\n\nExperts who track aid, including from multiple international organizations and the State Department itself have found that Israel has continually blocked aid to the people of Gaza.\n\nWe asked Brett McGurk, White House coordinator for the Middle East \u2013 and one of President Biden's closest advisers \u2013 for an interview. He declined our request.\n\nBut a senior White House official told us that government lawyers have not determined that Israel has violated the laws of armed conflict \u2013 and therefore American weapons have continued to flow.\n\nThe official said Hamas could end the war by returning the hostages. The belief here in the White House is that cutting off weapons would lead to an even longer, deadlier conflict and that it is America's military support and diplomacy that has prevented a wider war in the Middle East.\n\nBut, the director of the FBI told Congress the war in Gaza has raised the threat of a terror attack at home.\n\nThe acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Brett Holmgren, told 60 Minutes that anti-American sentiment driven by the war in Gaza is at a level not seen since the Iraq War, and that groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS are recruiting on that sentiment \u2013 issuing the most specific calls for attacks on America in years.\n\nHala Rharrit: The level of anger throughout the Arab world, and I-- I'll say beyond the Arab world-- is palpable. Protests began erupting in the Arab world, which I was also documenting, with people burning American flags. This is very significant because we worked so hard after the war on terror to strengthen ties with the Arab world.\n\nCecilia Vega: You believe that this has put a target on America's back, you've said.\n\nHala Rharrit: 100%.\n\nCecilia Vega: Those are strong words.\n\nHala Rharrit: Yes. I don't say them lightly. And I say it as someone that myself has survived two terrorist attacks. My first assignment was in the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. I survived a mortar attack. I say it as someone who has worked intensely on these issues and has intensely monitored the region for two decades.\n\nMultiple diplomats we spoke with say the U.S. policy on Gaza has led to widespread dissent at the State Department. A rarely used method of sending cables to the secretary of state \u2013 created during the Vietnam War so employees could voice objection \u2013 has received a record number of submissions over Gaza.\n\nThirteen officials \u2013 including from the State Department, White House and Army \u2013 have publicly resigned in protest.\n\nCecilia Vega: What was the final straw that led you to resign?\n\nHala Rharrit: I'll point out one moment that broke me. I used to put a lot of images of the children after they were killed. But this one-- um, sorry. (crying)\n\nCecilia Vega: It still haunts you.\n\nHala Rharrit: Yeah. One Pan-Arab channel one day did a report on a little girl that had been killed in an airstrike. But they put a picture of the little girl when she was alive. She has her princess dress, and she's in the picture waving her wand with a huge, beautiful smile. And-- you know, I saw my child in that child.\n\nHer name was Aana al-Farra -- she is one of thousands of children killed so far in Gaza\u2026\n\nCecilia Vega: How does this end?\n\nAndrew Miller: When Israel says it's over. Absent intervention from the United States or for someone else to compel or to force a decision-- it ends when Netanyahu says it's over.\n\nProduced by Ayesha Siddiqi.

            "article_content": "Fundstrat chief investment officer Tom Lee says those who turn a blind eye to Bitcoin likely believe that BTC will eventually plunge all the way down to zero.\n\nIn an interview on the Global Money Talk YouTube channel, Lee says Bitcoin has proven its staying power after over a decade of existence.\n\nHe also notes that it\u2019s now very unlikely for Bitcoin to vanish, given that the incoming Trump administration has repeatedly expressed its support for the largest crypto by market cap.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s probably better to just observe a few things. One is Bitcoin has now been around for 15 years, and there has not been a Bitcoin 2.0. So there\u2019s no crypto 2.0, Bitcoin is the surviving chain.\n\nAnd Bitcoin has become a $2 trillion asset which never in financial history has anything reached $2 trillion and then disappeared. It\u2019s a different argument if it was $100 billion.\n\nThird is the US government [has] reiterated its commitment to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. That\u2019s not bad for the price of Bitcoin. So if someone is watching this and said, \u2018Well, they don\u2019t understand Bitcoin so they decide not to own it.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a catastrophic way to look at markets.\u201d\n\nLee also believes that the macroeconomic backdrop appears to be acting as a tailwind for risk assets like stocks and crypto, at least for the first half of the year. He adds that his bullish stance is supported by jittery market sentiment and the massive amount of cash still waiting in the wings.\n\n\u201cThere is probably room for more positive surprises in the first half because we have an incoming president that\u2019s very pro-business, probably the most pro-business president in modern times. And with, so far, the cabinet selections that the market is very happy with. So that should be providing room for investors to become optimistic which they call \u2018animal spirits.\u2019\n\nAnd the second tailwind is that the Fed is dovish. And what that means is that the central bank is easing. So that\u2019s positive for stocks.\n\nThe third is investors are cautious because almost everyone we talked to thinks valuations are expensive or because we\u2019ve had two good years, [the next year] has to be bad. So we know sentiment is cautious. Usually when people are cautious, then you bet against the caution.\n\nAnd the fourth is that we know mechanically there\u2019s a lot of cash on the sidelines. There\u2019s a lot of firepower \u2013 $7 trillion of cash on the sidelines.\n\nSo I would see this as positive for the first half of [this] year.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's why the rally in Nvidia stock is somewhat justified, why Nvidia could continue outperforming the market and is worth buying, and some reasons to keep Nvidia on a watchlist for now.\n\nNvidia's momentum knows no bounds\n\nNvidia followed up a rip-roaring 2023 with another incredible year in 2024 -- briefly becoming the most valuable company in the world before Apple reclaimed the title.\n\nNvidia has defended its commanding lead in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market despite a slew of competition. In December, Nvidia announced that its Blackwell architecture for generative artificial intelligence (AI) was coming to Amazon Web Services. On Jan. 3, Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion in its current fiscal year to \"build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.\" On Jan. 7, Amazon said it plans to spend $11 billion in the U.S. state of Georgia alone on AI infrastructure and cloud technologies.\n\nNvidia could easily beat the market again in 2025 because it continues to innovate, and AI spending is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nNvidia rallied to an all-time high on Monday in response to news that Nvidia customer Hon Hai Precision Industry (also known as Foxconn) is seeing massive growth for AI in cloud and networking. The rally could have also been driven by anticipation of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang giving the keynote address at CES, a major technology conference in Las Vegas. However, Nvidia pulled back 6.2% on Tuesday after Huang's keynote.\n\nNvidia will report its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 26. Analyst consensus estimates call for $2.95 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share and $4.43 in fiscal 2026 earnings per share -- implying year-over-year growth of 50%. So it's worth understanding that there are lofty expectations already baked into Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50.6.\n\nThe power of earnings growth\n\nNvidia is by no means a cheap stock based on near-term expectations. But it could grow into its valuation over time if it continues innovating and sees sustained product demand.\n\nNo force is more powerful in the stock market than earnings growth. Earnings growth can justify a premium valuation and make a stock quickly look cheap.\n\nFor example, if Nvidia stock returns 20% per year over the next five years but averages 30% earnings growth in that period, its forward P/E will decline from its current level of around 51 to under 30.\n\nThis lesson demonstrates why excellent earnings growth can make expensive stocks look like a good value for long-term investors. As long as Nvidia continues on its path, it should have no problem outperforming the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). However, if there's a major industrywide slowdown or competition heats up, it wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia sell off.\n\nA person sitting at a table, looking calmly at a laptop computer.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRapidly growing earnings sets Nvidia apart\n\nNvidia has been at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry. Earnings are soaring, and so is the stock price. But for earnings to keep going up, Nvidia has to lap its difficult comps. That could become challenging if the investment cycle enters a slowdown or less expensive alternatives, like chips made by Advanced Micro Devices, eat away at some of Nvidia's market share.\n\nThe buy case for Nvidia is quite simple. If you believe the company will remain a long-term winner in AI, the stock is worth buying and holding. But it's worth understanding that Nvidia's sky-high operating margins, market share, and growth rate may not be sustainable over the long term.\n\nEven if revenue growth remains strong, Nvidia's earnings growth could fall if its margins come down. Nvidia's trailing 12-month gross margin is 75.9%, and its operating margin is 62.7% -- meaning it's converting the majority of sales into operating income, a truly unbelievable feat.\n\nBut earnings growth can slow down\n\nNvidia's high profitability comes from the ability to set premium prices for its products, which deep-pocketed customers willingly pay to further their AI ambitions. If those customers aren't able to monetize AI as well as they hoped, they could slow their pace of AI spending, which would affect Nvidia even if it continues cranking out great products. Put another way, Nvidia needs to continue making great products, and its customers must be able to afford those products. For example, companies can spend money on Nvidia computing hardware for self-driving vehicles, but those vehicles must sell to justify future order volumes.\n\nJust as the buy case for Nvidia is fairly straightforward, I think the reasons to keep it on a watchlist are also simple. Some investors may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to how Nvidia handles mounting competition, how it performs in an industry slowdown, and if it can continue to be the undisputed industry leader.\n\nNvidia has been at the top of its game, uninterrupted, for a couple of years now. If it keeps it up, it's easy to see how Nvidia could become the most valuable company in the world and maintain position. But it's also possible that spending on AI could flatline for a few years, or that some unforeseen challenges will appear that hinder Nvidia's ability to grow.\n\nApproaching an investment in Nvidia\n\nNvidia is priced for strong and sustained growth, but not for perfection. Despite the run-up, it doesn't have a nose-bleed valuation. Instead of trying to time the market, it's better to do some research and decide where you stand on Nvidia.\n\nIf you decide not to buy the stock now and keep it on a watchlist, it's important to have clearly defined reasons for what needs to change to consider buying the stock. That way, you can ensure you are using business performance as a measuring stick, and not the stock price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

            "article_content": "On Saturday, the new exhibition area \"Quantum computers \u2013 Supercomputers of the next generation\" opened at the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum (HNF). The exhibition was curated by physicist and educator Dr. David Woitkowski. It is the first exhibition on the subject of quantum computers in a German museum. The Paderborn HNF is the largest computer museum in the world and presents the history of 5000 years of information technology from cuneiform writing to artificial intelligence in its permanent exhibition.\n\nAnzeige\n\n\"Are we at the dawn of a new information age? Are quantum computers replacing our tried-and-tested digital calculating machines as the new supercomputers?\" asks Dr. Jochen Viehoff, Managing Director of the HNF, when introducing the new department. \"With this new department, we want to venture a look into the future of computers and present a technology that seems to contradict our previous experience.\"\n\nThe United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. Various events will take place throughout Germany throughout the year, and the Paderborn activities are part of the German program.\n\nThe largest quantum bit in the world\n\nAt the center of the exhibition is the \"world's largest quantum bit\": two glowing spheres that are intended to introduce visitors to the concepts of superposition and entanglement.\n\nQuantum bits, or qubits for short, are the basic building blocks of quantum computers. They consist of tiny building blocks that obey the rules of quantum physics. The exhibition focuses in particular on the question of what these qubits are made of. Information panels and demonstrators present four different approaches: superconducting qubits, photons, ions and nuclear spins.\n\nThe \"chandelier\" (provided by Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich) is often used to illustrate a quantum computer. However, this is only used to cool the actual quantum processor, which is installed inside. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nMany of the exhibits come from real research. For example, the exhibition features a \"chandelier cryostat\" from the J\u00fclich Research Center, in which superconducting qubits are installed. An adjacent screen with touch function clearly visualizes what the various components are used for and where the actual quantum processor is located.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe HNF also presents the experimental setup of a photonic quantum algorithm according to David Deutsch. The aim of this is to use entangled photons, i.e. particles of light, to distinguish a correct coin from a counterfeit coin in just one step.\n\nCurator David Woitkowski demonstrates the Deutsch algorithm with the aid of various mirrors, beam splitters and other optical components. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nOne of the ion traps on display once belonged to Nobel Prize winner Wolfgang Paul. A shoebox-sized quantum computer from the Chinese company SpinQ with two qubits will demonstrate small programs. Another exhibit illustrates Lov Grover's quantum search algorithm using a detailed hidden object picture. A news ticker will provide information on the latest developments, such as the breakthrough in effective error correction by a Google research team, which they recently demonstrated using their latest chip \"Willow\".\n\nAfter the official opening on Saturday evening, numerous visitors crowded into the exhibition, tried out the exhibits and discussed them with experts on site. Some were excitedly debating which architecture would prevail. For others, the possible areas of application for quantum computers were too short. The exhibition thus successfully introduces laypeople to quantum physics and encourages them to think about it.\n\nAnniversary year Nixdorf100\n\nThe opening of the quantum computer area marks the beginning of the Nixdorf100 anniversary year, with which the HNF is celebrating the 100th birthday of Heinz Nixdorf on April 9, 2025. \"With the development of the quantum computer, we are on the brink of a new dawn, just as Heinz Nixdorf dared to do in the 1950s to enter the age of electronics and computers,\" says Viehoff. Over the next twelve months, the HNF will be presenting new exhibition areas, events and various activities.\n\nNobel Prize winner Wolfgang Paul already worked with this ion trap in 1985. It can store dye particles for months and manipulate them electrically. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nHeinz Nixdorf was a German entrepreneur, engineer and pioneer of the computer industry. He founded Nixdorf Computer AG in 1952, which became one of the largest computer companies in Europe under his leadership. Nixdorf was known for his vision of providing powerful and affordable computers for medium-sized companies, which contributed significantly to the digitalization of Germany. He was born in Paderborn in 1925 and died in Hanover in 1986. One of his sons, Martin Nixdorf, became Chairman of the Board of the Heinz Nixdorf Foundation and the Westphalia Foundation.\n\n(spa)"

            "article_content": "The elixir of life: When AI meets genomics\n\nDr. Khaled Walid Mahmoud\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) and genetic engineering represents an unprecedented turning point in human history. By merging digital capabilities with biology, these fields are unlocking the secrets of life and reshaping it in profound ways. Among the leaders in this transformative era is the biotech company Shift Bioscience, which recently secured $16 million in seed funding to support its groundbreaking research on reversing aging. Utilizing generative AI, the company simulates human cells to identify genes capable of rejuvenation, paving the way for treatments aimed at slowing or even reversing the effects of aging.\n\nHowever, this scientific leap forward is intertwined with deeper complexities concerning humanity\u2019s understanding of existence and the boundaries of scientific intervention. Genomics, one of the most intricate sciences, deciphers the DNA code that holds information about our biological history, present, and future. Dubbed the \u201celixir of life,\u201d genomics enables humans to correct genetic mutations that impact health. Yet, it also raises thorny ethical questions about the limits of genetic modification and its implications for human nature itself.\n\nAI excels in tackling the challenges inherent in this complexity. With tools like CRISPR-Cas9, precise genetic modifications can now correct hereditary errors responsible for various diseases. Advanced technologies such as DeepCRISPR and CRISPR-Net enhance the accuracy of these modifications and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. AI not only identifies target genes but also designs guide RNA sequences to ensure precise execution of genetic edits. These extraordinary capabilities are redefining our relationship with our bodies, making it possible to predict future diseases, prevent them, and even improve genetic traits before future generations are born.\n\nDespite these advancements, the scientific revolution is not without its challenges and risks. While scientists pursue the dream of biological immortality, privacy concerns emerge as one of the most significant threats. Genetic data analysis, also known as genetic fingerprinting, reveals the biological secrets of individuals, which could potentially be exploited to develop biological weapons or invade personal privacy. Without robust legal and ethical frameworks, these technologies become a double-edged sword\u2014either enhancing human well-being or exposing humanity to exploitation.\n\nBeyond ethical risks, humanity faces new challenges related to increasing reliance on technology. A notable example is the impact of modern devices like GPS systems on the human brain. Studies show that drivers who rely on these systems experience shrinkage in brain regions responsible for navigation, while those who rely on natural skills maintain the health of these areas. This \u201ctechnological colonization,\u201d which threatens to undermine human capabilities, raises questions about the price we pay for technological progress.\n\nThe ongoing scientific revolution is not merely about technical achievements; it is a test of our ethical and human values. Genetic modification and anti-aging technologies may bring biological immortality closer to reality, but the larger question remains: How do we balance scientific ambition with the preservation of human essence? While AI delves into the \u201cbiological library\u201d within our bodies, humanity bears the responsibility of ensuring these innovations serve, rather than dominate, us.\n\nThis complex question gains urgency as scientific progress accelerates, tempting some to prioritize profit or power over ethics. It is crucial to establish regulatory frameworks to govern the use of genetic data and protect it from misuse. Yet, regulations alone are insufficient; societies need a collective awareness of the importance of balancing technological progress with respect for human values.\n\nAs AI and genetic engineering open unprecedented doors to enhancing and prolonging life, the greatest challenge remains ensuring that these innovations reflect our shared aspiration for a more humane and secure future. Technology, with all its potential, is merely a tool; its true value lies in how it is used to serve humanity.\n\nGenomics stands as humanity\u2019s most ambitious and transformative scientific pursuit\u2014a profound journey to decipher the very code of life and reshape its narrative. In unraveling the mysteries of DNA, we are not merely advancing the boundaries of biology; we are fundamentally redefining what it means to be human. This monumental endeavor holds the promise of becoming the ultimate \u201celixir of life,\u201d capable of curing diseases, extending longevity, and enhancing our existence. Yet, it also carries the weight of profound ethical and societal challenges. The true legacy of genomics will be determined by our capacity to wield its power with wisdom, foresight, and responsibility.\n\nThe writer is a researcher specializing in cyber politics, holding a PhD on the topic of \u201cCyberspace and Power Shifts in International Relations.\u201d"
