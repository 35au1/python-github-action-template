        "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nThree years ago, Missouri resident Justin Johnson captured video of a strange, cube-shaped silver UFO that appeared to be spinning in place in the sky. He is still looking for help identifying it.\n\n\u201cThat thing\u2019s a cube with lights!\u201d Johnson shouts on the video.\n\nAfter recording the strange cube-shaped UFO on his phone, he reached out to people who launch weather balloons and nearby air traffic controllers to see if they could shed any light on what he had seen. No one could give him an answer.\n\nHe believes the object was flying just a few hundred feet in the air, but when he tried to follow it in his pickup truck, it disappeared.\n\nJustin Johnson isn\u2019t alone in his quest for answers about UFOs that have been spotted in the skies above Missouri. Nor is the cube-shaped UFO the only time he has spotted and filmed something unexplained in the sky.\n\nSeeking answers, Johnson uploaded his videos to an app that launched in May called Enigma that calls itself \u201cthe first Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP/UFO) sightings alert network.\u201d\n\nEnigma says its mission is \u201cTo advance progress on UAP using cutting-edge technology and social intelligence. Only through thoughtful, open-minded study of unidentified phenomena can we get answers. We are focused on building and keeping our team low profile for privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of sightings that we get are misinterpretations of something mundane,\u201d Alejandro Rojas, a consultant to Enigma Labs, told KMBC News.\n\nHowever, with nearly 20,000 videos and UFO sighting reports to review, Enigma isn\u2019t ruling anything out.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of great possibilities out there. But we just don\u2019t know. We really need to follow that data to figure it out,\u201d Rojas said.\n\nJohnson, too, isn\u2019t giving up hope.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of finding out something that can change humanity forever. This is all very exciting to me,\u201d he said."

        "article_content": "\"The Man Who Loved UFOs\" is a satirical foreign film that just landed on Netflix and hailing from Argentina that takes a nostalgic approach to the subject of flying saucers and the hysteria, fear, and misinformation these sightings spawn. It might not be on your immediate radar, but it demands a viewing for its semi-comedic examination of the nature of hype, media fabrications, and the need to believe.\n\nDirected by Argentinian filmmaker Diego Lerman and starring Leonardo Sbaraglia and Sergio Prina, this inspired production centers around the true tale of eccentric TV journalist Jos\u00e9 de Zer, who in 1986 ventured to a remote village where strange lights and a hillside burn mark were reported. When he discovers all is not as it seems, he invents an elaborate UFO hoax to create the best-known audiovisual recording on the existence of extraterrestrials in the history of Argentinian television, in turn boosting his own level of fame along with the TV station's ratings.\n\nIn the wake of its world premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival in September, this interesting indie sci-fi film has found a home on Netflix where it debuted on Oct. 18. The English dub is sub-par so we'd recommend watching it with the default Spanish accompanied by English subtitles.\n\nLeonardo Sbaraglia stars in \"The Man Who Loved UFOs.\" (Image credit: Netflix)\n\nWhen de Zer is approached by a pair of mining company owners with a business proposal to drum up interest in their town by using purported paranormal sightings as a means to attract tourists and raise real estate values, he and his cameraman Chango pack their bags and travel to the site of the UFO phenomenon near the small mountain village of La Candelaria in the province of C\u00f3rdoba,\n\nOnce in the rustic town, de Zer and Chango take a horseback ride up to investigate a mysterious circular mark burned into the grassy foothills of the nearby mountain, purported to be the landing zone of an alien craft. The site is surrounded by local villagers and police and a grizzled man who claims his grandson witnessed an alien encounter that turned his hair white.\n\nLerman (\"Refugee,\" \"A Sort of Family\") co-wrote the script with Adri\u00e1n Biniez and their narrative takes real-life events and blurs the line between fiction, dreams, and reality with equal measure.\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\n\"Well, this is a film that I wanted to do for many years,\" Lerman told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I used to spend vacation time in Cordoba where the story takes place, so I remember stories, and I always wanted to write something about it. I remembered the character of Jose, so I started researching and that made me think that there was an interesting film to do about him and the origin of fake news, for example.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"It is also a film about beliefs, the mystery of what can be or not be, the sense of life or the mystery of death. So underlying, in a more serious way, is a film about that: belief, what you can call religion, or whatever you want, whatever you choose.\"\n\nOnce back at the TV studio with the initial footage, de Zer's boss is apprehensive about this sort of sketchy tabloid entertainment material, but the aging reporter convinces him that there's journalistic gold in broadcasting a fantastical story as counterprogramming to all the usual economic and political turmoil.\n\nWhen the hype machine kicks into high gear and this UFO story goes global, de Zer and Chango must keep cultivating more sensational footage and evidence by recruiting reluctant residents and urging them to recite pre-rehearsed statements, unearthing phony rock paintings, planting dead beetles, and gathering squealing goats for effect. As pressure mounts to continue the charade after ratings soar, de Zer suffers exhaustion, visions, depression, and a definite touch of madness.\n\nA scene from \"The Man Who Loved UFOs.\" (Image credit: Netflix)\n\nPortraying the obsessed investigative journalist de Zer, Sbaraglia turns in an exceptional performance in this compelling and sometimes uneven film that delves into the most famous case of paranormal journalism in the history of Argentinian television. It was a true media circus that attracted considerable attention by the public at the time, though few can recall its impact in those innocent pre-internet days. The movie does get a bit lost in its own drama, but never loses its charm.\n\nAre we alone? Perhaps, but not with this provocative foreign film as a temporary companion. \"The Man Who Loved UFOs\" is currently screening exclusively on Netflix."

'' said McCaslin, recalling that flight four decades ago.\n\n\"We asked, 'What are we looking for?'\n\n\"They said, 'You'll know it if you see it,' '' McCaslin said.\n\n\"This is a dim memory,\" he added, \"but I think one of the pilots said, 'Are the missile crews seeing things again?'''\n\nMcCaslin's first move was to focus the plane's radar into a narrow, high-intensity beam.\n\n\"I saw a (radar) return off to our right; it was faint on the first sweep and then it was very strong on the next sweep,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen McCaslin informed the pilots about the contact, they replied they couldn't see anything because of cloud cover, but asked him to keep them apprised of what the object did.\n\nWhat it did, McCaslin said, was move faster than anything he had ever clocked on radar.\n\n\"From one sweep (of the radar) to the next, it came from three miles to one mile,\" he said. \"Later, we computed the closure speed at 3,000 miles an hour.\"\n\nFrom there, it only got stranger.\n\n\"It blew my mind that this thing had closed on us this quickly,\" said McCaslin, who recalled that as he advised the pilots of what the object was doing, the bomber lost radio contact with the tower.\n\n\"We could hear them, but they couldn't hear us,\" he said.\n\nA short while later, the object dropped from the plane's radar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfficials in the tower also watched the blip disappear from radar and asked the bomber to fly lower in an attempt to regain contact.\n\nThis is a drawing by B-52 pilot Brad Runyon of a craft sighted October 1968 over the Minot Air Force Base. Bill McNeff / Special to The Forum\n\nAs the plane approached the spot where radar contact was lost, the crew finally saw something.\n\n\"The pilots indicated they could see it visually, just hovering above the ground,\" McCaslin recalled.\n\n\"They said to me, 'Why don't you unstrap and come up and take a look at this thing?' \" said McCaslin, who decided to stick close to his ejection seat.\n\n\"I didn't know what this thing was.\"\n\nShortly after the pilot and co-pilot began observing the mysterious, glowing object, it rose quickly into the sky and disappeared.\n\nLong witness list\n\nWhile the bomber crew members were making their observations, workers on the ground were seeing something similar and reacting to alarms going off at one of the Minuteman missile silos near the Minot air base, said Bill McNeff, who heard parts of the story firsthand from a brother-in-law who worked as a security guard at the air base in 1968.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMcNeff, a retired electrical engineer living in the Twin Cities and a former director of the Minnesota chapter of the Mutual UFO Network, said the Minot incident was one of the things that inspired him to pursue decades of research into UFO phenomenon.His quest led him in the 1980s to the National Archives in Washington, where he poured over the files of Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Air Force inquiry into reports of unidentified flying objects in the 1950s and '60s.\n\n\"There were incidents (during the Minot episode) that did not make it into the Blue Book files,\" said McNeff, who added the official record doesn't reflect that two airmen passed out after a close approach from the UFO.\n\nHe said a report that the lid of a missile silo was tampered with was also left out.\n\n\"What I learned later is that the lid was completely off the silo and lying on the grass,\" McNeff said.\n\n'Patternicity'\n\nMcNeff said the Minot case ranks among the most intriguing of all UFO sightings because of the number of witnesses and its proximity to a heavily guarded nuclear installation.\n\nThose factors don't impress Michael Schermer.\n\nSchermer, the publisher of Skeptic magazine and founder of the Skeptics Society, shakes his head at any suggestion UFOs are anything more than earthly events that have yet to be explained.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What the public has done is equate 'UFO' with 'extraterrestrial spaceship,' but to date we don't have a shred of evidence that any of the sightings represent extraterrestrial,\" Schermer said.\n\nHe said the Minot case, with its radar contact indicating an object that moved extremely fast, is interesting, but proves nothing.\n\nIn this 2003 Forum file photo, a B-52 takes off while another sits on the runway at Minot Air Force Base.\n\n\"How do you know it just wasn't one branch of the military not telling the other branch of the military what they're doing? That happens all the time.\" Schermer has coined a term for why some equate UFOs with visits from outer space.\n\n\"I call it patternicity, the tendency to find meaningful patterns in random noise,\" he said.\n\n\"Basically, our brains are wired to always find an explanation even if there isn't one,\" he said. \"In other words, we have a low tolerance for ambiguity.\"\n\nVega schmayga\n\nMcCaslin, who eventually became a pilot and later a high school science teacher in Texas, where he still lives, doesn't know if what showed up on his radar that night 40 years ago came from outer space or inner space.\n\nBut he said one of the explanations the Air Force came up with - that his bomber crew was looking at a star called Vega - is hogwash.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWell, he actually used a stronger noun.\n\nAnd his irritation with the official story is still evident after four decades.\n\n\"My business was to navigate with several means, the star Vega for one,\" he said. \"This thing was at or near the ground. How could it be a star if you're looking at the ground?\"\n\nWhen TV specials air interviews with McCaslin, his neighbors will approach him and ask if he believes in UFOs.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I tell them. I believe what I saw that night. I'm not ready to accept all the things that you see out there - about alien abduction and all that - because I didn't have that experience.\n\n\"It would be a leap in logic to say it came from outer space,\" McCaslin said.\n\n\"It could have come from inner space,\" he said. \"It could have come from anywhere.\"\n\nScientist says some UFO reports worth pondering\n\nStories about a B-52 bomber's encounter with an unidentified flying object in North Dakota in October 1968 pop up on many Web sites.\n\nIn one posting, Twin Cities-based UFO researcher Bill McNeff relates what co-pilot Brad Runyon reported seeing in the early morning hours on that day 40 years ago.\n\nRunyon described an object more than 200 feet in diameter and hundreds of feet long.\n\nHe said the object had a metallic cylinder attached to one end, with a crescent moon-shaped section glowing yellow-green connected to the cylinder.\n\nThis page on UFOcasebook.com details the 1968 UFO encounter of a B-52 crew from Minot Air Force Base.\n\nMany scientists dismiss UFO sightings as unremarkable.\n\nMany, but not all.\n\n\"My perspective is there's certainly something going on. I don't know what it is,\" said Bernard Haisch, an astrophysicist and author of more than 130 scientific publications.\n\nHaisch believes the UFO question deserves to be pondered by the scientific community, even if 99 percent of reports are explainable or hoaxed.\n\n\"There's still a huge amount of data that is potentially useful,\" said Haisch, who operates a Web site called ufoskeptic.org .\n\nHe defines \"skeptic\" as someone wary of extraordinary explanations for perplexing mysteries who is also willing to look at data.\n\nWith the rise of string theory - which allows for the possibility of multiple universes - Haisch finds it odd that physicists are usually the first to scoff at the idea of visitors from other worlds.\n\n\"It's kind of a strange situation,\" he said.\n\nThomas McDonough, senior scientist with a group called The Skeptics Society, grew up believing in the paranormal, but gradually became a doubter.\n\n\"There are so many ways people can be fooled,\" said McDonough, who like Haisch is from California and has a Ph.D. in astrophysics.\n\nAbsent tangible evidence, McDonough said he has concluded that the Earth is not being visited by aliens.\n\nHowever, he's keeping the door open to possibilities.\n\n\"Every now and then in science, someone comes along with a weird story that leads to something new.\n\n\"But most times,\" he said, \"the weird stories lead to something mundane.\""

Each functions the same way - you click, and speak through the mic, and there's no Hume account required if you want to give it a go.\n\nI asked the Quick Answers chatbot how tall the Eiffel Tower is, and got, well, a quick answer, followed by additional information about how it's been added to over time, and how big certain sections of it are.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

It repeated lines, and even changed voice at one point which was pretty jarring, but it was happy to receive additional prompts to help direct the flow of the story (sadly, the story it provided, of a car called Cara looking for a power source, is unlikely to win any awards any time soon.\n\nOn the other hand, there's some overlap between some of the voices, and I actually found that a nice way of acknowledging there's no one true answer.\n\nI asked the Spirituality voice how I could better live in the moment, and it suggested feeling the breeze through my hair, the sun on my skin, and that I try eating a mango, bizarrely.\n\nThe same prompt on the Deeper Questions bot prompted smelling my morning coffee, and the way sunlight hits a desk for some reason.

Yeah you use technology, but not well.\u201d\n\n3 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has the ability to whip up a resume or cover letter in less than five minutes based on information you feed it. BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf you\u2019re using an AI-generated job application with an AI-powered assistant to help you, you\u2019re not the only one. Hundreds of other candidates likely had the same idea, and your sentence structures and formatting will read similarly to theirs.\n\nFor example, Dilber noted that the \u201cWhy are you interested in this position?\u201d question on a job application often generates the same word-for-word response through ChatGPT of \u201cCompany\u2019s mission of \u2018insert mission statement\u2019 resonates with me and my experience in \u2018insert their current job.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter seeing this exact same response over and over again, it becomes clear that the candidates are all using AI,\u201d she said.\n\nAI even generates the same anecdotes for potential candidates. On the Zapier job application, it asks applicants about about how to use their product, which automates tasks.\n\n\u201cA bunch of people all came up with the same use case of a flower shop,\u201d Dilber explained. \u201cFirst time I saw it, it was cute. The next few times, it becomes obvious they all plugged this into the same tool.\u201d\n\n3 \u201cAfter seeing this exact same response over and over again, it becomes clear that the candidates are all using AI,\u201d she said. Thaspol \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nRecruiters advise that if you\u2019re going to use ChatGPT, it should be used simply as a starting point or to help with a first draft, but you need to be sure to edit it and make it personal to your experiences, making your job application \u201ctargeted and not templated.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can ask ChatGPT to break down a job description or identify the most relevant skills and experiences for the position you\u2019re applying to,\u201d Wagadia said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have five targeted applications where you put in effort than 100 where the other person can clearly tell that you\u2019re not interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the company was simply looking for AI-generated work, they\u2019d use an AI tool,\u201d Dilber added. \u201cThey are trying to hire a human for the unique things only humans can offer, so make sure your application showcases that.\u201d"

        "article_content": "\"The Man Who Loved UFOs\" is a satirical foreign film that just landed on Netflix and hailing from Argentina that takes a nostalgic approach to the subject of flying saucers and the hysteria, fear, and misinformation these sightings spawn. It might not be on your immediate radar, but it demands a viewing for its semi-comedic examination of the nature of hype, media fabrications, and the need to believe.\n\nDirected by Argentinian filmmaker Diego Lerman and starring Leonardo Sbaraglia and Sergio Prina, this inspired production centers around the true tale of eccentric TV journalist Jos\u00e9 de Zer, who in 1986 ventured to a remote village where strange lights and a hillside burn mark were reported. When he discovers all is not as it seems, he invents an elaborate UFO hoax to create the best-known audiovisual recording on the existence of extraterrestrials in the history of Argentinian television, in turn boosting his own level of fame along with the TV station's ratings.\n\nIn the wake of its world premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival in September, this interesting indie sci-fi film has found a home on Netflix where it debuted on Oct. 18. The English dub is sub-par so we'd recommend watching it with the default Spanish accompanied by English subtitles.\n\nLeonardo Sbaraglia stars in \"The Man Who Loved UFOs.\" (Image credit: Netflix)\n\nWhen de Zer is approached by a pair of mining company owners with a business proposal to drum up interest in their town by using purported paranormal sightings as a means to attract tourists and raise real estate values, he and his cameraman Chango pack their bags and travel to the site of the UFO phenomenon near the small mountain village of La Candelaria in the province of C\u00f3rdoba,\n\nOnce in the rustic town, de Zer and Chango take a horseback ride up to investigate a mysterious circular mark burned into the grassy foothills of the nearby mountain, purported to be the landing zone of an alien craft. The site is surrounded by local villagers and police and a grizzled man who claims his grandson witnessed an alien encounter that turned his hair white.\n\nLerman (\"Refugee,\" \"A Sort of Family\") co-wrote the script with Adri\u00e1n Biniez and their narrative takes real-life events and blurs the line between fiction, dreams, and reality with equal measure.\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\n\"Well, this is a film that I wanted to do for many years,\" Lerman told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I used to spend vacation time in Cordoba where the story takes place, so I remember stories, and I always wanted to write something about it. I remembered the character of Jose, so I started researching and that made me think that there was an interesting film to do about him and the origin of fake news, for example.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"It is also a film about beliefs, the mystery of what can be or not be, the sense of life or the mystery of death. So underlying, in a more serious way, is a film about that: belief, what you can call religion, or whatever you want, whatever you choose.\"\n\nOnce back at the TV studio with the initial footage, de Zer's boss is apprehensive about this sort of sketchy tabloid entertainment material, but the aging reporter convinces him that there's journalistic gold in broadcasting a fantastical story as counterprogramming to all the usual economic and political turmoil.\n\nWhen the hype machine kicks into high gear and this UFO story goes global, de Zer and Chango must keep cultivating more sensational footage and evidence by recruiting reluctant residents and urging them to recite pre-rehearsed statements, unearthing phony rock paintings, planting dead beetles, and gathering squealing goats for effect. As pressure mounts to continue the charade after ratings soar, de Zer suffers exhaustion, visions, depression, and a definite touch of madness.\n\nA scene from \"The Man Who Loved UFOs.\" (Image credit: Netflix)\n\nPortraying the obsessed investigative journalist de Zer, Sbaraglia turns in an exceptional performance in this compelling and sometimes uneven film that delves into the most famous case of paranormal journalism in the history of Argentinian television. It was a true media circus that attracted considerable attention by the public at the time, though few can recall its impact in those innocent pre-internet days. The movie does get a bit lost in its own drama, but never loses its charm.\n\nAre we alone? Perhaps, but not with this provocative foreign film as a temporary companion. \"The Man Who Loved UFOs\" is currently screening exclusively on Netflix."

This technology finds identities with leaked credentials and their potential impact. DetentionDodger will list all the identities with a Quarantine Policy (version 1-3) and look for failed policy attachments of a Quarantine Policy in CloudTrail Logs to generate a list of users with leaked credentials. It also lists all the inline and attached policies of the user and each group it is part of to determine the impact based on privileges.\n\n\n\nBucketShield is a monitoring and alerting system built for AWS S3 buckets and CloudTrail logs. It ensures the consistent flow of logs from AWS services into S3 buckets and mitigates potential misconfigurations that could interrupt log collection. With real-time tracking of IAM roles, KMS configurations and S3 log flows, BucketShield ensures that every critical event is recorded and a cloud instance remains audit-ready."
