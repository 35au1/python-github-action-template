            "article_content": "If 2024 is going to be remembered for anything, it likely will be remembered as the first year that generative AI took hold of the cultural zeitgeist. It seemed everywhere you looked, you saw something about AI. At Google, the company went all-in on AI, injecting its Gemini systems into pretty much every product and service it offers.\n\nAs it turns out, this also applies to its security teams. The Google Play security team, for example, just released its annual report on what\u2019s been happening behind the scenes as they protect us all from harmful apps, bad developers, malware, and other issues. In 2024, this team stopped more bad apps than any other year prior \u2014 2.36 million apps, to be precise, which is wild to even think about. Google says that AI played a considerable role here.\n\nAccording to Google, human app reviewers on the Google Play security team used AI in their work in 92% of cases. That\u2019s a massive amount. Google claims AI tools help the team act more quickly and take more accurate action against developers who are trying to sneak bad apps onto the Play Store.\n\nThe Google Play security team is not the only way we are protected from bad apps, though. In 2024, Google also introduced a bunch of new security features to its Play Protect service that prevent attackers that do get through its defenses from doing any significant harm to you. Here are three examples:\n\nReminder to turn on Play Protect: The Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks. Sometimes, user turn this feature off so that they can install something they know to be safe. To help prevent attacks during this Play Protect downtime, Chrome now reminds users to turn Play Protect back on if it has been turned off.\n\nThe Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks.

Disabling Play Protect toggle during calls: One method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call. To combat this, Android now disables the Play Protect toggle during both regular calls as well as voice calls through popular chat apps. In order to toggle Play Protect off, you would need to end the call first, which will hopefully be enough time for the user to figure out that that\u2019s not a great idea.\n\nOne method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call.

Automatic permissions revoking: When you install and use an app, you sometimes need to grant it permissions. Sometimes, the app you\u2019ve installed is malicious, and the permissions you\u2019ve granted it put you in danger. Now, Play Protect automatically revokes permissions for apps like these. The user can still manually restore those permissions if they want to, but once again, this will give that malicious app less of an opening to do any damage.\n\nConsidering how many Android devices are out there (over two billion) and how open the Android ecosystem is compared to other operating systems, it\u2019s a wonder it isn\u2019t completely overrun with bad actors. Many people reading this have likely never faced a significant security problem on their Android device, which is a direct result of what the Google Play security team does every day."

Sign up here to get our Paranormal PA newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nBy all accounts, Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s life is pretty sweet.\n\nHe\u2019s immortal. He\u2019s got a great wife and kids. And his only job requirement is going outside once a year.\n\nBut before anyone poo-poos what many view as one of Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2014 or, indeed, the country\u2019s \u2014 more bizarre traditions, Paranormal Pa. will have you know that Phil is a product of a storied tradition (and superstition) that stretches back for years and years.\n\nGerman immigrants brought the tradition over when they settled in Pennsylvania hundreds of years ago. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nThe Punsutawney Groundhog Club explains how the first time \u201cWeather Wags\u201d recognized Groundhog Day was in 1886, although the first official trek to Gobbler\u2019s Knob was the following year.\n\nBut the concept of having animals predict the weather goes way back before the 19th century. According to the Library of Congress Blogs, Groundhog Day\u2019s lineage can be traced back to ancient pre-Christian festivals celebrated by the Celts that served as midway points between equinoxes. Halloween \u2014 originally Samhain \u2014 falls into this category, too.\n\nFormerly known as \u201cImbolc\u201d before it eventually became the Christianized Candlemas, Groundhog Day was once considered the first day of spring. And while little is known about how the Celts celebrated the day, one traditional practice was attempting to divine the weather.\n\nNow, here\u2019s how animals figure into this: Ancient people used to observe animal behavior as part of their own farming practices, so the idea of watching how a groundhog to see whether or not spring was on its way makes sense.\n\nVisitPa.com adds how Roman legions, in their conquest of northern Europe, eventually spread the Candelmas Day tradition of candles being blessed and distributed. Those living in what\u2019s now Germany soon began to believe that if the sun made an appearance on the day, an animal who cast his shadow would predict six more weeks of cruddy weather.\n\nGroundhog Club President Tom Dunkel taps on the immortal groundhog's door so the weather oracle can make his prediction. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nIn his book \u201cGroundhog Day (2003),\u201d Dan Yoder writes how the Germans who brought this tradition over to the U.S. used to watch badgers to see how far away spring was (the German folk expression for the holiday was \u201cDachstag,\u201d or \u201cBadger Day\u201d). Then somewhere along the line, that badger became a groundhog.\n\nNot to say that early Groundhog Day celebrations in Pennsylvania didn\u2019t maintain a bit of their mysticism: Yoder describes late 19th century celebrations of involving ritualized Groundhog Hunts in September which drew in \u201cdevotees from Pittsburgh and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nOne parade in 1909, as staged by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, was deemed \u201cthe Circumgyratory Pageant of the Astrologers, Horoscopists, Magicians, Soothsayers, and Meteorological Attach\u00e9s of Punxsutawney Weather Works.\u201d A man named Clymer Freas \u2014 credited as conceiving of the idea for the holiday \u2014 even created \u201cGroundhogese,\u201d the language Groundhog Club presidents learn in order to discern the groundhog\u2019s annual predictions.\n\nThere may not be any more astrologists or soothsayers involved, but Groundhog Day remains a celebration: More than 30,000 people from across the globe drop by Knobbler\u2019s Creek on the day, getting up at the crack of dawn in the dead of winter to watch Phil make his prediction.\n\nTo be fair, though, even back in the day, people raised their eyebrows at the idea of watching a rodent predict how much longer winter would last.\n\n\u201cIn consequence, probably of having given all spiritual matters to the exclusive supervision of the clergy, newspaper editors are somewhat skeptical about many things which are popularly accepted with absolute faith,\u201d read an 1876 edition of the Harrisburg Daily Patriot.\n\n\u201cThis may account for the reason that some of them have failed to appreciate the sentiment\u2026in favor of a legal recognition of Ground Hog Day.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, editorial skepticism be damned, Groundhog Day won out, and did, indeed, spawn an industry. And inspired a Bill Murray movie. And tons of Punxsutawney wannabes like Staten Island Chuck, who did, it should be noted, tragically lost his life after former New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio quite literally fumbled him (never forget).\n\nYes, the holiday has come very far from its very old roots. And whether you\u2019re an eyebrow-raiser to the holiday or all-in, it doesn\u2019t look like Groundhog Day is going away any time soon.\n\nThat is, unless PETA has their way."

So, that's the coolest part about this building specifically.\"\n\nThe crew even attempts to contact one specific prisoner \u2014 Glenn \u2014 at the very spot he was murdered. \"Can you make this ball of light turn on?\" Bernstein asks, immediately resulting in a strange array of lights.\n\nWatch it all in Episode 11 directly below.\n\nREAD MORE: Inkcarceration Festival 2025 Full Daily Lineups Revealed\n\nAbout Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents\n\nInkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nConstruction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.\n\nFans are already looking forward to the 2025 installment, which takes place July 18, 29 and 20 with headliners Falling in Reverse, Slipknot and Five Finger Death Punch.\n\nInkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals. Since it's formation in 2011, DWP has become a leading promoter in heavy music and beyond, building up the U.S. festival circuit that dominates the spring, summer and fall months.\n\nThe DWP festival roster also includes Aftershock, Born & Raised, Bourbon & Beyond, Golden Sky Country Music Festival, Louder Than Life, Rocklahoma, Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville.\n\nVisit the Inkcarceration and DWP websites for more information."

Now a new study claims to have discovered a massive reserve of hydrogen beneath the earth surface which could power the planet for decades and centuries to come. The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

The company says these smarter Gemini features are targeted toward small business owners, marketers, or anyone else working with a lot of data in Google Sheets.\n\nSpecifically, Gemini in Sheets can now spot \"contextual trends, patterns, and correlations between different variables in your data\" when you ask it questions via the sidebar. From there, it can create charts from your data automatically when requested. You can insert those charts as images in your Google Sheets document, or use them elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough these features might seem simple, Gemini is doing some impressive work behind the scenes. For complex queries, Gemini is actually converting your written entries into Python code, executing the code, and drawing conclusions based on the result. This is how Gemini in Sheets can now provide multilayered analysis, according to Google.\n\nSimpler Gemini requests might leverage Sheets formulas instead of Python code, but the latter will help for larger and more complex needs. For instance, Google says Gemini in Sheets performs consistently in documents up to one million cells in size.\n\nCredit: Google\n\nTo get the best results, make sure your Gemini prompts are clear and specific. In your document, use consistent formats and organization techniques, like clear headers and complete values. Remember that since graphs generated with Gemini are static images, they won't update when you update your cells. Instead, you'll need to generate a new graph when updating a document's contents.\n\nThese features are available starting today for paid Gemini in Workspace customers. That includes Business Standard and Plus users, Enterprise Standard and Plus users, customers with the Gemini Education or Gemini Education Premium add-ons, or Google One AI Premium subscribers. Legacy purchasers of Gemini Business and Enterprise will also get the Gemini in Sheets features.\n\nGoogle is using an extended rollout for these tools for both rapid and scheduled release Workspace domains. You'll start seeing these tools as of today, Jan. 29, 2025, but some users and domains may have to wait until Feb. 20, 2025 for completion."

            "article_content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Google has announced new features for Gemini in Google Sheets, aimed at making data analysis easier.\n\nGemini can now generate charts, analyze trends, and answer data-related questions, even running Python code for deeper insights.\n\nThese features are rolling out now and will be available to select Google Workspace and Google One AI Premium subscribers.\n\nIf spreadsheets have ever left you squinting at rows of data or scrambling to build charts, Gemini\u2019s latest update might be a welcome relief. The company announced today that its Gemini AI assistant, already embedded in Google Workspace apps, is learning some new tricks for Google Sheets.\n\nStarting today, Gemini in Sheets can process user queries to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within spreadsheet data. This means users can ask questions about their data and receive actionable insights without needing advanced technical skills. For example, a marketing analyst could request insights into their top-performing channels, while a financial analyst could use Gemini to detect anomalies in inventory levels.\n\nAnother major addition is Gemini\u2019s ability to generate charts based on spreadsheet data. These charts, inserted as static images, provide a visual representation of key insights but do not automatically update when the data changes.\n\nGemini in Sheets can now also translate user requests into Python code, execute that code, and analyze the results. This would allow for more complex data analysis, enabling users to identify trends and drill deeper into their findings \u2014 all without needing to write a single line of Python themselves. However, for simpler queries, Gemini may still rely on spreadsheet formulas instead of Python.\n\nTo ensure the best results, Google recommends that users maintain a clean and well-structured dataset, free of missing values, with clear headers. Additionally, Sheets with more than one million cells may experience performance limitations when using Gemini for complex analysis.\n\nThe new features are rolling out starting today, with a full rollout expected by February 20. For those eager to test out the new features, Gemini in Sheets can be accessed through the side panel in Google Sheets by clicking on the \u201cAsk Gemini\u201d button in the top-right corner.\n\nHowever, not all users will have immediate access. Gemini\u2019s expanded capabilities in Sheets will be available to subscribers of Google Workspace Business Standard and Plus, Enterprise Standard and Plus, as well as users with the Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium, or Google One AI Premium add-ons.\n\nGot a tip?

            "article_content": "Intentional gifts for the guests by Tyler Speier Events. | Credit: Courtesy\n\n\n\nWedding Trends\n\nWeekend Experiences, Bold Colors and Fabrics,\n\nDramatic Drapes, and More Trends for 2025\n\nBy Meaghan Clark Tiernan\n\nJanuary 30, 2025\n\nWhether you\u2019re newly engaged, almost nearly engaged, or just love weddings, this season\u2019s trends are all about elevating personality. We talked to local experts who mentioned everything from color to dining experiences as this season\u2019s trends, where couples revoke the traditional and instead prioritize the intentional.\n\nColor, Color, Color\n\nMinimalism is out, and bold, textured color that reflects a couple\u2019s personality is in. Textiles and fabrics can truly help liven up a space, and that\u2019s exactly what professionals in the wedding industry are expecting to see more of in 2025. Think less neutral, more personal, says Over the Moon Events & Experiences owner and creative director Krysta Stoddard. \u201cThere\u2019s so much freedom, design wise, when you start working with different elements and colors,\u201d she says. That can be anything from eccentric tablescapes covered in a dramatic textile to draping in uncommon colors and fabrics.\n\nDramatic Drapes\n\nAny space can be immediately transformed with draping, but a single sheath of chiffon isn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be steering away from the white and blushes, and instead people are getting adventurous and using more color,\u201d says Cristina Bentley, VP director of operations at Bella Vista Designs. \u201cAnd draping plays a huge part in that.\u201d Imagine an extra layer of elegance, where yards of deep green velvet or vibrant patterns help transform spaces into something lush and luxurious.\n\nBella Vista Designs, a premier production company that just celebrated 20 years in business, has been doing draping since day one. \u201cA trend that we\u2019re seeing with draping is a lot of asymmetries \u2014 so it\u2019s not just a flat wall \u2026 [but] very eclectic layers on top of layers,\u201d says Bentley.\n\nDrapery drama by Bella Vista Designs | Credit: James and Jess Photography\n\nIntentional Design\n\nThis year, with color playing a huge factor in design, there\u2019s a shift from traditional to personal. That\u2019s reflected in nontraditional color palettes, but also in every element throughout the event; people are not just going to offer gifts because they\u2019ve been told to. Instead, says Tyler Speier of Tyler Speier Events, couples are requesting \u201creally intentional pieces that tell a story.\u201d\n\nThose high-touch elements can appear in the form of elaborate lighting like huge lantern or globe installations, or custom dance floors that tie the whole space together. \u201cI think people are going to start getting really creative with their dance floors,\u201d says Stoddard. Vendors like RCD Dance Floors can incorporate a monogram or introduce a vinyl overlay that matches a color or floral scheme to transform the space.\n\nDress Codes\n\nGone are the days where guests just show up for the ceremony, a meal, and maybe a dance. Couples are planning weekend-long celebrations for everyone; think coordinated hikes, yoga retreats, and wine tastings. With fewer and fewer couples asking friends and family to be part of the \u201cofficial\u201d wedding party, says Stoddard, dress codes and color palettes for three days of activities means everyone is part of the wedding. \u201cNot only is the bride, groom, or anyone in the bridal party going to make some fashion statement, but I think people are going to start giving mood boards or dress codes to their guests,\u201d she says.\n\nInteractive Experiences\n\nFor much of the population getting hitched, they\u2019ve placed a particular emphasis on experience. Couples are vying for grabbing guests\u2019 attention in a world of ephemeral design, which translates to more interactive wedding experiences. \u201cThe focus is so much on the experience,\u201d says Speier, that everything down to the smells, sounds, and tastes is being curated.\n\nTraditionally, says Speier, the festivities centered around the dance floor at the reception. Today, weddings are steering more toward \u201csexier, elevated dinner parties,\u201d he says, which translates to separate rooms for cocktail hour, dancing, and dinner \u2014 each with its own \u201cwow moment.\u201d That experiential moment can come in the shape of a poet with a vintage typewriter coming to cocktail hour or custom scent bars or upscale taco bars like Nomada or oyster bars where chefs shuck.\n\nContent Creators\n\nAs we mentioned last year, industry experts expect the demand for content creators to rise. In line with the desire to create a \u201cfeeling,\u201d on-site content creators can give couples something others can\u2019t: real-time content. Capturing the real-life moments allows for everyone to put down their phones and be more present \u2014 a feeling that will enhance the overall guest experience."

            "article_content": "There has been a recent increase in specific types of cybersecurity breaches, data leaks, and supply chain attacks, all linked to compromises that begin during runtime on users\u2019 internet browsers. Traditional cybersecurity solutions lack the visibility and reach to detect, protect, and respond to such incidents.\n\nThe term Web Client Runtime Security (WCRS)1 was coined by the authors to highlight the security or possible malicious behavior of the code executed in users' browsers during their web interactions. While the code is served to users via the websites they visit, not all of it is written by the websites\u2019 owners or even hosted on the website. This complexity leads to vulnerabilities arising from the use of third-party code. It is important to note that such code is usually hosted and served dynamically at runtime from digital supply chain parties or even fourth- and fifth-party code loaded by those parties. The website owners, therefore, would have no control or means to assert the integrity of the code owned or maintained by the third party.\n\nThe 2024 Polyfill.io supply chain attack, where a trusted third-party script was replaced with a malicious one, may have affected more than 100,000 websites by some estimates.2 It is just one of the latest incidents involving exploitation at run-time in consumer web browsers. Cisco3, Everlast,4 and many other organizations5 have also had WCRS-related cybersecurity incidents in recent years. These incidents are in addition to other, earlier significant examples of Magecart-style attacks,6 which focused on skimming payment card data at prominent organizations such as British Airways, Ticketmaster, and many others.7 The WCRS-related breaches are not limited to those caused by adversarial threat issues. Breaches can also come from the unintended transfer of sensitive or regulated data to third parties. The recent incidents at Kaiser Permanente8 and the United States Department of Education9 are examples of such inadvertent breaches.\n\nThis preliminary article in a three-part series on WCRS introduces the concept to readers, emphasizes the importance of prioritizing WCRS in cybersecurity programs beyond traditional application security measures, and examines the risk and compliance drivers for implementing and operationalizing WCRS mechanisms.\n\nThe Need for Special Attention to WCRS\n\nWeb application security is not a new discipline. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10,10 the premier web application security awareness project for more than 20 years, demonstrates that organizations paid attention to web application security long before many of the modern web application threats were known or anticipated.\n\nHowever, historically the security industry has focused primarily on the server side of web applications rather than the client (browser) side at runtime. The nascent nature of WCRS is also evidenced by the fact that OWASP's work11 on this topic appears to have only started in 202212 and remains an incubator project.\n\nTraditional client-side vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), were often mitigated with server-side code changes that are either implemented by or at the behest of the hosting organization. It is only in recent years that client-side runtime security has started gaining prominence. This is primarily because internet browsers have become progressively function-rich in recent years, requiring organizational websites to rely increasingly on downstream (e.g., third or nth parties) sources for significant amounts of code that must be loaded dynamically from those sources at runtime.\n\nIt would also not be technically or operationally feasible for website owners to use traditional application security tests such as static application security testing (SAST)13 or dynamic application security testing (DAST)14 to ensure that the code provided by third parties or subsequent parties further downstream (nth parties) is not malicious. Further discussion in this series (part 2) delves into the details of why these and other traditional web applications security application tools or approaches are ineffective when mitigating WCRS risk.\n\nHistorically the security industry has focused primarily on the server side of web applications rather than the client (browser) side at runtime.\n\nOrganizations must, therefore, rely on a newer set of WCRS approaches or technology solutions to monitor the behavior of all code served by their websites and executed by the browser at run-time (i.e. during users\u2019 interactions with websites).\n\nRisk and Compliance Drivers\n\nWCRS must be a focus for any website that processes sensitive information or any information that might be of value to adversaries. As such, WCRS should be top of mind for most industries when protecting themselves against reputational or financial risk in the event of a data breach.\n\nWCRS is also relevant in the context of various security or privacy laws and regulations.\n\nPCI DSS\n\nPerhaps the earliest and most notable WCRS compromises, the Magecart-style attacks, were designed to skim payment card data on ecommerce websites. Given the frequency and severity of these attacks, it is no surprise that the Payment Card Industry (PCI) is the first to issue specific mandates focused on WCRS.\n\nFigure 1 outlines the PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) v4, which mandates two specific requirements that become mandatory on 31 March 2025.\n\nFigure 1\u2014PCI DDS v4 Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.115\n\n\n\nThe PCI DSS Sub-requirements appearing above have been extracted from the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, v4.0.1 and appear courtesy of PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. \u00a9 2006-2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved.\n\nHIPAA Security and Privacy Rules\n\nThe US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulates several aspects of the healthcare industry. While the HIPAA Security, Privacy, and Breach Notification Rules do not contain prescriptive WCRS requirements, the US Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has drawn attention to the WCRS issue through guidance bulletins.\n\nThe guidance bulletin issued on 26 June 2024 highlights \u201cthe obligations of [HIPAA Regulated Entities] under the [HIPAA Rules] when using online tracking technologies.\u201d16 In the bulletin, the OCR stresses that \u201cRegulated entities are not permitted to use tracking technologies in a manner that would result in impermissible disclosures of protected health information (PHI) to tracking technology vendors or any other violations of the HIPAA Rules. While it has always been true that regulated entities may not impermissibly disclose PHI to tracking technology vendors, because of the proliferation of tracking technologies collecting sensitive information, OCR is providing this reminder that it is critical for regulated entities to ensure that they disclose PHI only as expressly permitted or required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\u201d17\n\nThe OCR bulletin underscores the increasing challenge of preventing PHI data leaks to online tracking solution providers and the critical need for regulated entities to ensure that PHI is disclosed only in strict accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n\nFTC Health Breach Notification Rule\n\nThe United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the regulator for the Health Breach Notification Rule,18 which has been in effect since 2009 and applies to organizations that are not covered by the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule. The regulation covers vendors of personal health records (PHRs) and their third-party service providers.\n\nThe FTC also issued a recent amendment to the rule that went into effect on 29 July 2024.19 The amendment clarifies that the regulation also applies to organizations that collect user health information such as fitness trackers and wellness apps (e.g., for diet, diabetes, or blood pressure monitoring). Section I.B\u2013Enforcement History of the amendment includes two examples\u2014GoodRx and Easy Healthcare\u2014of FTC enforcements from 2023 that relate to WCRS.\n\nIt should also be noted that FTC issued a joint guidance with the US OCR in 2023 regarding online tracking technologies in websites and mobile apps20, to reinforce the need for healthcare and wellness organizations to pay attention to unauthorized malicious or inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information resulting from scripts or tracking technologies (such as cookies) at runtime.\n\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act\n\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act21 is a United States federal law first enacted in 1999. It mandates requirements for financial institutions regarding the protection of non-public personal information. The law is enforced by federal financial regulators, the FTC, and insurance authorities across different states in the United States. Recently the FTC enacted modifications to amend the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information rule, which became effective on 10 January 2022.22 While regulators have not issued specific mandates concerning WCRS, the broad definition of non-public personal information would require financial institutions to implement WCRS safeguards on their customer-facing websites.\n\nSection 5 of the FTC Act\n\nIn addition to the US FTC Breach Notification Rule and the US Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the FTC has enforcement power of yet another regulation that is broad in its scope and would almost certainly cover instances of breaches resulting from WCRS-related exploits. Section 5 of the FTC Act, Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices, applies to all persons and organizations engaged in commerce regardless of the industry.23 As can be seen in the FTC\u2019s clarification/statement on deception,24 it is reasonable to assume that organizations enduring a WCRS-related breach will likely be found in violation of the FTC Act, considering that most organizations\u2019 website privacy policies or statements include an assertion that they have implemented necessary security safeguards, including on their websites.\n\nSection 5 of the FTC Act is particularly noteworthy because the FTC can enforce it over and above other enforcement initiated by other federal or state-level regulators for the same incident, resulting in increased regulatory fines. A good example is the FTC\u2019s CVS Caremark enforcement in 2009.25 In this case, the organization, a HIPAA-regulated entity, had already undergone enforcement by the OCR for the same breach.\n\nFFIEC IT Examination Handbook\n\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is a federal interagency body of 5 banking regulators in the United States. The FFIEC publishes and maintains an IT Handbook, which includes booklets on various topics such as information security.26 This handbook provides principles and practices for banking examiners to review.\n\nWhile the Handbook does not mention WCRS specifically, the Information Security booklet27 contains the overarching requirements related to web application security. The most relevant to WCRS among them would be \u201cProtect web or Internet-facing applications through additional controls, including web application firewalls, regular scanning for new or recurring vulnerabilities, mitigation or remediation of common security weaknesses, and network segregation to limit inappropriate access or connections to the application or other areas of the network.\u201d28\n\nGDPR and Similar Privacy Laws\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)29 took effect in May 2018, establishing requirements for the processing and protection of personal data belonging to EU residents.\n\nAs it relates to WCRS, the GDPR\u2019s Article 5(1)(f) requires that personal data shall be \u201cprocessed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (\u2018integrity and confidentiality\u2019).\u201d 30\n\nIt is important to note that an effective WCRS implementation might have helped British Airways with the Magecart-related GDPR enforcement31 in 2020. In their penalty notice, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) states \u201cThe failures are especially serious in circumstances where it is unclear whether or when BA itself would ever have detected the breach. BA was only alerted to the exfiltration of personal data from its website by a third-party.\u201d32 Cybersecurity leaders under the purview of GDPR must act with prudence and consider implementing robust WCRS solutions to proactively detect and mitigate client-side threats.\n\nThe GDPR is not unique in requiring the implementation of appropriate safeguards, even if it does not include or prescribe WCRS safeguards. Similar regulations worldwide mandate the implementation of reasonable or appropriate safeguards.\n\nUS State-Level Regulations\n\nIn addition to the previously discussed US federal laws and regulations, most US states have their own mandates for privacy, protection of personal data, and breach notification requirements for their residents\u2019 data. This includes newer regulations that are focused on the protection of consumer health data. Some examples include the State of Washington\u2019s My Health My Data Act,33 the State of Connecticut\u2019s Substitute Bill No. 3,34 and the State of Nevada\u2019s SB370.35\n\nConclusion\n\nWCRS should be a key consideration for any organization that runs websites that process sensitive or regulated data due to the demonstrable security and privacy risk discussed in this article.

            "article_content": "Giant radio galaxies are cosmic megastructures that can span millions of light-years, making them some of the largest-known structures in the Universe.\n\nYet space is big, and despite their size, giant radio galaxies can be hard to find. Discovering one is a big deal, especially if it's as colossal \u2013 and peculiar \u2013 as one recently found by astronomers using South Africa's MeerKAT telescope.\n\nThe newly discovered galaxy measures over 3 million light-years from end to end, including the huge jets of hot plasma it's blasting into intergalactic space, the astronomers report in a new study.\n\nThat means it's more than 30 times the size of our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\nIt's also enigmatic, the researchers say, with unusual qualities that defy simple explanation. They decided to name it after this troublesome nature, choosing a word from two Bantu languages indigenous to Southern Africa.\n\n\"We nicknamed this giant galaxy 'Inkathazo,' meaning 'trouble' in isiZulu and isiXhosa because it has been a bit troublesome to understand the physics behind what's going on here,\" says first author Kathleen Charlton, a master's student at the University of Cape Town.\n\nRadio galaxies already feature mind-bending physics, with supermassive black holes accreting matter at the galactic core and sending out vast plasma jets that glow at radio frequencies. Those larger than roughly 2 million light-years may be classified as giant radio galaxies, or GRGs.\n\nYet even by radio-galaxy standards, Inkathazo is puzzling.\n\n\"It doesn't have the same characteristics as many other giant radio galaxies,\" Charlton says. \"For example, the plasma jets have an unusual shape: Rather than extending straight across from end to end, one of the jets is bent.\"\n\nAnd while Inkathazo's size would be impressive anywhere, it's especially surprising given the galaxy's location. Inkathazo is nestled amid a cluster of other galaxies, Charlton and her colleagues report, where conditions should discourage the growth of such gargantuan jets.\n\n\"This is an exciting and unexpected discovery,\" says co-author Kshitij Thorat, an astronomer at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \"Finding a GRG in a cluster environment raises questions about the role of environmental interactions in the formation and evolution of these giant galaxies.\"\n\nIn hopes of shedding light on Inkathazo's mysteries, the researchers used MeerKAT to create high-resolution spectral age maps of the galaxy. These can reveal the age of plasma in different regions of a galaxy, potentially providing hints about what exactly is happening out there.\n\nThe maps showed surprising quirks in Inkathazo's jets, the researchers report, where something was granting cryptic energy boosts to some electrons.\n\nThis may reflect effects of the broader cosmic neighborhood, the authors suggest. Instead of shooting its plasma into relatively empty space, Inkathazo's jets erupt into intergalactic voids within its galaxy cluster, where their interaction with hot gases might explain the strange energy boosts.\n\n\"This discovery has given us a unique opportunity to study GRG physics in extraordinary detail,\" Thorat says. \"The findings challenge existing models and suggest that we don't yet understand much of the complicated plasma physics at play in these extreme galaxies.\"\n\nOnce considered rare, giant radio galaxies have begun to reveal themselves more frequently in recent years, the researchers note, thanks largely to a new generation of more sophisticated radio telescopes like MeerKAT.\n\n\"The number of GRG discoveries has absolutely exploded in the past five years thanks to powerful new telescopes like MeerKAT,\" Charlton says. \"Research into GRGs is developing so rapidly that it's becoming hard to keep up.\"\n\nMost GRGs found so far were spotted via telescopes in Earth's Northern Hemisphere, but some recent discoveries have highlighted the potential treasures hiding in southern skies.\n\nInkathazo is one of three GRGs recently identified from a single swathe of sky, all using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, the authors note. It follows two previous discoveries described in a 2021 paper.\n\n\"The fact that we unveiled three GRGs by pointing MeerKAT at a single patch of sky goes to show that there is likely a huge treasure trove of undiscovered GRGs in the southern sky,\" says co-author Jacinta Delhaize, a researcher at the University of Cape Town.\n\n\"MeerKAT is incredibly powerful and in a perfect location, so is excellently poised to uncover and learn more about them.\"\n\nThe study was published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."

Now a new study claims to have discovered a massive reserve of hydrogen beneath the earth surface which could power the planet for decades and centuries to come. The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

Having a managed service provider can help by being proactive in providing alerts on upcoming compliance and licensing changes,\u201d Desai says.\n\n\u201cThat was important for us, making sure we are not behind the curve and mitigating instead of being proactive. The \u2018how\u2019 was through constant reporting, proper reporting. When the time came for a compliance audit, I didn\u2019t have to ask my team. We had the reports already, due to our regular quarterly interaction with our MSPs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt allowed me to use our internal resources for purposes other than managing software licensing complexity.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Application rationalization can reduce application sprawl.\n\nSoftware Licensing Benefits from Centralized Effort\n\nA centralized approach to software licensing helps, giving IT leaders visibility into and control over the licensing landscape.\n\n\u201cYou have to manage your software assets in a central place,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cWe use ServiceNow and Flexera: They give us visibility and allow us to control the licensing, to have a better understanding of it.\u201d\n\nTo ensure users are supported, and redundancy minimized, \u201cyou need a tool that you can use to scan the environment. You can use security tools, or you can use ServiceNow for discovery and learn that this machine has all of these applications, and this user doesn\u2019t use these applications,\u201d he says. \u201cServiceNow knows we have 15 of these Office365 licenses, and if we see this user isn\u2019t active on Office365, we can reclaim that license and repurpose it to somebody that needs it,\u201d\n\nGardner says it\u2019s important to track version changes in software to avoid buying more than you need.\n\n\u201cSoftware vendors often will call something by a different name each year. You can end up with five versions, and you\u2019re going to have to do some manual normalization \u2014 like, application A is really application B, because they changed the name,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that an agency won\u2019t need licenses for both, but it will need to know about those changes in order to adjust the licenses."

On Thursday she will be defending those comments.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, senators are likely to zero in on her sympathy toward Russian President Vladimir V.

Her failure to strongly and consistently condemn Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s now-deposed dictator, is likely to be another line of questioning.\n\nMs. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who is now a Republican, will undoubtedly be asked about her views on whether the intelligence gathering of federal agencies, which she will oversee if confirmed, needs to be reined in.\n\nShe might find herself on the defensive, even in questioning from Republican senators, for her previous championing of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, each of whom were pursued by the American authorities for unlawfully releasing classified documents.\n\nHere are examples of comments she made on podcasts, social media or television interviews:"

            "source": "The Daily Telegraph",
            "article_content": "The vast majority of you reading this will not have experienced war. The closest many of us came was perhaps during the Covid pandemic, when Boris Johnson suggested he was leading a wartime government and in a special broadcast, the late Queen Elizabeth II praised the \u201cnational spirit\u201d and evoked the Second World War, saying: \u201cWe will meet again.\u201d\n\nWe did meet again, but we also remember the psychological effects of that time \u2013 the isolation, losing people close to us before their time, and perhaps becoming ill and debilitated ourselves.\n\nThere are people in Britain today who currently deal with war-like situations. As a psychologist working in an NHS trauma service, I see the effects up close, in those who\u2019ve been caught up in disaster and in the emergency first responders sent to help them. My patients tell me traumatic experiences shift everything; those who come onto my radio show, Life Changing, say the same.\n\nSome traumatic experiences are one-offs, even if the effects last a lifetime. What, then, must it be like for those living through military conflict, day after day, month after month, year after year, with little or no respite? This is what is happening in Ukraine, where trauma is a daily reality and where stress and anxiety affect almost 80 per cent of people living there.\n\nImagine waking up every day not knowing if your home will still be standing by nightfall or whether the people you love will return \u2013 the anxiety of what might happen keeping you in a constant state of high alert.\n\nThere are the sights, sounds and smells of war, too: the constant blasts of air-raid sirens, the destruction of neighbourhoods, the smell of burning, and the regular power cuts. All of it creates a pervasive sense of fear and insecurity \u2013 a multisensory attack on minds and bodies.\n\nResearch suggests that prolonged exposure to stress in conflict zones can change the way the brain functions. The amygdala, the brain\u2019s fear centre, can become hyperactive, scanning for danger, like an alarm that\u2019s constantly ringing, quietening other important brain regions responsible for memory, decision-making and emotional regulation. It puts people in fight-flight-freeze mode, unable to switch off, or even to process what\u2019s happening effectively.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the brain that\u2019s affected. Ten years ago, Dutch psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk published a seminal best-selling book called The Body Keeps the Score. Its core message is that trauma leaves its mark not just on the mind but also on the body.\n\nOn a physical level, the body\u2019s stress response \u2013 including the release of cortisol and adrenalin \u2013 goes into overdrive. Over time, this leads to fatigue, sleep disturbances and a weakened immune system, raising the risk of other health conditions.\n\nDiane is a psychologist working for Humanity & Inclusion (HI) in Kharkiv in the north-east of Ukraine. She says the population has had to learn to adapt quickly. Practically, giving them instructions and safety rules provides them with a structure to help them navigate bombings and air alerts. Even so, she says, everyone is still living in a climate of uncertainty. It\u2019s hard to think about and build a future when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next few seconds.\n\nHI\u2019s mental health team has identified various negative coping strategies that people are using, such as drinking more alcohol and taking medicines without a prescription; becoming cut off from others or having a negative attitude to life, and transferring negative emotions to friends and family."

            "article_content": "Once the dominant force in the Indian electric scooter segment, Ola Electric has lost significant market share to rival brands like Bajaj Chetak and TVS Motor. The Bengaluru-based electric mobility provider seems to have had a \u2018flew too close to the sun\u2019 moment as the roaring and dominant sales have been dulled down significantly.\n\nWhile Ola is still the highest-selling 2W EV manufacturer, it is not the dominant force anymore. Rivals like Bajaj and TVS have come a long way and they are poised to surpass Ola\u2019s figures and take over any time now. Their share price has also hit an all time low of Rs 64.6 on 28th Jan, which comes after the company launched 4,000 physical stores across India. In this post, we will analyse Ola\u2019s sales performance across CY24 and see just how much downfall Ola has had when compared to Bajaj and TVS.\n\nOla Electric CY24 Sales\n\nIf we take CY24 (Jan 2024 to Dec 2024), we can see how Ola has been losing market share with time. Ola kick-started CY24 with a 58.33% share (within this trio) in Q1 2024 which used to be close to three times more than Bajaj and TVS at 19.36% and 22.31%, respectively. By the end of CY2024, that number was reduced to 35.74%, while Bajaj was at 32.74% and TVS at 31.52%. In Q1 2024, Ola sold 1,19,418 units and accounted for 58.33% of sales within this trio. At the same time, Bajaj managed 39,628 units and TVS managed to sell 45,680 units. In Q2 2024, Ola sold 1,07,641 units, losing 11,777 units QoQ and the percentage share dropped to 54.46%. In Q2 2024, we can see that Bajaj and TVS showed QoQ growth and increased their percentage share among this trio.\n\nThis trio managed to clock a total of 4,02,374 units in H1 2024. Breaking the numbers, 2,27,059 units were from Ola, 80,482 from Bajaj and 94,833 from TVS. In Q3 2024, Ola\u2019s sales were reduced to 93,820 units, losing 13,821 units QoQ and accounted for 39.42% of sales within this trio, down from 54.46%.\n\nLowest numbers in Dec 2024 for Ola\n\nAt the same time, Bajaj and TVS showed significant growth as they sold 70,387 and 73,774 units respectively. Bajaj registered 29,533 units volume growth QoQ, while it was 24,621 for TVS. Bajaj\u2019s percentage share grew from 20.67% to 29.58%, while TVS\u2019 grew from 24.87% to 31% QoQ.\n\nThe results got a lot more interesting in Q4 2024 as Ola registered its worst-ever sales of CY24 in December 2024 at just 13,771 units. Ola\u2019s sales took a downfall from 93,820 units in Q3 2024 to 84,626 units in Q4 2024, losing 9,194 units in volume QoQ. At the same time, Bajaj and TVS sold 77,524 and 74,635 units respectively, registering positive growth QoQ.\n\nIn H2 2024, Ola, Bajaj and TVS managed to sell 4,74,766 electric scooters, up from 4,02,374 units in H1 2024. However, the impressive heavy lifting is done by Bajaj and TVS, while Ola has registered a massive decline in sales. Breaking the numbers, Ola sold 1,78,446 units, Bajaj 1,47,911 units and 1,48,409 units by TVS in H2 2024.\n\nThe numbers still place Ola at the top spot with 33,792 units monthly average in CY24, while it was 19,033 for Bajaj and 20,270 for TVS. However, that might change in CY25, with Bajaj and TVS likely to take off further in sales, leaving Ola behind, considering its sales pattern."

Regular architecture reviews are key to ensuring that systems continue to evolve with the changing demands of businesses.\"\n\nIn today's landscape, balancing system performance with data privacy compliance is a significant challenge. \"Data privacy is a core concern, especially when building scalable systems,\" Karthik notes. \"I design systems with privacy-by-design principles in mind, ensuring compliance with major privacy regulations while keeping performance intact. It's a delicate balance, but one that is achievable with careful planning and robust security measures.\"\n\nKarthik is a firm believer in using data to measure success. \"I always monitor performance metrics like system latency, throughput, and resource utilization,\" he says. \"But just as important is ensuring that engineering solutions align with business KPIs. By tracking both technical and business metrics, I can optimize systems to directly contribute to business objectives.\"\n\nInnovation is at the heart of Karthik's philosophy. \"I encourage my team to experiment and continuously learn,\" he explains. \"With emerging cloud services and big data technologies, there are always new approaches to explore. It\u2019s important to foster a culture of experimentation to stay ahead of the curve.\" He credits this mindset for many of the successful solutions he\u2019s pioneered.\n\nCollaboration with cross-functional teams has played a significant role in his career. \"Working with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders is essential,\" he reflects. \"I pride myself on being able to explain complex technical concepts in a way that everyone can understand. It\u2019s about making sure that the entire team is aligned, from a technical and business perspective.\"\n\nLooking to the future, Karthik is excited about the direction of cloud computing. \"Serverless architecture, machine learning operations, and edge computing are all areas I'm particularly excited about,\" he reveals. \"The integration of AI and ML capabilities with traditional systems is a game-changer for scalability and efficiency.\"\n\nAs Karthik continues to innovate and lead in the tech space, he also sees a growing emphasis on sustainable computing. \"There\u2019s a rising awareness about the environmental impact of technology,\" he says. \"Efficient system design can reduce carbon footprints, and I\u2019m proud to contribute to that movement.\"\n\nWith his unique blend of technical expertise and leadership, Karthik Venkatesan is shaping the future of software engineering, ensuring that it remains both cutting-edge and responsible."

He has since denied the charges and pleaded not guilty.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs was arrested on multiple charges last year (NBC via Getty Images)\n\nDiddy\u2019s Miami mansion was raided last year, with the unsettling discovery being made of large amounts of baby oil, lubricant, guns, and ammunition.\n\nThe lubricant and baby oil are thought to be linked to allegedly violent and drug-fuelled sex parties known as 'freak offs'.\n\nAdvert\n\nPines came forward and spoke about these parties which Combs would have him arrange for a 'laundry list' of paraphernalia.\n\nPines worked for the rapper and mogul from 2019 to 2021, and said he never personally attended the 'freak off' parties.\n\nThe former assistant did say, however, that other parties called Wild King Nights events would lead to him arranging the list of items Diddy required.\n\nPhil Pines opened up about working for the rapper in a new interview (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the interview, conducted by Investigation Discovery, he said: \"We usually had a laundry list of items that included lights, alcohol, marijuana, ketamine, Molly.\n\n\"You have mushrooms on the top there \u2026 baby oil and astroglide [lubricant] are very important; candles, incense, Apple TVs, electronics, computers, iPads. Obviously there was, you know, male libido supplements, stuff like that.\"\n\nPines added that 'young' girls would often attend these parties, describing them as women in their 20s. Diddy is 55.\n\nHe said: \"A lot of times, there were girls that were under the radar, didn\u2019t have a lot of influence. I think that speaks to the type of situations people were put in.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"A lot of times, you have [Diddy] with a young female, and there\u2019s a power dynamic there.\n\nDiddy awaits trial in Brooklyn, New York (Sharief Ziyadat via Getty Images)\n\n\"A more impressionable girl is easier to reel in, as opposed to somebody who might be a celebrity who\u2019s not going to do too much of that, or give some pushback.\"\n\nIn another portion of the interview, Pines was emotional as he described how the rapper 'ordered' him to have sex with a girl to 'prove his loyalty'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe claims that Diddy said to him: \"Prove your loyalty to me, King.\"\n\nThe rapper then began massaging his shoulders like a coach to a 'player that's about to enter the game', handed him a condom, and 'pushed' Pines onto the girl on the couch.\n\nHe went on to add: \"In the moment it felt like, 'What, is this fun for him? Is this a test for entertainment, does he know he's doing this? Is he that gone?' I didn't know what to do.\"\n\nHarrowing allegations have come out about the rapper and his 'freak off' parties (Samir Hussein via Getty Images)\n\nPines said the woman consented to the sex and 'performed' until Diddy was out of sight, at which point he ran away.\n\nHe claimed that he had 'never really recovered from' the incident.\n\nCombs currently awaits trial in Brooklyn, New York, and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article and wish to speak to someone in confidence, contact The Survivors Trust for free on 08088 010 818, available 10am-12.30pm, 1.30pm-3pm and 6pm-8pm Monday to Thursday, 10am-12.30pm and 1.30pm-3pm on Fridays, 10am-12.30pm on Saturdays and 6pm-8pm on Sundays."

I'll never forget that sight as long as I live,\" Ogden added.\n\nAsked whether he feared death while he was hanging out of the cockpit, Lancaster told reporters: \"It did cross my mind. For a moment or two.\"\n\nIn the 2005 documentary Mayday, he also explained: \"What I remember most clearly was the fact that I couldn't breathe because I was facing into the airflow.\"\n\nAn investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) later found that bolts belonging to the windshield had been replaced with slightly smaller ones, which proved to be a lot less secure.\n\nLancaster returned to work after less than five months, but left British Airways in 2003.\n\nHe went on to fly planes for EasyJet until 2008, when he retired from commercial piloting - as I'm sure he'd seen more than enough of the skies by that point."
