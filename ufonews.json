            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nAt some point, the truth about all of these UFO and drone sightings has to start being revealed. There are just too many eyewitness reports and videos being shared online for governments to just keep pretending like nothing is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the United States either (though that is where a majority of the reports are originating). They have also been happening in places like the United Kingdom, Germany, and now, in Brazil.\n\nWhile orb-shaped UFOs are perhaps the most common type of UFO that has been seen over the years, triangular-shaped crafts have also been reported being seen quite often.\n\nThe latest triangular-shaped UFO to be reported, and in this case filmed, occurred recently in the Barigui Park, in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.\n\n\u201cI came across the video yesterday while browsing reels on Instagram,\u201d a report written for Ovniologia in Brazil read. \u201cThe account published the footage, called Paranadrone , is a page dedicated to aerial images to with drones and has no connection to the UFO theme.\n\n\u201cI contacted you and requested the original footage, which was sent to me. The video was forwarded them by a follower who requested anonymity. The images were recorded around 8 pm, while the witness was in a trade in the park region.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the video, it is possible to see that the person filming was apparently close to a wall, inside a residence or business, the Paranadro told me. Then, we see a large, luminous point coming from the left, reveals its which triangular shape when the witness zooms in,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cThe object crosses the sky at a considerable and constant speed until it disappears from the author\u2019s field of vision behind the trees. See below.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have what appears to be beautiful footage of a triangular UFO. The fixed, unwavering lights at the bottom seem to match reports of these craft. One worth thing noting is the number of lights. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, three to four lights are usually reported on these objects. However, in the footage, in addition to the three lights at the ends, we can see two more luminous points near the larger central light.\n\n\u201cThis led me to question if it was actually a solid object or just a formation of orbs. While the footage is quite clear, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say that another witness to the same UFO claimed it had \u201ctwo lights at a considerably low altitude that same day. One of them was in front of her house, with a green and red coloration, while the other, located behind the house, was orange in color and considerably larger.\u201d\n\nHer neighbor also saw the UFO and also filmed it.\n\nThe report by Ovniologia went on to explain, \u201cI spoke to other people who reported strange activity in the skies over Curitiba this month. The reports describe some anomalous sightings and experiences. It is possible that that some incidence of the phenomenon is occurring in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the video of the triangular UFO, the first thing thing that came to mind was the wave of drones on American soil. Could there be any possible connection? Could it be starting to spread to other regions of the Americas? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo far, no definitive explanation has been revealed."

            "article_content": "Smaller artificial intelligence stocks have seemingly gone parabolic at the close of 2024, especially those that have been backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the form of an investment. Although Nvidia invested a mere $3.7 million in voice-AI start-up SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) about a year ago, that investment put SoundHound squarely on the map as a potential AI winner.\n\nAfter making several accretive acquisitions and racking up an impressive customer list, SoundHound's stock has soared in recent weeks.\n\nIs this price increase a signal that SoundHound could be the next \"killer app\" AI platform? Or is it a sign of a bubble waiting to burst?\n\nWhy SoundHound has made a big noise lately\n\nSoundHound appears to have achieved escape velocity as the go-to voice-enabled AI system outside big tech, especially within the automotive and quick-serve restaurant (QSR) verticals. SoundHound has landed seven of the top 20 QSR brands, including heavyweight Chipotle, for things like phone and drive-through ordering. In automotive, SoundHound's voice AI is now embedded in many leading auto brands such as those owned by car giant Stellantis, as well as four major electric vehicle manufacturers as of last quarter.\n\nIn addition to those two big verticals, this past summer's acquisition of Amelia, another voice-based start-up for enterprises, has boosted SoundHound's enterprise platforms both for customer service applications and employee-facing IT AI applications.\n\nWhy SoundHound has an early lead in voice AI\n\nWhile the generative AI craze has only been happening for two years, SoundHound has actually been around since 2005, and first released its Houndify voice AI platform 10 years later in 2015. So, the company has been developing this technology for a long time.\n\nWhile SoundHound does incorporate other third-party large language models into its products when necessary, it has distinguished itself by building its own proprietary model called Polaris. Polaris is built on its two decades of experience spanning billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio in dozens of languages.\n\nSoundHound has only been building Polaris since LLM training was available, but the platform is already in use for one-third of the company's restaurant ordering transactions, while management aims to eventually use Polaris in all of SoundHound's interactions across its platform.\n\nIn the age of AI, having proprietary data to build one's own model or augment a general-purpose LLM -- in this case, SoundHound's billions of voice transaction data going back decades -- should be a competitive advantage.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "A woman vanishes into thin air with a man who does not exist, a dreary village visited by a police party disappears the next day, a burly man suspected of murdering his wife dies mysteriously, and the police officer who witnesses this all is transported 30 years back to his class of 1986 as he steps inside the old building of his alma mater.\n\n\n\nThese are some of the stories in retired IPS officer and ex-chief of the National Security Guard (NSG) M.A. Ganapathy\u2019s debut book Whispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman. The book is unusual in more ways than one. Unlike most ex-cops who would write of tales of bravery, achievements, administrative ills, or insider info, Ganapathy detours towards a path less taken and fictionalises a policeman\u2019s life and gives it a paranormal twist, as if to make sense of many puzzling events he must have witnessed in his long and illustrious career.\n\nThis is an interesting choice given his writing about his work at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Ministry of Home Affairs, Central Industrial Security Force, and as the DGP of Uttarakhand before hanging his boots as the chief of the NSG earlier this year, could have made for a juicy read.\n\nHowever, the ex-cop takes the Ruskin Bond route of paranormal tales, who also serves as an inspiration. \u201cRuskin Bond\u2019s stories in this genre became my staple at one point, which I read several times over,\u201d Ganapathy writes about the much-loved writer, who, in turn, reviews the book as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy interest in the paranormal was fuelled in no small measure by the stories of certain odd events narrated by my grandfather, a retired forester, who had served in remote corners of South India,\u201d the author writes in the introduction, and it shows. While every short story in this quick-to-read book spanning just over 100 pages is engrossing, the tales where he absolutely shines are those set against forests with spirits and wildlife appearing periodically to seek redemption for the victims through a paranormal route.\n\nThe stories are told through the eyes of Avinash, a diligent and low-profile cop. The first book of any writer is an autobiography of sorts, they say, and it\u2019s evident in Ganapathy\u2019s work as he takes the readers through India\u2019s varied landscapes where he grew up and worked, from his native home in the Western Ghats and alma mater in Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the Naxal-hit regions of central India.\n\nUnlike how policemen are generally showcased in popular culture as either god-sent or pure evil, Ganapathy doesn\u2019t portray them as either but rather shines the light on the victims. And in the process, he also humanises his lot by focusing on what they experience on the field and their relationship with their work, colleagues, families, teachers, alma mater, and even the victims and the offenders. \u201cWhy do human beings inflict such unspeakable atrocities on other human beings, that too for an outdated ideology, he (Avinash) wondered,\u201d he writes, giving a peak into a policeman\u2019s psyche.\n\nWhispers in the Shadow isn\u2019t your typical horror read. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even use horror to spook the reader but to make sense of the difficult-to-comprehend events and offer closure where none exists. From spooky forest spirits to post-death experiences and time travel, Ganapathy employs just enough elements to make his debut book an interesting and captivating read.\n\nWhispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman\n\nAuthor: M.A. Ganapathy\n\nPublisher: Srishti Publishers and Distributors\n\nPages: 120\n\nPrice: Rs 299"

            "article_content": "An American man living in the UK has shared four observations about Tesco supermarkets - admitting one modern aspect of British superstores has left him baffled.\n\nKalani Smith, who goes by @kalanismith on TikTok, is an influencer and YouTuber who regularly creates content about paranormal activity, but he's recently been documenting quintessentially British experiences during his stay in the UK.\n\nSince being in the UK, he's also captured the interest of millions by filming himself trying a variety of different British cuisines - from fish and chips in St. Andrews to a Sunday roast in London.\n\nBut his recent video captured the interest of both Brits and Americans after he shared his thoughts about British superstores whilst out shopping with his partner at a Tesco Extra.\n\nCapturing their visit in a three-minute clip, Kalani was left in awe as he approached the entrance of the large supermarket, adding: 'Look at the size of this store. I thought you guys said you didn't have big stores over here.'\n\nThe first observation the content creator noted was the opening hours of the superstore, going on to explain how Tesco Extra stays open until midnight while Walmart in the States closes at 11pm.\n\nAs he entered the store, Kalani stumbled across a section of handheld scanners - and the content creator didn't hold back from expressing his confusion over the device.\n\nHe said: 'It's kinda weird. You can scan your stuff and pay for it with these little handheld devices. We don't really have these in the U.S.'\n\nKalani Smith, an American man living in the UK has shared four observations about Tesco supermarkets - including one aspect he reported to have found 'weird'\n\nNext, Kalani entered the refrigerated meat aisle, where he observed shelves filled with bacon, pork, lamb and sausages.\n\nHowever, he was left dumbfounded, noting that there are 'so many sausages in the UK' and that he's 'never seen so much meat in one spot.'\n\nLastly, the content creator highlighted the difference between the frozen aisles in the UK and U.S.\n\nAs he explored the area, he explained: 'I think what's really weird compared to America is there's only three rows for frozen meals, whereas I feel like we have more of these in America.'\n\nThe content creator concluded the video by announcing his need to use the bathroom, but as he approached the toilets, he was left scratching his head after finding it locked with a padlock.\n\nIn the comments, dozens of viewers shared their thoughts, with one Brit advising: 'There\u2019s Iceland and farm foods they are shops of just frozen foods.'\n\nAs he entered the store, Kalani stumbled across a section of handheld scanners - and the content creator didn't hold back from expressing his confusion over the device\n\nAnother Briton remarked: 'Tesco used to have a lot of stores open 24 hours but they started closing them.'\n\nAn American, meanwhile, was left impressed by what Tesco had to offer, as they wrote: 'Oh my gosh that looks [like an] amazing store.'\n\nIt comes as an American man living in the UK has shared his shock at five stark differences between grocery shopping in Britain and back home.\n\nKobie Jordan, a TikTok content creator known as @kjordyyy, often explores cultural contrasts between the two countries, both through street interviews with Brits and sharing his own experiences online.\n\nIn a video uploaded in August, titled 'Grocery shopping in London as an American,' Jordan shared his observations whilst shopping for necessities in his local Sainsbury's supermarket.\n\nFilming his visit, the content creator singled out specific items while weighing up the pros and cons of varieties available in supermarkets in both nations."

            "article_content": "An increasingly diverse coalition is forming in opposition to OpenAI\u2019s plan to restructure itself into a fully for-profit company.\n\nOn Monday, Encode, a youth-led advocacy organization representing young people in dozens of countries, filed an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk\u2019s ongoing lawsuit to stop OpenAI\u2019s corporate metamorphosis. The filing came with support from one of the biggest names in the field, Nobel and Turing prizes award-winner Geoffrey Hinton, who is often called the godfather of AI.\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode along with its brief. \u201cIt received numerous tax and other benefits from its non-profit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHinton recently told the BBC he believes there is a \u201c10 percent to 20 percent\u201d chance that AI will lead to human extinction within the next 30 years. Previously, Hinton\u2019s been more modest, putting the odds at just 10 percent.\n\nOpenAI is currently structured as a for-profit company controlled by a non-profit board, which places some restrictions on its mission and ability to raise money and compensate investors. The company formally announced its intention to restructure itself as a more traditional for-profit corporation last week, although the change had been anticipated for some time and Musk, who was a cofounder of OpenAI, filed his federal lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to stop it in November.\n\nEncode argues that OpenAI\u2019s planned shift from a nonprofit to a Delaware public benefit corporation would \u201cundermine specific safety-focused commitments the nonprofit has made to the public.\u201d In particular, the brief questions whether a for-profit corporation could ever fulfill OpenAI\u2019s promise that it will \u201cstop competing with and start assisting\u201d any value-aligned organization that appears close to building artificial general intelligence before it does.\n\n\u201cToday, a handful of companies are racing to develop and deploy transformative AI, internalizing the profits but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,\u201d Sneha Revanur, the president and founder of Encode, said in a statement. \u201cThe courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.\u201d\n\nFor its part, OpenAI has urged the court to reject Musk\u2019s lawsuit, arguing that he lacks standing and is seeking to gain an unfair competitive advantage for his own AI startup, xAI. OpenAI also released a trove of emails and other messages from Musk, including several that the company said showed Musk advocated for converting the organization to a for-profit as early as 2017."

            "article_content": "Encode, the nonprofit organization that co-sponsored California\u2019s ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, has requested permission to file an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk\u2019s injunction to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit company.\n\nIn a proposed brief submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Friday afternoon, counsel for Encode said that OpenAI\u2019s conversion to a for-profit would \u201cundermine\u201d the firm\u2019s mission to \u201cdevelop and deploy \u2026 transformative technology in a way that is safe and beneficial to the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, claim to be developing society-transforming technology, and those claims should be taken seriously,\u201d the brief read. \u201cIf the world truly is at the cusp of a new age of artificial general intelligence (AGI), then the public has a profound interest in having that technology controlled by a public charity legally bound to prioritize safety and the public benefit rather than an organization focused on generating financial returns for a few privileged investors.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sneha Revanur, Encode\u2019s founder and president, accused OpenAI of \u201cinternalizing the profits [of AI] but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,\u201d and said that \u201c[t]he courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.\u201d\n\nEncode\u2019s brief has garnered the support of Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the AI field and 2024 Nobel Laureate, and Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor and director at the Center for Human-Compatible AI.\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused nonprofit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a press release. \u201cIt received numerous tax and other benefits from its nonprofit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was launched in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft.\n\nToday, OpenAI has a hybrid structure: a for-profit side controlled by a nonprofit with a \u201ccapped profit\u201d share for investors and employees. But in a blog post Friday morning, the company said it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s nonprofit will remain but will cede control in exchange for shares in the PBC.\n\nMusk, an early contributor to the original nonprofit entity, filed suit in November requesting an injunction to halt the proposed change, which has long been in the works. He accused OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission of making the fruits of its AI research available to all and of depriving rivals of capital \u2014 including his AI startup, xAI \u2014 through anticompetitive means.\n\nOpenAI has called Musk\u2019s complaints \u201cbaseless\u201d and simply a case of sour grapes.\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI\u2019s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Encode said that OpenAI\u2019s plans to transfer control of its operations to a PBC would \u201cconvert an organization bound by law to ensure the safety of advanced AI into one bound by law to \u2018balance\u2019 its consideration of any public benefit against \u2018the pecuniary interests of [its] stockholders.\u2019\u201d\n\nEncode\u2019s counsel notes in the brief, for example, that OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit has committed to stop competing with any \u201cvalue-aligned, safety-conscious project\u201d that comes close to building AGI before it does, but that OpenAI as a for-profit would have less (if any) incentive to do so. The brief also points out that the board for the nonprofit OpenAI will no longer be able to cancel investors\u2019 equity if needed for safety once the company\u2019s restructuring is completed.\n\nOpenAI continues to experience an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said in a series of posts on X that he worries about OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit becoming a \u201cside thing\u201d that gives license to the PBC to operate as a \u201cnormal company\u201d without addressing potentially problematic areas.\n\n\u201cOpenAI\u2019s touted fiduciary duty to humanity would evaporate, as Delaware law is clear that the directors of a PBC owe no duty to the public at all,\u201d Encode\u2019s brief continued. \u201cThe public interest would be harmed by a safety-focused, mission-constrained nonprofit relinquishing control over something so transformative at any price to a for-profit enterprise with no enforceable commitment to safety.\u201d\n\nEncode, founded in July 2020 by Revanur, describes itself as a network of volunteers focused on ensuring voices of younger generations are heard in conversations about AI\u2019s impacts. Encode has contributed to various pieces of AI state and federal legislation in addition to SB 1047, including the White House\u2019s AI Bill of Rights and President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on AI.\n\nUpdated December 30, 2024, with statements from Revanur and Hinton.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

Even if you haven\u2019t fallen victim to the TikTok trends going into 2025, no doubt you\u2019ve promised yourself that you\u2019ll sign up for the uni gym and stop forgetting your cash on a Monday night at The Raz.\n\nAll students in Liverpool have their vices \u2013 the Elf Bars can only get you through a few days of seasonal depression and withdrawals from your mum\u2019s Christmas dinner before you\u2019re up at 3am making a vision board and completely reinventing yourself. So whether you\u2019re looking to give up fat frogs, find the love of your life skating by the Pier Head, or just want to attend more than two lectures a week, you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nHopefully these resolutions for 2025 will fill you with hope and ambition rather than the all-consuming feeling of guilt and paranoia we\u2019ve all experienced at some point. No doubt you won\u2019t follow any of them and still end up being that one third year who\u2019s blackout drunk at AU night. Happy New Year!\n\nStop trying to find your lost parcel on the Smithdown Matters Facebook page\n\nLet\u2019s face it, a middle aged scouser is probably trying on your Oh Polly parcel as we speak. You can only pray that you\u2019ve not lost the envelope that has your missing ID in it, or any birthday money from your grandparents. There\u2019s only so many times you can ask for the neighbours\u2019 names from the house opposite you, and sometimes you just have to come to terms with the fact that yor Vinted parcel has become part of a student house\u2019s secret santa for the year.\n\nCut down the amount of cash you bring out on a Monday at The Raz\n\nRealistically speaking, telling a medical professional that you consumed 34 raz-bombs the night before a 9am lecture should genuinely be a criminal offence. Adding in the fact that that only cost you \u00a337 in total with entry, they\u2019ll probably give you a pat on the back, but your housemates certainly won\u2019t be celebrating your achievements when you\u2019re throwing up against a lamppost whilst simultaneously crying at the transaction notifications from your bank. Getting a grip is a commendable feat, we promise.\n\nStart wearing multiple layers to the Grove Wing of the Sydney Jones\n\nAlternatively, start protesting against the energy saving in all the libraries and make them turn the heating on. Why is it so cold and why do I never learn to pack a jumper?\n\nStop regretting which modules you picked last year (and complaining about it)\n\nIt\u2019s literally your fault that you picked that one really niche module about Northern Irish art history or coding obscure maths data in Spanish, sorry. Maybe your goal for 2025 is to fulfil the academic weapon role you thought you\u2019d adopt after your first year at uni.\n\nStop getting blackout drunk at pres\u2026\n\nI wish I took a mental note of my alcohol tolerance every time I got caught throwing up outside The Lime Kiln but you win some, you lose some I suppose. Sometimes necking an entire bottle of cheap wine from Wag 1 Offy isn\u2019t the move, and you definitely don\u2019t need that concoction of leftover gin, out of date fruit juice and off brand lemonade to take with you as \u201cjourney juice\u201d. Maybe Dry January would be a good idea for you x\n\nBut start ACTUALLY going to pres\n\nNo doubt you\u2019re getting paralytic before every night out because you\u2019re only doing one every three months \u2013 stop saying no to social plans just because you\u2019ve got assignments to do or CVs to write. The time will make itself for your uni work, but never stops when it comes to piling in an Uber at 3am with no plans, just a few weird props you acquired from the living room floor. It\u2019s all well and good entering your intelligent era next year, but you deserve to let your hair down too. You\u2019ll regret it otherwise, trust me.\n\nStart washing up everything in the sink of your uni kitchen\n\nSink does not equal dumping ground for crusty pasta bowls.\n\nStop making friends with the bossmen on Leece Street\n\nAs hilarious as it was to be a fresher behind the counter in Hot n Tender, there\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than seeing videos of drunk you taking orders from a confused bunch of third years just popping in for a kebab. Save yourself the shame of initiating a love story with the chicken shop man.\n\nStop adding to the bin mountain\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\nStart walking from Smithdown to uni even when your mates don\u2019t go\n\nThe feeling of betrayal you experience when you wake up in time for a 10am, get yourself ready with the expectation that all of your coursemates are meeting you on the way to walk to campus, and then seeing that they haven\u2019t been active for 14 hours, is incomparable to anything else. The brand new 2025 you should be brave enough to trek from Smithdown to South Campus Teaching Hub solo, even on a chilly morning. Use it as your hot girl walk and opportunity to listen to a weirdly niche podcast, or stomp along to your \u201cmisty mountain solo self reflection main character moment jams\u201d daylist on Spotify.\n\nStart giving yourself a break from uni assignments\n\nAlong the same lines of actually having a night off to head out on the town with your flatmates, having a relaxing evening tucked up on the sofa with a friend or two can do you wonders mid-semester. There\u2019s only so many late night study sessions you can pull off before you\u2019re burnt out and start to convince yourself that your housemates have forgotten that you exist and you\u2019ll never find a graduate job with an arts degree. So not true! Have a break, have a self care night, have a cheeky takeaway. You deserve it.\n\nStop spending half your student loan on sweet treats\n\nHowever, when you do manage to get that 4000 word assignment started, spending \u00a33 on a pastry after every 150 words is actually quite bad for your bank account \u2013 or so I\u2019ve heard.\n\nStart saying no to Concert Square for a night out\n\nWe\u2019ve all got that one friend that wants to start the night in SOHO or MODO for the \u201cvibes\u201d but you always end up feeling sober, freezing cold and no longer excited to go out. There are so many venues and clubs in Liverpool to test out once or twice, so make a list with your friends of your ideal places to visit and branch out a little! The nightlife scene in town defo stretches further than Concert Square and Quick Burger, you just have to look for it.\n\nStop texting your ex\n\nTHEY ARE NOT THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.\n\nIf they\u2019re an avid Skint goer, on any of the snowsports society boards at John Moores, or genuinely disagree that pineapple doesn\u2019t belong on pizza, then they\u2019re not for you I\u2019m afraid. Get those grapes down you on New Years babe.\n\nStop avoiding walking up Brownlow Hill\n\nWhat happened to those 75 hard plans you made, eh? Taking the long way through campus to avoid clambering up Brownlow Hill is not part of the hot girl gym aesthetic you put on your vision board for 2025. Get those legs moving and squint through your tears, it\u2019s not that bad. Joking. LOL.\n\nStart making time to visit your friends or invite them to visit you\n\nA little bit of home never does anyone any harm. Dragging your home friends up to Liverpool to give them a tour around the Docks and Baltic Market will help you take your mind off things when you\u2019re fighting those winter blues. Sometimes you just need that comfort of getting wine drunk with your best friends in a different city \u2013 making time for this in the new year can do wonders for you.\n\nStop being scared of the teenagers on Lawrence Road\n\nSeriously though, why are they so scary?\n\nStart making moves on your library crush\n\nOur Library Crush feature on Instagram hears, sees and knows everything you\u2019d be dying to know about everyone\u2019s love lives on campus, believe me. There\u2019s nothing more exhilarating than noticing the love of your uni life sitting across from you in the Hogwarts room in the Harold Cohen, or brushing past them on the stairs in the Sydney Jones. I expect to see you all flirting in the Starbucks in time for Valentine\u2019s Day this year.\n\nStop putting the attendance code in for seminars after 11am\n\nIf it\u2019s past 11am just get a grip and go onto campus, surely? The only exception MIGHT be the Thursday after AU night, but you\u2019re admitting your weaknesses if you\u2019re asking the course group chat for the attendance code for the 2pm seminar.\n\nStop being afraid to do things solo\n\nLiverpool is an incredible city with so many activities and places to visit \u2013 if none of them take the fancy of your friends or housemates, don\u2019t be afraid to go and explore things on your own! Incorporating solo dates into your resolutions for 2025 is so cute and VERY mindful.\n\nStart applying to jobs to fuel your Gourmet Grill/Nabzy\u2019s/Harper\u2019s addiction\n\nThere\u2019s only so far a trust fund will stretch when it comes to cheesy chips and gyros unfortunately.\n\nTake our advice and run with it \u2013 we know you won\u2019t stick to any of these resolutions and can\u2019t wait to hear how miserable we all feel by the Easter break. If you manage to find a way to romanticise January and the dreaded exam season, please let us know."

            "article_content": "As committed chroniclers of the proverbial \u201cart world\u201d \u2014 an imperfect term denoting the ecosystem of artists, institutions, and other entities that make the visual art planet go \u2019round \u2014 we at Hyperallergic have noticed a few patterns emerge over the years. For example, why are museums getting so expensive? How come exhibition lighting is so offputting? And for God\u2019s sake, what\u2019s with all the soil art?!\n\nIn the spirit of ringing in the new year \u2014 and bidding adieu to 2024 \u2014 we\u2019ve compiled our Dos and Don\u2019ts for 2025, listing the trends and habits we\u2019d like to leave behind and those we\u2019d like to bring forward. Here\u2019s to another year navigating our strange, lovable, and deeply idiosyncratic art community (hopefully with fewer fair panels this time around \u2026 )\n\nIn 2025, Let\u2019s Leave Behind \u2026\n\n1. Soil Art \u2014 Since Walter De Maria\u2019s classic \u201cEarth Room\u201d (1977), soil has held a certain fascination and allure for art audiences, but now we\u2019re drowning in artworks that love to dig things up and prove to us how environmental they\u2019re being. All this has soiled our spirits on earthy works and we\u2019d prefer something else to make us feel grounded.\n\n2. Scrappy Ceramics by Artists Who Are Not Ceramicists \u2014 We\u2019ve all seen them, in hastily organized group shows and certain art fairs \u2014 shoddy ceramic \u201csculptures\u201d reminiscent of a last-minute middle school project you only remembered to tell your parents about the night before it was due. They\u2019re typically the work of artists with good intentions who want to experiment with the medium, but it\u2019s time to accept that this art form requires skill, and not everyone can (or should) take on the challenge.\n\n3. Abstruse Art Terms \u2014 \u201cThe artist\u2019s oeuvre of speculative futurisms is a catalyst for a praxis of rupture\u201d \u2014 did you feel your entire body cringe at that sentence? Let\u2019s treat contrived, obscure art terms like any other vice this new year: Everything in moderation. Don\u2019t get us started on crafty little parentheses within words, usually in service of saying two things at once that both mean nothing \u2014 \u201c(mis)understand,\u201d \u201c(re)imagine.\u201d It\u2019s not clever, it\u2019s just annoying.\n\n4. Little Gallery Books \u2014 Let us take a moment to consider the ecological disaster that is little gallery books. They\u2019re often small picture flipbooks with a short essay that someone hopefully got paid well to contribute to, but as anyone who has a bookshelf knows, those slim volumes are impossible to find. Not that anyone will ever read them.\n\n5. Gold Flakes \u2014 They\u2019re not good on cakes, so why would they be good in art? Believe us: The shinier the gold flakes, the cheaper the artwork looks. Wealthy collectors with abhorrent taste in art might cheer this unnecessary addition, but we prefer art that is rich at heart.\n\n6. Neon Text Art \u2014 It was cool back in the early aughts when everyone was into the academic critique of consumerism and mass advertising, but over the years we all caved in, gave up, and moved on. What good is your clever, post-modernish neon text if you\u2019re addicted to your phone, binge every piece of crap on Netflix, and ask ChatGPT to write your press releases? And does anyone even care?\n\n7. The Vessel \u2014 We were hoping for a permanent closure of the Hudson Yards Vessel when it shuttered for three years after four people jumped to their deaths from the structure, but no such luck. In October, the Manhattan eyesore reopened with prevention nets, despite public outcry. As Charley Burlock wrote for Hyperallergic, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the site has become a memorial rather than a public artwork.\n\n8. Unclear Opening Hours \u2014 Galleries and museums, for the love of all that is good: Clearly list your opening hours on your website and respect them. That seems obvious, yet art venues that boast values like access and inclusivity often ignore this most basic of principles. (On a related note: please make your websites user-friendly. If we have to click on an unlabeled floating object just to get to a list of current exhibitions, or your home page looks anything like Documenta 15\u2019s website, you\u2019re doing it wrong.)\n\n9. Pseudo-Academic Art Fair Panels \u2014 Hosting \u201cpanel discussions\u201d and similarly meaningless programming during an art fair is like putting a dress on a pig. No one wants to hear a group of \u201cthought leaders\u201d debate the politics of public art in the age of AI, or the relevance of biennials, or whatever. These talks are typically attended only by the speakers and their three friends who agree with them, perpetuating the art-world echo chamber effect we know all too well.\n\n10. Miserly Food Offerings at Openings \u2014 Nary a miniature croissant could be found at the press opening of the Whitney Biennial this year, to the chagrin of many of us who perused the bland artwork offerings on view with a grumbling stomach. No, we don\u2019t expect a three-course meal, but a small snack for a multiple-hour-long event is a nice gesture. And don\u2019t get us started on the increasingly microscopic wine pours at gallery openings.\n\n11. \u201cGallery-Spreading\u201d \u2014 Ever silently wrestle with some guy on the subway over leg space before resigning yourself to bumping up against him the whole ride? \u201cGallery-spreading\u201d \u2014 opening up multiple spaces with essentially the same function within just a few miles of each other \u2014 is the art world equivalent.\n\nNotice any odd titles in Philip Johnson\u2019s bookcase? (photo Valentina Di Liscia/Hyperallergic)\n\n12. Philip Johnson \u2014 Four years ago, when a group of architects and scholars exposed the architect\u2019s creepy racist and white supremacist views \u2014 and Harvard University removed his name from a building, and even the Museum of Modern Art, where he was the first director of the Architecture Department, agreed to cover up his name in an exhibition \u2014 we really thought Philip Johnson was dunzo. This year, however, The Glass House in Connecticut announced the complete restoration of his little \u201cBrick House\u201d on the property, complete with a reconstruction of Johnson\u2019s private library exhibiting a book simply titled \u201cHitler.\u201d Jfc.\n\n13. Expensive Museum Tickets \u2014 In the last two years, we\u2019ve seen ticket costs rise at several major museums across the United States, from MoMA to The Met to the Guggenheim to SFMOMA. Tempered by some positive initiatives like the Whitney\u2019s commitment to free admission for attendees 25 and under for the next three years, senior and student discounts, and other options, these price hikes are nevertheless an obstacle for low-income visitors.\n\n14. Art World Social Media \u201cInfluencers\u201d \u2014 With all due respect to your \u201cpersonal brand,\u201d we don\u2019t need your vapid hot takes on art, and don\u2019t have any time or energy to waste on your narcissism.\n\n15. Wishy-Washy Billboard Art \u2014 Let me guess: Your billboard project opens up a portal for discourse, community-building, and alternative futures. Does it really, though? Unless it offers a thoughtful message, isn\u2019t navel-gazing, and is situated in an area where people will actually see it and reflect on it, these billboards are less public art, more publicity.\n\nIn 2025, Let\u2019s Bring Forward \u2026\n\n1. Artists Putting Their Politics Into Action \u2014 This fall, author Jhumpa Lahiri turned down an award in protest of the Noguchi Museum\u2019s staff dress code banning the Arab and Palestinian headscarves known as keffiyehs, and earlier in the year, a group of anti-Zionists artists withdrew from a show at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco in a call for divestment from Israel. These were just a few of countless examples of cultural workers putting their money where their mouth is and holding institutions accountable. It takes integrity to pass up a career opportunity to stand up for what\u2019s right, and we commend those in our community who are speaking truth to power.\n\n2. Accessibility in Art Institutions \u2014 Canvases hung just a couple of inches lower to accommodate those in wheelchairs, better experiences for color-blind visitors, and fairs centered around artists with disabilities \u2014 we\u2019re starting to see some hints of the art world becoming more geared toward accessibility. Let it not be another fad, please.\n\n3. Better Food at Museums \u2014 There was a time when all we would expect at a museum restaurant or cafeteria was a dry ham and cheese sandwich or bad coffee, but nowadays we\u2019re finding that the options are better than ever. Whether it\u2019s Untitled at the Whitney Museum of American Art or the new caf\u00e9 at the Brooklyn Museum, it is feeling like we don\u2019t have to leave our culinary tastes at the door anymore, as there\u2019s sure to be something to enjoy if we need to take a break with a drink and food.\n\n4. Tribeca, a More Human-Scaled Art Neighborhood \u2014 We\u2019ve been dealing with the alienating galleries of Chelsea for too long, and now that Tribeca is slowly snatching the crown as the city\u2019s new gallery district, we\u2019re very relieved that there\u2019s a more human-scaled art neighborhood that allows you to wander dozens of art venues, while not feeling like you\u2019re trekking through an industrial wasteland. And if you thought the High Line park would help humanize Chelsea, I think you\u2019re wrong, as we have just added that one thing New Yorkers hate the most: feckless tourists who can\u2019t wait to tell you that their kid can paint that. Tribeca galleries give us hope that the art community is realizing that audiences want a different kind of art-viewing experience.\n\n5. A More Ethical Arts Journalism Ecosystem \u2014 So your show got a great review in Hyperallergic and you want to share it on social media \u2026 great! Just don\u2019t screenshot the whole article and upload it as an image on Instagram. Many people don\u2019t realize that online publications depend on readers and traffic, and posting our content in this way only benefits social media platforms. Instead, post a small snippet or image, if you\u2019d like, and direct your followers to a link they can click on to actually read the article on our site. Please share our stories as thoughtfully as we strive to write them.\n\n6. Thoughtful Exhibition Lighting \u2014 For a field that prioritizes visual experience, we sure spend a lot of time dodging light reflecting off an artwork\u2019s protective glass in order to, you know, actually look at the work. We see you, museums with anti-glare glass, and we appreciate you.\n\n7. Museums Unearthing Fascinating Collection Items \u2014 After languishing in storage for decades, if not longer, there\u2019s a new trend among collecting art institutions to showcase art that has not been allowed to shine in their galleries for ages, if ever. From the exhibition of Bhupen Khakhar\u2019s \u201cKali\u201d (1965) for the first time ever since it was purchased in 1967 by the Museum of Modern Art, or Thelma Johnson Street\u2019s \u201cRabbit Man\u201d (1941), which was purchased in 1942 but never shown \u2014 both of which are currently on display in MoMA\u2019s Vital Signs show \u2014 it\u2019s great to see museums figure out what they aren\u2019t doing right. As Shiva Balaghi outlined in her piece about MoMA\u2019s \u201cMuslim Ban\u201d show back in 2017, the reality is institutions are doing a poor job exhibiting their own collections, and when they do it is often much later, which robs audiences of important access to art that doesn\u2019t always fit into the institutional narratives.\n\n8. More Native Curators and Artists at Museums \u2014 There are more Indigenous curators and artists at museums than ever. In the last few years, artists as varied as Shelley Niro, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Jeremey Frey, Robert Houle, Nicholas Galanin, and many others have had retrospectives at major American museums, while artists like Kay WalkingStick have been exhibited at the New York Historical alongside their renown Hudson River School collection to explore the political realities that each body of work evokes. This is a trend we adore. More, please.\n\n9. More Local, Community-Based Art Shows \u2014 The year 2024 brought us an open-call exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum featuring more than 200 artists from the borough and a \u201csalon des refus\u00e9s\u201d at the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, presenting the work of hundreds of artists who submitted to the former and didn\u2019t get in. Meanwhile, at the Flushing Town Hall, over 70 Queens artists were included in the notably diverse World\u2019s Borough Exhibition. We love to see more opportunities for emerging artists to show locally, and for us residents to discover them.\n\n10. More Awareness of Age and Ageism \u2014 The art world has made some progress in recognizing the contribution of long-overlooked women and queer artists. On our end, we published a series of 23 interviews with queer elders throughout this year\u2019s Pride month. We must continue honoring those who pave the way for future generations.\n\n11. Being Open About Faith \u2014 There was a time when talking about religion in the art community was frowned upon. It was a strange taboo, considering so much classroom time in art history programs spent looking at Roman Catholic altarpieces, Early Christian manuscripts, Islamic architecture, or Buddhist or Hindu sculpture. But that unofficial ban seems to be lifting, and while some people like to think of contemporary art as a type of secular spiritualism, the art community is finally relaxing and allowing faith to be a bigger part of the conversation in arts institutions. Faith, like anything, is something we welcome as part of conversations. Back in 2003, I remember interviewing a Jewish-American artist who explained that he wasn\u2019t able to find a traditional gallery to exhibit Judaica. Has that changed today? Not fully, but it most certainly is changing.\n\n12. Museums Appointing Provenance Researchers \u2014 The Met Museum hired its first-ever head of Provenance Research this year, after a string of high-profile restitution scandals that led to government seizures of artworks believed to have been looted or otherwise improperly acquired. It\u2019s about time for institutions to have dedicated teams pursuing this work rather than relegating it to overwhelmed and underpaid curators.\n\n13. Playlists for Exhibitions \u2014 As interdisciplinary as the art world claims to be, how did it take so long for us to start incorporating music into the gallery-going experience? We think playlists add another dimension to viewing art, a personal touch, as evinced by the soundtrack Manny Vega curated for his exhibition Byzantine Bemb\u00e9 at the Museum of the City of New York this year.\n\n14. QR Codes \u2014 Let\u2019s face it, those printed press releases and checklists that galleries hand out always end up in the trash, wasting resources and polluting our precious planet. Art institutions that still don\u2019t use QR codes should join the trend. Your grandchildren will thank you.\n\n15. Audiobook Catalogs \u2014 While audiobooks are booming in the publishing industry, the field of art has yet to catch up on this trend \u2014 granted, this might be partly because so many artbooks are simply sales catalogues and not really supposed to be read, but that\u2019s another story. Earlier this month, I heard Duke University will be creating an audiobook version of Eunsong Kim\u2019s The Politics of Collecting book (check out our podcast with the author), and I hope it is part of a trend to allow us another way to engage with important volumes that we can listen to while we drive, cook, clean, go for a walk, or toil away in our studios. Audiobooks are great, and as someone who listens to them all the time, it would be great to have more art content to explore."

From space exploration and AI to medical breakthroughs, these discoveries could improve our health and broaden our knowledge of the universe. One of the most remarkable achievements this year was China's successful retrieval of lunar samples from the far side of the Moon with its Chang'e-6 spacecraft.\n\nLunar exploration\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 mission uncovers Moon's hidden side\n\nThe Chang'e-6 spacecraft drilled beneath the Moon's surface and returned with 2kg of rock and soil samples. These materials could provide valuable insights into Earth's formation. The achievement has ignited a new space race with the US, as NASA plans its crewed landing for 2027, while China aims for a similar mission in 2030.\n\nMedical innovation\n\nGroundbreaking HIV prevention drug developed\n\nIn the field of medicine, a major breakthrough was the development of an HIV prevention drug, Lenacapavir. The drug, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, was found to be 100% effective in clinical trials in South Africa and Uganda involving 2,134 women and girls. Unlike current pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs that need to be taken daily, Lenacapavir only requires two injections a year. The new drug is likely to be approved by mid-2025.\n\nAI insights\n\nAI's role in understanding human cognition\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has also advanced a lot in 2024, especially in social sciences. Large language models have been employed to study human cognition and find ways to improve our thinking. In one study, an AI chatbot was successfully trained to convince conspiracy theorists to rethink their beliefs. But in another study, doctors often remained stuck with wrong diagnoses even after an AI suggested the right one.\n\nSpace journey\n\nEuropa Clipper mission: A quest for extraterrestrial life\n\nIn space exploration, the $5 billion spacecraft Europa Clipper set off on a journey to Jupiter's moon, Europa. The celestial body is seen as a potential habitat for extraterrestrial life owing to signs of a vast ocean under its icy surface. The spacecraft will arrive in 2030 and will conduct several flybys over Europa's surface, searching for molecules that could serve as nutrients and mapping out the ice and ocean beneath.\n\nCosmic discovery\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope recalculates universal expansion\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a new window into our distant universe. It has enabled scientists to recalculate how fast the universe is expanding and capture the most distant galaxy ever seen, as it appeared over 13 billion years ago. These discoveries are part of a larger quest to understand why the universe is expanding and predict its ultimate fate.\n\nAging study\n\nResearch reveals aging spurts at 44 and 60\n\nAs part of a project to fight aging, geneticist Michael Snyder and his team tracked age-related changes in a mix of microbes and molecules from 108 volunteers. The study saw sudden molecular-scale shifts when people turn 44 and then again at 60. These changes highlighted a loss of muscle mass, poor heart health, and a lowered ability to metabolize fats, alcohol, and caffeine.\n\nClimate reconstruction\n\nEarth's climate history reconstructed\n\nA new reconstruction of Earth's climate shows it fluctuated wildly over the eons. The study reveals that over the last 485 million years, the climate alternated between \"hothouse\" periods when global temperatures were 30\u00b0F hotter than now, and unstable \"icehouse\" periods with temperature swings between ice ages and more temperate phases. This research has been instrumental in testing our climate models as they align with these measurement-based approximations going back in time."

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\n\nNLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding by combining computational linguistics with machine learning, explains Arturo Buzzalino, Chief Innovation Officer, Epicor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAI includes other domains besides NLP, such as computer vision which deals with analysis and generation of images, but advances in NLP in the last few years have been at the heart of the current AI revolution,\u201d says Stefan Leichenauer, VP of Engineering, SandboxAQ.\n\nDescribing NLP as the analysis and generation of natural language with computers, he says, it is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbots that are driving a lot of the excitement around the subject.\n\nNLP and LLMs\n\nDrilling down further, Volodymyr Kubytskyi, Head of AI in MacPaw, says popular LLMs like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or Google\u2019s BERT, are trained on massive amounts of text data, allowing them to grasp not just individual words but context, nuance, and even creativity in language.\n\nHe argues that it is these LLMs that have pushed NLP to new heights, enabling machines to generate coherent, human-like text, summarise long documents, translate between languages, and even engage in meaningful dialogue. By leveraging these models, NLP can now do things that seemed impossible a few years ago, like writing essays or answering complex customer inquiries in a natural, flowing manner.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLLMs are the engine that\u2019s driving much of today\u2019s progress in making machines capable of human-like conversations,\u201d says Kubytskyi. \u201cThis is AI meeting language at an incredibly sophisticated level.\u201d\n\nWhy should businesses care about NLP?\n\nLeichenauer says because natural language is the way we communicate with each other, a lot of our business operations are encoded in natural language.\n\n\u201cOur reports and presentations, our internal memos and emails, and all of our customer communications are written in natural language,\u201d says Leichenauer. \u201cNLP techniques can accelerate and automate workflows involving all of these things.\u201d\n\nBuilding on this Buzzalino explains businesses should care about NLP because it allows them to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data like customer reviews, emails, and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNLP, he says, can help automate tasks such as customer support through chatbots, sentiment analysis for market research, and efficient document processing, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing customer engagement.\n\nSukh Sohal, Senior Consultant at Affinity Reply agrees. He says NLP brings real impact to businesses by transforming how they engage with customers, handle data, and even communicate internally.\n\n\u201cImagine an AI that can analyze thousands of customer messages in minutes, picking up on common issues, emotions, or trends,\u201d says Sohal. \u201cFor companies, NLP can be the difference between overwhelming customer service demands and an efficient, responsive operation.\u201d\n\nHe says NLP lets businesses automate repetitive tasks, improve customer experience, and respond dynamically to feedback while freeing up human teams for tasks that require real insight.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKubytskyi is excited about the use of LLMs and how it\u2019s elevating these NLP capabilities. For instance, he says, customer service bots powered by models like GPT can handle not just basic queries, but more nuanced, complex conversations. They can follow the flow of dialogue, understand context, and respond in a way that feels more human than ever before.\n\n\u201cThis level of understanding allows businesses to offer personalized, responsive services without sacrificing efficiency,\u201d says Kubytskyi.\n\nNLP applications\n\nNLP has become so integrated into our lives that we often overlook it.\n\nBuzzalino points to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa that understand voice commands, customer service chatbots that handle inquiries, machine translation services like Google Translate, sentiment analysis tools that gauge public opinion on social media, and text analytics systems that extract key information from large volumes of documents, as some real-world applications of NLP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOne real-world application of NLP that strikes Leichenauer is as a smart assistant for writing code. This enables developers to operate more efficiently and also allows for low-code and no-code solutions that are more powerful than before.\n\nHow does NLP work?\n\nUnlike traditional computing, which relies on straightforward commands, NLP involves teaching machines to grasp the subtleties and quirks of human language, including context, tone, and meaning, says Sohal. It\u2019s how AI moves from rigid rule-following to more intuitive understanding, opening up new ways for tech to interact with us in a more \u201chuman\u201d way.\n\nNLP is built on two key components. There\u2019s Natural Language Understanding (NLU), which analyses input to extract meaning and intent, and Natural Language Generation (NLG), which produces responses based on context and system logic, says Dan Balaceanu, Co-Founder & Chief Product Officer at DRUID AI.\n\nFor example, when a user requests to \u201cbook a flight to London,\u201d NLU identifies \u201cbook\u201d as the action and \u201cLondon\u201d as the destination, while NLG generates a follow-up response, like \u201cI found a flight to London for \u00a3220. Would you like to book it?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTechnically speaking, Sohal says, NLP works by breaking language down into patterns computers can recognize. It starts with tokenization, where sentences are split into words or smaller chunks. Then, grammar and structure are analyzed to understand the relationships between words.\n\nSemantics come next, where computers use massive data to grasp meanings, even for slang or idioms. Finally, context and intent are added through machine learning, especially deep learning. \u201cHere, NLP models learn from large datasets to identify emotions, requests, or subtleties in language, making responses more human-like,\u201d says Sohal.\n\nBalaceanu adds this process standardizes vocabulary by reducing words to their root forms and filtering out common words that add little meaning, which helps to identify the real intent of the prompt that it should respond to, and how it should answer.\n\nHe adds that to improve the accuracy of the responses, NLP leans on machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, and models like transformers such as BERT.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFor NLP systems to respond accurately, they are trained on vast datasets that include diverse language patterns, grammar rules, and sentence structures, covering a range of possible queries and responses,\u201d adds Arunkumar Thirunagalingam, Manager, of Enterprise Data Management at Santander Consumer USA.\n\nHe says this training involves machine learning models and deep learning techniques that expose the AI to various linguistic scenarios, enabling it to recognize intent, context, and nuances. Over time, and with continuous learning from large, representative datasets, AI systems become more adept at handling complex language tasks and providing relevant, human-like responses."

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nTime and again, Data Science has made its mark on human society. It is repeatedly making headlines in newspapers and magazines. It mainly involves getting insights from huge datasets and making decisions based on the analysed data.\n\nData Science is significant as it helps companies to optimise their process. Companies can also predict trends and find answers to difficult questions with the help of it. Machine Learning plays an important part in this whole process.\n\nMachine Learning transforms Data Science processes by automating repetitive and boring tasks. It also helps in identifying patterns in data and improving the accuracy of prediction. The aim of this article is to explore how Machine Learning enhances each stage of the Data Science process.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Machine Learning, then you need to enrol in free Data Science courses and learn Data Science free. Hence, you can focus on your learning without worrying about financial limitations.\n\nCore Components of Data Science Processes\n\nNow, we\u2019ll look at the core components of Data Science processes. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, Data Science focuses on getting insights from raw data. It follows a systematic approach in this process. There are several steps involved, and each step plays an important role. Let\u2019s explore these steps in detail.\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nData collection and preprocessing is the first step in the Data Science process. Data collection involves getting relevant and appropriate data. The data can come from various sources like databases, APIs and manual inputs. It is important to collect data appropriately as it lays down the foundation for correct analysis.\n\nWhen raw data is collected, it has inconsistencies like missing values, duplicates, or outliers. Here comes the role of data preprocessing. It involves cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.\n\nSeveral techniques like imputation, normalisation, and feature engineering are also used in this step. These techniques make the data ready for later stages of the Data Science process. It is important to invest time in preprocessing as it reduces errors and improves the accuracy of the model.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the second step in the Data Science process. It helps in discovering patterns in the data. It also helps in uncovering the trends and relationships within the data. In this step, statistical methods and visualisation tools are used. These help in better understanding the characteristics of data.\n\nEDA gives you the roadmap for modelling by plotting distributions and identifying correlations. It\u2019ll also help you with detecting anomalies in the data. With the help of EDA analysts can make crucial decisions like selecting appropriate features. It also helps in handling uneven data.\n\nMany tools are used in this process like Pandas and Matplotlib library of Python. Other than this, Tableau and PowerBI are also used to make this process effective.\n\nModelling, Evaluation, and Deployment\n\nModelling, evaluation and deployment is the third step in the Data Science process. Let\u2019s look at them briefly one by one.\n\nModelling is like the heart of Data Science. It uses Machine Learning algorithms to transform data into actionable insights. In this step, Data Scientists will select and train models. These models will then be tuned to achieve optimal performance.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the next step i.e. the evaluation process. It ensures that the model is performing well on both trained and untrained data. You might not know this, but various metrics are also used in this step.\n\nFor example, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score are used to measure the effectiveness of a model.\n\nFinally comes the deployment process. In this process, the model is integrated into real-world systems. It enables automated predictions and decision-making. It ensures that the project gives value and enables ongoing improvements.\n\nHow Machine Learning Optimises Each Step\n\nNow, in this section, I\u2019m going to tell you how Machine Learning is revolutionising each step of the Data Science process. I\u2019m going to tell you how ML improves efficiency and accuracy at every stage. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nAutomating Data Preprocessing and Cleaning\n\nAlthough data preprocessing is a crucial step in Data Science, it\u2019s also a time-consuming process. Machine Learning algorithms play the magic here by simplifying this process. ML algorithms automate tasks like missing value imputation and outlier detection. Not only this, but data normalisation is also automated by these algorithms.\n\nFor instance, Machine Learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) estimate missing values based on patterns in the data. On the other hand, clustering algorithms identify and handle outliers in the data.\n\nMoreover, advanced tools like AutoML streamline feature scaling and encoding. It makes sure that your data is ready for analysis. Thus, all this automation helps in reducing manual work and improving the quality of input data. Thus, it directly impacts the reliability of downstream models.\n\nEnhancing EDA with ML-Driven Insights\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously mentioned, EDA helps in uncovering trends and correlations in data sets. It also helps you with finding anomalies in the data. The traditional EDA process uses visualisation and basic statistics. But here, Machine Learning takes it one step further.\n\nIf used, unsupervised Machine Learning techniques will be very fruitful. For instance, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) find dominant patterns. On the other hand, clustering algorithms will reveal natural groupings in the data.\n\nDo you know that ML-powered tools can also generate automated insights? These tools will highlight relationships in the data that might not be immediately noticed. Thus, ML enhances the EDA process and allows Data Scientists to focus on strategic problem-solving instead of manual exploration.\n\nImproving Prediction Accuracy and Model Selection\n\nYou might be surprised to know how Machine Learning improves prediction accuracy. To make this work, it uses advanced algorithms like ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and neural networks.\n\nAutoML frameworks are used to analyse multiple models. It also evaluates the model\u2019s performance and recommends the best one for the task. Besides this, hyperparameter tuning using ML techniques is used to ensure more optimal performance. Thus, Machine Learning maximises the model\u2019s predictive power with minimal manual intervention by streamlining model selection and optimisation.\n\nWrapping up\n\nData Science is making innovations daily, and Machine Learning plays an important role in this process. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques are used in every stage of the Data Science process. It automates repetitive tasks, enhances the EDA process and improves the prediction accuracy of the model.\n\nIn fact, the Data Science field is booming as of now and generating many career opportunities for individuals. Salaries are also lucrative for those who have the right knowledge and skills. It is high time for you to learn Data Science now. You will be surprised to know that you can also learn Data Science for free.\n\nI highly recommend you to join Pickl.AI as it offers one of the best free Data Science courses for beginners and professionals.

AFP\n\nIn 2024, the world continued to be gripped by conflict and chaos.\n\nRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine continued to grind on with both sides digging in and refusing to give way.\n\nIsrael has devastated large swaths of Gaza in the wake of the October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas.\n\nSyria\u2019s civil war took a shocking turn with rebels ousting Bashir al-Assad in a lightning offensive.\n\nThe brutal civil war in Sudan continued between the army and the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyanmar\u2019s civil war raged on with the rebels continuing to make inroads against the junta and gobble up territory.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the wars of 2024 \u2013 where they stand and what happens in 2025.\n\nUkraine-Russia war\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict, which kicked on in February 2022, dominated headlines in 2024.\n\nAccording to BBC, Russia has steadily made gains in Ukraine\u2019s east.\n\nRussia\u2019s troops in November \u2013 when the war crossed 1,000 days \u2013 took 30 square kilometres of Kyiv\u2019s territory.\n\nHowever, this Russia\u2019s progress has been painstakingly slow and come at a cost of much blood and treasure.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence has pegged Russia\u2019s losses at 70,000 soldiers killed and another 500,00 either killed or injured.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, has responded by opening a counter-offensive into Russia.\n\nKyiv has even claimed that its forces have encountered North Korean soldiers in Russia\u2019s Kursk region.\n\nWhile Moscow and Pyongyang have not confirmed this development, Nato has cited evidence of the same.\n\nIn this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, firefighters work on the site of a damaged building after a Russian missile attack in Kyiv. AP\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden has given Ukraine the all-clear to use its long-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles against Russia.\n\nThough experts insist that Kyiv being given permission to use these missiles is not a game changer, Moscow has responded by lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons.\n\nThe development, what is seen as a likely warning from Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin to the West to avoid escalation, came after Russia for months warned that that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire US, British, and French missiles deep into Russia then Moscow would consider those Nato members to be directly involved in the war in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia, for 2025, has set itself lofty goals in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv Independent quoted Russia\u2019s Defence Minister Andrei Belousov as saying that Moscow wants to completely capture Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia in 2025.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, Moscow plans to achieve victory in the war,\u201d he added.\n\nExperts say there is a very good chance that Russia could fulfill at least some of the goals of what it refers to as its \u2018special limited operation\u2019 in Ukraine.\n\nThe Guardian quoted Ukraine\u2019s ex-foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba as warning that Ukraine \u201cwill lose this war\u201d unless something changes.\n\nSamya Kullab, AP correspondent, Ukraine, told the outlet that the situation is far different from when the war began.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly,\u201d Kullab wrote.\n\nMaryna stands in the yard of her house during an evacuation of civilians from Pokrovsk, Ukraine. AP\n\nWhat makes the situation even more difficult for Ukraine is that Donald Trump is set to take office in January and that the Republicans, many of whom are against US continuing to support Kyiv, will gain control of all the levers of federal government in America\n\nTrump \u2013 a self-styled deal maker \u2013 will likely pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to cut a deal with Putin by threatening to cut off military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin has already said that he is willing to reach some compromise with US President-elect Donald Trump and that he would set no preconditions to begin talks with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThis is somewhat of a departure from what he said in June.\n\nAs per Kyiv Independent, Putin had claimed that Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia and disavowed its goal of joining Nato.\n\nPutin also demanded that Ukraine acknowledge Crimea and Sevastopol as Russian territory.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,\u201d Putin said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Putin has said any deal could only be signed with Ukraine\u2019s legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nZelenskyy, whose term was due to expire earlier this year but has been extended due to martial law, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin.\n\nPutin has dismissed the idea of agreeing a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice.\n\nBut Ukraine isn\u2019t without friends.\n\nA piece in The Conversation noted that European foreign ministers in December vowed to keep backing Ukraine.\n\nEx-Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas, currently the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said Ukraine needs \u201cnot just to hold on, but to tilt the balance to their favour because Putin will not stop, unless he\u2019s stopped\u201d.\n\nTh EU also continued to sanction individuals and companies in Russia.\n\nHowever, a piece in The Guardian argued the only way Kyiv will be able to prevail is if the rest of Europe steps up and fills in America\u2019s boots.\n\nThe newspaper noted that despite the realisation of what a Russian victory could mean for Europe, it remains to be seen whether politicians and public have the will to fight on.\n\nThe Conversation piece too noted that Zelenskyy has few good options.\n\n\u201cThe best that Ukraine can hope for is playing for time. Zelensky will need to placate Trump. He\u2019ll need to be open to the idea of negotiations with Russia while avoiding a collapse of the frontlines before a ceasefire can be achieved,\u201d the piece argued.\n\nThe piece continued that the only way Europe will be able to deter Putin is if finally starts standing up for itself and its Nato allies.\n\n\u201cSo far, they have talked the talk. In 2025, they will need to prove that they can walk the walk,\u201d the piece concluded.\n\nIsrael-Gaza conflict\n\nIsrael in 2024 continued its merciless bombardment of Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have been at each other\u2019s throats since gunmen from the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip stormed into southern Israel in October 2023.\n\nOver 1,200 were killed and 253 taken hostage by the terror group.\n\nIsrael has responded with a brutal military assault.\n\nOver 45,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities.\n\nNearly the entire population of 2.3 million people in the enclave has been displaced from their homes and much of the territory has been laid to waste.\n\nAccording to CFR, Israel\u2019s attempts at freeing the rest of the hostages have come to naught.\n\nEfforts to free the more than one hundred remaining Israeli and foreign hostages taken by Hamas have been largely unsuccessful, and their location and health status are unknown.\n\nPalestinians carry UN-donated flour in Khan Younis, central Gaza Strip. AP\n\nAs per Al Jazeera, such has been the devastation and the damage to civilians that Amnesty International released a report saying that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza fulfilled the legal definition of a genocide.\n\nHuman Rights Watch too has claimed Israel is committing \u201cacts of genocide\u201d by Palestinians in Gaza clean water.\n\nThe rights group has demanded that the international community issue \u2018targeted sanctions\u2019 against Israel.\n\nThe group in its report claimed that Israeli officials \u201cdeliberately obstructed Palestinians\u2019 access to the adequate amount of water required for survival in the Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s foreign ministry accused the rights group of lying, saying Israel had facilitated the continuous flow of water and humanitarian aid into Gaza since the start of the war despite constant attacks by Hamas.\n\nMeanwhile, US and Arab negotiators are working around the clock to hammer out a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas\n\nThe mediators, at talks in Egypt and Qatar, are trying to forge a deal to pause the 14-month-old war in the Hamas-ruled enclave.\n\nMediators had managed to narrow some gaps on previous sticking points but differences remained, the sources said.\n\nLast month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nBut there\u2019s a good chance the Israel-Gaza war could well end in 2025.\n\nYet again the shadow of Trump looms large over a conflict.\n\nAs per The Times of Israel, Trump in July told Netanyahu he wants the fighting ended before he takes office.\n\nTrump, at the time the Republican nominee, gave Netanyahu the diktat at a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe account was confirmed by an Israeli official and a former Trump administration official.\n\nAs for what comes after?\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel will keep hold of Gaza for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d after the war ends.\n\nOther Israeli officials have talked about the Israeli Defence Forces setting up a \u2018buffer zone\u2019 within the strip as it tries to clamp down on Hamas trying to reform.\n\nThe Netanyahu government also seems dead set against allowing the Palestinian Authority to take any role in Gaza\u2019s administration.\n\nA second Israeli official has said this is why the war in Gaza has stretched out.\n\nWell, Josef Federman, AP news director, Israel-Palestinian territories-Jordan, said there are signs that the war is in its final stages.\n\nA Palestinian boy carries jerrycans of water along a dirt road in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, AP\n\n\u201cBut even if it ends, I don\u2019t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that\u2019s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think.\u201d\n\nFederman said there is no turning the clock back to before the attack.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where diplomacy comes in \u2014 who\u2019s going to run it? It has to be somebody that\u2019s trusted by all of the sides. It has to be somebody that\u2019s confident they can do things differently. And you\u2019re going to have that constant threat of Hamas undermining the work if they\u2019re not part of this anymore.\u201d\n\nSyrian civil war\n\nSyria\u2019s civil war, which began in 2011, took a dramatic turn in late 2024.\n\nBashar al-Assad, who had been in power in Syria in 2000, fled the country after being ousted by rebels led by Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS).\n\nAssad had succeeded his father Hafez al-Assad as president. Hafez had ruled Syria since 1971.\n\nAs per CBS, the war had kicked off after pro-Democracy protests kicked off against Assad \u2013 who responded by killing his own people.\n\nBashar al-Assad with his wife Asma Akhras. Reuters\n\nAround 500,000 people are thought to have been killed in the civil war.\n\nHowever, for the past few years, none of the sides had managed to gain an advantage.\n\nThe year 2024 began with the status quo.\n\nAs per Vox, Sunni militants had established dominion over Syria\u2019s North East, the Kurds backed by America had claimed the North West.\n\nAssad, meanwhile, was in control of the rest of the country including Damascus.\n\nAs per Washington Post, violence began in October as insurgents and government forces clashed.\n\nRussia too conducted airstrikes on rebel groups.\n\nThe first sign of trouble for Assad began in late November when the Islamist-led rebel alliance began conducting its offensive.\n\nThe HTS and its allies quickly took control of Aleppo \u2013 a key city in Syria home to two million people \u2013 for the first time since the beginning of the war.\n\nThis, for Assad, was a catastrophe.\n\nAs per Vox, he had spent four years trying to take Aleppo, which before the war began had been Syria\u2019s biggest city, back piecemeal \u2013 and had reduced much of it to rubble in doing so.\n\nIt had taken the rebels just days to overwhelm government forces.\n\nSyria responded by conducting airstrikes on Aleppo with the help of its ally Russia.\n\n\u201cWe of course continue to support Bashar al-Assad and we continue contacts at the appropriate levels, we are analyzing the situation,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry too pledged its support for the regime of the dictator.\n\n\u201cOur military advisers were present in Syria, and they are still present. The presence of advisers from the Islamic Republic of Iran in Syria is not a new thing,\u201d Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei was quoted as saying.\n\nIran\u2019s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, even went to Syria to give Assad a message of support.\n\nBut some experts were already expressing scepticism about Assad\u2019s chances.\n\nAron Lund of the Century International think tank told CBS, \u201cAleppo seems to be lost for the regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\u201d\n\nThey cited the fact that Russia was heavily distracted by the war in Ukraine and that Iran and Hezbollah were left weakened by their conflict against Israel.\n\nAaron Stein, president of the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, said, \u201cRussia\u2019s presence has thinned out considerably and quick reaction airstrikes have limited utility.\u201d\n\nStein at the time called the developments \u201ca reminder of how weak the [Assad] regime is.\u201d\n\nThey said the rebels had been biding their time for years.\n\n\u201cThis has to do with geopolitics and local opportunity,\u201d Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies told Washington Post. \u201cThe rebellion at large had regrouped, rearmed and retrained for something like this.\u201d\n\nThe offensive had the international governments calling for de-escalation.\n\nMany, including the United States, which had declared the HTS as a terror group, were taken aback.\n\n\u201cIt goes to show that sometimes there\u2019s a tendency in Washington for people to sit there and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know, the conflict is frozen. We don\u2019t worry about it anymore,\u2019\u201d Brian Carter, an analyst who tracks militant groups in the Middle East for the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Critical Threats project told Vox. \u201cThis offensive shows how flawed that sort of thinking is. It\u2019s going to have big impacts for the region and for US policy.\u201d\n\nThe rebels, however, were in no mood to relent.\n\nHaving tasted the success of taking Aleppo, the rebels pushed on to the strategically-vital city of Hama.\n\nAnti-government fighters pose for a selfie on a Syrian regime military aircraft at the Kweyris military airfield in the eastern part of Aleppo province on Tuesday. AFP\n\nOn the way, they went on freeing inmates who had been held in Syria\u2019s jails for years.\n\nAs per Washington Post, Daraa then quickly fell to the rebels in short order.\n\nRebels also took the city of Homs \u2013 which effectively split the Assad regime in two.\n\nThen, on December 8, the Islamist faction entered Damascus.\n\nThey proclaimed the beginning of a new Syria.\n\n\u201cThis is a momentous moment, not just for the Syrian people, but for the people of the Middle East, Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians or otherwise,\u201d Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Middle East Institute, told CNN.\n\n\u201cThis is a regime that, for over 50 years, under the mantra of freedom, unity and socialism, oppressed, tortured and disappeared many millions in Syria.\u201d\n\nAssad, meanwhile, quickly fled to Moscow \u2013 where state media confirmed he had been granted asylum.\n\nAround the world, millions of Syrians who had fled the country began declaring their intentions to return.\n\nMeanwhile, the Joe Biden administration in the US, which had been watching the dizzying events, chimed in.\n\n\u201cOur approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,\u201d President Joe Biden said.\n\nHe credited action by the US and its allies for weakening Syria\u2019s backers \u2014 Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nHe called the fall of Assad a \u201cfundamental act of justice\u201d but also a \u201cmoment of risk and uncertainty,\u201d and said rebel groups are \u201csaying the right things now\u201d but the U.S. would assess their actions.\n\nExperts say West Asia could see massive changes in 2025.\n\nA US official told CNN that developments in Syria mark the collapse of \u201cIran\u2019s artifice\u201d across the region.\n\nA piece in CFR noted that West Asia is set to be the focus of attention next year.\n\n\u201cWill post-Assad Syria unify disparate opposition groups? Or will it remain a failed state, only this time, run by Islamists?\u201d\n\nThe piece contended that what happens in Syria next will have an impact on its immediate neighbors \u2013 Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel.\n\nDanny Citrinowicz is a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Middle East Programs, told the website said the Assad regime\u2019s demise will likely cause Tehran to reexamine its security strategy in West Asia.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of weeks, Iran lost its pillars in the Axis of Resistance. After the heavy blow that Hezbollah suffered at the hands of Israel, the fall of Assad is a fatal strike on Iran\u2019s influence efforts in the Middle East,\u201d Citrinowicz said.\n\nCitrinowicz argued that the fall of the Assad regime has dramatically weakened Iran\u2019s chances of rebuilding Hezbollah and threatening Israel.\n\n\u201c\u2026the collapse of the regime shows how much the tools in Iran\u2019s hands to save Assad without Hezbollah were almost non-existent. This fact also indicates Iran\u2019s weakness and its limited ability to influence what happens in the Middle East without its proxy.\u201d\n\nCitrinowicz said Iran will have to chart a new course without the support of proxies.\n\nSudanese civil war\n\nSudan\u2019s civil war entered its second year in 2024.\n\nAs per CFR, the war erupted in Sudan\u2019s capital Khartoum between Sudanese Armed Forces led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary group RSF spearheaded by Mohamed Hamdan \u201cHemedti\u201d Dagalo in April 2023.\n\nThe war, which has lasted 20 months, came ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule.\n\nThe RSF now controls swathes of central and western Sudan including most of the capital Khartoum and the Darfur region, its traditional base.\n\nAccording to CFR.org, almost 15,000 people have been killed, and more than 8.2 million have been displaced \u2013 the largest such crisis in the world.\n\nA view of a street in the city of Omdurman damaged in the year-long civil war in Sudan. Reuters\n\nHowever, researchers say the toll is likely far higher. Even in peace time, many deaths are not registered in Sudan, they contend.\n\nAs fighting intensified, people have been cut off from places that record deaths, including hospitals, morgues and cemeteries.\n\nRepeated disruptions to internet services and telecommunications has left millions unable to contact the outside world.\n\nAs per Bloomberg, Russia and Iran have provided Sudanese Armed Forces with and drones, while the UAE has emerged as a key backer of the RSF.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has provided weapons to both sides.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to our friends and appreciate the help we have received,\u201d Malik Agar, the deputy to al-Burhan, was quoted as saying. \u201cWe know who our friends are and who has chosen not to back us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important ambassadors today in Port Sudan are the Russian, the Turkish, the Egyptian and the Iranian,\u201d said Magdi el-Gizouli, a Sudanese academic and a fellow of the Rift Valley Institute, told _Bloomber_g. \u201cNobody in Sudan can fight without external support \u2014 it\u2019s just not possible. You don\u2019t make enough weapons in Sudan. You don\u2019t make enough ammunition. You don\u2019t generate fuel.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a humanitarian crisis has unfolded on the ground.\n\nThe UN says nearly 25 million people, half of Sudan\u2019s population, need aid as famine has taken hold in displacement camps and 11 million people have fled their homes.\n\nIt warns that the \u201cworld\u2019s largest hunger crisis\u201d could be at hand.\n\nUN refugee agency UNCHR has confirmed a famine in Darfur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an invisible crisis,\u201d UN\u2019s humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC in November. \u201cTwenty-five million Sudanese, more than half the country, need help now.\u201d\n\nNearly three million people have left for other countries.\n\nThis includes two million who have sought refuge in Chad, Ethiopia, and South Sudan.\n\nAccording to UNCHR, 1.2 million have fled to Egypt, 712,288 to Chad, 192,280 to South Sudan, 180,000 to Libya, 60,808 to Uganda and 39,984 to Ethiopia.\n\nThe US and rights groups have said both sides have committed atrocities, and accused the RSF of carrying out ethnic cleansing in Darfur.\n\nAccording to the BBC, both sides have been alleged to be using starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nSexual violence, the UN says, is \u2018an epidemic\u2019 in the country.\n\nBoth sides have dismissed all the charges.\n\nThe civil war may see fresh hostilities in 2025.\n\nRussia in November vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution that called on Sudan\u2019s warring parties to cease hostilities immediately and ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n\nThe move was hailed by the army-aligned Sudanese foreign ministry.\n\nAll other countries of the 15-member council, including China, voted in favor of the measure drafted by Britain and Sierra Leone.\n\nThe SAF and RSF may be preparing for a do-or-die battle.\n\nSudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) head of delegation Omer Hamdan Ahmed speaks at a press conference on the current situation in Sudan. Reuters\n\nBloomberg quoted a United Nations security assessment as saying that that both sides \u201care actively replenishing their weapon supplies, including drones, to strengthen their positions.\u201d\n\nThis comes even as the RSF has said it will work with a planned new government to oversee territories they control.\n\nBut that brings with it its own set of problems.\n\nAny new administration ruling that area would be a challenge to the internationally recognised and army-led national government which was forced out of Khartoum last year and now operates on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan.\n\nA group of civilian politicians and armed group leaders have agreed to set up what they describe as a \u201cpeace government\u201d, members of the group told Reuters this week.\n\nThey said it would be civilian-led, independent of the RSF and set up to replace the government in Port Sudan which they accused of prolonging the war.\n\nWestern diplomats told Reuters they were aware of discussions about a new administration, and said that any institution that emerged would be controlled by the RSF.\n\n\u201cI see no one rushing to recognise them,\u201d one Western diplomat said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest weakness of the RSF is no functioning chain of command. All the atrocities we see, how do we see that in a government?\u201d\n\nRegardless of who comes out on top, outsiders will be looking to take advantage.\n\n\u201cSudan seems to be an easy win that you can get on the cheap,\u201d el-Gizouli told Bloomberg. \u201cYou can get the Red Sea coast, you can get political influence in Khartoum, you can get mineral resources at a very cheap price. You can make a hell of a profit out of a country like Sudan.\u201d\n\nMyanmar civil war\n\nMyanmar has been in chaos since 2021 after the junta toppled the democratically-elected regime of Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nAnger against the junta in the aftermath of the coup has given rise to a nationwide armed resistance movement.\n\nFighting has only grown more intense over the past year.\n\nAccording to DW, the uprising is fiercest in regions dominated by ethnic minorities.\n\nIn these areas, ethnics groups and civilian-led defence forces have stitched together alliances to challenge the military across vast swathes of the country.\n\nWhile rebels have made inroads across the war-torn Southeast Asian nation, this is particularly true for areas near the China border.\n\nAccording to BBC, the army has suffered humiliation upon humiliation this past year.\n\nRebels in December took control of the country\u2019s western border with Bangladesh after insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA) drove out the junta\u2019s Border Guard Police (PGP5) in northern Rakhine State.\n\nThis video grab released by the Arakan Army shows burning buildings in the headquarters of the army\u2019s western command in Ann township, Rakhine state, Myanmar. AP\n\nThe entire 270 kilometre with Bangladesh is now governed by the rebels.\n\nThe BBC noted that in Rakhine State only the capital Sittwe remains in military hands \u2013 which is isolated from the rest of the nation.\n\nThe army has suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the Arakan Army.\n\nThe AA will likely be the first insurgent group to take complete control of a state in Myanmar, as per BBC.\n\nAmid the fighting, there has been much devastation and human suffering.\n\nThe Conversation quoted UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk as saying that the military has killed more than 5,000 civilians since 2021.\n\nOver three million people have been displaced across the country.\n\nAround 18 million people \u2013 a third of the populace \u2013 do not have food, housing access to electricity and heating.\n\nAmong those that have suffered most are the Rohingya population of Myanmar.\n\n\u201cWe cannot deny the fact that Rohingyas have been persecuted by Myanmar governments for many years, and the Rakhine people supported that,\u201d a Rohingya man told BBC.\n\n\u201cThe government wants to keep Rohingyas from becoming citizens, but the Rakhine people believe there should be no Rohingyas at all in Rakhine State. Our situation today is even more difficult than it was under the rule of the military junta.\u201d\n\nAs per The Conversation, nearly 750,000 people have fled to Bangladesh.\n\nChina has been pushing for a ceasefire in Myanmar.\n\nTwo out of three members of the Brotherhood Alliance have agreed to it.\n\nWhile the insurgents have demanded that the military be cut off from politics, they may ultimately seek to hold onto their gains rather than push for a complete reform.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s neighbours are worried.\n\nThailand in December hosted talks to resolve the political crisis.\n\nThe meeting was attended by foreign ministers and high-level representatives from Myanmar as well as Laos, China, India, Bangladesh and host Thailand.\n\nBut experts say this approach is unlikely to bear fruit.\n\nDavid Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst working on conflict and human rights issues on Myanmar, told DW, \u201cUnless the Myanmar military is serious about peace, these talks will be extremely limited. You can\u2019t approach any diplomacy on Myanmar without a clear understanding that the military is the root cause of all the problems,\u201d Mathieson said.\n\nThis photo released by the Arakan Army, shows members of the Arakan Army posing for a photograph in front of the captured district police office in Ann township, Rakhine state, Myanmar. AP\n\nHe added not to give any credence to the junta\u2019s vow to hold polls.\n\n\u201cNo one should be taking these claims seriously. This is a trap of diplomacy. If any interlocutor takes election preparations seriously, they have doomed the country to prolonged conflict,\u201d he underlined.\n\nKyi, the 78-year-old Nobel laureate, meanwhile, is now under house arrest.\n\nShe faces 27 years in prison for crimes ranging from treason and bribery to violations of the telecommunications law.\n\nShe denied all charges against her.\n\nKyi was previously held under house arrest for a total of 15 years under a previous junta. Her son fears she will be used as a \u2018bargaining chip\u2019 or a human shield.\n\nIn November, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, requested an arrest warrant for junta leader Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the junta can hold on in 2025 \u2013 or even mount an unlikely comeback.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

            "date": "2h",
            "source": "Mena FN",
            "article_content": "(MENAFN- Straits Research) Introduction\n\nWith the assistance of interpreted content for specialized mobile applications, the managed mobility service providers offer solutions that reduce the workload of enterprise IT departments by handling the complex management of multiple device platforms. Therefore, managed mobility services facilitate communication between mobile office workers and management, servers, and databases by connecting them to these resources. In addition, organizations in the healthcare end-user are required to comply with HIPAA regulations regarding the sharing and storage of data. In the healthcare industry, these factors will likely spur the adoption of managed mobility services.\n\nMarket Dynamics Increasing Adoption of BYOD in Multiple Industries to Drive the Global Managed Mobility Services Market\n\nOver the years, the enterprise mobility trend has emerged. Today, firms concentrate primarily on business strategy and core competencies, driving the use and adoption of bring-your-own-device policies (BYOD). This raises the need for streamlined mobility services and will undoubtedly increase demand for controlling these mobile devices. Moreover, the expanding mobile subscriber base in emerging nations such as China, India, Brazil, etc., is accelerating the adoption of BYOD policies, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and flexibility.\n\nAccording to Cisco, businesses with a BYOD strategy save an average of USD 350 per employee annually. Furthermore, reactive programs can increase these savings to approximately USD 1,300 per employee annually. These cost savings can add up quickly for SMBs and allow them to protect their bottom line while increasing employee productivity. The BYOD policy is embraced by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), necessitating diverse security software to protect corporate data across multiple devices. Various industry verticals, including retail, banking, financial services, insurance, IT and telecom, manufacturing, aerospace and defense, healthcare, and others, utilize cybersecurity solutions, such as managed security, to protect their data. BYOD provides organizations with greater flexibility, increases employee satisfaction, permits greater choice in the type of device used to complete a task, and reduces hardware expenditures and software licensing costs. Consequently, optimizing operational expenses and creating a positive.\n\nConsequently, demand for mobile device management solutions increases. IBM, for instance, provides the solution for increasing BYOD visibility, management, and security. For instance, the company has implemented mobile device management and enterprise mobility management to protect documents, applications, and content and manage user access and identity.\n\nCybersecurity Compliance Requirements by the State and Local Governments and Regulatory Bodies to Provide Opportunities for the Global Managed Mobility Services Market\n\nGiven the rate of mergers and acquisitions, the managed service providers market is likely to be a highly competitive industry in the future. In addition, most MSPs may recognize the need to adopt MSSP business models, which require cybersecurity expertise in addition to IT management. Cybersecurity compliance requirements mandated by state and local governments and regulatory bodies also necessitate that MSPs prioritize security. Additionally, as dedicated, on-premise hardware for computing purposes declines and the majority of functionality migrates to the cloud, privacy and security concerns may intensify.\n\nThis also allows employees to utilize their own devices for office work. According to a Scalefusion article, 31% of companies permit employees to use their smartphones and laptops for work. In addition, approximately 61% of companies expect their employees to be accessible from home despite not possessing a company-issued device. As a result of these trends, managed mobility service providers are gradually adopting the MSPv(IT) and MSP (Security) business models. To avoid fading into IT obscurity, the market is reorganizing its structural ecosystem. This will propel the managed mobility services market in the coming years.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nBy region, the global managed mobility service market is bifurcated into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and LAMEA.\n\nNorth America occupies the largest market share and is expected to register a CAGR of 22.6% during the forecast period.

The United States will continue to have the highest average of devices and connections per capita in 2023, with an average of 13.6 devices and connections per capita, followed by South Korea and Japan. In addition, the country's 5G adoption will bolster future demand for IoT devices. The focus on 5G deployment by national mobile operators such as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon has resulted in significant advancements over time. According to the GSMA, 5G will reach 100 million mobile connections by early 2023 and surpass 190 million connections by 2025, making it the leading mobile network technology in the United States. The increased rate of cloud adoption in the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to accelerate the digital transformation of businesses, ultimately resulting in the adoption of managed mobility solutions.\n\n\n\nEurope is the second largest region. It is estimated to reach an expected value of USD 7363 million by 2031, registering a CAGR of 23.3%. Germany holds a significant market share in the studied market. It is anticipated to see increased adoption of managed mobility services due to the country's large remote-operating industry presence and favorable government initiatives. The German government's initiatives are one of the primary drivers pushing the market for managed mobility services.

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nAt some point, the truth about all of these UFO and drone sightings has to start being revealed. There are just too many eyewitness reports and videos being shared online for governments to just keep pretending like nothing is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the United States either (though that is where a majority of the reports are originating). They have also been happening in places like the United Kingdom, Germany, and now, in Brazil.\n\nWhile orb-shaped UFOs are perhaps the most common type of UFO that has been seen over the years, triangular-shaped crafts have also been reported being seen quite often.\n\nThe latest triangular-shaped UFO to be reported, and in this case filmed, occurred recently in the Barigui Park, in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.\n\n\u201cI came across the video yesterday while browsing reels on Instagram,\u201d a report written for Ovniologia in Brazil read. \u201cThe account published the footage, called Paranadrone , is a page dedicated to aerial images to with drones and has no connection to the UFO theme.\n\n\u201cI contacted you and requested the original footage, which was sent to me. The video was forwarded them by a follower who requested anonymity. The images were recorded around 8 pm, while the witness was in a trade in the park region.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the video, it is possible to see that the person filming was apparently close to a wall, inside a residence or business, the Paranadro told me. Then, we see a large, luminous point coming from the left, reveals its which triangular shape when the witness zooms in,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cThe object crosses the sky at a considerable and constant speed until it disappears from the author\u2019s field of vision behind the trees. See below.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have what appears to be beautiful footage of a triangular UFO. The fixed, unwavering lights at the bottom seem to match reports of these craft. One worth thing noting is the number of lights. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, three to four lights are usually reported on these objects. However, in the footage, in addition to the three lights at the ends, we can see two more luminous points near the larger central light.\n\n\u201cThis led me to question if it was actually a solid object or just a formation of orbs. While the footage is quite clear, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say that another witness to the same UFO claimed it had \u201ctwo lights at a considerably low altitude that same day. One of them was in front of her house, with a green and red coloration, while the other, located behind the house, was orange in color and considerably larger.\u201d\n\nHer neighbor also saw the UFO and also filmed it.\n\nThe report by Ovniologia went on to explain, \u201cI spoke to other people who reported strange activity in the skies over Curitiba this month. The reports describe some anomalous sightings and experiences. It is possible that that some incidence of the phenomenon is occurring in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the video of the triangular UFO, the first thing thing that came to mind was the wave of drones on American soil. Could there be any possible connection? Could it be starting to spread to other regions of the Americas? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo far, no definitive explanation has been revealed."

            "article_content": "People often wonder why bad things happen to good people. Or, why bad things happen at all, really.\n\nSome use this as part of their basis for atheism, saying that they don\u2019t understand why God would allow bad things to happen. Others have not let this deter them from seeking out and finding religion.\n\nBut, if these questions could be answered, wouldn\u2019t everyone feel at least a bit more satisfied?\n\nOne pastor thinks he knows why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening.\n\nA man named Jeremy, who identified himself as \u201ca deep skeptic [and] also a pastor,\u201d believes that quantum physics holds the age-old answer to why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe shared his theory on TikTok.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pastor began by explaining the basics of quantum physics.\n\n\u201cSo we exist in four dimensions, which is really interesting \u2018cause most people think we exist in three dimensions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, uh, it\u2019s actually four, and Einstein may have been the first person to actually label it this way.\u201d\n\nJeremy said that those four dimensions consist of length, width, height, and time.\n\n\u201cBut Einstein said that our experience of time is interesting because we don\u2019t experience all of time; we just experience time as duration,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs, like, this progression from where we are to wherever we are next. So, he actually said that we exist in three and a half dimensions.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jeremy, each dimension builds on the previous one, which gives us the three-dimensional world that we know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeremy admitted that this was \u201ca little nerdy\u201d and difficult to understand. After all, the average person did not take a quantum physics class in high school. But he promised that if you stuck with him, he would prove his point.\n\nThe pastor explained that the concept of time in quantum physics explains his theory.\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s just say that God occupies all of the four dimensions that we occupy and occupies them fully,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat means that God experiences all of time, as what one philosopher called an \u2018eternal now.\u2019 That everything in time is now to God. And so when God acts within those four dimensions, it actually is not acting in duration, but in all of them at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Jeremy said, \u201cthat you can\u2019t use terms like before or after with God. Terms like before or after don\u2019t make sense because God doesn\u2019t experience time as duration in this sort of philosophical framework.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJESHOOTS.com | Pexels\n\nBasically, what Jeremy meant was that we experience time as \u201cduration\u201d or how we get from point A to point B. God does not. Instead, he experiences it all at once. It is all \u201cnow\u201d to him.\n\n\u201cSo when you think about that question, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t God stop bad things from happening?\u2019 it\u2019s very much related to time, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why did God not act before this thing happened? But when you talk about God existing in all the dimensions, there is no before, there is no after with God. God is experiencing the eternal now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is, quite frankly, all really confusing.\n\nCould this be an answer to why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening? It\u2019s possible. Then again, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s just the ramblings of someone who\u2019s a little too geeky for their own good.\n\nAs for the Biblical perspective, Pastor William L. Kynes, the Senior Fellow for Pastoral Theology at the C.S. Lewis Institute, wrote, \u201cThough we can never give a full explanation of evil in this world, we do have God\u2019s response to it.\u201d\n\n@ashleyhetherington to the girl who may be wondering why God is allowing this to happen\u2728\ud83d\udc97#christiantiktok #relatable #christiangirl #jesus #christian #bibleverse #bibleverse #gospel #trending #motivation #viral #God #dailybible #fyp #Godisgood #testimony \u266c original sound- ashley hetherington\n\nKynes cited the scripture Revelation 21:4, which says in part, \u201cHe will wipe every tear from their eyes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that there are some things we will simply never understand, although we try to make sense of it.\n\nMary-Faith Martinez is a writer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and Journalism who covers news, psychology, lifestyle, and human interest topics."

            "article_content": "Photo: VCG\n\nThroughout the year of 2024, there has been no shortage of posts and videos on social media platforms by bloggers from home or abroad, sharing how they were captivated by China's surging scientific revolution tide, ranging from real-time food delivery by hotel room service robots, driverless artificial intelligent (AI) robots delivering parcels to spherical robots patrolling the street side by side with police officers.In a recent milestone, a group of four-legged \"Made in China\" robotic dogs, designed for tunnel inspections and maintenance tasks, have been put on duty and are now operating in a 6-kilometer underground power tunnel inspection project in Singapore - the first overseas deployment of a Chinese robotic solution in such an application scenario.These unique creatures have wooed thousands of netizens after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian shared a video of them on social media in mid-December, calling them \"cool.\"The \"cool\" wave of the tech revolution has been unlocking more exciting possibilities across multiple Chinese industries in 2024, a year that is deemed critical for the rapid advancement of China's robotics technology. It, in a broader picture, underscored the explosive progress of new quality productive forces -an emerging key term in China's economic and social axis that is playing an expanding role in driving the country's high-quality development.A walk-in into manufacturing bases across various Chinese localities also provides insights into how the development of new quality productive forces has been transforming traditional industries while injecting new impetus into driving the country's industrial upgrade.To date, a flurry of auto-makers and logistics providers including Geely, BAIC New Energy, and SF Express have been integrating humanoid robots, considered at the forefront of the development of new quality productive forces, into their facilities, the Global Times learned from Hong Kong-listed UBTech Robotics. These robots are being trialed on factory floors to perform tasks like assembly, transportation, testing, and maintenance, making remarkable progress in automation and industrial efficiency improvement in the world's second-largest economy.In December, the just-concluded Central Work Economic Conference set priorities for economic work in 2025, including ensuring that scientific and technological innovation drives the development of new quality productive forces and builds a modernized industrial system.As China is steadily marching toward the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026-30), industry insiders expect that the development of new quality productive forces will serve as a cornerstone of China's long-term strategic vision in the face of a more complicated geopolitical landscape, rising protectionism and global tech supply chain \"decoupling.\" Meanwhile, China's build-up of a host of emerging industries like AI and 5G would also create a new type of global supply and value chains that injects strong momentum and brings more development opportunities to the Global South, analysts stressed.During this year's national two sessions in March, the phrase new quality productive forces has become a buzzword among Chinese officials, national lawmakers, and political advisors, with \"developing new quality productive forces at a faster pace\" listed among the major tasks for 2024 in the Government Work Report for the first time.More elaborations on the concept, as well as detailed plans and coordinating measures, were released in follow-ups, further highlighting its profound ramifications in the country's economic policymaking and future development course.In early December, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting to analyze and study the economic work of 2025, during which it was noted that new quality productive forces have developed steadily this year.According to industry insiders, scientific and technological innovation is the core of the new quality productive forces. In this regard, China has achieved numerous monumental milestones in sci-tech innovation this year in a variety of sectors, such as semiconductor, quantum computing, telecom technology, AI, low-altitude economy, biomedicine, new energy, and large aircraft manufacturing.It is important to sustain this homegrown technological climb-up momentum, according to analysts, and they expect the 15th Five-year Plan (2026-2030) to continue prioritizing the development of new quality productive forces, listing it as both an urgent task and a long-term vision.Pan Helin, a member of the Expert Committee for the Information and Communication Economy under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told the Global Times that the accumulation of these technological edges is crucial to fueling China's ongoing industrial transformation and upgrading. It is also conducive to the formation of new economic drivers and new business models, which are all decisive elements in buttressing China's high-quality development course in the years to come.The accelerated efforts in the development of new quality productive forces also come as Western countries show no sign of retreating from technological suppression against China.Against the backdrop, industry insiders called for more inputs in independent innovation and a strong spirit of self-reliance in core technologies, so that the country will be less vulnerable to any malicious attempts to curb its development and will have a greater say in international technological standard-setting.In terms of humanoid robots which integrate a wide range of cutting-edge full-stack AI technologies, Chinese players may start late as the technology and products were initially developed in countries like the US and Japan a decade ago. But this year, Chinese humanoid robot companies have achieved remarkable innovations, establishing themselves as global leaders in both robot products and applications, UBTech Robotics told the Global Times.The Government Work Report delivered in March 2024 stressed that China will pool the country's strategic scientific and technological strength and non-governmental innovation resources to make breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields and step up research on disruptive and frontier technologies.Highlighting the country's institutional advantage, Hua Rongqi, a Beijing-based AI entrepreneur, told the Global Times that China is perhaps the most efficient in mobilizing resources nationwide to enhance its capacity for innovation across the board. He said that this advantage is particularly palpable in the generative AI industry which is in a white-hot global race.At the same time, China excels in applying these technologies to real-world scenarios, and also is home to the world's most efficient and cost-effective supply chain alongside a deep pool of talent, which will all propel the development of new quality productive forces, Hua added.Zhou Hongyi, founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology, told the Global Times that China's stepped-up efforts are poised to make greater contributions to global technological progress and economic development, with its innovation-driven development model offering valuable experience for other countries to draw upon.\"On the one hand, industrial digitalization will create more new business models and growth dynamics, thereby generating great opportunities for global investors to tap into the country's expanding market. On the other hand, more and more countries will show great interest in engaging with technological cooperation taking account of China's growing technological prowess,\" Zhou explained.Chinese industries related to the development of new quality productive forces have increasingly risen to become a magnet to foreign investors this year.In the first 11 months, foreign direct investment in the country's high-tech manufacturing reached 82.53 billion yuan, accounting for 11 percent of the national total, data released by the Ministry of Commerce showed.According to UBTech Robotics, China's fast-lane development of new quality productive forces has also elevated the global standing and influence of Chinese enterprises and rendered them with more business opportunities in the global market. The company to date has collaborated with local partners to apply robotics solutions in countries such as Thailand, Dubai, South Korea, Japan, and Germany.Huang Lingxiao, overseas marketing manager of DEEP Robotics, the Chinese company that provides robotic dogs for tunnel maintenance tasks in Singapore, told the Global Times on Thursday that as developed nations like Singapore upgrade their industrial infrastructure through automation and digitization, this creates enormous opportunities for innovative solutions from Chinese robotics companies."
