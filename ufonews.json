            "article_content": "When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \u201cflying saucer.\u201d\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Rhode Island using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis. Popular Now on What'sUpNewp What\u2019s Up in Newport today: Thursday, November 28 Happy Thanksgiving! Here\u2019s what\u2019s up today.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nYou may also like: Counties receiving the most SBA loans in Rhode Island\n\nPeopleImages.com \u2013 Yuri A // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

            "article_content": "Residents of Central Alberta in Canada recently witnessed a breathtaking atmospheric display as light pillars illuminated the night sky. These dazzling columns of light seem to emanate from ground-level sources, stretching upwards into the sky and creating an otherworldly, mirror-like illusion. Often misconstrued as paranormal phenomena, these light pillars are in fact a striking natural optical illusion formed by specific winter conditions.\n\nSee pictures and videos here:\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form. For example, these photos were taken at\u2026 pic.twitter.com/F3Rk55UXaV \u2014 Malinda \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea (@TreasChest) November 26, 2024\n\nHow are Light pillars formed?\n\nThese vertical beams of light are created when light, usually from artificial sources such as streetlights, reflects off hexagonal ice crystals, typically measuring 0.02 mm, suspended in the atmosphere. These plate-shaped crystals behave like tiny mirrors, reflecting light from ground-based sources such as streetlights, building lights, or other artificial illuminations. As the light bounces off the ice crystals, it creates a dazzling, shimmering pillar that appears to stretch high into the sky, producing a breathtaking visual display.\n\nWhile striking, these light pillars are a natural and scientifically understood phenomenon, unrelated to extraterrestrial activity or other mysterious causes. The winter phenomenon is predominantly witnessed in regions with frigid climates, particularly where temperatures plummet during the winter months. Countries such as Canada, Russia, and parts of Scandinavia offer ideal conditions for this spectacle, with light pillars frequently observed on bitterly cold nights when ice crystals are abundant in the atmosphere.\n\nLight pillars in Tobolsk, Russia, November 2024. pic.twitter.com/0fHiRHFgWm \u2014 Kirill Bakanov (@WeatherSarov1) November 15, 2024\n\nThe formation of light pillars demands a precise convergence of meteorological conditions, including extremely cold temperatures ranging from -10\u00b0 to -40\u00b0C, high humidity levels, and calm conditions with virtually no wind."

Here's what you need to know, according to Nasa... Asteroid: An asteroid is a small rocky body that orbits the Sun.
