Free software for creating images and videos has led to a surge in slop, driven by scammers, spammers and the occasional genuine user seeking to go viral.\n\nFacebook\u2019s most recent report from its Transparency Center reveals that two of the top five most widely viewed images on the network in the three months to September were AI-generated \u2013 viewed 38.6m and 35.8m times respectively.\n\nMatt Navara, a social media consultant, says the novelty of these posts has quickly worn thin for many of Facebook\u2019s billions of users.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of low-quality or spammy AI content risks cluttering feeds and diminishing overall user satisfaction,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing little evidence yet that users are actively demanding such content in their feeds.\u201d\n\nIn March, Facebook users began to notice a flood of images featuring Jesus Christ mixed with a crustacean rising from the sea. These \u201cShrimp Jesus\u201d posts garnered hundreds of thousands of interactions and tens of millions of views.\n\nOther weird AI trends soon emerged, including African women building fruit sculptures and young children showing off elaborate birthday cakes with the caption: \u201cThis is my first cake\u201d."

            "article_content": "The drone crisis that's been causing a stir across the eastern US shows no signs of abating. Hundreds of mysterious drones have been sighted in the skies recently, mainly over New Jersey but also reaching as far as New York and Connecticut.\n\nDespite officials' attempts to reassure the public that these unidentified objects pose no threat to national security, their unknown origins continue to fuel wild speculation. Some suggest they're on the hunt for \"nuclear warheads\", while others believe they could be the property of foreign superpowers.\n\nMore ominously, some observers reckon this wave of sightings is just the tip of the iceberg \u2013 with something major expected within the next few weeks. UFO expert Dr. Steven Greer has suggested that these strange lights seen worldwide are part of a staged operation designed to trick the public into believing an alien invasion is imminent.\n\nSpeaking to Newsmax's Rob Finnerty, Dr Greer predicted that the situation will escalate \"in the next 30 days or so\". He believes the supposed \"alien invasion\" is a cover-up to hide the real truth about extraterrestrial encounters, which he alleges have been happening for several decades.\n\nImage: (Image: Youtube/ABC 7)) (Image: Youtube/ABC 7))\n\nAccording to him, alien technology has fallen into the hands of US weapons manufacturers, who have initiated an operation to keep the conspiracy under wraps, reports the Express US.\n\nHe asserts: \"We have a team of about six different black sites that have been running illegal projects related to so-called UAPs and UFOs.\n\n\"Coming forward in the next 30 days or so, they will bring forth positive evidence of this and the fact that these programs have been run illegally and outside of constitutional oversight.\"\n\nIt's quite the bold statement, one that aligns with various commentators' forecasts that by early 2025, there'll be a significant shift in how the public is informed about UFOs. Ross Coulthart \u2013 who's become synonymous with the \"UFO disclosure\" campaign \u2013 has predicted that \"all hell is going to break loose\" as the new year ticks in, calling it \"the calm before the storm\".\n\nImage: (Image: Getty Images)) (Image: Getty Images))\n\nDespite the buzz, the enigmatic drones remain an unsolved riddle. U.\n\nS. Government honchos confess their ignorance regarding who controls these supposed drones, whilst simultaneously assuring there's no risk at play.\n\nCoupled with President-elect Donald Trump revealing that the US government has deep insights into the drone debacle, it seems clear that, regardless of what reality holds, incoming 2025 promises to be one heck of a rollercoaster for enthusiasts and skeptics alike."

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nThe gaming app promoted in the misleading video is not on Pagcor\u2019s list of licensed electronic and offshore gaming platforms\n\nClaim: The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) launched an online gaming platform in partnership with a global software developer company.\n\nRating: FALSE\n\nWhy we fact-checked this: The Facebook ad was posted by a page with over 1,100 followers and has already gained 24,300 likes, 3,200 comments, and 352 shares as of this writing.\n\nThe video begins with a supposed news report by ABS-CBN newscaster Karen Davila about the launch of a new online gaming platform, PH888.COM, by Pagcor. The platform is purportedly developed in partnership with a global software company called \u201cProblematic Play.\u201d\n\nThe advertisement promotes the platform as a safe gaming app, assuring players they will win the jackpot prize within a week.\n\nThe facts: Pagcor has not announced its supposed launch of the gaming app on any of its official channels.\n\nBased on Pagcor\u2019s List of Service Providers and Registered Domains/URLs as of December 18, 2024, PH888.com is not on the list of licensed electronic and offshore gaming platforms.\n\nIn a report last July 2024 during a Senate committee hearing, the government-owned and -controlled corporation revealed that it had identified and blocked a total of 5,793 illegal online gaming websites. These included platforms falsely claiming accreditation from the agency and using its logo in their promotional materials.\n\nThe agency has also previously said that it is eyeing the launch of its own online gaming platform, casinofilipino.com, in 2024, but there have been no updates as of writing.\n\nAI-manipulated: The supposed news report by Davila is fake. Deepfake detector tool TrueMedia.org labeled the video ad as AI manipulated with a 100% confidence rate in its analyses for detecting deepfake and AI-generated audio.\n\nSimilarly, Render.Ai flagged the video\u2019s audio as fake. This assessment is supported by noticeable mismatch between the lip movements of Davila and other individuals featured in the video and the accompanying narration.\n\nPragmatic, not Problematic: The company logo featured in the latter part of the video belongs to global iGaming provider \u201cPragmatic Play,\u201d not Problematic Play.\n\nOne clip in the ad features an interview with Pragmatic Play\u2019s Irina Cornides where she responds in English, contrary to the Tagalog or Filipino dialogue implied in the video. The original interview was conducted by EGR Global during the International Casino Exhibition 2023 in London.\n\nA search on its website shows that PH888.com is not on the list of games recognized by Pragmatic Play.\n\nDebunked: Rappler has previously fact-checked several AI-manipulated content. In 2024, AI-driven disinformation has become a prominent challenge in the information landscape.

            "article_content": "Tongyi Qianwen, Alibaba's large language model, on display during an expo in Shanghai last year. LONG WEI/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek has made a significant mark in the generative AI landscape with the groundbreaking release of its latest large-scale language model (LLM), which is comparable to leading models from heavyweights like OpenAI.\n\nDeepSeek's V3 model, trained for just two months using significantly fewer computing resources, delivers performance on par with the world's top proprietary model, GPT-4o, at a much lower cost than its rivals, according to the Hangzhou-based firm.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 makes it \"look easy today with an open weights release of a frontier-grade LLM trained on a joke of a budget (2,048 GPUs for 2 months, $6M)\", posted Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI, on social media platform X.\n\n\"This is such clean engineering under resource constraints\u2026all of this looks so elegant,\" said Tim Dettmers, a research scientist at Allen AI, on X.\n\nDeepSeek's new open-source tool exemplifies a shift in China's AI ambitions, signaling that merely catching up to ChatGPT is no longer the goal. Instead, Chinese tech firms are now focused on delivering more affordable and versatile AI services.\n\nAccording to a 2024 report by the China Internet Network Information Center, 230 million users in China had registered for using generative AI-powered products as of June 2024.\n\nIn November, the Beijing-based AI startup Shengshu Technology unveiled its image-to-video tool called Vidu-1.5, capable of generating a video from as few as three input images within 30 seconds while establishing logical relationships among those objects in a scene.\n\nIts impressive performance has quickly garnered widespread admiration in both the AI community and the film industry.\n\nSony's Venom: The Last Dance, screened in China in October, was accompanied by an elegant Chinese ink-style promotional video crafted by Vidu. In the clip, ink blossoms across the screen as Venom morphs into a war horse, fish and crane, before playfully turning into a Kongming Lantern.\n\nUsing traditional film methods to produce a 30-second trailer typically takes about 30 days, but with Vidu, it only takes 10 working days and saves nearly 90 percent on post-production costs, said Zhang Xudong, product director of Shengshu Technology.\n\nAI design can also inspire artists, offering new creative ideas beyond expectations, Zhang added.\n\nIn March, Wang Feng and his team at East China Normal University unveiled a million-word AI-generated fantasy novel, Heavenly Mandate Apostle, crafted with a homegrown large language model. \"This novel was completed in just a month and a half, a feat that would take a dedicated human author a full year to match,\" Wang said.\n\nThe team later launched their second AI-generated novel, The Awakening at the Machine Epoch, which features a more gripping narrative, averaging 1.5 conflicts per chapter compared to the 1.2 in their first work.\n\nThe Xingye chatbot, developed by Shanghai-based startup MiniMax, uses AI to enable users to interact with a virtual romantic partner. However, its youthful user base has fostered a unique \"community vibe,\" as the app combines an AI chatbot with a collectible card system, creating a dynamic platform for user-generated content.\n\nThe chatbot is drawing in a variety of internet culture enthusiasts, ranging from anime and comic fans to cosplayers and gamers, who use AI virtual characters to collaboratively create unique narratives deeply resonant with their respective communities.\n\nXingye's international version, Talkie, along with another Chinese AI companion app, Poly.ai, ranked among the top 10 most downloaded AI apps in the United States during the first half of 2024.\n\nAlibaba's Tongyi LLM, specializing in digital avatar tech, has recently gained internet fame with its \"All-People's Stage\" feature. This innovative feature transforms static photos into dynamic singing or dancing videos, setting a new trend in entertainment.\n\nIn June, during a gala on China Central Television, Tongyi's AI-generated technology enabled Terracotta Warriors to perform the traditional Chinese art form of Huayin old tune.\n\nHowever, the misuse of talking head technology has led to a surge in fake content, such as rewriting the classic Dream of the Red Chamber as a martial arts story.\n\nLast month, China's broadcasting watchdog issued new rules to strengthen oversight, highlighting the country's commitment to closely monitoring the rapid growth of AI.\n\nXinhua"

            "article_content": "TikTok is launching its global STEM feed in Saudi Arabia as part of its ongoing efforts to diversify content and inspire young Saudis to explore new careers in science, technology, maths and engineering.\n\n\n\nThe kingdom becomes the first country in MENA to roll out this innovative feature, further cementing its commitment to fostering a combination of entertainment and education.\n\n\n\nTikTok\u2019s new STEM feed is designed to provide the community with high-quality, verified content in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

It also supports TikTok\u2019s broader goal of content discovery and community building, ensuring the community can easily access enriching and inspiring content.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the STEM feed will be regionally optimised in collaboration with local partners such as Majarra, a leading provider of high-quality, useful, and credible Arabic content online, to ensure it meets the highest standards of scientific accuracy and relevance to Saudi Arabia\u2019s developmental goals. As part of its long-term vision, TikTok plans to cultivate additional partnerships with top educational platforms, expanding the feed\u2019s offerings and further enhancing its impact on STEM education in the region.\n\n\n\nA key part of the STEM feed\u2019s success will come from its vibrant creator community. A diverse range of creators, educators, and STEM enthusiasts will share content that sparks curiosity and promotes hands-on learning. By showcasing these creators from Saudi Arabia and beyond, the STEM feed will become a dynamic resource for youth to explore STEM careers and ignite their passion for discovery.\n\n\n\nGlobally, STEM-related communities on TikTok have already proven to be a massive success, with almost 10 million STEM-related videos published globally in the last three years. From hands-on experiments to tutorials on coding and engineering principles, the platform offers endless opportunities for creators and the community to share their knowledge and passion."

            "article_content": "If 2023 was the year of AI discovery and 2024 was that of AI experimentation, then 2025 will be the year that organisations seek to maximise AI-driven efficiencies and leverage AI for competitive advantage.\n\nDespite the ambitions many leaders harbour, they face a series of challenges that must be overcome to realise the true value of AI investments. Primary among these is the need to ensure the data that will power their AI strategies is fit for purpose. In fact, a data framework is critical first step for AI success.\n\nShadow IT thrives on weak governance\n\nThe struggle many organisations face is reflected in the relatively slow uptake of meaningful AI projects in Australia, which sometimes is at odds with the wants of their workforces.\n\nMany workers are not waiting for guidance and permission when it comes to adopting AI tools, leading to the emergence of shadow AI. In late 2023, a report from ISACA suggested that up to two-thirds of workers are using unsanctioned AI tools, despite only 11% organisations having a formal policy permitting its use.\n\nAccording to Richard Kulkarni, Country Manager for Quest, a lack of clarity concerning governance and policy around AI means that employees and teams are finding workarounds to access the technology. \u201cSome senior technology leaders fear a Pandora\u2019s Box type situation with AI becoming impossible to control once unleashed. Yet research shows Australians are already using AI without formal policies. Lack of oversight establishes a different kind of risk, with shadow IT posing significant security threats to organisations.\u201d\n\nCompared to other parts of the world, the uptake of AI within Australian businesses is lagging. Research from HubSpot found only 17% of Australian firms had integrated AI or AI-enhanced tools within their operations.\n\nAnother impediment to AI adoption is the ongoing need to ensure that appropriate governance and protections are in place. This is to ensure any potential negative consequence is avoided.\n\nThis challenge has been recognised by the Australian Federal Government, with Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic announcing in September the creation of a set of voluntary AI guidelines, with consultation on whether these should be mandated in high-risk areas.\n\nData readiness and governance are critical for AI success\n\nGetting these foundational aspects of AI governance in place will be critical to successful adoption, and for unlocking an opportunity that the Tech Council of Australia estimates could contribute $45 billion to $115 billion per year to the Australian economy by 2030.\n\nThe question now for every Australian business leader is how to adopt AI in ways that are both fast and safe, such that they can get on with using it to accelerate decision-making and automate core and non-core processes to better serve their customers.\n\nThere is, however, another barrier standing in the way of their ambitions: data readiness.\n\n\u201cStrong data strategies de-risk AI adoption, removing barriers to performance. If you\u2019re not keeping up the fundamentals of data and data management, your ability to adopt AI\u2014at whatever stage you are at in your AI journey\u2014will be impacted,\u201d Kulkarni points out.\n\nDespite decades of investment in data management solutions, many continue to struggle with data quality issues, either through their failure to modernise legacy investments or through the outcomes of acquisitions and business decisions, which in either instance have led to data existing in multiple silos across their organisations.\n\nThis need to improve data governance is therefore at the forefront of many AI strategies, as highlighted by the findings of The State of Data Intelligence report published in October 2024 by Quest, which found the top drivers of data governance were improving data quality (42%), security (40%), and analytics (40%).\n\nThe 2024 report also found that ensuring data readiness and quality for AI was the fourth most cited driver of data governance programs, as reported by 34% of respondents, with the focus on AI governance efforts and AI data readiness needs permeating the report\u2019s findings.\n\nTearing down data silos to unlock value\n\nWith many AI strategies highly reliant on having access to large volumes of high-quality data, the need to resolve the issues cited above is driving interest in new solutions to data governance.\n\n\u201cAI thrives on clean, contextualised, and accessible data. Without it, businesses risk perpetuating the very inefficiencies they aim to eliminate,\u201d adds Kulkarni.\n\nOne field that is gaining attention is data intelligence, which uses metadata to provide visibility and a deeper and broader understanding of data quality, context, usage, and impact. This is essential for enabling organisations to discover, trust, manage, and leverage high-value data for better decisions and outcomes and to better protect against risk.\n\nThe report further saw activity around metadata harvesting, classification, and curation experiencing a 94% surge in response between 2023 and 2024 as organisations prepared for future AI initiatives.\n\nDe-risk AI adoption by unlocking the power of your data in 2025\n\nActions such as those described above can play a key role in not only improving data quality and the breaking down of silos but also in democratising access to data by making it more useful and accessible to AI-driven use cases across the organisation.\n\nThis in turn stimulates a more agile and adaptable approach to AI which can accelerate its uptake and the returns that the organisation can expect.\n\nFor any organisation keen to take a leadership position on AI adoption\u2014or that simply wants to avoid rapidly falling behind those that do\u2014making the necessary investments in data governance may provide a many-fold return as the benefits of AI itself scale over time.\n\nAccording to Kulkarni: \u201cBusinesses that resolve their data complexities now will gain the agility to respond faster to market changes, ensuring competitive advantage in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nFor the latest insights on current data intelligence initiatives and planned investments by some of the largest organisations in the world, visit The 2024 State of Data Intelligence report."

            "article_content": "Submission 1,753\n\nAbout\n\nOpenAI Whistleblower's Death refers to the discovery of the body of Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old former OpenAI researcher and whistleblower, in his San Francisco apartment that authorities have ruled as suicide. Balaji publicly discussed OpenAI's potential copyright violations in developing ChatGPT and was planning to testify against the company in upcoming legal actions. Netizens have likened the event to other whistleblowers and individuals who allegedly committed suicide despite not being suicidal.\n\nBackground\n\nSuchir Balaji was a 26-year-old artificial intelligence researcher who worked at OpenAI for about four years before leaving in August 2024. He gained attention as a whistleblower after he publicly alleged that OpenAI violated US copyright laws in the development of its AI models like ChatGPT. In an October interview with The New York Times, Balaji said he believed the company's practices could harm individuals and businesses by using their copyrighted content without permission. His criticisms coincided with OpenAI facing lawsuits from news organizations and authors accusing it of unlawful data use for training its AI systems.\n\nBalaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26, 2024. The San Francisco medical examiner's office ruled his death as a suicide.\n\nDevelopments\n\nBalaji's family disputes the suicide ruling, alleging signs of foul play and calling for an FBI investigation, citing inconsistencies in the circumstances surrounding his death.\n\nElon Musk replied \"This doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide\" on his social media platform X to a post by Balaji's mother that claims her son was murdered. Musk's reply received around 945,000 views, 10,000 likes and 1300 reposts.\n\nOnline Reactions\n\nRedditors have opened numerous threads related to the whistleblower in subreddits such as r/Futurology, r/news, r/technology and r/singularity that have garnered at least over 1000 comments. The whistleblower's death being ruled as a suicide has been associated with several other whistleblowers' deaths which have also been ruled as suicides, such as the Boeing whistleblowers, and the suicide of John McAfee, who tweeted in the past that he will never commit suicide.\n\nMedia Coverage\n\nLarge news organizations such as CNBC, BBC, and The Economic Times have covered developments related to Balaji's death.\n\nSearch Interest\n\nExternal References"

            "article_content": "There is very little movement in markets over the Christmas period, so this week we are looking at selling and what might affect markets in the new year.\n\nThis time of the year is quieter on tillage farms.\n\nYes, there is still work to be done, but there is time to catch up on crop records, costs and returns.\n\nKnowing the costs and returns of all your crops is essential.\n\nIn order to decide on what price to sell your grain at, you need to know your costs, so get this job done as soon as possible and decide on a price that you are happy to sell at to spread risk.\n\nThis was brought up numerous times at Tillage Day 2024 and it was clear it is a job that more farmers need to do.\n\nHaving those figures to hand and deciding on a number to sell at makes the decision easier to make once you get a text message with prices from your co-op or merchant.\n\nForward selling\n\nIn recent years, harvest prices have worked out very well for people, but that doesn\u2019t say it will happen every year.\n\nThat said, you are probably better off to either take the harvest price every year or do some forward selling every year, rather than dipping in and out of both of them, or else you may lose out badly in certain years.\n\nIf you are forward selling grain, then you should only be selling about 50% on your estimated production. You should be a little bit pessimistic with yield predictions as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you have sold grain, but don\u2019t have that grain. At Tillage Day, Donal Moloney of Tirl\u00e1n explained that farmers can sell as little as 20t at a time when forward selling grain.\n\nIf you think about that, you could be selling small amounts of grain every week or every two weeks or even once a month to get an average price from the season.\n\nThis would be spreading risk - something similar to the Boortmalt pricing system where an average price is taken every week from the middle of April to the middle of September.\n\n2025 prices\n\nLooking ahead to prices and it is very hard to know where they will end up this season. There was a lift in prices in December.\n\nTeagasc economist Fiona Thorne estimated that prices could rise by 5% in 2025 at their recent Outlook Conference.\n\nThis prediction was based on the difference between historic predicted values of French wheat prices and the actual outcomes.\n\nTeagasc estimated an increase in EU cereal production and an increase in Irish cereal yields. Looking at costs and Teagasc placed fertiliser prices down 5%, but fertiliser use up on a whole-farm basis."

            "article_content": "The iconic barcode, a staple of product packaging for nearly 50 years, is set to be replaced by an advanced alternative. QR codes, recognized for their flexibility and efficiency, are poised to take center stage in the retail industry. The transition, driven by the international standardization body GS1, is expected to become widespread within the next two years, bringing significant changes for both consumers and retailers.\n\nUnlike old barcodes, new QR codes can hold more data, such as shelf life, allergens, ingredients, and ways to recycle. This added info helps beyond product tags, giving key tips to cut waste and boost green efforts. For example, Woolworths in Australia saw food waste drop by 40% with QR codes that allow quick price cuts before items expire.\n\nGS1 UK leader Anne Godfrey said the pandemic sped up the use of QR tech. She noted how people got used to scanning QR codes for menus at cafes, making them more open to the idea.\n\nBenefits for users and stores\n\nQR codes have clear perks over old barcodes. They can handle wear and still work, making them better for checkout lines. They also help with eco-plans. Coca-Cola, for one, uses them in Latin America to track the reuse of bottles, aiding recycling goals. Big stores like Tesco and Woolworths are trying out the tech. Their early wins show how QR codes can help track goods, make shopping better, and push green goals.\n\nHurdles in the path to change\n\nSwitching to QR codes brings both promise and challenges. Significant investments are needed as retailers upgrade point-of-sale systems, and some items, like candles, may not fully benefit from the transition. Established supply chain routines could also face disruptions as they adjust to the new system.\n\nStill, GS1 remains confident. President Renaud de Barbuat envisions global readiness by 2027, with nearly half of UK retailers already adapting. The move to QR codes marks a pivotal shift in retail, blending efficiency, sustainability, and greater convenience for consumers.\n\nDisclaimer: We may be compensated by some of the companies whose products we talk about, but our articles and reviews are always our honest opinions.

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "Every year brings the accounting industry new tools, tech buzzwords and promises of transformation. How do firms separate the noise from what truly delivers value?\n\nSilverfin\n\nTechnology certainly has the potential to change the way accountants work for the better, but it can be difficult to know which trends are worth the investment of time, effort and budget, and which will fade away.\n\nIn this wrap-up of 2024 and look ahead to 2025, we explore what\u2019s exciting accountants, what concerns them, and how they\u2019re using capabilities like AI to drive their next chapter of growth. Most importantly, we\u2019ll also touch on what your firm should consider to stay competitive in the year ahead.\n\nOver 75% of firms have invested more in technology this year\n\nAccording to the UK Accountancy Sector Outlook Report by HSBC UK and Accountancy Age, over 75% of firms have increased their technology spending year-on-year, reflecting the industry\u2019s growing willingness to invest in digital tools.\n\nHowever, 15% of firms acknowledge difficulties in adapting to technological advancements, suggesting that while most are keen to innovate, some still face challenges in keeping up.\n\nFirms are actively exploring AI, with over 30% already integrating it into their operations and a further 23% planning to adopt it in 2025. This growing interest in AI reflects its potential to improve processes and support growth.\n\nTechnology adoption is not a one-size-fits-all journey\n\nThe report highlights an important point: technology adoption looks different for every firm. While the entire industry recognises the importance of digital transformation, it seems as if priorities and strategies differ significantly based on firm size and resources.\n\nLarge firms are scaling and optimising\n\nBigger firms are leading the charge in technology adoption, with 37.5% significantly increasing their tech investments. Their focus has shifted from adopting new tools to optimising existing systems to maximise value and efficiency.\n\nMid-sized firms are focused on balanced growth\n\nAmong mid-sized firms, 58.3% report somewhat increased spending on technology, reflecting a steady and measured approach. These firms often aim to scale their operations without overextending resources, focusing on incremental improvements to existing systems.\n\nSmaller firms are in a catch-up phase\n\nThese firms seem to be focusing on foundational investments like cloud computing and process automation. While they may lack the budgets of larger firms, their investments are driven by the need to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market. These firms often prioritise solutions that deliver immediate efficiency gains without significant risk.\n\n39% of firms are using full-suite solutions\n\nThe results of a recent LinkedIn survey run by Phil Hobden, Silverfin\u2019s Head of Sales, provide valuable insights into the technologies currently being used by accounting practices.\n\nThe findings show that the majority (39%) of respondents are using full-suite software solutions such as Iris, CCH and Digita. These tools, known for their comprehensive features, enable firms to handle multiple aspects of accounting efficiently within a single platform.\n\nInterestingly, 21% of participants reported using specialist software like Caseware and Alphatax, suggesting that many firms are seeking tailored tools to meet specific needs.\n\nSimilarly,18% have transitioned to 100% cloud-based platforms, like Silverfin, highlighting the ongoing shift towards cloud technology for its flexibility and real-time collaboration capabilities.\n\nThe power of cloud computing is evolving\n\nCloud-based accounting software is playing an increasingly important role, making financial data accessible from anywhere and enabling teams to collaborate in real time. This flexibility helps firms manage tasks more efficiently and reduces the risk of errors by automating manual processes.\n\nBeyond these practical benefits, cloud-based software can connect with other tools to create systems that simplify workflows and improve accuracy. For instance, firms can link cloud accounting platforms with tools for analytics, payroll or client management.\n\nRecent investments, such as KPMG\u2019s $100 million partnership with Google Cloud, demonstrate the rising demand for cloud infrastructure. Over the past two years, bookings for KPMG's services related to Google Cloud have increased tenfold.\n\n\"We believe that professional services is going through the largest transformation that it will likely ever go through.\" \u2013 Steve Chase, vice chair of AI and innovation for KPMG\n\nCloud technology and AI are closely linked, as cloud platforms provide the scalable computing power and data storage required to run AI applications effectively. By hosting AI tools on the cloud, firms can process large volumes of data quickly, access advanced analytics, and deploy solutions that adapt to changing needs without investing heavily in on-premises hardware. For instance, AI-driven applications often rely on the cloud to handle complex calculations and store real-time data securely.\n\nAI is being harnessed for the next chapter of growth\n\nIn recent years, AI has rapidly gained traction, evolving from a niche technology into a mainstream trend. Its impact on every industry is undeniable and it has the potential to significantly boost the global economy. PwC estimates AI could add $15.7 trillion by 2030, with $6.6 trillion coming from productivity improvements as businesses automate tasks and enhance efficiency.\n\nIn the UK, AI is expected to contribute \u00a32 billion to GDP, with firms adopting it likely to see revenue grow three times faster than those that don\u2019t. In accounting, AI is improving accuracy, streamlining processes, and helping firms adapt to new challenges, with 61% of accountants seeing it as more of an opportunity than a risk. However, not everyone is fully convinced.\n\nSome accountants are voicing concerns about AI\n\nWhile AI offers exciting possibilities for the accounting profession, it\u2019s not without its challenges. According to a Karbon\u2019s State of AI in Accounting study, many accountants worry about the potential downsides of automation. For instance, 56% are concerned that AI could undermine the \"human touch\" in client relationships, making interactions feel less personal and more transactional.\n\nData security also looms large as a concern, with 76% of respondents identifying it as a key issue. Ethical considerations, such as bias in AI systems and the transparency of AI-driven decisions, trouble nearly half (49%) of accountants surveyed. These worries reflect broader anxieties about how AI will be integrated into professional settings without compromising fairness and accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that AI is far from a replacement for the expertise that accountants bring to their work. Strategic thinking, client understanding and ethical judgment remain areas where human professionals excel. Instead, AI serves as a tool to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for accountants to strengthen client relationships and add greater value to their firms.\n\nThe road ahead will involve finding a balance \u2013 harnessing AI to drive innovation while preserving the trust, personal connections and ethical foundations that define the profession.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe future of AI in accounting looks bright, with advancements expected to help firms navigate new regulations and deliver more specialised tools for tasks like tax calculations and financial reporting. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing could amplify these benefits, making processes even faster and more efficient. By adopting AI responsibly and addressing its ethical considerations, firms can remain competitive while supporting their teams and clients.\n\nBlockchain technology is another field to watch, with its potential to transform auditing and assurance by automating processes with smart contracts and enhancing transparency. Its decentralised design could be used to reduce the risk of fraud and build trust in financial transactions. This is certainly a new frontier for accounting firms to explore in the years to come!\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, Silverfin is here to help you discover and embrace new possibilities in accounting.

            "article_content": "Tech mogul Elon Musk intensified his legal battle with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in the days after Christmas. Court filings show two prominent tech investors lending support to the billionaire\u2019s allegations that the company unfairly blocked potential backers from investing in its rivals. The dispute between the world\u2019s richest person and one of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups sets up a potential court battle over OpenAI\u2019s future. The artificial intelligence developer is trying to restructure itself to remove the oversight of its nonprofit board, freeing it to pursue profits more like a conventional tech company.\n\nMusk is asking a federal court in Northern California to block OpenAI from changing its structure, arguing that a nonprofit can\u2019t walk away from its original mandate backed by donors like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015 and was a major funder of the project before splitting with his co-founders in 2018 after attempting to take control of the project.\n\nThe billionaire also wants OpenAI to be prohibited from forcing its investors to decline to support competing AI companies, such as his own AI start-up, xAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s company, which offers the chatbot Grok, announced $6 billion of new funding last week from investors including Morgan Stanley and an investment fund associated with the Saudi royal family.\n\nAlso last week, progressive tech advocacy organization Encode filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing support for Musk\u2019s claims against OpenAI. Encode\u2019s filing was backed by several AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google researcher who shared a Nobel Prize last year for his work on AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode. \u201cAllowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed a brief in the case saying she was talking with the company about its plans and would step in if she believed it was breaking the law.\n\nMusk added new support from prominent tech investors to his legal assault on OpenAI in sworn declarations filed late last week by the entrepreneur and three allies.\n\nThey alleged that OpenAI told potential investors last year that they could back the company only if they committed not to invest in rival AI developers, including Musk\u2019s AI start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, which has invested in xAI, said in a filing that it was widely known among investors that OpenAI had made withholding from investments in competitors a provision of its latest funding round.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of hedge fund Atreides Management, which has invested in Musk ventures including electric automaker Tesla, said in his own declaration that the competitor investment ban was common knowledge among top tech investors.\n\nGracias and Baker did not claim in the filings to have heard directly from OpenAI\u2019s leaders about the alleged condition placed on prospective investors in the company.\n\nJared Birchall, chief financial officer of Musk\u2019s xAI and a longtime lieutenant to the billionaire, said in his own declaration filed with the court that an unspecified \u201creputable venture capital investor\u201d told him of the restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Deutrom, a spokesperson for OpenAI, referred to a Dec. 13 court filing in which the company said that it did not bar its investors from also backing competitors. Investors were told that they would not receive competitively sensitive information from OpenAI if they chose to also invest in rivals to the company, the filing said.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a December interview with the Free Press that Musk was \u201cclearly a bully.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Musk and Altman, two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men, erupted into public view last February.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman that month in state court in San Francisco. He alleged the company\u2019s leaders tricked him and others into supporting a company pledged to bettering humanity, but pivoted it into a for-profit enterprise. He later dropped the suit but filed a similar one in August in federal court in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced in October that it had raised $6.6 billion in new investment funding, valuing the company at $157 billion. The following month, Musk widened his suit to also allege that OpenAI worked with its main backer, Microsoft, to unfairly squash competition in AI. Microsoft has denied the allegations in court filings."

            "article_content": "In the new year, blockbuster legal cases will play out in US courts.\n\nMajor criminal cases include Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Luigi Mangione.\n\nIn the civil arena, the DOJ's list of antitrust lawsuits will make their way to court.\n\nAs we enter the new year, dockets are filling up with blockbuster court cases in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCriminal courts in Manhattan are preparing for the trial of rap mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and early hearings in the prosecution of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\nIn the civil arena, lawyers are gearing up for a year of antitrust lawsuits brought by the DOJ against Big Tech, Visa, and other companies it accuses of monopolizing their industries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2024 was the year of Donald Trump in court, there's still much to be done in the coming year as his fight to clear his rap sheet and zero out his civil judgments continues.\n\nHere are some of the cases Business Insider will be watching this year:\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs faces criminal and civil cases. Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs cases\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 founder of Bad Boy Records and the Sean John brand \u2014 is due to stand trial in federal court in Manhattan on May 5 on a sex-trafficking indictment that could send him to prison for life. Prosecutors have also warned that a second indictment is imminent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven what's already in the record, trial testimony and evidence will be graphic, and the courtroom jousting will be heated. Combs' defense is that he never forced anyone to have sex, and that his accusers have financial motive to implicate him. The trial will likely focus on consent and credibility.\n\nCombs' mother and his six oldest children \u2014 who range from teenagers to early 30s \u2014 have attended pretrial hearings, waving and smiling at him from the audience. The trial may prove less family-friendly. The evidence includes hundreds of hours of videotape from the rap mogul's sex parties \u2014 especially from his so-called freak-off performances, along with testimony by male sex workers who attended the parties. The trial will not be televised.\n\nSeparately, Combs faces more than 30 civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse. \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted, or sex trafficked anyone,\" his attorneys recently said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuigi Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is awaiting trials on murder charges. Pamela Smith/AP\n\nLuigi Mangione court case\n\nLuigi Mangione, a 26-year-old software developer from a Maryland real estate family, will face state and federal murder charges in Manhattan this year in the December ambush shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He risks a maximum sentence of life in prison and, in the federal case, the death penalty \u2014 though it has been more than 60 years since a Manhattan jury has sent anyone to death row.\n\nBoth the state and federal prosecutions are in their early days. While Mangione has pleaded not guilty in his state case, he is not set to enter a plea to his federal indictment until later this month.\n\nIt's possible Mangione will go to trial in 2025, though it's unlikely. His attorney suggested prior to taking the case that he could pursue some kind of psychiatric defense, which could delay the trial into 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continues to fight for a clean rap sheet and to zero out his civil judgments. AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nDonald Trump's court cases\n\nThe president-elect's criminal indictments have sputtered to a halt, thanks in large part to the US Supreme Court's July presidential immunity decision. Loose ends remain in the Manhattan hush-money case, as Trump works to clear his rap sheet of its sole conviction before his January 20 inauguration.\n\nThere is still no sentencing date, and New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan has yet to rule on Trump's demand that the case be tossed in the interest of justice, given the election. Also pending is Trump's Second Circuit appellate efforts to move the hush-money case to federal court.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump begins 2025 with a half-billion-dollars in civil court judgments hanging over his head, all of which he's in the midst of aggressively appealing, including his two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases. A midlevel New York appellate court could keep, trim, or overturn the biggest of Trump's judgments at any time \u2014 his massive civil fraud penalty, a debt to New York state that remains frozen on appeal, which has now ballooned to $490 million with interest. He remains a defendant in eight civil cases brought by injured Capitol Police officers and members of Congress involving his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court could strike down the law banning TikTok from app stores. Gearstd/iStock, Tyler Le/BI\n\nTikTok ban\n\nIn the spring, Congress passed a law that would ban TikTok from app stores in the United States unless Bytedance, the platform's Chinese owner, divested itself from the app.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe deadline is January 19. Bytedance still owns TikTok. A Washington, DC-based appeals court was unpersuaded by TikTok's arguments that its users' First Amendment rights outweigh the national security-based reasoning of Congress's law.\n\nAll eyes are on the US Supreme Court to see whether it will strike down the law before the deadline. The court agreed to hear oral arguments in the case on January 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia faces a DOJ probe. Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nNvidia\n\nThe Justice Department has reportedly been ramping up an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker throughout 2024. Competitors have said Nvidia uses unfair marketing tactics to gain a stranglehold on the market for chips used in AI development, while the company says it simply offers a best-in-class product. If the DOJ brings a lawsuit or comes to a settlement with Nvidia, it'll likely come in 2025.\n\nMeta faces an antitrust lawsuit. Fabrice COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeta antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued Meta during the first Trump administration, alleging it had an illegal monopoly on the social media market through its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The Biden administration has kept up the lawsuit, which scored a major victory in November when a federal judge allowed most of the case to go to trial.\n\nMeta says the company's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram have been good for consumers. If it loses the trial \u2014 scheduled for April \u2014 the FTC will seek to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has two ongoing antitrust battles. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nGoogle antitrust lawsuit\n\nGoogle search case\n\nAlphabet was dealt a major blow in 2024 when a federal judge concluded Google formed an illegal monopoly in the search market. Now the company is tussling with the Justice Department over how it should be punished. Google suggested it could pull back some of its partnerships with other companies. The DOJ has asked the judge to force Google to divest from its Chrome browser, a more dramatic move. The decision \u2014 and the many appeals to come \u2014 will continue to play out in 2025.\n\nGoogle advertising case\n\nAnother major Google antitrust case is over its role in online advertising. In September, a federal court held a bench trial to determine whether the company formed another illegal monopoly, in the adtech market.\n\nGoogle claims the Justice Department has overstated its role in the market, where it competes fiercely with the likes of Meta and Amazon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decision is expected to come sometime in 2025, with appeals to follow.\n\nAmazon's antitrust trial is expected in 2026. Amazon\n\nAmazon antitrust lawsuit\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of states sued Amazon, alleging it abused its dominance in the online retail space to inflate prices, squeeze third-party sellers with onerous fees, and push its in-house products at the expense of others. Amazon has said it does everything for the benefit of consumers, to whom it provides better products and better prices.\n\nIn September, a federal judge knocked down some of the states' claims but allowed the bulk of the lawsuit to proceed to trial. The trial date is scheduled for 2026, with more litigation and appeals expected to take place before then.\n\nOpenAI faces a lawsuit by The New York Times. NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nNew York Times vs OpenAI\n\nAll sorts of content creators \u2014 journalists, novelists, filmmakers, photographers \u2014 have filed a slew of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, accusing them of illegally siphoning their creations to train their AI models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI companies have generally argued that the use of the material is sufficiently \"transformative\" to be considered \"fair use\" under copyright law.\n\nOne of the major cases to watch is The New York Times's lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, which has progressed further than many of the other cases. In January, a federal judge is scheduled to oversee a marathon day of oral arguments over whether the case is on firm enough legal ground to proceed to trial.\n\nElon Musk vs Sam Altman and OpenAI\n\nIn the past few years, OpenAI has become a tech behemoth, setting the pace for generative artificial intelligence technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is technically structured as a nonprofit that seeks to build artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. However, under its leader Sam Altman, OpenAI has signed a lucrative deal with Microsoft, which hopes to harness the tech to drive its own growth.\n\nNow OpenAI is trying to formally convert itself into a for-profit company, shedding the nonprofit label. Musk \u2014 who was involved in OpenAI's early stages and who runs a competitor, xAI \u2014 is trying to stop that from happening.\n\nThe case has been moving at a fast clip, with lawyers for Musk and OpenAI dropping legal filings that reveal internal emails and other records about the other. It's set to continue heating up in 2025 as OpenAI tries to become a corporation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams' administration was in turmoil before he was indicted.

Visa\n\nVisa antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa in September, accusing the company of engaging in anticompetitive behavior with its US debit transactions. Initial hearings in the case are expected in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the payment-processing giant of entering into contracts with potential competitors that prevent them from becoming actual competitors. By doing so, Visa is able to collect fees that it wouldn't be able to in a competitive market, the Justice Department alleges.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, said Visa handled more than 60% of US debit transactions, earning the company more than $7 billion in fees a year.\n\nIn September, a lawyer for Visa told BI the lawsuit was \"meritless.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Today's lawsuit ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving,\" Julie Rottenberg said in a statement at the time.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is scheduled for a January 3 contempt hearing.

            "article_content": "Source: Scholaris/Pixabay\n\nExploring uses for artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning is de rigueur, and large language models (LLMs) are having their moment in the spotlight. Last year, LLMs were used in a variety of research studies to unravel complexities in psychology, neuroscience, and many other fields.\n\nEvaluating LLM transformers using principles drawn from human cognition and psychology will be a growth area this year. Researchers have just scratched the surface in evaluating artificial intelligence LLMs using what scientists know from psychology and human behavior. For example, last year an AI study examined the rationality of large language models using cognitive psychology from a series of tasks designed to spot human heuristics and biases.\n\nUnderstanding exactly how the human brain processes speech and language can accelerate advancements in a wide variety of real-world uses, such as brain-computer interfaces, AI machine learning, robotics, neurotechnology, child development, talk therapy, speech synthesizers, natural language processing, assistive technology for the disabled, commercial chatbots, voice-recognition products, machine translation, autonomous vehicles, psychology, psychiatry, medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and health care.\n\nIn 2025, expect more exploration of conversational AI in the fields of human speech and language. Last year inroads were made using LLMs to shed light on the biological brain. For example, a 2024 PNAS study by Goldin-Meadow and others used an LLM created by Google called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to determine the timing of the pediatric milestone of linguistic productivity, the ability to produce novel language versus mimicking speech. This discovery has the potential to help clinicians in child development, speech therapy, and artificial intelligence development.\n\nAnother trend to watch in 2025 is the use of LLMs to identify patterns from reams of complex biological data captured by established brain activity imaging and recording technologies. Expect an increase of research studies using LLMs and neural activity data overall. The largest increase is expected in studies that use neural data recorded through noninvasive methods by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), or even via a temporary digital electronic tattoo (e-tattoo) printed directly on the scalp as demonstrated in 2024.\n\nAnother 2024 study published in Nature Machine Intelligence compared a variety of LLMs and actual human brain activity recordings to discover that LLMs and human brains are converging. Namely, the study showed that the LLMs studied showed hierarchical processing similar to the regions of the biological brain responsible for sound and language processing.\n\nAn emerging trend in the position to expand in 2025 is the evaluation of the predictive capabilities of LLMs versus human experts in neuroscience. Last year, an AI milestone was established with the demonstration that the predictive capabilities of large language models outperformed human neuroscience experts in determining neuroscience outcomes in the landmark study published in Nature Human Behaviour.\n\nAlso in 2024, OpenAI\u2019s LLM GPT-4 was put to the test vis-\u00e0-vis human neuroradiologists in a study published in European Radiology in the task of diagnosing real-world clinical MRI reports of brain tumor cases. The scientists found that the performance of GPT-4 could serve as a neuroradiology advisory tool for clinicians as well as a useful second opinion on final neuroradiology diagnoses.\n\nBeyond the realm of neuroscience, expect more integration of LLMs as potential enhancements for consumer-facing products, especially in transportation. For example, in 2024 Purdue University researchers conducted a study featuring a conversational AI based on an LLM framework called Talk2Drive that can interpret human voice commands to guide autonomous vehicles. The research was the first-of-its-kind to conduct a multi-scenario field experiment that deploys LLMs on a real-world self-driving car.\n\nAn important trend to watch in 2025 is the potential increased use of LLMs by scientists as a research tool itself throughout the research study lifecycle for a variety of functions, such as information gathering, editing, formatting, grammar check, synonym searches, background data gathering, published research searches, database cleaning, data analysis, statistical reporting, writing, rewriting, brainstorming, synthetic data production, data label generation, and more uses.\n\nIn this past year, one preprint conducted by researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2), University of Washington, University of Copenhagen, and Princeton University shows that a majority (80.9%) of over 800 verified published authors listed on Semantic Scholar surveyed had self-reporting using LLMs in one or more areas in their research.\n\nExpect this number to rise as more researchers use LLMs as an assistive technology throughout the scientific research process; from brainstorming ideas to helping with report writing. Another trend to watch is the growing call for transparency and disclosure when LLMs are used and how they are used to produce research studies in the future.\n\nThis past year was a remarkable year of discovery at the intersection of artificial intelligence transformer technology and the sciences. Expect more research studies evaluating the capabilities of large language models versus human experts, as well as the increased use of LLMs to produce the actual research itself. Using human behavior and applied psychology to understand the efficacies and capabilities of large language models will be an important growth area in 2025 and beyond.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Cami Rosso All rights reserved."

A catastrophe around the world was predicted to take place in 2025, as according to Baba Vanga. On the other hand, Nicholas Aujula, 38 years old, is also known to have given very dire predictions that came true when he said COVID-19 will erupt in 2018, the hypnotherapist from London shared his visions for what might happen in 2025.Aujula confirmed to be a believer in reincarnation, based on which the experiences gathered for centuries direct his psychic development. He described death as transformation, not something that ends or marks the disappearance of the soul. The process of death allows the soul to go forward by taking on a new form. This lets him, Aujula added, experience things before it occurs and explain it to humankind.Aujula has forecast that the year 2025 will be one of worldwide turmoil. According to him, religious and nationalist violence will start the Third World War. In his opinion, political murders have become commonplace, evil, and violence prevail over the world, and compassion and peace are as rare as grains of sand. Such predictions present a very grim picture of a world mired in conflict and suffering.Apart from political instability, Aujula feels that science will make giant leaps, particularly in medical technology. He feels that organs will be grown in the laboratory and this will be a breakthrough in medical science. But this will be balanced with natural disasters, he says, where heavy rain will cause widespread flooding, displacing millions of people and destroying homes. He further warns that flooding of whole cities by rising sea levels will exacerbate the calamity even worse than the cause created by environmental change.According to Aujula, the political meltdown of the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is an omen, while inflation keeps steadily on the increase across the entire globe. Meanwhile, amidst the pandemonium, he expects Prince William and Prince Harry will again reconcile once in a blue moon. In this regard, their estrangement will also soon be rewarded. All these prophesies hint at a mixture of political predictions with personal ones around the international scene.Nicholas Aujula claims that his psychic ability has its root in a profound experience he had as a teenager. He says at the age of 17, he had a dream in which he was shown things that were to happen by an unknown figure. He asserts this experience initiated him into psychic prediction. Aujula's prophecies have gained fame over the years, and several of his prophecies have already been seen to be correct, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, Donald Trump winning the presidency, and the COVID-19 pandemic.Aujula also claims that he was in a coma for some time after waking up from it, during which he started experiencing visions of his past lives. He believes these experiences have contributed to his ability to predict future events. He says that he has lived a previous life as an ancient queen of Egypt, a tailor in China, a nun in the Himalayas, and even as a lion in Africa. Such is his faith in reincarnation, the premise for his predictions: \"The soul never dies,\" he claims. \"It just comes back to be reborn in some form.\""

            "article_content": "Thiruvananthapuram\n\nWorld Tsunami Awareness Day (November 5) presented a moment of reflection 20 years on from catastrophic Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004 that resulted in 2.25 lakh fatalities across 14 countries and emphasised the urgent need for effective tsunami preparedness.\n\nIt led to the establishment of Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System that serves 27 Indian Ocean Basin countries. Initiatives such as \u2018UN Secretary-General\u2019s call for Early Warnings for All\u2019 aim to make these systems inclusive and accessible to all, further strengthening collective resilience.\n\nLead time available\n\nHawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre that operates in the Pacific Ocean was aware of the mega event unravelling in the Indian Ocean. A lead time of two hours was available before the tsunami could potentially strike - as it eventually did - coasts of India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The disaster would have been mitigated if there had been an effective warning system in place.\n\nJapan experience\n\nBut a recent experience from quake-prone Japan, known for its culture of preparedness to mitigate effects of these disasters, is instructive. A magnitude 7.1-Mw quake off the coast of Kyushu on August 8, 2024, prompted an advisory indicating an increased likelihood of a mega quake. The advisory expired on August 15, 2024. Fortunately, the shaking that intervened was not severe, causing some damage and a modest 0.5-metre tsunami, but no casualties.\n\nEarly warning system\n\nIn any case, a multi-hazard early warning system is crucial for mitigating risk from various natural hazards, including tsunamis, notes Sanjay Srivastava, Chief, Disaster Risk Reduction, UN-ESCAP. It provides timely alerts to protect lives and reduce economic damage from extreme geophysical and climate events occurring individually, simultaneously, or sequentially.\n\nMakran zone scan\n\nIt is noteworthy that India, Iran, Pakistan, the UAE and Oman have collectively developed a unified Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment with respect to a perceived threat in the Makran subduction zone. This is now being used to help enable evacuation planning and activation of national tsunami warning chains within a matter of 20 minutes, Srivastava explained to businessline.\n\nFrom global to local, tsunami warning systems should represent a seamless value chain. For instance, the Indian and Pacific Ocean capacity assessment covers all aspects of existing tsunami warning and mitigation systems as well as identifies targeted areas for improvement from upstream to downstream.\n\nAssessment summaries\n\nAssessments and companion summaries for policy and decision makers are being published in line with the 20th commemoration of the Indian Ocean tsunami events (2024) and the 60th anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (2025). This effort is being piloted by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission-UNESCO with support from the ESCAP Trust Fund for Tsunami, Disaster, and Climate Preparedness; the Asian Development Bank; the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Italy.\n\nTsunami threat resilience\n\nCurrent level of adaptation finance falls short of what is needed for transformative adaptation, Srivastava noted. Investments made in preparedness are far more cost-effective than spending after a disaster especially since climate change continues to exacerbate effects of disasters including those geophysical in origin (tsunamis).\n\nDisaster risk financing needs to be dramatically increased and financing mechanisms scaled up. Progress has been made in regionally active tsunami warning and mitigation systems, but continued investments in the region\u2019s multi-donor coordinated Trust Fund is essential to ensure that Asia and the Pacific remains resilient to future tsunami and climate related threats."

If one entity (or even a few) has access to a database, then there is only one \u201cpoint\u201d to compromise in order to gain full access. This is a serious problem for networks holding sensitive data like customer information, government files, and financial records, and those with control of infrastructure like power grids.\n\nBillions of digital records were stolen in 2024 alone, causing an estimated $10 trillion in damages! Notable breaches include nearly all of AT&T\u2019s customer information and call logs, half of America\u2019s personal health information, 700 million end-user records from companies using Snowflake, 10 billion unique passwords stored on RockYou24, and Social Security records for 300 million Americans.\n\nSource: Statista, 2024\n\nThis is not just a private sector issue \u2014 governments and crucial national infrastructure also rely on centralized networks. Notable recent breaches include records on 22 million Americans stolen from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, sensitive government communications from multiple U.S. federal agencies, personal biometric data on 1.1 billion Indian citizens, and the ongoing Chinese infiltration of several U.S. internet service providers.\n\nAlthough hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year on cyber security, data breaches are getting larger and happening more frequently. It\u2019s become clear that incremental products cannot fix these network vulnerabilities \u2014 the infrastructure must be completely rearchitected.\n\nSource: market.us, 2024\n\nAI magnifies the issue\n\nRecent advancements in generative AI have made it easier to automate everyday tasks and enhance work productivity. But the most useful and valuable AI applications require context, i.e. access to sensitive user health, financial, and personal information. Because these AI models also require massive computing power, they largely can\u2019t run on consumer devices (computer, mobile), and instead must access public cloud networks, like AWS, to process more complex inference requests. Given the serious limitations inherent in centralized networks illustrated earlier, the inability to securely connect sensitive user data with cloud AI has become a significant hurdle for adoption.\n\nEven Apple pointed this out during their announcement for Apple Intelligence earlier this year, stating the need to be able to enlist help from larger, more complex models in the cloud and how the traditional cloud model isn\u2019t viable anymore.\n\nThey name three specific reasons:\n\nPrivacy and security verification: Providers' claims, like not logging user data, often lack transparency and enforcement. Service updates or infrastructure troubleshooting can inadvertently log sensitive data. Runtime lacks transparency: Providers rarely disclose software details, and users cannot verify if the service runs unmodified or detect changes, even with open-source tools. Single point of failure: Administrators require high-level access for maintenance, risking accidental data exposure or abuse by attackers targeting these privileged interfaces.\n\nFortunately, Web3 cloud platforms offer the perfect solution.\n\nBlockchain-Orchestrated Confidential Cloud (BOCC)\n\nBOCC networks are like AWS \u2014 except built completely on confidential hardware and governed by smart contracts. Though still early days, this infrastructure has been in development for years and is finally starting to onboard Web3 projects and Web2 enterprise customers. The best example of this architecture is Super Protocol, an off-chain enterprise-grade cloud platform managed completely by on-chain smart contracts and built on trustless execution environments (TEEs). These are secure hardware enclaves that keep code and data verifiably confidential and secure.\n\nSource: Super Protocol\n\nThe implications of this technology address all of Apple\u2019s concerns noted earlier:\n\nPrivacy and security verification: With public smart contracts orchestrating the network, users can verify whether user data was transported and used as promised. Workload and program transparency: The network also verifies the work done within the confidential TEEs, cryptographically proving the correct hardware, data, and software were used, and that the output wasn\u2019t tampered with. This information is also submitted on-chain for all to audit. Single point of failure: Network resources (data, software, hardware) are only accessible by the owner\u2019s private key. Therefore, even if one user is compromised, only that user\u2019s resources are at risk.\n\nWhile cloud AI represents an enormous opportunity for Web3 to disrupt, BOCCs can be applied to any type of centralized data network (power grid, digital voting infrastructure, military IT, etc.), to provide superior and verifiable privacy and security, without sacrificing performance or latency. Our digital infrastructure has never been more vulnerable, but blockchain-orchestration can fix it."

            "article_content": "Like a shot to your dome piece, I'm back to hit you with my annual roundup of what happened in the rumble-tumble game of databases. Yes, I used to write this article on the OtterTune blog, but the company is dead (RIP). I'm doing this joint on my professor blog.\n\nThere is much to cover from the past year, from 10-figure acquisitions, vendors running wild in the streets with license changes, and the most famous database octogenarian splashing cash to recruit a college quarterback to impress his new dimepiece.\n\nI promised my first wife that I would write more professionally this year. I have also been informed that some universities assign my annual blog articles as required reading in their database courses. Let's see how it goes.\n\nPrevious entries:\n\nIt\u2019s My Database and I\u2019m Going to License it the Way I Want!\n\nWe live in the golden era of databases. There are many excellent (relational) choices for all types of application domains. Many are open-source despite being built by for-profit companies backed by VC money.\n\nBut VCs want that money back and their trap full, so these companies turn out a hosted service for their DBMSs on the cloud. But the cloud makes open-source DBMSs a tricky business. If a system becomes too popular, then a cloud vendor (like Amazon) slaps it up as a service and makes more money than the company paying for the development of the software. This threat is why many database companies change to more restrictive source code licenses that protect against cloud vendors from reselling their products. MongoDB was among the first to do this in 2018 when they switched to their Server Side Public License (SSPL).\n\nThis past year was a turbulent one for license changes, and the most prominent two were Redis\u2122 and Elasticsearch.\n\nRedis:\n\nRedis Ltd. (the company) is on an aggressive path towards its IPO. Originally starting as Redis Labs in 2011, they switched their name to Redis Ltd. in 2021 when they acquired the Redis trademark from its creator (Salvatore Sanfilippo), who Redis Labs had bankrolled. Over the last few years, Redis Ltd. has attempted to consolidate control over the Redis landscape. The company has also tried to cast off the perception that the system is primarily used as an in-memory cache by adding support for vectors and other data models.\n\nIn March 2024, Redis Ltd. announced they were switching from the system's original (very permissive) BSD-3 license to a dual license comprising the proprietary Redis Source Available License and MongoDB's SSPL. The company announced this change the same day they announced the acquisition of Speedb, an open-source fork of RocksDB.\n\nThe backlash to the Redis license move was quick. The same week the license changed, two forks were announced based on the original BSD-3 code line: Valkey and Redict. Valkey started at Amazon, but engineers at Google and Oracle quickly joined. In only one week, the Valkey project clapped back at Redis Ltd. when it became part of the Linux Foundation, and several major companies shifted their development efforts to it. Redis Ltd. did not help their perception of being up to no good when they got frisky with their beloved trademark and started taking over open-source Redis extensions.\n\nIn an obvious homage to when Bushwick Bill (RIP), Scarface, and Willie D got back together in 2015, the Redis' creator announced in December 2024 that he is in touch with the Redis Ltd. management and is looking to make a comeback to reunite the Redis community.\n\nElasticsearch:\n\nElastic N.V. is the for-profit company backing the development of the leading text-search Elasticsearch DBMS. In 2021, they announced their switch to a dual-license model of the Elastic License and MongoDB's SSPL. Again, this was in response to the rising prominence of Amazon's Elasticsearch offering, even though the service had been out since 2015. Amazon didn't take this switch kindly and announced their OpenSearch fork.\n\nThree years later, Elastic N.V. announced in August 2024 that they reverted their license change and switched to the AGPL. Their blog article announcing this change references Kendrick Lamar's songs (e.g., Not Like Us). Amazon did not like being called the Drake of Databases and announced the following month that they were transferring ownership of the OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation.\n\nUpdate 2025-01-01: I previously stated that AWS added the InfluxDB v2 protocol on top of their existing Timestream DBMS. Instead of just copying the protocol, AWS is providing a managed service of the InfluxDB v2 DBMS in collaboration with Influx Data.

[Credit]\n\nThe Databricks vs. Snowflake Gangwar Continues\n\nThere continues to be no love lost between Databricks and Snowflake. This fight is a classic database war that has spilled out into the streets. The two companies\u2019 previous feud over query performance has expanded to other areas of data management and become much more expensive.\n\nDatabricks took the first shot in March 2024 when they announced they spent $10 million to build their DBRX open-source LLM with 132 billion parameters. The Mosaic team led the development of the DBRX model, which Databricks acquired in 2023 for $1.3 billion. One month later, Snowflake rolled up to the same corner and lit it up using their Arctic open-source LLM with 480 billion parameters. Snowflake boasted they only spent $2 million to train their model while outperforming DBRX for \u201centerprise\u201d tasks like SQL generation. You can tell that Snowflake cares most about taking a shot at Databricks because their announcement shows other LLMs doing better than them (e.g., Llama3), but they highlight how they are better than DBRX. One AI researcher was confused about why Snowflake focused so much on DBRX in their analysis and not the other models; this person does not know how much blood these two database rivals have spilled.\n\nWhile the public LLM battle raged, another front in the war between Databricks and Snowflake opened up behind the scenes over catalogs. For most of the 2010s, Hive\u2019s HCatalog has been the de facto catalog system on data lakes. Iceberg and Hudi emerged as replacements in the late 2010s from Netflix and Uber, respectively, and both became top-level Apache projects backed by VC-funded startups. These systems provide a meta-data service to track files and support transactional ingestion of new data on an object store (e.g., S3). Databricks has a proprietary catalog service called Unity, which works with its DeltaLake platform. Snowflake announced their initial integration with Iceberg-backed tables in 2022. They then expanded their support for Iceberg over the next few years. Then, they looked into acquiring Tabular, the main company behind Iceberg, to compete against Databricks with Unity and DeltaLake. The story goes that Snowflake was about to close the deal for $600 million. But then Databricks crashed the party and splashed $2 billion to acquire Tabular. Databricks announced the acquisition the same day as the Snowflake CEO\u2019s conference keynote address, where he was announcing their new open-source Polaris catalog service in June 2024. Databricks continued to kick Snowflake in the teeth when they announced they were open-sourcing their Unity catalog the following week. Straight murdergram.\n\nAndy\u2019s Take: What is interesting about this database battle is that it is not just about raw performance numbers. It isn\u2019t like the old Oracle versus Informix shootout of the 1990s, where they were mostly boasting about faster query latencies. It is true that the battle also went beyond just benchmark shots when Informix sued Oracle (and later had to withdraw their suit) because Oracle poached some top Informix executives. Later, the world found out that the Informix CEO had cooked the company\u2019s books to inflate revenue numbers to look better against Oracle and had to do a two-month bid in the federal clink. Instead, the Snowflake versus Databricks battle has expanded to be about the ecosystem around the database. That is, it is about the infrastructure people use to get their data into a database and then the tools they use on that data. Vectorized execution engines for analytical queries are a commodity now. Databricks and every other OLAP vendor follow Snowflake\u2019s architecture design from 2013, originally based on one of the Snowflake co-founders\u2019 Ph.D. thesis. What matters now are quality-of-life facets (which are hard to monetize and compare with competitors), compatibility with other tools, and AI/LLM magic. At least the competition between Snowflake and Databricks has an upside for consumers. Such ferocity means better products and technology for data (e.g., Snowflake\u2019s Polaris is now an Apache project) and eventually (hopefully) lower prices. It\u2019s not like the previous pissing match between Oracle and SalesForce CEOs, where it was two rich guys taking pop shots at each other during their expensive conferences.\n\nShoving Ducks Into Everything\n\nIn the same way that Postgres is the default choice for anyone starting a new operational database, DuckDB has entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for someone wanting to run analytical queries on their data. Pandas previously held DuckDB's crowned position. Given DuckDB's insane portability, there are several efforts to stick it inside existing DBMSs that do not have great support for OLAP workloads. This year, we saw the release of four different extensions to stick DuckDB up inside Postgres.\n\nThe first announcement came in May 2024 when Crunchy Data revealed their proprietary bridge for rewiring Postgres to route OLAP queries to DuckDB. They later announced an expanded version of their extension to leverage DuckDB's geospatial capabilities to accelerate PostGIS queries.\n\nIn June 2024, ParadeDB announced their open-source extension (pg_analytics) that uses Postgres' foreign data wrapper API to call into DuckDB; they previously were using DataFusion in an earlier version (pg_lakehouse) but switched to the Duck.\n\nThen, in August 2024, the next DuckDB-for-Postgres extension (pg_duck) came out. The source code for this extension is hosted under the DuckDB Labs GitHub organization. As such, this is the officially sanctioned DuckDB extension for Postgres. The original announcement touted this project as being a collaboration between MotherDuck, Hydra, Microsoft, and Neon. The latter two were (allegedly) kicked out of the mix over a dispute on development controls, similar to Arabian Prince leaving NWA. The repository now only lists it as a joint effort between MotherDuck and Hydra.\n\nThe latest DuckDB extension dropped in November 2024 with pg_mooncake. Mooncake differs from the other three because it supports writing data through Postgres into Iceberg tables with full transaction support.\n\nAndy\u2019s Take: Most OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries. DuckDB's convenience and portability are the reasons for its proliferation in the Postgres community. Although ClickHouse has existed since 2016, it was not as easy to run as DuckDB until recently (see this blog article that discusses the steps to deploy ClickHouse in 2018). These DuckDB extensions are a single entry point to the broader data ecosystem. Users no longer need to install separate extensions to access data in Iceberg and separately for S3. DuckDB can handle all of that for you. It allows organizations to gain high-performance analytics without needing an expensive data warehouse. Postgres' support for extensions and plugins is impressive. One of the original design goals of Postgres from the 1980s was to be extensible. The intention was to easily support new access methods and new data types and operations on those data types (i.e., object-relational). Since 2006, Postgres' \"hook\" API. Our research shows that Postgres has the most expansive and diverse extension ecosystem compared to every other DBMS. We also found that the DBMS's lack of guard rails means that extensions can interfere with each other and cause incorrect behavior. Earlier projects that added columnar storage to Postgres (e.g., Citus, Timescale) only solved part of the problem. Columnar data formats improve retrieving data from storage. However, a DBMS cannot fully exploit those formats if it still uses a row-oriented query processing model (e.g., Postgres). Using DuckDB provides both columnar storage and vectorized query processing. There is likely a turducken joke here involving an elephant, but I will not make it because I do not want to get fired or put on probation by the university (again).\n\nRandom Happenings\n\nMany one-off events happened with databases last year that you might have overlooked. Here is a quick summary of them:\n\nReleases:\n\nAcquisitions:\n\nFunding:\n\nThere are a few more raises from CedarDB, SpiralDB, and others but those amounts are not public yet.\n\nDeaths:\n\nAmazon QLDB If Amazon can't figure out how to make money on a blockchain database, then nobody can. And yes, I know QLDB is not a true P2P blockchain, but it's close enough.\n\nOtterTune Dana, Bohan, and I worked on this research project and startup for almost a decade. And now it is dead. I am disappointed at how a particular company treated us at the end, so they are forever banned from recruiting CMU-DB students. They know who they are and what they did.\n\nI want to also give special props to Andres Freund for discovering the xz backdoor in 2024 while working on Postgres at Microsoft. This attack was a two-year campaign to inject malicious code into an important compression library widely used in computing. Although the backdoor targeted SSH and not Postgres directly, it is another example of why database engineers are some of the best programmers in the world.\n\nCan\u2019t Stop, Won\u2019t Stop\n\nDo you know who had their 80th birthday this year? The legendary Larry Ellison! Once again, we see that he is a man who refuses to settle down or be put into a box. First, Larry propelled himself up Forbes' Billionaires List to become the third richest person in the world. In March 2024, the Oracle stock rose so much that he made $15 billion in a single day. Flush with cash, Larry went shopping in July 2024 and signed a deal to purchase Paramount Studios at $6 billion for his only son (third wife). He then decided to relax by buying a Palm Beach resort for only $277 million. These moves happened in just one year, and databases paid for all of it. But these are mere trifles compared to Larry's most significant accomplishment in 2024.\n\nEveryone I know was surprised when our Larry Ellison news alerts woke us up in the middle of the night in November 2024. The headlines were touting how Larry helped the University of Michigan football program recruit the premiere college quarterback. The university had previously announced that this player was transferring from Louisiana State to Michigan. Their press release included a curious acknowledgement to \"Larry and his wife Jolin\" for helping with the recruiting effort. Reporters soon confirmed that this \"Larry\" was the one and only Larry Ellison! Larry contributed $12 million to the booster campaign to bankroll the best quarterback's move to Michigan.\n\nThe bigger mystery in this story was the identity of this \"Jolin\" person. Investigators found older photos of Larry watching a tennis match with a woman wearing a Michigan hat. Then, two weeks later, a major news organization broke the story at 5:30 am (my alerts woke me up again) that the woman's identity was Jolin (Keren) Zhu and they confirmed that she was Larry's new wife.\n\nAndy\u2019s Take: I am beaming with pride over what Larry accomplished in the past year. He famously did not graduate from any university and had no prior connection to the University of Michigan. And yet, because the love of his life went to Michigan about a decade ago, Larry made magic happen by writing a check for a measly $12 million (about 0.0055% of his net worth). I told Larry this especially means a lot to me because my former #1 ranked Ph.D. student is now a professor in Michigan's Computer Science department with their famous Database Group. What is even more fantastic about this story is that Larry is again in love! Too many people struggle in today's world to find that special somebody. Dating apps are a mess, speed dating events are awkward, and it is now considered uncouth to hang around a playground to meet single parents when you do not have kids of your own. Then, just when you think you finally found the right person, it all falls apart when you learn they do not wash their socks regularly or like to put hot sauce on cold cereal. That is why everyone was telling me that Larry would never get married again after his 2010 divorce from romance novelist Melanie Craft (fourth wife). Those people were telling me the same thing after his 2020 divorce from Nikita Kahn (fifth wife). But I knew better, and Larry proved me right with his surreptitious marriage to Keren Zhu (sixth wife)!\n\nConclusion\n\nI was planning on starting this article boasting how this is the first time in three years where I was celebrating NYE not sick. But then my biological daughter gave me COVID so I'm laid up with that. I got boosted back in September and they gave me Paxlovid, so I'll survive this.\n\nI am disappointed that OtterTune is dead. But I learned a lot and got to work with many brilliant people. I am a big fan of Intel Capital and Race Capital for sticking with us to the end. I hope to announce our next start-up soon (hint: it\u2019s about databases).\n\nIn the meantime, I am happy to be back full-time at Carnegie Mellon University. Jignesh Patel and I have some baller research projects that we hope to turn out this upcoming year. I am also looking forward to teaching a new course on query optimization this semester. I need to figure out to juice my stats because in September 2024, Wikipedia removed the article about me over not having enough citations.\n\nWe are staying true to DJ Mooshoo while he is locked up in Cook County. We hope to free him in 2025.\n\nLastly, I want to give a shout-out to ByteBase for their article Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review. In previous years, they emailed me asking for permission to translate my end-of-year database articles into Chinese for their blog. This year, they could not wait for me to finish writing this one, so they jocked my flow and wrote their own off-brand article with the same title and premise."

What cruelty!\" The Pontiff is worked up, impatient, angry. He wants an unspecified court to decide in his favour \u2013 Israel is committing genocide\n\nIn fact the Pontiff could settle the matter for himself in ten minutes. The \u2018discovery\u2019, to use lawyers\u2019 jargon, will not be to his liking. What exactly should the applicant Google to obtain compelling evidence that Israel has a record of trying to exterminate a Muslim population? Most would Google, \u2018Israel/Gaza/genocide\u2019 \u2013 the wrong track. It yields nothing better than stock opinions which a rookie counsel might quash before a Pope can say, \u2018From the river to the sea.\u2019 A Vatican team worth its salt will Google \u2018Plight of Christianity\u2019. To zoom onto the Middle East, it could do no better than click on the link above.\n\nThe totality of evidence discovered can make a summing up statement well nigh impregnable. Under Muslim sovereignty the plight of Christianity is dire. Under Jewish sovereignty, opposite to plight, Christianity grows. The Pope alleging that genocide is in the wind is directed at the wrong door. His Holiness must not even try going to reliably anti-Israel Wikipedia. He will find there the galling truth confirmed that, \u201cChristians are on the verge of extinction in the Middle East\u201d. It is elsewhere than Gaza he will discover proof of genocide. Rather than committing it, Israel is fighting it; doing so for Jews no less than for Catholics and Protestants. No doubt the papal gut will find digesting the truth a painful process.\n\nThe loci of Israel\u2019s fighting genocide used to be the \u2018Palestinian territories\u2019 where 99% of Palestinians live . That was before the horrors of Oct 7, 2023. Then its fight spilled over the borders into Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iran \u2013 all listed in Open Doors\u2019 World Watch as countries where Christians face \u201cvery high or extreme levels\u201d of persecution. For reason known to itself, Open Doors steers clear of the \u2018Palestinian territories\u2019. But no matter - into the breach steps the Jerusalem Centre of Public Affairs.\n\n\u201cDemographics don\u2019t lie,\u201d declares the title of the JCPA\u2019s December 2024 report. The subtitle reveals which demographics don\u2019t lie: \u201cThe Christian population within the Palestinian Authority and under Hamas is declining.\u201d Factors cited are the lack of police protection, work discrimination, harassment, coercion to convert to Islam, and types of socio-economic hardship.\n\nDemographics in Gaza also don\u2019t lie. From the time Israel abandoned the strip to Palestinian control in 2005, Christians have dwindled from 5,000 to 1,100 in October 2023, on the eve of the war in Gaza.\n\nWhat of the so-called, \u2018West Bank\u2019? Practically synonymous with Christianity, Bethlehem hardly has a better record than Gaza. When the city came under the Muslim dominated Palestinian Authority in 1994 Bethlehem was, \u201cThe most populous Christian town in the Holy Land.\u201d Christians at this time made up 15% of all residents, By 2020 they were down to no more than 5%. On Christmas day 2024, not more than a small element remained to celebrate the birth of Jesus \u2013 to a Jewish couple. The beleaguered contingent bemoaned that Ramallah, the central seat of Muslim government, had hijacked Christian holidays. \u201c Jesus was born in Bethlehem, not Ramallah ,\u201d a tour guide reminds the Palestinian Authority. \u201cWhat the Palestinian leadership is doing is an insult to not only Bethlehem but all Christians.\u201d\n\nHold onto where Jesus was born and highjacked. His Holiness plays the highjacking game when he swaddles Christ in a Palestinian keffiyeh. Since the garment is a worldwide symbol of \u2018resistance\u2019, the catchword for Islamic sovereignty over the Holy Land, the Pope converting Jesus into a Palestinian (Arab?) follows hard on its heels. These embattled thoughts of the Bishop of Rome are out of sync with Catholicism. And so we arrive at some critical clues into delusion-caused blindness. The Pope divorcing Jesus from Judaism may account for a refusal to accept that Christianity under Israeli sovereignty has fared close to faultlessly.\n\nDemographics don\u2019t lie. According to a 2021 poll, 84% of Israeli Christians were satisfied with life in Israel. It ties in neatly with a new report by Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics. Far from the dwindling trend in \u2018Palestinian territories\u2019, the Christian population in Israel portrays growth at a steady rate. In December 2023 there were some 190,000 Israeli Christians, increasing their proportion to 1.9% of the total. A year-on-year growth of 1.2% consolidated a long term upward trend. \u201cAs opposed to the trend in many countries of the Middle East,\u201d says the report, \u201cIsrael reflects a different reality.\u201d\n\nThere are further conclusive indicators of a \u201cdifferent reality\u201d, of Israel being a Christian haven . Nine churches are officially recognized, including the Roman Catholic and Armenian Catholic churches. Secondly, Arab Christians happen to be the most educated ethnic group in Israel. \"The Christian number is increasing because of freedom of religion ,\" says Pastor Petra Heldt, a leading Christian scholar and Israel resident for 40 years. \"This is not true of Muslim-majority countries in the region.\"\n\nYet the Pope reacts to Israel as he would to a slap in the face. Why is that?\n\nA commonplace explanation is that the Argentinean prelate is cowardly.\n\n\u201cPerhaps he believes that pointing a finger at the Jews will divert Muslim rage from the Vatican. Perhaps he believes it distracts the world from his own cowardice and failure to protect Christians.\u201d\n\nThere must be truth in this; Protestant leaders display the identical fear. The now disgraced Anglican leader, Archbishop Justin Welby , had Pope Francis\u2019 fear. One, Welby treated Muslims with kid gloves and two, he looked on his persecuted flock as sacrificial lambs. It therefore stands to reason what buckles the Pontiff\u2019s pink knees: his pathetic fear. Thus far it explains him but no further.\n\nA Pope prostituting the Messiah simply to divert and distract from his gross cowardice? Would he really go that far? The fact is, he shares a trait which is common to leading clerics of different churches. This involves borrowing the Messiah to have a go at the Jews. If politicised Protestants can do it, and 3rd Reich Hitler-loyal clerics could do it, why not a Woke Pontiff? Francis may be well be driven by Jew-hatred pure and simple, to abandon the Old Testament and the Gospels, and subvert Jesus into a divine zealot for the Palestinian Arab cause.\n\nThere is no lack of modern precedents. Kairos borrows Christ not to beat swords into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks, rather for daily all-too human acts. Rather than Jesus walking on water, Kairos gets him to walk through a military checkpoint manned by Israelis.\n\nFor another precedent, at the Bethlehem \u2018Christ at the Checkpoint Conference\u2019, clerics debated what Jesus would do and say, if he had to cope with the \u2018Occupation\u2019. How would the Messiah deal with the anger and bitterness Palestinians feel? Munther Isaac, Dean of Bethlehem Bible College, stepped into the Son of God\u2019s big shoes to address this captivating idea.\n\nThe applications of Jesus seem endless. His agony on the cross is not immune to abuse. An Easter sermon by Arab Protestant Naim Ateek , draws a most bizarre image regarding this.\n\n\u201cIt seems that Jesus is on the cross again with thousands of crucified Palestinians around him, said Ateek. \u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s crucifixion system is operating daily.\u201d\n\nIn short, Gospel narratives are cunningly worked into anti-Semitic propaganda. The United Church of Christ, embarrassed by the New Testament testifying to Jews living in a land they were supposed to have pinched from Palestinian Arabs in the 20th Century, reverts to the canard of Zionist colonizers.\n\nApparently therefore, outrage for Palestinian Arabs living under the Jews, though far better off than their brethren rotting and dying under Muslims, is a way to go to heaven. Curse Israel and God will bless you.\n\nIs Pope Francis another high priest of anti-Zionism? He would not be the first anti-Israel Pope. The Vatican\u2019s refusal in 1948 to recognize the newly declared State of Israel was not pro-Arab bias, but an issue of dogma. Nor is the Vatican out on a limb. The World Council of Churches, the Presbyterians of America, the Greek Orthodox and diverse clerics, think in St Augustine\u2019s terms. Get the hell out of Palestine. After you rejected Christ you lost your place as the Chosen. Go back to being the witness wanderers God meant you to be.\n\nNot only Christianity thinks like this. Israel\u2019s rise from Holocaust ashes troubles secular anti-Zionists. Their problem is not doctrinal but perceptual. The anti-Zionist cannot come to terms with such a thing as a military Jew. The stereotype of the Jew of old \u2013 a bearded bookish stateless wanderer \u2013 could never have evolved into a mean machine. What vinegary thoughts turn on Israel, what sourball gaze at the juggernaut Jew. Get the hell out! Go back to your natural born fate.\n\nSo there we are; a Pope who is driven to defame the un-chosen people. Israel\u2019s destiny was never to make the desert bloom; to build a Tel Aviv of Manhattan skyscrapers; to win Nobel Prizes by the wheelbarrow full; to boast a bustling high-tech economy stronger than Italy\u2019s; to be a rare and isolated haven for blessed Arab Christians. The Pontiff\u2019s pores leak not envy but error, the faith-losing error of dogma. We now have the cause of his dogmatic angst and bluster: the spoilage of the plot, the shattering of the icon.\n\nSteve Apfel is an international authority on anti-Zionism and a prolific author published on many sites and journals since 2003.

The thickness of the fog, its appearance under a flashlight, and the respiratory symptoms some have reported after exposure led many to theorize about chemical attacks, bioweapons testing, and, of course, aliens.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSo far, there has been no confirmation that there is anything nefarious about any fog in any part of the world, but with mistrust in the government at high levels, this hasn\u2019t slowed the spread of frightened posting.\n\nNow everyone in TikTok is afraid of the fog pic.twitter.com/Trt4bOXEJN \u2014 UAE Exotic Falconry & Finance\ud80c\udd43 (@FalconryFinance) December 31, 2024\n\nWhat are the fog conspiracy theories?\n\nStarting on Dec. 29, social media users on conspiracy-heavy platforms like TikTok and X began publishing videos about a nefarious fog that seemed unusually thick or made of large particles. Some reported an odd smell described as chemical, electrical, or burning, and then claimed to experience fever, coughing, sore throat, headache, and fatigue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese symptoms drew COVID-19 comparisons and soon led to the term \u201cFogvid-24.\u201d As an echo of the conspiracy theories around the virus, some claim that government forces are surely deploying the fog as a means to spread a new pathogen, either as an experiment or an attack.\n\nReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u201cchemical fogs.\u201d\n\n\n\nDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\n\n\n\nDubbed\u2026 pic.twitter.com/DQqnrsYKzd \u2014 Shadow of Ezra (@ShadowofEzra) December 30, 2024\n\n\u201cReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u2018chemical fogs,\u2019\u201d writes X account @ShadowofEzra. \u201cDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAround the globe\u201d may be an exaggeration, however. Most if not all of these reports appear to come from the U.K. (which is famous for its fog) or areas of the U.S., including Florida.\n\n\u201cFlorida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, California, Texas and basically all over the country people are reporting this same thick \u2018particle fog,\u2019\u201d tweeted @WallStreetApes. \u201cThey say it\u2019s making them feel sick, smells like chemicals, and is not normal.\u201d\n\nSkeptics react\n\nConsidering how prolific they have become thanks to the internet, many users are quick to dismiss anything that smacks of a conspiracy theory. Theories on the fog are no exception, especially as believers and skeptics appear to fall along political lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose reporting on the fog as though it\u2019s a government plot (or aliens) tend to lean conservative, with histories of anti-government posts or handles like \u201c@BGatesIsAPsycho.\u201d Skeptics, on the other hand, tend to lean left and are wasting no time insulting those who want to believe.\n\n\u201cThe delusional throbbers that believe this stupidity need to give their heads a massive wobble,\u201d writes @BSmithBenS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have suggested that conspiracy theories like this demonstrate a need for traditional news media, heavy on fact-checking.\n\nWhat could explain the mysterious fog?\n\nAs the term \u201cthe fog\u201d trends on X, many posts come with videos of people shining flashlights into the mist, allowing viewers to see individual particles swirling around. This led to widespread alarm among those unaware that fog is actually made of small water or ice particles that reflect light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA video from 2015 by a YouTube user testing out his LED flashlights shows the same effect. This is, in fact, how fog normally looks under concentrated light.\n\nAs for cold or flu-like symptoms, it\u2019s possible that people are simply catching COVID-19 or another common respiratory virus over the holidays. Some of those sounding the alarm say that the fog appeared on Christmas Day when they likely would have spent time indoors with a group of loved ones.\n\nEvery year since 2020, the late fall and early winter holidays have brought a spike in COVID cases, as has always been the same with contagious and seasonal respiratory illnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial fog machine patent fuels conspiracy theories\n\nNot everything about these conspiracy theories can be easily explained away, including the reported chemical smells. Meanwhile, people keep digging up additional oddities that they connect to the fog.\n\nEarlier today, X user @girlymisogynist posted about a patent for a \u201cprocess and apparatus for the production of intense artificial clouds, fogs, or mists.\u201d However, inventors Paul Weiss and Jules Verdier submitted the patent application on Feb. 27, 1916, and it expired in 1937. So, it\u2019s probably not related to the current fog issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. military bacteria fog experiments\n\nIn what sounds like a conspiracy theory but is reported as real by the Bay Area CBS News, the U.S. military conducted experiments over cities like San Francisco using artificial fog to spread bacteria from 1949 to 1969. They were meant to be simulations of \u201cgerm warfare\u201d attacks and allegedly sickened and even killed U.S. residents.\n\nThis is according to Director of the Terror Medicine and Security Program at Rutgers Medical School Leonard Cole in his 1989 book Clouds of Secrecy.\n\n\u201cNearly all of San Francisco received 500 particle minutes per liter,\u201d Cole wrote. \u201cIn other words, nearly every one of the 800,000 people in San Francisco exposed to the cloud at normal breathing rate (10 liters per minute) inhaled 5,000 or more particles per minute during the several hours that they remained airborne.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis report is based on \u201cgovernment records, courtroom testimony and interviews,\u201d according to Publishers Weekly.\n\nNone of this means that the government is pouring pathogens on its populace now, but we can\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible to do so.\n\nThe internet is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "Northwestern University engineers made a remarkable advance in quantum computing and communication, demonstrating quantum teleportation over a standard fiber optic cable that already carries everyday Internet traffic.\n\nThis development shows that quantum communication might not require dedicated lines, which clears the path for easier and more widespread integration of quantum and classical data sharing.\n\nPath for quantum networking\n\nThe news centers around the idea that quantum signals \u2014 information carried by delicate particles of light known as photons \u2014 can travel alongside everyday Internet traffic without losing their integrity.\n\n\n\nThis breakthrough demonstrates quantum teleportation, a process where the state of a particle (like a photon) is transferred to another distant particle without the initial particle moving physically.\n\nScience behind quantum teleportation\n\nBy using entangled photons, this method enables secure, near-instantaneous data sharing and paves the way for future quantum networks.\n\nThe research team successfully tested a setup that allows quantum information to weave through the bustling flow of regular Internet data without interference.\n\nThis achievement overcomes one of the biggest hurdles in making quantum networks a practical reality.\n\nPrem Kumar, who oversaw the research, is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering.\n\nHe is known for his contributions to quantum communication and serves as the director of the Center for Photonic Communication and Computing.\n\n\n\nIn their recent work, Kumar and his collaborators introduce a new way of thinking about quantum signals alongside their classical counterparts.\n\nEntanglement in quantum communication\n\nQuantum teleportation stands out because it uses entanglement as a way to exchange information without physically sending matter across a distance. The concept traces back to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935.\n\n\n\nScientists have since tested quantum entanglement in labs, culminating in the formal proposal for quantum teleportation in 1993.\n\nOne of the biggest appeals of quantum teleportation is that it can occur almost as fast as light travels. Photons can become entangled so that performing a measurement on one instantaneously affects its partner, no matter how far away it is.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly exciting because nobody thought it was possible; our work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks sharing a unified fiberoptic infrastructure. Basically, it opens the door to pushing quantum communications to the next level,\u201d enthused Kumar.\n\nProtecting delicate photons\n\nSecuring a clear route for single photons involves more than just adding them to an active cable. Ordinary Internet traffic typically relies on millions of light particles, so a handful of quantum photons can easily get lost or overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nThe Northwestern team performed detailed studies on how light scatters inside the cable to see if there was a specific wavelength that experiences less clutter.\n\nThey pinpointed that sweet spot and added special filters to reduce the noise generated by normal data traffic.\n\n\u201cQuantum teleportation has the ability to provide quantum connectivity securely between geographically distant nodes,\u201d said Kumar.\n\n\n\nPast work suggested that large-scale quantum networks might need specialized systems. Now, his findings reveal that this might not be strictly necessary, if signals are positioned in just the right place in the spectrum.\n\nFirst test run in busy channels\n\nEarlier demonstrations of quantum teleportation typically involved pristine settings or dedicated fibers.\n\nSome researchers believed that real-world cables, teeming with signals, would smother the faint quantum light. That assumption has been proven wrong.\n\nIn tests at Northwestern, the researchers ran quantum signals and classical communications over the same fiber optic cable without them colliding.\n\nThey measured how well the quantum information arrived at its destination and confirmed that it was still correct at the other end.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks,\u201d Kumar summarized.\n\nReal-world infrastructure\n\nThe immediate plan is to scale the system to longer runs and then transition to underground fiber connections.\n\nThe group believes that an eventual shift to real-world cables could be next. Building on single-pair teleportation, they also want to experiment with multiple pairs of entangled photons to achieve another crucial step known as entanglement swapping.\n\nIf that milestone is reached, quantum networks could begin to take shape across regions rather than only between two points.\n\n\n\nFor critical operations in finance, defense, and data management, such networks could offer more secure connections thanks to the inherent secrecy of quantum methods, where any tampering is immediately noticeable.\n\nBroader applications\n\nThe capacity to support quantum connections without setting up special cables makes many new ideas more viable.\n\nDistributed quantum computing, which relies on linking multiple quantum computers in different locations, would be simpler to establish.\n\nDistance-sensing tasks and advanced metrology could also benefit from more stable quantum links.\n\nEven beyond computing, quantum networks have the potential to spur new technologies in encryption, imaging, and fundamental physics experiments.\n\n\n\nResearchers have also discussed using quantum entanglement to synchronize distant clocks or to share random numbers for cryptography at unprecedented levels of security.\n\nSignificance of quantum teleportation\n\nQuantum teleportation has matured from a fascinating theory to a tool that is becoming more practical.\n\nWhile it is never straightforward to integrate delicate quantum signals, the Northwestern group\u2019s accomplishment raises confidence that such integration is within reach.\n\nMany experts have believed that building specialized infrastructure was an unavoidable cost of quantum networking.\n\nAccording to Kumar\u2019s report, if wavelengths are picked carefully, classical signals and quantum information can coexist just fine. This line of thinking spares organizations from installing entire new grids of cables.\n\nFuture work on quantum teleportation\n\nIn upcoming work, the researchers plan to expand the scope of their approach in longer segments to confirm that the method remains stable as cables stretch far past the lab. They will also design a multi-node demonstration to verify it can handle more than a single link.\n\n\n\nThere is much excitement that existing communication channels, once tuned just right, could carry quantum data to distant points.\n\nWith such possibilities on the horizon, quantum teleportation may shift from a theoretical concept to a tool that transforms communication.\n\nThe future might see quantum and classical networks working side by side in ways that once sounded unlikely.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Optica.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
