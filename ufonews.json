Credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAdult content, including AI-generated nudes, remains banned on Facebook and Instagram, despite recent policy changes at Meta.\n\nHowever, that hasn't stopped \"nudify\" apps \u2014 platforms that create nonconsensual AI-generated nudes of celebrities and influencers \u2014 from advertising on Meta's platforms. And those ads have been extremely successful for at least one service called Crush AI.\n\nAccording to a new report from 404Media , as originally reported in Alexios Mantzarlis' Faked Up newsletter, the Crush AI modifier app receives the vast majority of its traffic from Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. According to Similarweb's data, last month Crush AI received more than a quarter of a million visits to its service \u2014 and roughly 90 percent of that traffic was from Meta's platforms.\n\nCrush AI makes it quite clear what the purpose of its service is in its advertisements. The company's ads include photos of real-life individuals like Instagram influencer and model Mikayla Demaiter and OnlyFans creator Sophie Rain. The ads boast that users can \"upload a photo\" and \"erase anyone's clothes.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Crush AI creates fake profile pages using AI-generated profile pictures and runs new ads using those pages. The ads promote different domain names that then redirect to Crush AI when clicked.\n\nMashable has previously reported on other deepfakes and AI platforms that utilize Meta's advertising platform to generate traffic and revenue from AI-generated adult content. These ads are strictly against Meta's policies, and the company often removes them once it becomes aware of specific advertisements.\n\nHowever, as 404Media previously reported , Meta appears to have different standards for ad moderation. Policy-breaking content published by users as Facebook or Instagram posts will often be automatically detected by Meta and subsequently removed. Yet, that same content will not be detected when uploaded to Meta's advertising platform."

            "source": "ZDNet",
            "article_content": "Cheng Xin/Getty Images\n\nMicrosoft has begun expanding the reach of its Copilot feature set, bringing its AI capabilities to Office apps for anyone currently subscribed to Microsoft 365 Personal or Family.\n\nFor customers in the US and Europe, those features are only available with an extremely pricey Copilot Pro subscription. For Personal and Family subscribers, the upgrade costs an extra $20 monthly, which is more than double the cost of the basic Microsoft 365 subscription.\n\nBut that's all about to change.\n\nAlso: Microsoft Copilot vs. Copilot Pro: Is the subscription fee worth it?\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the company is making Copilot part of all Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions. According to an announcement I found last November, the change is effective for Microsoft 365 subscribers in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand; they also get access to the Microsoft Designer app for generating images.\n\nOver the past two months, current subscribers in those regions have been reporting that they got access to Copilot in their apps after they updated to the latest version. But with the start of the new year, Microsoft has started informing those customers that their subscription prices are about to rise substantially.\n\nOne unhappy customer signed on to a Microsoft Community board to complain about the sudden and unexpected price hike: \"I just got an email saying my family subscription is going from $129 a year to $179 a year. That's a big increase!\"\n\nYes, it is. And what do those subscribers get for those hefty extra fees? Sorry, but this isn't an all-you-can-AI deal. As the announcement explains, \"Subscribers will receive a monthly allotment of AI credits to use Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Designer. The credits will also apply to apps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on Windows.\" The option of a Copilot Pro subscription is available for subscribers who use more than the basic basket of credits.\n\nWhile the new features are free to current subscribers, the upgrade comes with two big gotchas. For Microsoft 365 Family subscribers, the added features are available only to the primary user and can't be shared with other members. And if the primary user doesn't want those features, they're nearly impossible to disable.\n\nAlso: Your Windows 10 PC can't be upgraded? You have 5 options before support ends in 2025\n\nOn paper, this is a good deal for current subscribers. Or at least that's what Microsoft is hoping those subscribers will think after they've had a chance to give the Copilot features a test drive. The current $20-a-month Copilot Pro subscription is prohibitively expensive. The new package offers a reasonable chunk of AI credits for just over $4 a month. Such a bargain, right?\n\nBut my quick survey of online forums suggests that very few customers are buying that math. And for those who neither want nor need those AI features, finding the alternative is a challenge. A Microsoft 365 Classic option is available, without the Copilot features, at prices that are similar to those in place before the AI-driven increase. But the only way to unlock that option is to try to cancel your current subscription. At that point, as Office-Watch discovered, Microsoft coughs up the lower-priced alternative.\n\nMeanwhile, in the rest of the world -- including the US and Western Europe -- the free Copilot features aren't available -- yet. But I expect it's only a matter of time before this change expands to additional markets.\n\nIt's not unusual for Microsoft to try out new subscription offers on a regional basis before taking them to a worldwide market. That's exactly what this announcement looks like.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot, and worthy alternatives\n\nAnyone who's paid attention to Satya Nadella's Microsoft in recent years knows that the company is all in on AI, so it would be odd if there were no plans to roll out a similar feature set to the Microsoft 365 subscription base worldwide. Starting in the APAC region gives the company time to gauge customer reaction and also continue scaling up the capacity of servers that power Copilot features.\n\nBased on the pricing in those test regions, pricing for customers in the US would probably increase by $50 -- from $69 to $119 for Personal plans and from $99 to $149 for Family subscriptions. Those data centers aren't going to pay for themselves.\n\nThe expanded offering is still brand new, but Reddit users from the region have already weighed in with complaints. One asked, rhetorically, \"I'm just meant to put up with unwanted bundleware that I never agreed to soaking up CPU cycles on my hardware \u2026 because Microsoft needs to look like [its] AI spend is getting ROI to investors?\"\n\nAlso: Microsoft introduces 10 AI agents for sales, finance, supply chain in Dynamics 365\n\nAnother Reddit user, who's apparently a graduate student in Taiwan, called the new Copilot features a \"nightmare,\" adding that it can't be turned off. \"Doesn't Microsoft understand that Graduate/Phd students receive an automatic fail or are charged with academic misconduct for any hint of AI assistance in their writing?\"\n\nIn my testing of the Copilot Pro features in a Microsoft 365 in the Northern Hemisphere, I discovered that the option to turn off those prompts, which had been available in earlier releases, is no longer available. You can hide the AI panes above and to the right of the document, but the Copilot icon in the document itself is ever-present and can't be squelched.\n\nLast November, I asked Microsoft if the company has plans to introduce similar features in the US and other worldwide remarks. A spokesperson replied, \"The company has rolled out changes in six markets to listen, learn, and improve. We don't have anything more to share today.\"\n\nI hope they're listening."

So, Josiah wrote about a fictional vacation that included far-fetched interactions with the supernatural.\n\nJosiah\u2019s classmates voted his essay one of the best, and Josiah was hooked on writing fiction.\n\nJosiah Golojuh, 42, now lives in Huntington Beach, California, but his first novel, \u201cThe Paper Boy\u201d (Stage Beetle Books / 2024), is paranormal fiction inspired by the author\u2019s experiences growing up in Russellton \u2014 a small Allegheny County town about 20 miles northeast of Downtown Pittsburgh \u2014 and delivering newspapers in a trailer park in West Deer.\n\nInteracting with people on the paper route and listening to customers at his family\u2019s hair salon connected Josiah to his community. \u201cThat was how I began to learn character,\u201d he said.\n\nPenny Golojuh, 7, waits as her father, Josiah Golojuh, signs his book, \u201cThe Paper Boy,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. Penny and her sister, Primrose Golojuh, 5, designed the cover for one of their father\u2019s comic books. Photo by John Beale.\n\nIn addition to the inspiration gained from customers he met, the money earned delivering papers helped to fuel his passion for reading and collecting comic books. Decades later, Josiah started a comic book company and published three of his own comic books, sometimes featuring character namesakes of people from his childhood.\n\nJosiah moved to California in 2002 to attend the University of Southern California. He teaches writing at Coastline Community College, but he\u2019s quick to credit growing up in Russellton, population 1,200, with feeding his imagination for fiction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d walk over to Palmer\u2019s drugstore with my older brother to buy Slush Puppies. To a very small kid, that walk was like navigating the streets of a large city. The buildings felt gigantic,\u201d Josiah recalled.\n\nShelly Irvine of Curtisville talks with Josiah Golojuh, left, about his book. Josiah\u2019s daughter, Primrose Golojuh, 5, is seated next to her father. Photo by John Beale.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Josiah returned to Russellton\u2019s Palmer Pharmacy to promote his book. By mid-morning, a dozen people formed a line that extended to the pharmacy counter next to a wall displaying orthopedic shoes. At the far end of the counter, a young man wearing a ball cap waited for a prescription near a display for live bait.\n\nSharpie in hand, the author and his two young daughters sat at a table facing a rack stacked with the latest edition of the newspaper Josiah delivered 30 years ago. Behind him, several customers sat on green-padded stools as they drank coffee at a soda fountain counter repurposed as a coffee bar. Josiah Golojuh, left, waits to sign his book, \u201cThe Paper Boy,\u201d as Josiah\u2019s father, George Golojuh, greets a visitor to the book signing event. Behind Josiah is his wife, Judy Golojuh. Photo by John Beale.\n\nThe Russellton pharmacy has been a hub in the community for decades, and the book signing resembled a homecoming of sorts. Josiah later said the gathering was \u201cmagical.\u201d His hometown no longer seemed so large.\n\nJosiah\u2019s wife and parents were there. Shirley Irvine came from Curtisville. Shirley\u2019s daughter, Erin Irvine Nemazee, from Northern Virginia was there with her two daughters. Erin was in a school play with Josiah. Gary Lutz of Gibsonia, one of Josiah\u2019s high school friends and a namesake for a character in one of Josiah\u2019s comic books, came to get a photo. Chris Cushman was there to buy a book. He and Josiah shared a seat on the school bus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of you,\u201d a woman with short graying hair said with a smile as Josiah wrote an inscription inside her book.\n\nLater in the week, Josiah said he was welcomed during a visit to Deer Lakes Middle School to talk with students about his book and his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with gratitude and humbled by my community,\u201d Josiah said. \u201cI may live somewhere else, but this will always be my home.\u201d"

The top three speeches in each division will be recognized and awarded during the celebration. General admission tickets are $10 per person.

Meet Bathynomus vaderi, a newly identified terrifying sea bug that\u2019s making waves in both the scientific community and our collective nightmares.\n\nAt over 12 inches long and weighing more than 2 pounds, this giant isopod looks like it crawled straight out of a sci-fi horror film. With a head eerily resembling Darth Vader\u2019s iconic helmet\u2014hence the name\u2014this deep-sea dweller is as fascinating as it is frightening.\n\nThis terrifying sea bug belongs to the genus Bathynomus, a group of isopods often referred to as \u201csupergiants\u201d for their massive size. While most isopods are small enough to fit in your hand, these titanic crustaceans can grow up to 20 inches long. They were found near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, where scientists spotted B. vaderi lurking in the cold, deep waters where it scavenges for food.\n\nImage source: Nguyen Thanh Son\n\nBut what makes this B. Vaderi even more intriguing are the unique features that distinguish it from its relatives. Researchers discovered this terrifying sea bug has a distinct depression in its hip bone and a peculiar bony ridge protruding from its coracoid bone. These creepy details further set it apart in a family of creatures known for their unsettling appearance.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nSurprisingly, these nightmare-inducing sea bugs are becoming a delicacy in Vietnam. Often compared to lobster, giant isopods like B. vaderi are highly sought after in local markets. The demand has turned them into an expensive seafood item, driving increased fishing pressures in their deep-sea habitats.\n\nWhile this culinary trend poses a threat to their population, it also presents an opportunity for better conservation. Researchers hope the commercial interest in Bathynomus species will lead to stricter fishing regulations and sustainable practices.\n\nSure, the idea of a terrifying sea bug the size of a small dog may send shivers down your spine, but B. vaderi is also a marvel of nature. Whether you view it as a scientific wonder or a creature from your worst nightmares, one thing is certain: the ocean holds secrets that are as extraordinary as they are spine-chilling."

            "article_content": "Key Biscayne's Police Department will be providing safety tips each month following local and national trends to help avoid residents from falling victims to scams and crime.\n\nThis month's tip is a recent trend involving the use of QR codes, typically used to facilitate quick access to a website or app.\n\nIn the world of cybercrime, the act of fraudulent QR code used to steal an individual's credentials, passwords or even bank accounts is labeled as \"quishing,\" a different form of phishing by using a malicious QR code.\n\nOn recent social media posts, there have been incidents in which a fake QR code has been pasted over the legitimate QR code in cases of parking lots, for example.\n\n\"They can gain access to the data of what's on your phone,\" said Lt. Kristina Andreu with the Key Biscayne Police Department. \"We don't charge for parking here, but you may see QR codes on restaurants or other places. The best way to view the menu, if that's what it's for, is just go online to the restaurant's website and see it or go into the restaurant itself if you think there might be a problem.\"\n\nNBC 6 South Florida recently posted a short YouTube video on how fraudulent stickers can lead to a victim's financial woes.\n\nThe overlapping fake stickers on QR codes are just one way scammers are trying to gain access. Complete replacement of a legitimate sticker is another (the real one is behind it), and scammers might be even creating their own illegitimate menu off the existing QR code.\n\nHow the QR code works:\n\nWhen someone uses their cell phone camera to scan a QR code, the phone automatically opens the corresponding app or website. However, if you know the website you\u2019re trying to reach, scanning a QR code is not necessary; it simply eliminates that step.\n\nUnfortunately, hackers have discovered a way to exploit unsuspecting victims who innocently scan QR codes, allowing them to access all the data on their mobile devices.\n\nPolice advise the public not to scan any suspicious QR codes, avoid scanning QR codes that come in packages or mail from unfamiliar companies and to avoid scams in parking lots by logging into the website and make the payment manually\n\nAndreu's advice is simple: \"If it looks suspicious, don't do it!\""

Meet Bathynomus vaderi, a newly identified terrifying sea bug that\u2019s making waves in both the scientific community and our collective nightmares.\n\nAt over 12 inches long and weighing more than 2 pounds, this giant isopod looks like it crawled straight out of a sci-fi horror film. With a head eerily resembling Darth Vader\u2019s iconic helmet\u2014hence the name\u2014this deep-sea dweller is as fascinating as it is frightening.\n\nThis terrifying sea bug belongs to the genus Bathynomus, a group of isopods often referred to as \u201csupergiants\u201d for their massive size. While most isopods are small enough to fit in your hand, these titanic crustaceans can grow up to 20 inches long. They were found near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, where scientists spotted B. vaderi lurking in the cold, deep waters where it scavenges for food.\n\nImage source: Nguyen Thanh Son\n\nBut what makes this B. Vaderi even more intriguing are the unique features that distinguish it from its relatives. Researchers discovered this terrifying sea bug has a distinct depression in its hip bone and a peculiar bony ridge protruding from its coracoid bone. These creepy details further set it apart in a family of creatures known for their unsettling appearance.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nSurprisingly, these nightmare-inducing sea bugs are becoming a delicacy in Vietnam. Often compared to lobster, giant isopods like B. vaderi are highly sought after in local markets. The demand has turned them into an expensive seafood item, driving increased fishing pressures in their deep-sea habitats.\n\nWhile this culinary trend poses a threat to their population, it also presents an opportunity for better conservation. Researchers hope the commercial interest in Bathynomus species will lead to stricter fishing regulations and sustainable practices.\n\nSure, the idea of a terrifying sea bug the size of a small dog may send shivers down your spine, but B. vaderi is also a marvel of nature. Whether you view it as a scientific wonder or a creature from your worst nightmares, one thing is certain: the ocean holds secrets that are as extraordinary as they are spine-chilling."

The platform enters closed beta testing with an initial group of 500+ traders, targeting a significant reduction in emotional trading errors \u2013 a key factor in the well-documented 90-95% failure rate among retail traders.\n\nThe platform streamlines complex trading processes through systematic execution and automated risk management, addressing key issues that typically lead to trading losses.\n\n\u201cCurrent trading platforms are part of the problem, not the solution,\u201d says Good Market\u2019s development team. \u201cWhile Binance, Coinbase, and other exchanges focus on transaction volume, they\u2019ve neglected the fundamental issue: traders lack systematic execution tools that prevent emotional trading and enforce disciplined strategies.\u201d\n\nDemo: Good Markets platform\n\nGood Market\u2019s Smart Assist Intelligence\u2122 tackles this crisis head-on by automating trade execution and risk management. The platform allows traders to configure up to 300+ parameters, including technical indicators and entry/exit conditions, without writing code. This systematic approach eliminates the psychological biases that plague manual trading of popular tokens like Polygon (MATIC), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nCore Platform Features:\n\nAI-assisted analysis with semi-auto or fully automated execution\n\nAI-prompted strategy builder with 300+ parameters (no coding required)\n\nAutomated position sizing and risk controls\n\nA community marketplace for verified strategies\n\nIntegrated technical and fundamental analysis\n\nGetting $GOOD\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token, $GOOD, offers practical benefits including trading fee reductions of up to 20% and access to premium features. The initial token sale begins at $0.025, with 4 million tokens available in Phase 1 before moving to $0.05 in Phase 2.\n\nEarly Investor Benefits:\n\nBeta platform access\n\nInvitation to London investor meetup\n\nFounder-tier platform status\n\nPremium features for holders of 10,000+ tokens\n\nInput on platform development\n\nAbout Good Market\n\nThe Good Market team combines deep expertise in cryptocurrency trading and traditional finance, including key architects from M2 Exchange who managed over $2B in trading volume and product leaders from Freetrade. Development began in February 2024, building on years of direct experience with retail trading challenges.\n\nThe platform will move to public beta in Q1 2025. Early investors can participate at www.goodmarket.ai.\n\nNote: Trading cryptocurrency and other assets carry a significant risk of loss. Good Market provides tools for systematic trading but does not guarantee trading profits. Popular cryptocurrencies mentioned like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others experience high volatility and should be traded with caution.\n\nConnecting with Good Market:\n\nMedia Contact: [email protected]\n\nwww.goodmarket.ai\n\nContact\n\nMr\n\nChike Chiejine\n\nGood Market\n\n[email protected]"

            "article_content": "Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, opening the way to a possible end to a devastating 15-month conflict. Israel and Hamas have been at war in Gaza since gunmen from the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael responded with a military campaign in which more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to medical officials in the enclave, with thousands more feared buried under the rubble.\n\nHere is a timeline of the war:\n\nOct. 7, 2023: Hamas-led gunmen storm into southern Israel from Gaza and rampage through communities. Retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza begin, along with a total siege.\n\nOct. 8 - Lebanon's Hezbollah fires on Israel, saying its attacks aim to support Palestinians in Gaza, leading to sustained hostilities.\n\nOct. 13: Israel tells residents of Gaza City, where more than one million people live, to move south, beginning a process that will uproot nearly the entire population of the Gaza Strip.\n\nOct. 19: A U.S. Navy warship intercepts missiles and drones launched from Yemen towards Israel. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis continue attacks on Israel and against Red Sea shipping.\n\nOct. 21: Aid trucks are allowed through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into Gaza, where food, water, medicines and fuel are running out. Over coming months, the humanitarian crisis worsens with aid groups and Western governments saying Israel must do more to let in aid.\n\nOct. 27: Israel launches its ground offensive in Gaza.\n\nNov. 15: Israeli troops enter Gaza's biggest hospital, Al Shifa, after a siege of several days. Within a few weeks, all hospitals serving northern Gaza will cease to function.\n\nNov. 21: Israel and Hamas announce a seven-day truce and release of around half the hostages, but war resumes on Dec. 1.\n\nDec. 4: Israeli forces launch their first big ground assault in southern Gaza, towards the main southern city, Khan Younis.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, 2024: Israel signals it will start withdrawing from northern parts of Gaza, but months later it is again fighting militants in the same areas.\n\nJan. 26: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, also known as the World Court, orders Israel to prevent genocide.\n\nFeb. 29: More than 100 Gazans are killed queuing for aid in the presence of Israeli troops who opened fire, in one of the deadliest incidents of the war.\n\nMarch 7: Facing political pressure over hunger in Gaza, U.S. President Joe Biden announces work on a floating pier to deliver aid. It will be installed in May but last only until July with supplies remaining very constricted.\n\nApril 1: Iran's embassy compound in Damascus is hit by a suspected Israeli airstrike that kills several military officers including a top general. Tehran responds two weeks later by firing hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel.\n\nMay 6 - Hamas says it has accepted a proposal for a ceasefire, but Israel said it had not agreed to that text. Israel tells Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah after its forces take control of a buffer zone along the border between Gaza and Egypt, giving Israel effective authority over the Palestinian territory's entire land border.\n\nJune 23 - Netanyahu says the phase of intense fighting against Hamas in Gaza is coming to an end but that the war will not finish until Hamas no longer controls the enclave. However, heavy bouts of fighting continue across Gaza for months more.\n\nJune 25 - The Global hunger monitor, the IPC, says Gaza remains at high risk of famine.\n\nJuly 2 - Israel announces new evacuation orders for the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, which the United Nations called the largest edict of its kind since the beginning of the war.\n\nJuly 27 - A Hezbollah rocket kills a group of 12 children and teenagers in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, prompting Israel to vow retaliation.\n\nAug. 1 - Israel's military says it killed Mohammed Deif, Hamas' military chief, in an airstrike on July 13. Hamas neither confirmed nor denied Deif's death. Palestinian officials said the strike killed 90 people.\n\nAug. 23 - World Health Organization says a first confirmed case of type 2 polio in Gaza for 25 years has paralysed a baby.\n\nSept. 17 - Israel detonates thousands of booby-trapped pager communications devices used by Hezbollah in Lebanon, injuring hundreds of its members.\n\nSept. 28 - An Israeli airstrike in Beirut kills Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, one of many strikes against the group's senior leadership.\n\nOct. 5 - Israeli forces launch major anti-Hamas operation in northern Gaza focused on Jabalia refugee camp near Gaza City and Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya towns. The push continues into 2025. Much of the surrounding area is cleared of people and razed.\n\nOct. 16 - Israel kills Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a shootout in Rafah.\n\nNov. 21 - International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, former defence chief Yoav Gallant, and Hamas' Ibrahim Al-Masri -- also known as Mohammed Deif -- for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza war.\n\nNov. 27 - Israel and Hezbollah agree a ceasefire in Lebanon. On the same day rebels in Syria launch an offensive that will quickly topple President Bashar al-Assad, a major ally of Hezbollah and its Iranian backer.\n\nDec. 2 - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump says there will be \"hell to pay\" in the Middle East if hostages in Gaza are not freed before his Jan. 20 inauguration. Using similar language, he reiterates the demand on Dec. 16 and Jan. 7.\n\nJan. 15 - Negotiators reach a deal for a ceasefire in the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters, after 15 months of conflict that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and inflamed the Middle East."

Despite the underweight rating, the bank forecasts Tesla shares will collapse another 70% to $125 in the next year.\n\nWells Fargo's analyst commented that the grim prediction is driven by weak business fundamentals. They point to Tesla's struggles to prop up vehicle deliveries despite deep discounts, and they warn about fierce competition from Chinese EV players.\n\nThe analyst added that the potential to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits may impact a serious threat to Tesla's pricing power and U.S. market demand.\n\nAlso, Tesla's futuristic CyberCab and humanoid robot Optimus fail to impress Wells Fargo. These innovations have always been exciting, but the bank warns they are in development and are still incredibly expensive, even though they are operational in some form.\n\nThis gloomy projection is made when Tesla enthusiasts are still betting big on the company's long-term vision. Will Elon Musk's team twist the skeptics to prove wrong, or does Tesla head towards a big correction as predicted?\n\nThree Reasons Why Wells Fargo Predicts 70% Plunge on Tesla's Stock\n\nGF Score for Tesla is 78 per 100, highlights company's high financial strength and high revenue growth, but investors should take note that the profitability of Tesla is moderate, and the stock price is considered expensive.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Tesla retained the biggest market share among all battery electric vehicles (BEVs) sold worldwide in 2024, but only slightly. In 2023, Tesla's share stood at 19 percent before dropping to 18 percent in first nine months of 2024, according to analyses by EV Volumes published on CleanTechnica.\n\nThe competition is now hot on Tesla's heels. As Statista's Florian Zandt shows in the chart below, the Chinese conglomerate BYD, which produces standalone electric vehicle batteries and associated electronics in addition to plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, increased its market share by 9 percentage points between 2021 and 2024.\n\nInfographic: Tesla and BYD Claim a Third of the Global BEV Market | Statista\n\nYou will find more infographics at Statista\n\nAs CleanTechnica points out, BYD's market share in the BEV market might not increase that much in 2025 due to the manufacturer focusing on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the upcoming year.\n\nThe BEV portfolio of legacy automakers like Volkswagen and Geely-Volvo stood at 7 and 8 percent, respectively, while SAIC, which includes the joint venture between the Chinese state-owned SAIC Motor and Wuling as well as General Motors, also had a market share of 8 percent as of the most recently available data.\n\nBetween 2023 and January to September 2024, BYD's and Tesla's shares dropped by 1 percentage point each. BYD is focused on providing BEVs to a more general consumer base, while Tesla's products have a higher price tag. This difference might be slightly mitigated through the increase of tariffs on Chinese-made cars from 25 to 100 percent which came into effect in August 2024.\n\nAccording to EV Volumes, 14 million electric vehicles were sold globally in 2023, 70 percent of which were BEVs. However, 84 percent of all light vehicles sold still ran on traditional combustion engines or other non-electric fuel sources. The biggest exporter and market for both hybrids and BEVs was China with shares of 65 and 59 percent, respectively.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com"

And, now, Google Search appears to have hit its lowest market share in a decade.\n\nAs first spotted by SearchEngineLand, Google has dropped below 90% share in the worldwide search engine market over the past three months, marking a clear trend. The last time that Google\u2019s share was under 90% for three months was in early 2015. The data is provided by StatCounter, which uses tracking data on millions of websites to find trends among search engines, device usage, and more. That data isn\u2019t infallible to mistakes, as we likely saw with recent Google Pixel data, but there\u2019s obviously a trend in this case.\n\nWhy the drop in Google Search usage?\n\nThere are likely a lot of factors at play, but one highly likely reason is increased competition. The generative AI boom has led to new search offerings such as Perplexity and even OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Privacy-conscious users may have also adopted alternate search engines. StatCounter doesn\u2019t provide much insight there, beyond showing that Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex all very slightly grew (still fluctuating) while Google shrank.\n\nAnother point to consider is that, especially among younger audiences, TikTok is becoming a go-to location for searching for information, to the point where TikTok even tested linking out to Google Search in its own app. Google also started sourcing TikTok in early 2024.\n\nMore on Google Search:\n\nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram"

The cinema capital\u2019s wealth and industrial diversity, along with other natural advantages from geography and weather, may allow Los Angeles to stave off a worst-case scenario.\n\nEstimating the likely economic losses is tricky at this stage. The weather data company AccuWeather has offered a figure of $250 billion to $275 billion, though a Goldman Sachs report said it found the estimate high. (Declining to provide a breakdown because its methodology is \u201cproprietary,\u201d AccuWeather said it considered many factors including long-run health impacts as well as short-term losses in the value of public companies exposed to the disaster.)\n\nHere are some elements to account for when thinking about the total cost of the fires.\n\nPhysical Wreckage\n\nThe most straightforward component of damage is the number of structures damaged or destroyed, currently about 12,000. That\u2019s fewer than the 18,000 felled by the Camp fire in Northern California in 2018, but this is a different kind of house: Zillow values the average home in the Pacific Palisades ZIP code at $3.4 million; in Altadena\u2019s ZIP code, it\u2019s $1.3 million.\n\nThat\u2019s what is driving early estimates of insured losses progressively higher, now reaching $30 billion, according to Wells Fargo. But insurance will neither make all homeowners whole nor pay the full cost of rebuilding. Carriers have dropped thousands of policies in the affected areas in recent years, and the state-backed insurer of last resort caps coverage at $3 million per residential property.\n\nThen there\u2019s the damage to commercial space. Although one landlord managed to protect an outdoor mall with privately hired water tankers, many other businesses were gutted."

Derby\n\nReuters\n\nDevastating fires in the Los Angeles area are likely to put modest pressure on the U.S. national economy in the near term but are unlikely to derail strong forward momentum, economists say.\n\nForecasters reckon the fires\u2019 destruction of property and job market disruptions could put upward pressure on inflation as they also slow growth and put a modest brake on hiring, although not at a large enough level to fundamentally change the outlook.\n\n\u201cThe L.A. wildfires are shaping up to be the costliest climate disaster in U.S. history, which stems both from their size and the high value of the residential real estate they are destroying,\u201d said J.P. Morgan economist Abiel Reinhart.\n\nLos Angeles wildfires:US banks ready mortgage relief for affected homeowners\n\nNoting estimates placing the economic damage cost in the quarter-trillion-dollar range and outstripping the cost of Hurricane Katrina, Reinhart said \u201cwe think the short-term effect on national GDP growth, employment, and inflation will be small.\u201d The total size of U.S. domestic product was just shy of $30 trillion in 2023, for comparison.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists concurred and said past natural disasters offer clues for what to expect.\n\nThey foresee a 0.2 percentage point drag on first-quarter growth assuming that is not offset by rebuilding-related activity. Job growth in January is likely to be reduced by between 15,000 and 25,000 positions as a result of the fires, a relatively modest amount of drag in an economy that added 256,000 jobs in December, driven by the fact that only about 0.5% of California residents were under some form of evacuation order.\n\nGoldman Sachs forecasters do not expect the fires to push up immediate claims for unemployment insurance either.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts are roughly on the same page and project between a 20,000 and 40,000 drag on job creation levels. They note inflation pressures as measured by the consumer price index stripped of food and energy costs are likely to be four to nine basis points higher on fire impacts.\n\n\u201cThe shock seems to be on core goods prices, particularly, on used and new cars,\u201d the Morgan Stanley forecasters noted. \u201cWe find evidence of stronger used and new car inflation after wildfires\u201d based in similar disasters, while \"core goods ex-autos does not seem to be meaningfully affected.\u201d\n\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s Reinhart said \u201cwe expect localized upward pressure on rents, construction supplies, and residential construction labor, but limited national effects.\u201d\n\nThe relatively contained national economic impact of the California fires comes as the U.S. economy is entering 2025 on a strong footing and sticky levels of inflation. That said, the disaster adds to what was already a heightened level of economic uncertainty with the return of Donald Trump as president, having campaigned on a platform of huge tariff increases and the widespread deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nReporting by Michael S.

Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

            "article_content": "The 29th Traditional Beijing New Year Goods Fair opens to visitors at the National Agricultural Exhibition Center on Jan 3, 2025 attracting eager shoppers. LI ZHIMING/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nMany famous people were born in the Year of the Snake. There's Polish astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), a major figure in the \"scientific revolution\", who established that Earth revolved around the sun, not the other way around. Then there's the greatest of German literary figures, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\n\nBut let's talk about years, not people. One of the traditions of the Year of the Snake in China is transformation. There have been plenty of bad \"snake\" years. One is reminded of the Great Depression and the Wall Street Crash of (October) 1929. Another year I would like to mention is 2001. It was the year when the Sept 11 terrorist attacks on the United States took place. It was also the year when China joined the World Trade Organization \u2014 which helped expedite China's economic development and integrate its economy with the global economy.\n\nLooking back at the past year, two trends stand out for me. One is the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East. The region is seeing a genocide being committed by the Israeli state, witnessed in real time on TV screens across the world. And the US is complicit in this genocide, with its global standing going down drastically, even in parts of the West. On the other hand, apart from the West and a few US ally countries, China's standing has improved across the world, because it has stood with the ordinary people against the Israeli and American ruling elite.\n\nThe other development is the continuing rise of BRICS, along with China's rising economic status throughout the world. The year 2024 saw the addition of several major countries to BRICS, with Indonesia becoming the first country to join the grouping in the first days of 2025.\n\nThe rise of BRICS frightens the US elite, because it symbolizes the loss of their global economic dominance because of the decline of the US dollar as the principal international reserve currency. Although the decline of the dollar is an ongoing process, the year 2024 saw the acceleration of the process.\n\nSo what about 2025? I believe it will be a good year for China. Of course, we have to take into account Donald Trump's return to the White House after four years and his threat to impose high tariffs on imports from China, as well as other countries.\n\nIf Trump imposes punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, I believe he will cause more damage to the US than China. Looking at recent history, we can clearly see that the Chinese people's spirit of independence and self-reliance is very strong. They will not cave in under the pressure of punitive US tariffs.\n\nSelf-reliance is a major part of Chinese culture, which has influenced China's development. The other features include the emphasis on education and resolving problems harmoniously. Despite the bad periods in China's history, Chinese people's resilience, fighting spirit and industriousness have seen them through many a crisis. Three factors stand out in all this.\n\nThe first is the Chinese people's love for peace. Contrary to what the Western media say, I regard China as a peace-loving country. Unlike the US, which has been at war throughout its entire history, China avoids war. The century of humiliation taught it that a country is better off strong than weak. However, that does not mean it wants war.\n\nThe second factor is China's emphasis on reducing pollution and moving toward a sustainable, green economy. China's leadership of the green revolution over the last few years has been extremely impressive. The country is now the global leader in electric vehicles (EVs), and solar and wind energy. This is a remarkable achievement, and shows China is sensitive to the dangers that climate change poses to our world.\n\nSome Western countries have recently accused China of \"over-production\" of EVs, which are important to build a sustainable, green world in the future. However, the Western countries have targeted China because they are afraid that they will lose their market share of vehicles to China. But their attitude is mean considering how important EVs are to sustainable living. More importantly, these countries don't mind dominating markets through \"over-production\" when it suits them.\n\nThe third factor is China's technological advancement. China's scientific prowess before the \"scientific revolution\" beginning in the 16th century was unsurpassed in the world. But after that, China failed to advance like the West. But those days are over, with China catching up with the West in terms of technology and in some ways even eclipsing the West.\n\nIn space research, China has moved ahead so fast that it became the first country to bring lunar rock samples from the far side of the moon. And despite Western attempts to hold it back, Huawei remains a global leader in innovative telecommunications.\n\nChina is a global leader also in artificial intelligence. Despite the controversy over the rapid development of AI and its implications on human society, its importance in the world is undeniable. Plus, AI will be a major determinant of the global geopolitical order.\n\nThe geostrategic balance of power in the world has changed greatly in the last half a century, in China's favor. China faces some major problems, economic and environmental, as do other countries. But the Chinese people seem to be overcoming their problems more sensibly and calmly than others. I think it is largely due to their culture of education, harmony, peace and rationality. I expect the coming Year of the Snake to see further Chinese advancement.\n\nThe author is a Sinologist and an emeritus professor at Griffith University in Australia.
