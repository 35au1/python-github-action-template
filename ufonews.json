        "article_content": "Silent Hill 2 is renowned for a lot of reasons, and its multiple endings with their various ending conditions are one of those reasons. Back in 2001, it took a good while for people to actually figure out the math behind each ending, but it looks as though Bloober Team\u2019s Silent Hill 2 endings are a little easier to crack this time around.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nThat said, there are still a few specifics regarding each ending that need ironing out, and we\u2019re still trying to track down a few things. We\u2019ll update this guide as and when we learn more, but be sure to let us know if you uncover anything interesting! Without further ado, here\u2019s our Silent Hill 2 remake endings guide.\n\nSilent Hill 2 remake endings guide\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s worth noting that during your first playthrough of Silent Hill 2, you will only be able to unlock one of the three original endings: Leave, In Water, or Maria.\n\nOn a second playthrough in New Game Plus, you will then have the opportunity to unlock three additional endings: Rebirth, Dog, and UFO.\n\nOn top of that, Bloober Team has also added new endings to the game which we are still currently trying to figure out. Though, we will note everything we know about them so far either way.\n\nSilent Hill 2 Leave ending\n\nThe Leave ending is what most Silent Hill 2 players will wind up with. It sees James finally accept his actions and ultimately exit Silent Hill for good.\n\nTo get the Leave ending, all you need to do is keep James patched up with medical supplies throughout the game, and do not check on Maria at any point in the hospital or the Labyrinth. You then also want to listen to all of the sick-bed dialogue in the long hallway towards the end of the game. You essentially want to act as though James\u2019 only priorities are staying alive and finding Mary.\n\nYou can look at Mary\u2019s Photo or Letter in your inventory, but to be certain you get this ending, I would recommend not looking at either item more than once or twice. Similarly, do not look at Angela\u2019s Knife either.\n\nI\u2019m not 100% certain whether the following influences your ending, but to be sure, I would also take Personal Items into the Employee Elevator at Lake View Hotel with you. These are the only things you can take without going over the weight limit.\n\nTo summarize, here\u2019s what you need to do (or not do) to get the Leave ending:\n\nDO keep James healed.\n\nDO NOT interact with or check on Maria at the hospital or the Labyrinth.\n\nDO NOT look at Angela\u2019s Knife.\n\nDO take Personal Items into the hotel\u2019s Employee Elevator with you.\n\nDO listen to the entirety of the sick-bed dialogue in the long hallway towards the end of the game.\n\nSilent Hill 2 In Water ending\n\nThe In Water ending is another ending that players can quite easily end up with in Silent Hill 2. It essentially sees James playing as though he has some kind of death wish, and well\u2026 you should see for yourself how this ending unfolds, if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nTo get the In Water ending in Silent Hill 2, all you need to do is keep James at low health where possible and examine Angela\u2019s Knife multiple times, as well as listen to the sick-bed dialogue in the long hallway towards the end of the game.\n\nTo summarize, here\u2019s what you need to do (or not do) to get the In Water ending:\n\nDO keep James at low health.\n\nDO look at Angela\u2019s Knife multiple times.\n\nDO NOT look at Mary\u2019s Photo or Letter more than once or twice.\n\nDO listen to the entirety of the sick-bed dialogue in the long hallway towards the end of the game.\n\nAs a side note for achievement hunters, I played the whole game with the intention of getting the Leave ending. After reaching the Employee Elevator at Lake View Hotel though, I opted to look at Angela\u2019s Knife and stop healing James, which resulted in me getting the In Water ending. So, if you\u2019re looking to try and experience multiple endings using the same save file, this is a good turning point to reload from for either the Leave or In Water ending.\n\nSilent Hill 2 Maria ending\n\nThe Maria ending in Silent Hill 2 is what players who spend plenty of time with Maria will end up with. You essentially want to prioritize looking after Maria over finding Mary.\n\nTo get the Maria ending in Silent Hill 2, you want to neglect Mary\u2019s Photo and Letter entirely, check on Maria whenever you have the opportunity to do so, and skip the latter half of the sick-bed dialogue in the long hallway at the end of the game.\n\nTo summarize, here\u2019s what you need to do (or not do) to get the Maria ending:\n\nDO check on Maria in the hospital and the Labyrinth.\n\nDO NOT look at Mary\u2019s Photo or Letter in your inventory.\n\nDO NOT listen to all of the sick-bed dialogue in the long hallway at the end of the game.\n\nDO NOT take Personal Items into the hotel\u2019s Employee Elevator with you.\n\nDO protect Maria from any damage.\n\nThe final point about the Employee Elevator is not something I am certain of, but it is what I did during my run in which I attained the Maria ending. Better safe than sorry!\n\nSilent Hill 2 Rebirth ending\n\nThe Rebirth ending in Silent Hill 2 can only be accessed during a New Game Plus run of the game. This ending requires you to find four items around the game and then complete the game as you would normally, by defeating the final boss. Provided these four key items are in your inventory, you will get the Rebirth ending.\n\nHere's where you can expect to find the White Chrism. | Image credit: Bloober Team/VG247\n\nThe four items you need, and where you can find them, are as follows:\n\nBook of Crimson Ceremony - found in the graveyard where you first meet Angela, to the right of the area.\n\n- found in the graveyard where you first meet Angela, to the right of the area. White Chrism - found in front of Baldwin Mansion, accessible after exiting Jack\u2019s Inn with Maria.\n\n- found in front of Baldwin Mansion, accessible after exiting Jack\u2019s Inn with Maria. Obsidian Goblet - found inside of Silent Hill Historical Society, in a small cubby adjacent to the painting of Pyramid Head.\n\n- found inside of Silent Hill Historical Society, in a small cubby adjacent to the painting of Pyramid Head. Book of Lost Memories - found in the Lost and Found room on 1F of Lake View Hotel.\n\nSilent Hill 2 Dog ending\n\nThe Dog ending in Silent Hill 2 is one of two \u2018for fun\u2019 endings available in New Game Plus, conjured up by Team Silent, with Mira the Dog being almost as iconic as James Sunderland.\n\nTo access the Dog ending in the Silent Hill 2 remake, you need to collect two Broken Key Parts, combine them with one another, and then use the key to unlock the Observatory Room in Lake View Hotel (this is next to Room 312).\n\nAcquire the first broken key part from the pet store in East South Vale. | Image credit: Bloober Team/VG247\n\nThe first Broken Key Part is found in a pet store just north of Big Jay\u2019s in East South Vale at the beginning of the game. The shutter for this is down on your first run, and only opens in New Game Plus. The Broken Key Part is found in the back room.\n\nGo through this gate to find a doghouse with the second broken key part. | Image credit: Bloober Team/VG247\n\nThe second Broken Key Part is found on Katz St. in West South Vale, accessible after exiting Jack\u2019s Inn with Maria. In the east of the area, near Baldwin Mansion, look for a door with dogbone on it that\u2019s on the north side of the street.\n\nOnce you have both Key Parts, combine them and use the functioning Dog Key to unlock the Observatory Room beside Room 312 in Lake View Hotel. Have fun!\n\nSilent Hill 2 UFO ending\n\nThe UFO ending is the second \u2018for fun\u2019 ending available in New Game Plus runs of Silent Hill 2. To unlock this ending, you want to pay a visit to the Jeweller\u2019s store north of Big Jay\u2019s in East South Vale at the beginning of the game.\n\nFortunately, the Jeweller\u2019s also happens to be right beside the pet store. Smash the windows of the Jeweller\u2019s to be able to grab the Blue Gem from a case.\n\nYou then need to use this item in three different areas to unlock the ending. These areas are pointed out to you by a sci-fi sound effect that plays whenever you enter them. When that happens, investigate the Blue Gem in your inventory; if it glows, then you\u2019re using it in the right place.\n\nThe areas you need to investigate the Blue Gem at are as follows:\n\nThe rooftop of Saul Street Apartments, as you exit the building.\n\nThe pier at Rosewater Park, where you first meet Maria.\n\nNot yet known or confirmed, but in the original game, this was in Room 312 of Lake View Hotel. A note in East South Vale also refers to using this at the hotel.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, enjoy your rendezvous with some aliens.\n\nSilent Hill 2 remake new endings\n\nWhile Silent Hill 2 typically has six endings, Bloober Team has advised that new endings have been added to the game. At the conclusion of any of your runs, you'll find that in your stats, the 'Endings' section will detail that there are eight endings in total to find. Two of these are new, and we're yet to figure them out.\n\nImage credit: Bloober Team/VG247\n\nIn New Game Plus, however, you can find the Key of Sorrow at the very beginning of the game. I\u2019m assuming that this item is tied to a new ending, but I am yet to figure out where to use it. There's also a chance that this item only appears if you have unlocked the In Water ending, but I am still confirming this.\n\nJust beyond Nathan Avenue, after you leave Best Auto Parts and go past the gate where James would get the Wooden Plank and Radio in the original game, there\u2019s a green car. If you smash all the windows of this car using the Chainsaw, you\u2019ll acquire the Key of Sorrow here.\n\nIf you figure out where to use this item, be sure to let us know!\n\nFor more on Silent Hill 2, take a look at our walkthrough of the game, as well as our spoiler-free review."

'Even with marijuana she will f***ing find it and get rid of it.'\n\nOn the podcast, Ozzy also revealed how he tried enough ketamine 'to spark him' after he was offered the medical sleep drug at a surgery.\n\n'I went to a doctor recently and started to have this ketamine,' he explained.\n\n'He put a tiny bit in me, but that was enough to spark me. That thing came back and weighted my brain.'\n\nHe confessed that while he stopped attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, he now questions if that was the correct decision.\n\nHe said: 'If you are out there and you are using dope and you want to get off, there is plenty of help.\n\n'AA is a 12-step programme.

He said micro-dosing would not work for him.\n\nThe rock and roll legend admitted that during the height of his fame in the 1970s, he felt he could not 'do a thing creatively sober'.\n\n'I was the king of the world, a rock star and I had the biggest party ever. The thing is, I never thought I could do a f***ing thing of creativity (if I was sober).'\n\nOzzy has previously admitted he feels like he should have died years before some of his late 'drinking buddies' following a battle with booze and drugs.\n\nHe said he questions why he is still alive.\n\nOzzy discussed how he feels about outliving his friends, including Motorhead star Lemmy and UFO bass player Pete Way, who he performed with in the eighties.\n\nHe said: 'I've been doing a lot of reflection while I've been laid up, and all my drinking partners, I've realised they're all f*ing dead.\n\n'I should have been dead before loads of them. Why am I the last man standing? Sometimes I look in the \u00admirror and go, 'Why the f*k did you make it?'.\n\nOzzy has previously admitted he feels like he should have died years before some of his late 'drinking buddies' following a battle with booze and drugs\n\nHe said he now questions why he is still alive (pictured in 2018)\n\n'I should have been dead a thousand times. I've had my stomach pumped God knows how many times.'\n\nOzzy, who has sold more than 100million records throughout his illustrious career, announced earlier this year his plans to retire from touring.\n\nThe British musician was diagnosed with a mild form of Parkinson's disease in 2003, however he only went public with the condition in 2020.\n\nOzzy has said that his biggest struggles are due to a fall which he suffered in 2019 which caused metal rods in his back to dislodge.\n\nThe rods had been put there following a quad bike accident at his Buckinghamshire home in 2003.\n\nHe told Rolling Stone UK magazine: 'The second surgery went drastically wrong and virtually left me crippled.\n\n'I thought I'd be up and running after the second and third, but with the last one they put a f*ing rod in my spine.\n\n'They found a tumour in one of the vertebrae, so they had to dig all that out too.

        "article_content": "If you have an idea for the next big Apple iOS application, or just like to build something you have in mind for your own personal use. You will be pleased to know that creating an iOS app has become more accessible than ever before and you do not even need to know how to code. Thanks to the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, the journey from concept to deployment has been significantly streamlined. This comprehensive guide by Greg Isenberg explores how AI can transform your app development process, focusing on key areas such as prototyping, essential development tools, and the crucial role of community feedback.\n\nTransforming Prototyping with AI\n\nPrototyping stands as a cornerstone in the app development process, particularly when it comes to effectively communicating ideas in business and marketing contexts. AI-powered tools have emerged as fantastic options, allowing you to craft sophisticated app mockups without the need for extensive coding knowledge.\n\nThese intelligent tools offer several advantages:\n\nRapid visualization of concepts\n\nEasy iteration and refinement of ideas\n\nReduced time from concept to visual prototype\n\nEnhanced collaboration with stakeholders\n\nBy using AI in the prototyping phase, you can quickly transform abstract ideas into tangible visual representations. This allows for faster decision-making and more efficient use of resources before committing to full-scale development.\n\nMaximizing Xcode and Swift Potential\n\nXcode remains the foundation of iOS app development, providing a robust and comprehensive environment for building sophisticated applications. Swift, the programming language used within Xcode, offers a perfect blend of intuitiveness and power, making it accessible to developers across various skill levels.\n\nThe integration of AI tools with Xcode opens up new possibilities:\n\nAutomated code suggestions and completions\n\nIntelligent debugging assistance\n\nPerformance optimization recommendations\n\nEnhanced code refactoring capabilities\n\nThese AI-driven features not only accelerate the development process but also contribute to producing cleaner, more efficient code. As a result, you can focus more on creative problem-solving and less on repetitive coding tasks.\n\nBuilding Apple iOS app with AI\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of coding using artificial intelligence :\n\nNavigating the App Development Journey\n\nWhen embarking on your app development journey, starting with a simple, focused application is often the most effective approach. Consider beginning with a straightforward one-page app, such as a note-taking application. This approach allows you to:\n\nGrasp fundamental iOS development concepts\n\nUnderstand data storage mechanisms on iOS devices\n\nGain hands-on experience with user interface design\n\nLearn the basics of app deployment and testing\n\nBy initially focusing on local data storage, you can sidestep the complexities of backend setups, allowing for a more streamlined learning process. Testing your app on personal devices is a crucial step in this journey, allowing you to identify and address issues early in the development cycle.\n\nOvercoming Challenges and Seizing Opportunities\n\nWhile publishing apps on the App Store can present challenges due to stringent policies, the development and testing phases offer significant opportunities for growth and refinement. AI tools play a pivotal role in this process by:\n\nAccelerating the prototyping and iteration cycles\n\nProviding data-driven insights for feature optimization\n\nOffering predictive analysis for potential user engagement\n\nAutomating certain aspects of quality assurance testing\n\nThese AI-driven capabilities allow you to refine your app\u2019s features swiftly and efficiently, ensuring a higher quality product when it comes time for App Store submission.\n\nEnhancing Design with Vzer and AI\n\nVzer has emerged as an indispensable tool in the app developer\u2019s arsenal, particularly for crafting intuitive interfaces and compelling landing pages. Its ability to assist the forking and sharing of prototypes fosters a collaborative environment conducive to rapid iteration and improvement.\n\nAI integration in design tools like Vzer offers several benefits:\n\nGeneration of innovative design concepts\n\nAutomated layout suggestions based on best practices\n\nColor scheme recommendations for optimal user experience\n\nPredictive analysis of user interaction patterns\n\nBy using these AI-powered features, you can significantly enhance both the aesthetic appeal and functional design of your app, leading to improved user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Community Feedback\n\nCommunity feedback stands as a critical component in the app development journey. Engaging with users throughout the development process helps ensure that the final product aligns closely with user needs and expectations. AI can enhance this process by:\n\nAnalyzing user feedback to identify common themes and priorities\n\nPredicting potential user reactions to proposed features\n\nFacilitating more targeted and efficient A/B testing\n\nAutomating the organization and categorization of user suggestions\n\nConsider implementing feature contests or beta testing programs to boost community involvement. This approach creates a collaborative environment where users feel invested in the app\u2019s success, leading to more loyal and engaged user base.\n\nFrom Concept to Reality: The AI-Powered Journey\n\nThe transition from initial idea to functional prototype represents a critical phase in app development. AI tools have democratized this process, making it accessible to individuals with diverse skill sets and backgrounds. By using AI throughout the development journey, you can:\n\nRapidly iterate on design concepts\n\nStreamline the coding process\n\nOptimize app performance more efficiently\n\nMake data-driven decisions about feature implementation\n\nThese AI-powered capabilities not only accelerate the development process but also contribute to creating more innovative, user-centric applications. As you embark on your iOS app development journey, remember that AI tools are not replacements for creativity and vision, but powerful allies that can help bring your unique ideas to life more efficiently and effectively.\n\nMedia Credit: Greg Isenberg\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Few people know the business better than Garman, whose last position before becoming CEO was as senior VP for AWS sales, marketing, and global services.\n\nGarman told me in an interview last week that he hasn\u2019t made any massive changes to the organization yet. \u201cNot a ton has changed in the organization. The business is doing quite well, so there\u2019s no need to do a massive shift on anything that we\u2019re focused on,\u201d he said. He did, however, point out a few areas where he thinks the company needs to focus and where he sees opportunities for AWS.\n\nReemphasize startups and fast innovation\n\nOne of those, somewhat surprisingly, is startups. \u201cI think as we\u2019ve evolved as an organization. \u2026 Early on in the life of AWS, we focused a ton on how do we really appeal to developers and startups, and we got a lot of early traction there,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd then we started looking at how do we appeal to larger enterprises, how do we appeal to governments, how do we appeal to regulated sectors all around the world? And I think one of the things that I\u2019ve just reemphasized \u2014 it\u2019s not really a change \u2014 but just also emphasize that we can\u2019t lose that focus on the startups and the developers. We have to do all of those things.\u201d\n\nThe other area he wants the team to focus on is keeping up with the maelstrom of change in the industry right now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really emphasizing with the team just how important it is for us to continue to not rest on the lead we have with regards to the set of services and capabilities and features and functions that we have today \u2014 and continue to lean forward and building that roadmap of real innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the reason that customers use AWS today is because we have the best and broadest set of services. The reason that people lean into us today is because we continue to have, by far, the industry\u2019s best security and operational performance, and we help them innovate and move faster. And we\u2019ve got to keep pushing on that roadmap of things to do. It\u2019s not really a change, per se, but it is the thing that I\u2019ve probably emphasized the most: Just how important it is for us to maintain that level of innovation and maintain the speed with which we\u2019re delivering.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked him if he thought that maybe the company hadn\u2019t innovated fast enough in the past, he argued that he doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cI think the pace of innovation is only going to accelerate, and so it\u2019s just an emphasis that we have to also accelerate our pace of innovation, too. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re losing it; it\u2019s just that emphasis on how much we have to keep accelerating with the pace of technology that\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI at AWS\n\nWith the advent of generative AI and how fast technologies are changing now, AWS also has to be \u201cat the cutting edge of every single one of those,\u201d he said.\n\nShortly after the launch of ChatGPT, many pundits questioned if AWS had been too slow to launch generative AI tools itself and had left an opening for its competitors like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. But Garman thinks that this was more perception than reality. He noted that AWS had long offered successful machine learning services like SageMaker, even before generative AI became a buzzword. He also noted that the company took a more deliberate approach to generative AI than maybe some of its competitors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been looking at generative AI before it became a widely accepted thing, but I will say that when ChatGPT came out, there was kind of a discovery of a new area, of ways that this technology could be applied. And I think everybody was excited and got energized by it, right? \u2026 I think a bunch of people \u2014 our competitors \u2014 kind of raced to put chatbots on top of everything and show that they were in the lead of generative AI,\u201d he said.\n\nI think a bunch of people \u2014our competitors \u2014 kind of raced to put chatbots on top of everything and show that they were in the lead of generative AI.\n\nInstead, Garman said, the AWS team wanted to take a step back and look at how its customers, whether startups or enterprises, could best integrate this technology into their applications and use their own differentiated data to do so. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want a platform that they can actually have the flexibility to go build on top of and really think about it as a building platform as opposed to an application that they\u2019re going to adapt. And so we took the time to go build that platform,\u201d he said.\n\nFor AWS, that platform is Bedrock, where it offers access to a wide variety of open and proprietary models. Just doing that \u2014 and allowing users to chain different models together \u2014 was a bit controversial at the time, he said. \u201cBut for us, we thought that that\u2019s probably where the world goes, and now it\u2019s kind of a foregone conclusion that that\u2019s where the world goes,\u201d he said. He said he thinks that everyone will want customized models and bring their own data to them.\n\nBedrock, Garman said, is \u201cgrowing like a weed right now.\u201d\n\nOne problem around generative AI he still wants to solve, though, is price. \u201cA lot of that is doubling down on our custom silicon and some other model changes in order to make the inference that you\u2019re going to be building into your applications [something] much more affordable.\u201d\n\nAWS\u2019 next generation of its custom Trainium chips, which the company debuted at its re:Invent conference in late 2023, will launch toward the end of this year, Garman said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited that we can really turn that cost curve and start to deliver real value to customers.\u201d\n\nOne area where AWS hasn\u2019t necessarily even tried to compete with some of the other technology giants is in building its own large language models. When I asked Garman about that, he noted that those are still something the company is \u201cvery focused on.\u201d He thinks it\u2019s important for AWS to have first-party models, all while continuing to lean into third-party models as well. But he also wants to make sure that AWS\u2019 own models can add unique value and differentiate, either through using its own data or \u201cthrough other areas where we see opportunity.\u201d\n\nAmong those areas of opportunity is cost, but also agents, which everybody in the industry seems to be bullish about right now. \u201cHaving the models reliably, at a very high level of correctness, go out and actually call other APIs and go do things, that\u2019s an area where I think there\u2019s some innovation that can be done there,\u201d Garman said. Agents, he says, will open up a lot more utility from generative AI by automating processes on behalf of their users.\n\nQ, an AI-powered chatbot\n\nAt its last re:Invent conference, AWS also launched Q, its generative AI-powered assistant. Right now, there are essentially two flavors of this: Q Developer and Q Business.\n\nQ Developer integrates with many of the most popular development environments and, among other things, offers code completion and tooling to modernize legacy Java apps.\n\n\u201cWe really think about Q Developer as a broader sense of really helping across the developer life cycle,\u201d Garman said. \u201cI think a lot of the early developer tools have been super focused on coding, and we think more about how do we help across everything that\u2019s painful and is laborious for developers to do?\u201d\n\nAt Amazon, the teams used Q Developer to update 30,000 Java apps, saving $260 million and 4,500 developer years in the process, Garman said.\n\nQ Business uses similar technologies under the hood, but its focus is on aggregating internal company data from a wide variety of sources and make that searchable through a ChatGPT-like question-and-answer service. The company is \u201cseeing some real traction there,\u201d Garman said.\n\nShutting down services\n\nWhile Garman noted that not much has changed under his leadership, one thing that has happened recently at AWS is that the company announced plans to shut down some of its services. That\u2019s not something AWS has traditionally done all that often, but this summer, it announced plans to close services like its web-based Cloud9 IDE, its CodeCommit GitHub competitor, CloudSearch, and others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a cleanup kind of a thing where we looked at a bunch of these services, where either, frankly, we\u2019ve launched a better service that people should move to, or we launched one that we just didn\u2019t get right,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd, by the way, there\u2019s some of these that we just don\u2019t get right and their traction was pretty light. We looked at it and we said, \u2018You know what? The partner ecosystem actually has a better solution out there and we\u2019re just going to lean into that.\u2019 You can\u2019t invest in everything. You can\u2019t build everything. We don\u2019t like to do that. We take it seriously if companies are going to bet their business on us supporting things for the long term. And so we\u2019re very careful about that.\u201d\n\nAWS and the open source ecosystem\n\nOne relationship that has long been difficult for AWS \u2014 or at least has been perceived to be difficult \u2014 is with the open source ecosystem. That\u2019s changing, and just a few weeks ago, AWS brought its OpenSearch code to the Linux Foundation and the newly formed OpenSearch Foundation.\n\nWe love open source. We lean into open source. I think we try to take advantage of the open source community and be a huge contributor back to the open source community.\n\n\u201cI think our view is pretty straightforward,\u201d Garman said when I asked him how he thinks of the relationship between AWS and open source going forward. \u201cWe love open source. We lean into open source. I think we try to take advantage of the open source community and be a huge contributor back to the open source community. I think that\u2019s the whole point of open source \u2014 benefit from the community \u2014 and so that is the thing that we take seriously.\u201d\n\nHe noted that AWS has made key investments into open source and open sourced many of its own projects.\n\n\u201cMost of the friction has been from companies who originally started open source projects and then decided to kind of un-open source them, which I guess, is their right to do. But you know, that\u2019s not really the spirit of open source. And so whenever we see people do that, take Elastic as the example of that, and OpenSearch [AWS\u2019s ElasticSearch fork] has been quite popular. \u2026 If there\u2019s Linux [Foundation] project or Apache project or anything that we can lean into, we want to lean into it; we contribute to them. I think we\u2019ve evolved and learned as an organization how to be a good steward in that community and hopefully that\u2019s been noticed by others.\u201d"

Eight real-world examples two years on from ChatGPT A study in the US says that 24% of workers are already using generative AI. Data expert Kiko Llaneras explains how he uses the technology Una imagen de la aplicaci\u00f3n 'Raycast', que permite usar diferentes chatbots IA, como GPT-4o, Llama o Claude\n\nTwo years have almost passed since the launch of ChatGPT, the debut that launched the race for generative AI. Tech giants are competing to develop the best models. Meta is doing it with Llama, Google with Gemini, Anthropic with Claude and OpenAI with GPT-4o. The past few months have seen gigantic investments, as demonstrated by Nvidia\u2019s surge in the stock market. This company \u2014 which designs the hardware for these AIs \u2014 has seen its value increase fivefold. The promise of AI is undeniable. But at the same time, there is a question that haunts me: once the initial curiosity is over, are we using generative AI? Apparently so. According to a study in August, 24% of American workers had used generative AI in the week they were interviewed. What\u2019s more, one in 10 had used it daily.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect it so many people to be using it. It normally takes years for a technology to be adopted. Years of trial and error until we discover where and how to make it useful. Do you remember, for example, PDAs? Before the success of the iPhone, there was a similar device that didn\u2019t take off: personal digital assistants. On paper, they looked like future smartphones \u2014 they had GPS, email, internet and Excel \u2014 but they didn\u2019t work well. The seed of success was there \u2014 the idea \u2014 but not the implementation, and although PDAs had their fans, they were never massively adopted.\n\nToday I wanted to talk about that: the first use of chatbots like ChatGPT.\n\nWhat am I doing with AI?\n\nI\u2019ve made a list of what I actually use AI for. Not experiments or tests, but a list of how I actually use these tools to solve a task that I simply want to do well and quickly.\n\nProgramming. I use Github Copilot, an auto-completion tool that works with R and RStudio, which is my programming language. How does it help me? If you don\u2019t program, think of it as the keyboard predictor on your phone, but instead of adding half a word in WhatsApp, it adds entire paragraphs.\n\nIn this video, you can see an example:\n\nGithub Copilot's AI can autocomplete your code and add matches, with name and color, line by line.\n\nWriting in another language. I use chatbots with Claude 3.5 or GPT-4o model as a kind of translation assistant \u2014 in both cases, I use the Raycast app. The advantage of a chatbot is that you can ask for changes in tone, and ask questions or suggestions: \u201cCan I use reach instead of scope?\u201d One caveat, though: these AIs have been trained to please, so much so that they make mistakes in order to contradict you.\n\nHelp with Excel or Google Spreadsheet. Chatbots with the Claude 3.5 or GPT-4o model also help me answer questions about spreadsheet formulas, regex, or how to change the wallpaper on my phone.\n\nQuick searches. For example, at the beginning of this article, I asked Claude when ChatGPT was launched. It looked it up on the internet and answered, providing links. Remember, it\u2019s important to be careful, since it is not always reliable. I advise you to always look at the links \u2014 just move the mouse over it, as in the video \u2014 to confirm the information.\n\nIn the video, you can see how to do this:\n\nClaude AI can search the internet. It is being used via the Raycast application\n\nExtracting data from tables. In my line of work, I often need data from a table that is sent to me in a photo or PDF. Instead of copying 100 numbers by hand, which could also easily lead to mistakes, I do the following: I take a screenshot, drag it to Claude, and ask it to extract the data into a CSV, which I can then paste anywhere. But a word of caution: I do this with small tables that I can verify.\n\nClaude AI can extract data from a table or graph passed as an image and return it as a CSV. It is being used via the Raycast application.\n\nGenerating simple data. An example from last week: I had a spreadsheet with the U.S. states, and I wanted to add the number of electoral votes in each state. I asked Claude. I copied my table and asked it to look up the data and add it. It did it, and I just had to check the information.\n\nChoosing emojis. A minor task, but one I use daily. Raycast has an emoji search engine, but instead of searching and then selecting one, I can type what I want. For example, for \u201csuper useful\u201d it suggests these emojis: \ud83d\udd27, \ud83c\udf1f and \ud83d\udca1. The video shows another example:\n\nUna IA escoge emojis para la frase \"El Pa\u00eds\"\n\nBrainstorming (with myself). I just asked one of these chatbots, \u201ctell me things that can be done with Claude or ChatGPT,\u201d and I used their list to remind me that I also use AI for Excel questions. The trick here is to ask AI chatbots things you already know. Its job is to help you remember. Then you take its suggestions and build on them with your ideas. For example, imagine I get asked for tips on making better charts. Six come to mind\u2026 and I draw a blank. I can then ask ChatGPT for another 20 possible suggestions. There will be bad ones, but some will spark an idea that I will express better and make my own.\n\nThis last example highlights a pattern: I currently use generative AI to produce information that I can verify, from memory or by easily checking. These tasks range from producing code to finding an appropriate emoji.\n\nHow are other people using AI\n\nThe most common tasks are similar to mine. That\u2019s according to the August study, and also my followers on X/Twitter, who responded to this question: they use ChatGPT to translate, summarize papers, look up definitions, to do searches, and above all, to program. There are extreme cases: Javier L\u00f3pez, the founder of Magnific, one of the first startups in the AI era, recently acquired by Freepick, said that 50% of the source code of his successful application was written by an AI.\n\nI have only found one exception. Many people use chatbots to write texts, but I don't. Maybe because writing is the core of my work?\n\nIn any case, these first uses are tentative. They depend both on the capacity of artificial intelligence, in its current state, and on the interest of the first users. What\u2019s more, adoption varies according to occupation. According to the previous study, the workers who are using generative AI the most are computer scientists and mathematicians (46%), followed by managers (46%) and people in finance (39%) and education (33%).\n\nIf generative AI ends up being widely adopted, what will we be doing with it in 10 years? I have no idea.\n\nThirty years of interest in technology, and the memory of PDAs, make me very cautious about making predictions. But I don\u2019t want to avoid giving an answer either: I think it is more likely to succeed than fail.\n\n\ud83e\uddf0 2. My apps\n\nSince I'm talking about software today, I've taken the opportunity to update the list of the applications I use the most. Essentially, I'm still using the same thing I used a year ago, which is always a good sign.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Generative AI. I\u2019m still using Raycast. The macOS Swiss Army knife is very useful, but it\u2019s also now my preferred interface to interact with AI chatbots like GPT or Claude. With the paid version, you can open a floating window and talk to different language models, generic or custom, with text and images.\n\n\ud83d\udcc6 Tasks. I\u2019ve been writing down my to-do list on my calendar for years. Why? This way I avoid long lists, because only three or four tasks fit into one day. I use the Fantastical app, although the idea is pretty simple: just look at your tasks and your available time at the same time.\n\n\ud83d\udcd4 I carry a notebook throughout the day. Although any notebook will do, I always carry the Maruman Mnemosyne, which has matte paper, tear-out pages, and rings to open it in two.\n\n\ud83d\udce5 Notes. I keep everything in the Apple\u2019s Notes app. That\u2019s where all my notes go, to be used soon or never (in separate folders). I also use it to write on my phone.\n\n\ud83d\udcad To think and organize ideas. I still use Workflowy.\n\n\ud83d\udcda To read. I\u2019m still using Reader.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f To write. I\u2019m still using Ulysses.\n\n\u2728 Other Apps. I like Snipd, Klack, Cleanshoot, Rize.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\nTu suscripci\u00f3n se est\u00e1 usando en otro dispositivo \u00bfQuieres a\u00f1adir otro usuario a tu suscripci\u00f3n?

We decided to do something fun and come out with our list of haunted pubs, bars and restaurants.\n\nOver the course of 2021 we visited and researched these amazing places! Some of the criteria we used to determine our list was history, ambiance, personal stories, our own experiences, atmosphere and the reported hauntings. The stories we heard from each of these locations was really interesting and we found out things we didn\u2019t know! We hope you enjoy and we recommend checking them out for yourself.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMost haunted bars and restaurant in Michigan\n\nTwo Way Inn, Detroit\n\nTwo Way Inn, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nBuilt in 1873 and known as Detroit\u2019s oldest bar, it opened as a saloon in 1876 and also served as a general store, stagecoach, railroad station, hotel, jail, dance hall, and possibly a brothel. During Prohibition, the Two Way was owned by a dentist, which is significant because doctors could prescribe up to a pint of whiskey every 10 days for pain under The Volstead Act. There have been several deaths in the building throughout its lifetime.\n\nOne of the apparitions reportedly seen here is a cowboy with a long white beard and cowboy hat, who many believe to be the spirit of Col. Philetus Norris, the building\u2019s former owner. He was not only a bar owner, but also a Union spy during the Civil War, an archaeologist and a superintendent at Yellowstone National Park.\n\nRelated: \ud83d\udd12 Detroit ghost hunters share 5 scariest paranormal experiences\n\nNancy Whiskey\u2019s, Detroit\n\nNancy Whiskey's, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nNancy Whiskey\u2019s dates back to 1902. According to staff and regulars, this 119-year-old pub is believed to be haunted by no fewer than three spirits. Some of the activity reported includes disembodied voices when staff are closing and all guests have left, mirrors breaking on their own, and much more.\n\nJust inside the doorway is an old phone booth, which was reportedly used by Jimmy Hoffa on a regular basis. It\u2019s also possible that members of the Digby family, who opened the general store on this site in 1902, still remain to this day.\n\nCadieux Cafe, Detroit\n\nCadieux Cafe, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Cadieux Cafe is one of Detroit\u2019s most well-known reportedly haunted locations. A pair of Belgian immigrants, Yvonne and Robert Devos, founded the cafe on Detroit\u2019s east side in the early 1930s. In its early days, it was a Prohibition-era speakeasy. The Devos family purchased it in 1962, and in 2018 it was purchased by Paul Howard, co-owner of Cliff Bell\u2019s, and musician John Rutherford.\n\nIt was famously showcased by Anthony Bourdain during a visit for his TV show \u201cNo Reservations.\u201d Some have seen an apparition that they believe to be Yvonne sitting at a table near the bar area. Others have seen her husband, Robert, in the basement of the cafe, as well as objects reportedly moving on their own throughout the building.\n\nAtwater in the Park, Grosse Pointe Park\n\nThe church the brewery is housed in opened in 1936. The building was once home to Grace United Church.\n\nAtwater in the Park, Grosse Pointe Park MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nPeople heard strange noises and odd occurrences while the church was being transformed into the brewery. Atwater in the Park opened in 2014, and a priest came out to bless the brewery soon afterward. Employees fear going in the basement, where the fermenters, liquor and various supplies are kept. The basement once housed a nursery school and daycare.\n\nShadow figures, children\u2019s disembodied voices and lights flickering on, a video capturing a dove shadow flying inside are a few of the paranormal experiences that have been reported\n\nRelated: \u2018Ghost\u2019 captured on camera during investigation at Atwater brewery in Michigan\n\nTommy\u2019s Bar and Grill, Detroit\n\nTommy's Bar and Grill, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nTommy\u2019s Detroit Bar is one of the city\u2019s most historic and reportedly haunted locations. Dating back to the mid-1800s, the building is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Road and served as a speakeasy during the prohibition era before it became Tom\u2019s Tavern in 1938.\n\nThe bar\u2019s owner, Tommy Burelle, says he\u2019s heard about and experienced plenty of unusual encounters in the building. One of the paranormal hot spots is the basement, which is where the hidden speakeasy was. Urban legend says the basement is also where a body was once buried by the mob.\n\nGandy Dancer, Ann Arbor\n\nGandy Dancer in Ann Arbor (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Gandy Dancer restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was originally a Michigan Central Train Depot dating back to 1886. Considered the finest station on the Michigan Central line when it was built, this building features heavy stone walls, deep-set, round-arched openings, large fireplaces and beautiful stained glass windows. It\u2019s also said to be haunted possibly due to some of the traumatic events of its past.\n\nIn Sept. 1940, some kids put a railroad spike on the tracks, which caused a freight train to derail, killing Walter Flinn. The train depot also was where American military members killed in action during several wars were unloaded. It\u2019s said that during WWI, the bodies of deceased soldiers who weren\u2019t claimed by their family were stored temporarily in the basement of the depot.\n\nEven today, the Gandy Dancer showcases much of its historical authenticity. Be sure to check it out when you\u2019re in the area.\n\nThe Whitney, Detroit\n\nThe Whitney in Detroit (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Whitney restaurant was built between 1890 and 1894 by a prominent lumber baron, David Whitney. It served as his families home until 1920. The Whitney is 21,000 square feet with 52 rooms (including 10 bathrooms) and 20 fireplaces. Our favorite spot is the Ghost Bar! It\u2019s also been long rumored to be haunted. We were lucky enough to investigate a few years ago and captured an \u201cavp\u201d of what we think is Grace Whitney in the carriage house. Listen close for Grace humming a tune.\n\nHuron River Inn, Rockwood\n\nHuron River Inn, Rockwood MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nHRI, once known as the Burton Manor & Tavern, was originally built in 1860 and operated through the Civil War Years. It was the center of social life in what was then called Huron Station (current day Rockwood). In the early 1900s, the Burton Manor caught fire and had to be rebuilt. In 1907, out of the ashes arose the Rockwood Hotel!\n\nHRI is well-known to be haunted. Staff and patrons have reported seeing the apparition of a woman in a bonnet sitting at the bar, as well as shadowy man standing in the old coal bin entry in the basement. There have also been reports of loud noises, children\u2019s laughter and unexplained footsteps running down the second floor hallway.\n\nWalldorff Brewpub, Hastings\n\nWalldorff Brewpub, Hastings MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nNow a brewery, this building dating back to 1866 has been many things throughout its lifetime, including a funeral home, hardware store, furniture shop, clothing retailer, and a drug & grocery store. Staff and guests have reported numerous paranormal encounters, including objects unexplainably flying off the bar on their own, lights coming on, being touched, shadow figures and much more.\n\nThe White Horse Inn, Metamora\n\nWhite Horse Inn (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe White Horse Inn dates back to 1848 and is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. It originally served as a general store, but throughout its lifetime has also been an inn, dance hall and now a restaurant. The building has quite a haunted reputation, with many reporting to hear the sound of boots walking across its second floor when no one is up there, doors slamming, lights flickering and more. Some have even seen apparitions, including those of a man in a 1940s tuxedo, an older man and a young girl.\n\nOne of the haunted legends says that a handful of patrons and a worker were killed in a fire in the front section of the bar. To this day, people in the bar continue to report hearing screams, possibly of those who perished in the fire.\n\nBone Heads BBQ, Willis\n\nBone Heads BBQ is known to be one of the most haunted places in the state. Now a bar/restaurant, the building dates back to around 1865 and previously served as coach stop, grainery, butcher shop, ice house, post office and general store. Numerous paranormal encounters have been reported by staff and guests.\n\nSome have seen apparitions near the host stand and bar, heard footsteps and whispers when others weren\u2019t present, and seen the apparition of a woman in a white dress walking down the stairs.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not known who all the spirits are at Bone Heads, there\u2019s one the owners and staff call Nellie, who they believe may have lived in the building in the early 20th century.\n\nBone Heads BBQ, Willis MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nLearn more about Detroit Paranormal Expeditions on their website here."

        "article_content": "CASPER \u2014 Who you gonna call in Wyoming when the door slams in an empty room and a mysterious disembodied voice whispers \u201cget out?\u201d\n\nCasper\u2019s Pete McDaniels.\n\nA longtime fan of the 1984 hit movie \u201cGhostbusters\u201d starring Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Harold Ramios McDaniels and his team of ragtag wranglers of all things supernatural are listed are on an official \u201cwhoyougonnacall.org\" website that lists paranormal investigators in each state.\n\nHe is one of 165 franchises nationwide, and the only listed in Wyoming.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole group of folks that use that movie to help people in their communities,\u201d McDaniels said.\n\nIn addition investigating potential hauntings, Casper\u2019s Ghostbusters do birthday parties, food drives, conventions, \u201ctrunk\u201d or treats and raises money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nLike the movies that feature iconic ghost-busting cars, McDaniels drives his own version of \u201cEcto-1,\u201d the famous converted ambulance with the unique whiney siren. It has similar paraphernalia on top and Ghostbusters stickers on the side.\n\nHe bought the 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor from someone in Glenrock a few years ago.\n\nA hospital security guard when not busting ghosts, McDaniels had his uniform on when he initially drove the unmodified car. Wyoming Highway Patrol pulled him over, thinking he might be trying to impersonate a police officer.\n\nGhostbuster Interceptor\n\n\u201cI thought I should probably make this car less cop like and more something fun. And I had always wanted to have a Ghostbusters car, so I started to put stickers on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell then I thought, now I\u2019ve got to build a top in it, it can\u2019t just be stickers right? So, I started piecing together bit by bit the roof rack and housing and built all that out. There is one piece of pipe up that\u2019s up there being held onto the roof by a toilet flange.\u201d\n\nOnce he had his wheels, as well as the \u201cECTOI\u201d license plate, the doors opened for him to use it for fundraisers and to market his ghost removal side gig.\n\nOctober becomes the busy season. There is a \u201cTouch a Truck\u201d event on Oct. 12 at the Excel Academy Private School that allows kids to get in the vehicle, turn on the sirens, read the special tag fastened on the dash that labels the machine as belonging to Wyoming Ghostbusters, and check out the glove compartment.\n\n\u201cThere is a ghostbuster\u2019s employee handbook and a little canister of ectoplasm slime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids like to play with all that stuff.\u201d\n\nHe also plans to be at a car show and food drive at the Izaak Walton Clubhouse in Casper on Oct. 18 and end the month on Oct. 25, 27 and 28 with actual ghostbusting demonstrations at the Casper Elks Lodge No. 1353 where he said the equipment used by paranormal investigators will be explained and a walk through of the lodge will be conducted.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m discussing a fundraiser for a lady that is trying to fight cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try and kind of use the car as a way to help people out.\u201d\n\nAs in the movie, McDaniels and some other members of the team have uniforms and he and a buddy have the proton packs used in the last version of the film series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the iconic part of Ghostbusters history, it gets people excited,\u201d he said.\n\nSupernatural Missions\n\nIn addition to the fundraising, and parties, McDaniels also has been on an estimated 15 missions to identify or remove potential paranormal spirits in places around the region and state.\n\nHe recently was called to a Casper home where the owners discovered a set of footprints on concrete that went from a pickup truck to the garage door and then just vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat it looked like was that somebody had walked through a puddle of grease, made about four or five steps to the garage door and then nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels pulled out his EMF meter that measures electro-magnetic energy and found it registered a few points over the footprints and faded when pulled away from them. He checked to see if there were any internet routers or other source of energy nearby that would trigger the meters. There were none.\n\nOther tools in his ghostbusting toolbox include REM-Pod devices that reflect electromagnetic field changes and air temperature changes and a specialized SLS (Structured Light Sensor) camera that uses infrared light. It can 3D map areas in front of it \u201cso we can see things the human eye might miss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also uses other cameras that can capture images in ultraviolet, infrared, and the normal spectrum of light.\n\nAt the garage, McDaniels set up some REM Pods around the area to see if anything would trigger them. Nothing happened. Photos with the infrared camera found nothing.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always that way. McDaniels tells the story of being called to a Casper home about five blocks from the cemetery with a man experiencing doors being slammed in his home for no reason.\n\n\u201cHe said he was sitting on the couch one day and he felt like his leg started to burn,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHe looked down and it looked like a handprint had been slapped on his thigh. So, we got to go down and work with that.\u201d\n\nThe man requested that McDaniels and his team bless the house. McDaniels said he has studied different spiritual beliefs including druidism and another team member is a Norse shaman.\n\nPeter McDaniels' version of Ecto-1 is a former police interceptor that he has adapted for his Ghostbuster gigs.

(Courtesy Peter McDaniels)\n\nThe Casper-based Ghostbuster mobile has been on missions across the state. (Courtesy Peter McDaniels) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nStubborn Spirit\n\nTheir attempts to get rid of the spirit by blessing the house did not work. He claims it was forced into a back room. McDaniels had read about a dybbuk box used in Jewish tradition that is supposed to be able to contain a spirit. So, he tried using one.\n\n\u201cWe kind of forced this thing into the dybbuk box and sealed it,\u201d he said. McDaniels said as he was talking to the man at the house, he placed the box by the front tire of his Ghostbuster car and the tire deflated. He had to pump it up to leave.\n\nThere was another hurdle as well. Weather at the time was cold and the ground hard, so he couldn\u2019t bury the box as would be his practice. So, he kept it in a storage area at his house. McDaniels noticed the wax seal that he put on the box kept cracking. He needed to keep sealing it nearly every day.\n\nThen his radio started to flip on in his house at random times and the song coming out of the speakers would have a lyric such as \u201cset me free\u201d or \u201clet me loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, no buddy, that\u2019s not how this works,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cAs soon as it was warm enough we went and buried the box and all of that stopped afterwards.\u201d\n\nHe said the man in the house never had issues again as well.\n\n\u2018Get Out\u2019\n\nThe 39-year-old talks about an incident several years ago when he went to a trailer in the \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d as he was receiving training from a woman he labels a \u201cChristian witch.\u201d\n\nThe trailer sat on a plot of land that was said to have had a Native American burial ground underneath it. He said he entered the trailer and it was dark and he was trying to feel his way around and made it to a bedroom and sat on the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of sitting there trying to feel things out and I felt the bed depress behind me like someone was standing on it and then I hear the words \u2018get out\u2019 whispered in my ear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, I calmly stood up, and I walked out the front door and I got into the car next to the lady that was helping us. And she said, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018nope,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt scared me, oh man, it scared me.\u201d\n\nDale Killingbeck can be reached at dale@cowboystatedaily.com."

        "article_content": "A trio of stars just under 5,000 light-years away has absolutely smashed a long standing record.\n\nTIC 290061484 is a system of gravitationally bound stars consisting of a tightly-orbiting binary pair with a third star that circles both. Astonishingly, they're so close together the entire system would fit inside the orbit of Mercury.\n\nAnd that's not all. The tight trio seems to have another friend; there are hints of a fourth star describing a path at a much greater distance.\n\nAll three of the stars in the central trinary are on a collision course, destined to collide, merge, go supernova, and leave behind a single neutron star, in around 20 million years.\n\nThe discovery was made using the TESS exoplanet-hunting space telescope, which is optimized for detecting the minute changes in the brightness of a star that indicate an orbiting world.\n\nSystems of stars that eclipse each other along our line of sight also demonstrate changes in brightness, as the stars pass in front of each other and block at least some of each other's light. TESS's observations can detect these brightness changes, too. This is a powerful tool for finding these systems, because, from the distance at which we see them, they usually just look like a single star.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nThis is the case with the central trinary of TIC 290061484. The orbital plane on which they are all aligned is pretty much edge-on to our line of sight, meaning that we're treated to different eclipse configurations as the three stars go about their cosmic dance.\n\nA team of scientists led by astrophysicist Veselin Kostov of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center discovered the system after an extensive analysis of TESS data. They used a machine learning algorithm to filter the data based on the expected signal of star system eclipses, and then set a tiny army of citizen scientists loose on the results to refine it further.\n\n\"We're mainly looking for signatures of compact multi-star systems, unusual pulsating stars in binary systems, and weird objects,\" says physicist Saul Rappaport of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"It's exciting to identify a system like this because they're rarely found, but they may be more common than current tallies suggest.\"\n\nOnce they had identified the system as one of interest, the researchers could then analyze the changes in its light to determine its characteristics.\n\nThe two stars making up the central binary clock in at 6.85 and 6.11 times the mass of the Sun, with an orbital period of just 1.8 days.\n\nThe third star has a mass of 7.9 times the Sun's and orbits the central pair with a period of 24.5 days. That period blows the previous known smallest trinary, with an orbital period of 33 days, out of the water.\n\nFinally, the probable fourth star would have a mass of about 6.01 times the mass of the Sun. It is estimated to circle the central trinary on a much, much wider orbit of about 3,200 days.\n\nStars are born from abnormally dense regions of matter within vast clouds of gas. Usually, such clouds are speckled with a number of baby stars, some of which drawing close enough to merge, others to spend their lives together locked in orbit.\n\nMost of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy are in systems like these. When you look up into the night sky, more than half the stars you see are actually multiple stars, too distant to discern.\n\nWe know there are multiple-star systems out there that we haven't yet identified. This discovery suggests that there may be many more out there than we imagined. The next step will be to turn the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope to the task of finding them, once it reaches the skies.\n\n\"Before scientists discovered triply eclipsing triple star systems, we didn't expect them to be out there,\" says astronomer Tam\u00e1s Borkovits of the Baja Observatory of The University of Szeged in Hungary. \"But once we found them, we thought, well why not? Roman, too, may reveal never-before-seen categories of systems and objects that will surprise astronomers.\"\n\nThe research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal."

The Jets enter this game after playing the Denver Broncos, who blitz more than any other team in the league. In second place? The Minnesota Vikings.\n\nAs a result, the way the Jets operated in Week 4 will likely be similar, to how they operate in London this Sunday.\n\nThe player who stood out most in their opportunities was Mike Williams, who caught 4 of his 5 targets and totaled 67 yards. With a current over/under set at 33.5 receiving yards, take the over (-115 on DraftKings Sportsbook ) and count on the veteran to help you cash it."

RB Breece Hall had just four yards on 10 carries, and Rodgers completed 57% of his throws.\n\nGetting the seemingly easy wins is important when you\u2019ve got the undefeated Vikings on the schedule.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s defense allows 15 points per game and the offense is scoring 29 points a week, ranking fourth in the NFL in both categories.\n\nIt\u2019s been a resurgent year for former Jets QB Sam Darnold. The 27-year-old has never thrown more than 19 touchdowns in a season and already has 11 through four games."

        "article_content": "Beginning in the late 2000s, tech enthusiasts and journalists \u2014 including the cofounders of Technical.ly \u2014 recognized that tech startup culture was spreading beyond Silicon Valley. They launched blogs and news sites to cover emerging communities in other cities.\n\n\n\nStorytelling is a crucial yet often overlooked component of building innovation ecosystems. It promotes local culture, connects communities and guides new participants, but remains the least addressed part of the \u201cInnovation Ecosystem Stack.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany dedicated local tech media outlets have struggled to survive in a crowded digital landscape. At the same time, there\u2019s a growing desire among innovation ecosystem leaders for their region\u2019s narrative to gain recognition \u2014 both within and beyond their immediate community.\n\nLooking back, I got plenty of grief as a 20-something journalist reporting on tech and startups in Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\nBack in 2008, neither the subject matter nor those cities were taken seriously. But two friends and I realized no newspaper would hire us, and we believed Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture was already spreading to other cities. The year prior, Wall Street Journal veterans launched AllThingsD to add journalistic rigor to tech startup coverage, which TechCrunch had begun in 2005.\n\nIt seemed clear that the rise of the internet, software and consumer electronics could be found anywhere there were enough smart, forward-thinking people. We weren\u2019t alone.\n\nFrom the late 2000s through the early 2010s, other under-employed journalists and tech enthusiasts started tracking local startup communities through spreadsheets, maps and social media. Many launched newsletters, blogs, and news sites \u2014 like Technical.ly.\n\nMost of these efforts have come and gone, reflecting the broader and ongoing challenges of the local news business. But as tech becomes more central to economic strategy, civic leaders are investing more in workforce and entrepreneurship programs. With local newsrooms shrinking, there are fewer places for people to follow those investments \u2014 and even fewer outlets to tell stories beyond their immediate community.\n\nThat\u2019s why the least solved part of what I call the \u201cInnovation Ecosystem Stack\u201d is storytelling \u2014 aka publishing narrative change about a specific scene. It\u2019s the role I want Technical.ly to play in more places (hmu if you wanna talk about it!).\n\nIn 2019, Technical.ly produced a report for the Kauffman Foundation on how local entrepreneurship communities were getting news and information. Five years and a pandemic later, I returned to that report and want to share what I see.\n\nWhat kind of storytelling do you want\u2026or is it a need?\n\nThe onset and effects of the pandemic reversed declines in entrepreneurship, underscored the need for digital access and reinforced demand for a STEM workforce. Every US state now has at least one organization focused on startups or technology \u2014 or both.\n\nWith growth comes complexity. In a community\u2019s early days, a few key connectors can serve as nodes of information. Eventually, startup and tech activity grow to a point where it\u2019s not possible for a few individual connectors to do this on their own. Rather than a problem, it\u2019s actually a sign of success.\n\nBy my count, however, there are currently less than two dozen dedicated publications focused on a given region\u2019s tech and startup issues.\n\nMost specialize only in startups and are based in a single market. A notable exception is BostInno, a startup blog founded in 2008 that was acquired in 2012 by American City Business Journals (ACBJ). The \u201cInno\u201d brand is now used for ACBJ\u2019s tech coverage across multiple markets, though much of it is behind a hard paywall.\n\nA few publishers, including Technical.ly, pair important information sharing with original reporting on hard-but-useful truths.\n\nThe biggest tech markets, Silicon Valley and New York City, are awash in national tech and business coverage, though they each have local resources too, like the San Jose Mercury\u2019s SiliconValley.com and AlleyWatch. Chicago\u2019s Crain\u2019s has built a well-liked tech vertical, and publications like GeekWire in Seattle and dot.LA in Los Angeles have emerged to serve their respective communities.\n\nSmaller hubs also use storytelling to connect local ecosystems: Around the same time we launched Technical.ly, Silicon Prairie News became a beloved resource across the Midwest, and in 2022 was donated to the Nebraska Journalism Trust, where it continues. The Research Triangle\u2019s local NBC affiliate has published its TechWire since 2002.\n\nLike Technical.ly today, all of those are independent news resources, offering distance from the people and organizations directly creating programming for startups. That\u2019s in contrast to respected efforts like Startland News in Kansas City and Refresh Miami in Florida, which are different in that they\u2019re entrepreneur support organizations that employ journalists.\n\nSeveral other efforts don\u2019t employ journalists at all, and most avoid challenging subject matter \u2014 like, say, a failing startup or touchy issues with elected officials.\n\nNo matter their provenance, all these publications share a common goal: to promote the local innovation culture and guide new entrants to the ecosystem. A few, including Technical.ly, go further by reporting on the hard truths and uncomfortable realities within the local scene.\n\nLocal startup news is easy to envision, hard to sustain\n\nWhile most local efforts focus on internal storytelling, many civic leaders want their innovation stories to reach outside their markets.\n\nThis can be a challenge for single-market publications, though good stories occasionally break through. In a recent survey, nearly a third of Technical.ly readers reported researching regions beyond their own.\n\nWith limited storytelling resources, local business and talent attraction executives often lump a variety of tactics under the \u201cstorytelling\u201d banner \u2014 including standalone websites with catchy slogans, splashy photos and flattering data. Some organizations have gone further, such as Milwaukee\u2019s chamber of commerce, which launched in 2022 its own standalone news site focused on startups.\n\nWhat most efforts overlook is how tough it is to sustain a media business.\n\nWith digital tools, the cost to start an online publication is effectively zero, but a crowded marketplace has spiraled the cost of growing an audience. Of roughly 150 regions with some entrepreneur or tech engagement strategy, fewer than 15% of regions have a dedicated news resource.\n\nThe best evidence of how difficult this work is can be found in the number of efforts that no longer exist. After changing ownership in 2018, Tech.co, founded as TechCocktail by Frank Gruber and Jen Consalvo, was turned into a tech review site. The erratic COVID era was especially challenging: Multi-local, biotech-focused Xconomy, Iowa-focused Clay&Milk and Midwest minded Mug.news all ceased publishing. And these were the strongest. Many more never got to their level of traction.\n\nFifteen years after launching Technical.ly, the beat\u2019s importance has grown. The examples of doing it well haven\u2019t."

        "article_content": "Huawei has a long and rich history of making excellent wearables, and its latest (and most expensive) model is the Huawei Watch Ultimate. Simply put, it may be the best smartwatch you\u2019re in danger of overlooking.\n\nI\u2019ve been wearing it for a few days, and am smitten by its unique style and simplicity of use.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Huawei Watch Ultimate is a whopper\n\nIn an effort to get you to part with 750 British pounds (about $983) for a smartwatch, Huawei has shifted away from the overt adventure-style design of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and leaned into the appeal of a luxury traditional watch. The size, shape, and design won\u2019t be for everyone, but if you want a smartwatch built from all the right materials and a look that laughs at subtlety, this will be for you.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of the Huawei Watch Ultimate script on the bezel or the weird golf ball design on the lugs, but the rest of the watch successfully separates itself from other expensive smartwatches. The seriously chunky case has a hewn-from-a-solid-block solidity to it, and if weight equates to luxury for you, then it\u2019s right there at the peak. It is made from a fancy zirconium-based liquid metal and feels very high quality, as do the three buttons on the case. Button presses are perfectly dampened and the feel is up there with the Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4, which is very high praise.\n\nThe ceramic bezel shines in the light, but doesn\u2019t rotate. The case back is also made from ceramic, and the rubber strap on the model I\u2019ve been wearing is flexible and comfortable, if not especially expensive-looking. Don\u2019t worry, though, as Huawei includes a titanium metal bracelet in the box.\n\nThe overriding design aspect is the Watch Ultimate\u2019s size. It\u2019s gigantic, even for someone who regularly wears Casio G-Shock watches. The 48mm case and its integrated lugs mean it stretches all the way across my 6.5-inch wrist, and because it\u2019s 13mm thick, it\u2019s not the easiest to slip under a cuff, either. It\u2019s bold and brash and not for the shy.\n\nSmooth startup\n\nThis is not the first Huawei smartwatch I\u2019ve used, but I\u2019m pleased to note how much smoother the installation and signup process has become since I last used one. You need the Huawei Health app, which is available to download from the iOS App Store, the Samsung Galaxy App Store, and the Huawei AppGallery. Note that Google Play is not included. This means that if you have an Android phone, you have to source Huawei Health through the AppGallery, which means downloading it first.\n\nThis took just moments using Huawei\u2019s website in Chrome, and I didn\u2019t need to create an account or sign in to get the Health app, which really cut down the necessary time and effort. Linking the Watch Ultimate was easy and only required scanning a QR code, but a software update did take about 30 minutes to install before I could use the watch. The watch then required access to notifications and location to operate, and everything was done. I\u2019ve had it connected to a Google Pixel 9 Pro, and it has been faultless.\n\nStreamlining the onboarding process makes a massive difference to the initial ownership experience, which has become complex and frustrating over the years. It\u2019s great to see how Huawei has made it all very simple. I\u2019ve also noticed notification support has been dramatically improved on Android, with all messages arriving instantly on the watch. Just don\u2019t expect to interact with the notifications unless you\u2019re using a Huawei phone. This aside, the Huawei Watch Ultimate is a pleasure from the moment you take it out of the box.\n\nGolf and adventure\n\nThere will be the hardcore golfer who would laugh at the atrocious weather conditions in the U.K. recently and hit the greens anyway. I\u2019m not that golfer, so I\u2019ve not had the chance to try out the golf features on the Huawei Watch Ultimate yet. It\u2019s an extensive list, with a dedicated app that tracks both courses and the driving range, along with an AI Caddie mode, shot distance data, and GPS-driven course and green recognition.\n\nI haven\u2019t been out on any expeditions either, another prominent feature of the Watch Ultimate. It\u2019s accessed using the button at the 10 o\u2019clock mark and includes waypoint marking and a guide-back system, so you don\u2019t get lost on longer hikes. I have used the Watch Ultimate to track a few walks, though, and the activity tracking is fast and simple to use. Plus, it finds a GPS signal exceptionally fast.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 3 Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nHuawei still insists on keeping voice guidance activated by default and at maximum volume, so it shouts out things like \u201cworkout started\u201d and your heart rate data during exercise. It\u2019s embarrassing and unnecessary, although I can see how it would be handy if you\u2019re cycling and can\u2019t easily look at your wrist. At all other times, though, it\u2019s a hateful interruption. You have to search for the volume control, which is found only after pressing the button at the 2 o\u2019clock mark. It also pauses the workout.\n\nScreen, software, and watch faces\n\nThe Huawei Watch Ultimate\u2019s big 1.5-inch AMOLED screen is really bright and easily seen outside, has a sharp 466 x 466-pixel resolution, and is covered by sapphire crystal. The smartwatch\u2019s software has been refined to the point where it\u2019s quick to learn and logical to use. One suggestion is that it\u2019s wise to switch the default watchOS-like app grid to a list view, which makes it much easier to find apps quickly. Like most other smartwatches, you swipe the screen to see tiles showing data like the weather, your steps, and quick-start exercise icons. A swipe up shows notifications.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge array of well-crafted watch faces, most of which have customizable complications and various ways to personalize the look, from color to the type of hands shown. Each face has an ambient mode, so the screen is never just blank, and the raise-to-wake feature is very fast and responsive. It means the watch is never frustrating, usually shows exactly what you want, and you rarely find yourself stuck searching for a feature in multiple confusing menus.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 3 Image used with permission by copyright holder Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nI\u2019m on my third day of use with all the health-tracking features enabled and the always-on screen active. I\u2019ve also tracked two short walks, and the battery shows 79% remaining. I haven\u2019t tracked sleep as, although the Watch Ultimate is comfortable to wear, it feels awkwardly large to wear at night. Huawei claims the battery will last between four and eight days on a single charge with these settings, which seems achievable, or up to 14 days with light use.\n\nDon\u2019t overlook the Watch Ultimate\n\nLets recap. The Huawei Watch Ultimate is made of high-quality materials and has a unique and stylish design, software that makes sense and is easy to use, various unique features, and a battery that can last for a week between charges (depending on your use). It even works with both Android and iOS. Two of the best smartwatches available today \u2014 the Apple Watch Series 10 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 \u2014 are effectively siloed, so it\u2019s great to see a desirable third option that works with everything.\n\nThe Huawei Watch Ultimate is at the extreme, expensive end of Huawei\u2019s extensive smartwatch collection, and not everyone will appreciate its ample charms. I\u2019ve yet to try the latest Huawei Watch GT 5 and GT 5 Pro smartwatches, but they appear to offer most of what makes the Ultimate so good at a lower price and in several different styles and sizes, so take a look at those if the Ultimate\u2019s design puts you off.\n\nBut for those who haven\u2019t seen the Huawei Watch Ultimate until now and are intrigued by a luxury-inspired smartwatch with strong golf and outdoor features, I think you\u2019ve just discovered what could be this year\u2019s big under-the-radar hit smartwatch."
