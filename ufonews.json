            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump carries a pair of his new signature shoes before taking the stage at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCampaign catchphrases aside, we can probably all agree that this was a very weird year in politics, particularly in Pennsylvania, the swingiest of swing states. Before we look ahead to 2025 let\u2019s review the ways Pennsylvania\u2019s politics and politicians got a little (or a lot) weird in 2024.\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, President-elect Donald Trump did, in fact, take the stage at Sneaker Con in Philly back in February to unveil an official sneaker: gold high-tops with American flag logos, available for pre-order at $399 (limit three pairs per customer). Reporter John Cole had to convince his editor it wasn\u2019t a social media joke, and ended up with a front row seat despite little advance notice from the campaign about where and how to catch Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump admitted the sneakerhead crowd was \u201ca slightly different audience than I\u2019m used to,\u201d but also said launching the shoe line was something he had wanted to do for \u201ca long time.\u201d He did not wear the shoes on stage. And further proving that politics make strange bedfellows, we discovered that according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the president of Sneaker Con made donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and a Trump-affiliated PAC, although in relatively small amounts.\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, the head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) talked about the agency tracking UFO sightings, to the surprise of committee chairperson Jordan Harris. It took a while to receive them, but senior reporter Peter Hall sought records on the sightings, which showed PEMA investigated more than a dozen incidents over the past decade.\n\nThe sightings included mysterious lights following a motorist on a dark country road, a saucer-shaped craft hovering over a suburban subdivision, and a flaming orb falling into the woods, the records show. Many of the incidents are reported to Stan Gordon, a Westmoreland County resident who operates a 24-hour UFO, bigfoot and cryptid reporting hotline, who said the line has \u201cnever stopped ringing\u201d since the Kecksburg UFO incident of 1965.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken these cases very open mindedly,\u201d Gordon told the Capital-Star \u201cWe approach them scientifically.\u201d\n\nMold in a government office does not seem like the kind of situation that would require a whistleblower, but here we are. A staffer at Rep. Eric Davanzo\u2019s (R-Westmoreland) district office in West Newton complained of foul odors, and bought tests to check for the presence of mold. That didn\u2019t go over too well when the tests came back positive, and she was later fired. She sued for wrongful termination and the Commonwealth Court ruled she could move forward with a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nFirst things first: If you want to try to modify the weather in Pennsylvania, you need a license \u2014 but since the law took effect in 1967 no one has applied for one (we asked).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), former GOP nominee for governor, claims that new technology and a proliferation of weather modification patents \u201cowned by a combination of Federal Government Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and large multinational corporations\u201d have brought forward the need to update Pennsylvania\u2019s law. He wrote a memo seeking co-sponsor for legislation he intends to introduce.\n\nThe legislation would ban the release of substances within the borders of Pennsylvania to affect the temperature, weather or intensity of sunlight, and appears to be rooted in the false belief that condensation trails left by high flying aircraft are actually trails of chemicals \u2014 aka chemtrails \u2014 released by the government for nefarious reasons, that has become conflated with techniques being explored to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to write a story with so much potential to use the phrase \u201cred wave.\u201d Alas, it only occurred to our headline writer much later (which, truly, is probably for the best). In June, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) objected to a bill to create a grant program that would make pads and tampons free for public school students. She didn\u2019t like that the bill\u2019s cosponsorship memo referred to menstruating women as \u201cpeople,\u201d and claimed the bill was \u201cjust another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s prime sponsors, Rep. Darisha Parker (D-Philadelphia), said the bill would serve to \u201crestore the dignity to these women and girls who have gone unsupported far too long.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 117 to 85. It did not advance in the Senate."

            "article_content": "Two of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks heading into 2025 are Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Both stocks had a phenomenal 2024, with Palantir's stock up almost 400% and SoundHound AI's gaining nearly 900%.\n\nThat's nearly unheard-of performance, and any investor would love to have returns like that. But after a significant run-up, is either of these two stocks worth buying right now?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nBoth companies are on the cutting edge of AI deployment\n\nWhile both companies operate in the AI space, Palantir and SoundHound AI aren't competitors.\n\nPalantir's focus is to provide purpose-built AI applications for its clients, which allows decisions to be made with the most up-to-date information possible. Furthermore, Palantir has tools that allow generative AI integration within businesses' inner workings, rather than using it as a tool on the side. While Palantir's primary customer base is government entities, the commercial side of its business has adopted this next wave of AI much faster. This balanced approach between government and commercial should allow the company's business to continue benefiting from this AI wave for a long time.\n\nSoundHound AI's product is centered around using audio input for AI models. There are nearly unlimited use cases for this, which is why SoundHound AI has partnered up with some of the largest AI players, like Nvidia, to integrate its sophisticated technology with others' products. The main use cases from SoundHound AI's software have been in the restaurant and automobile industries, but it has also recently found success in the financial and healthcare sectors.\n\nBoth Palantir and SoundHound AI have strong business cases, but how are their finances?\n\nSoundHound AI is growing much faster than Palantir\n\nOn the financial side, it's really difficult to compare the two. Palantir is a much larger and profitable company growing at a slower rate as a result (it's much harder for a large company to grow as quickly as a small company). SoundHound AI is the exact opposite in all of those aspects.\n\nIn Q3, each company posted strong growth, with Palantir's revenue rising 30% year over year to $725 million, and SoundHound AI's increasing 89% to $25 million. However, Palantir posted a strong 20% profit margin, while SoundHound AI's bottom-line margin was a negative 87%.\n\nWhile those numbers may cause investors to favor Palantir, we're comparing these companies for 2025, and a lot could change over the next year. Wall Street analysts expect Palantir to grow revenue by 24% next year, while SoundHound AI's revenue is expected to rise 96%.\n\nThat's a huge difference, and it shows that SoundHound AI's growth is just getting started, while Palantir's may decrease a bit. On the profitability side, SoundHound AI isn't expected to make a true profit in 2025, but management has noted that they expect to achieve adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profitability by the end of 2025. While that's not real profitability, it is a step in the right direction.\n\nThere isn't a true winner in this analysis either, but there is one huge component that we need to discuss with both companies: valuation.\n\nJustifying each stock's valuation is difficult\n\nAs mentioned, both of these stocks are up massively for 2024, yet their revenue or profits aren't up by a corresponding amount. That's because their valuation ratios have skyrocketed.\n\nSOUN PS Ratio Chart\n\nSOUN PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nSoundHound AI trades for 92 times sales and Palantir for 75 times sales, making them among the most expensive stocks in the market.\n\nMost of the time, when we discuss valuation, 92 or 75 times earnings constitutes an expensive valuation, yet these two are trading that high without considering any expenses.\n\nBut do those price points make sense?\n\nPalantir is much further along in its company maturity than SoundHound AI and should be aiming for profit margins of 30%. It will likely trade around 40 times trailing earnings. However, if Palantir maintains its current 30% growth rate (remember, Wall Street expects it to decline to 24% growth next year), it will take the stock nearly six years to achieve that valuation with no stock price movement.\n\nThat's sky-high expectations, and I'm not sure Palantir can meet them.\n\nSoundHound AI is a bit different, as it's doubling its revenue year over year. Let's say SoundHound AI can double its revenue in three years. If it does that, the price-to-sales ratio will fall to around 11.5 by 2027, a more typical software company valuation.\n\nClearly, both stocks already have huge expectations baked into their stock prices, making any further stock price growth more associated with hype rather than actual business results. Still, if I had to pick one, I'd choose SoundHound AI, as its explosive growth can more rapidly cool down its valuation multiples in a shareholder-friendly manner.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you\u2019d have $355,269 !*\n\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $48,404 !*\n\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $489,434!*\n\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 23, 2024\n\nKeithen Drury has positions in Nvidia.

            "article_content": "AI is now everywhere, even if it is not natively integrated. It has given everyone the power to get things done, understand complex things, and create images using their imagination. Meta AI, the AI-powered chatbot, has been rolled out to almost everyone, and here is how to use the Meta AI in WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of all these apps before you try. Also, it is possible that Meta may not have rolled it out for all users and countries. So, if you press @ and Meta AI doesn\u2019t show up, that would be why.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in WhatsApp\n\nMeta AI was the first to roll on WhatsApp and has been incredibly useful for many. If you are a small business or struggle with creative writing, Meta AI can help you rather quickly. You can access Meta AI using the @ button in single or group chat and interact with it directly as a contact.\n\nSince the group chats are visible to everyone, use the one-to-one chat to get things done and then forward it to other groups or chats.\n\nYou can also access Meta AI using the individual chat option. The interesting part is that Meta AI now offers an AI studio with many ChatBots of different styles. That includes advice and connections, pop culture, Anime, and more.\n\nRead: Stop Meta from using your data for AI training\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Instagram\n\nInstagram is all about Reels and Images. That\u2019s where the Meta AI imagine feature comes into the picture. While it is not natively integrated yet, you can use it in Group or Individual conversations by asking it to generate images using the /imagine switch.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Facebook Messenger\n\nLike above, you can quickly access Meta AI using the @ button from the text box. You can then ask a question; for example, you can ask for restaurant recommendations, information on a topic, or even a request. Or you can go ahead and tag a conversation and ask Meta to explain it.\n\nIf images are your thing, then directly type /imagine or @metaAI /imagine followed by your description, and it will generate AI images you can send. However, do remember that Meta AI will provide answers or content directly within your chat, visible to all participants.\n\nRead: Is it Real or AI Picture? How to identify using tools?\n\nMeta AI in WhatsApp is not working\n\nIf Meta AI isn\u2019t working correctly in WhatsApp, make sure your app is up to date, as older versions might not support the feature. If issues persist, clear the app\u2019s cache through your phone\u2019s settings to resolve minor glitches. Restart the app by closing and reopening it to refresh the connection.\n\nMeta AI is not able to read chat in the Group\n\nEven though Meta Ai is part of WhatsApp groups or Messenger, it can read or analyze a message even if tagged. If you want it to read, you must type it, and it will be visible to everyone."

But head honcho Sam Lake says it's too early to even think about how it's all going to end.\n\nRemedy games always had easter eggs and mysterious references to other stories in the studio's gameography, but the connection was made 'canon' in Control's AWE DLC, which either stands for Alan Wake Expansion or Altered World Event depending on who you ask. Last year's excellent Alan Wake 2 then fleshed out that interlocked story further, and even unofficially (for probably legal reasons) tied it to back Max Payne and Quantum Break - both of which are owned by Rockstar Games and Xbox respectively.\n\nBut when asked about if there's an endgame in sight - an Avengers Endgame type of conclusion, if you will - Sam Lake told IGN that the studio are \"just getting started\" and \"it's too early to start talking about an endgame.\"\n\nSam Lake on Control 2, Remedy\u2019s Connected Universe, and the Studio\u2019s Future - YouTube Watch On\n\n\"I love tying these things together,\" he said. \"I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand, entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting. And the way we are looking at it is, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own feet, but then, for our fans, for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story.\"\n\nLake also explains that newcomers can jump into any of their games, and then hopefully dip back into the other, older Remedy games to \"dive deeper into that rabbit hole.\"\n\nFor now, Remedy will continue tugging at these threads in its first ever co-op shooter FBC: Firebreak coming next year, paranormal sequel Control 2, and maybe even with its Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes in collaboration with Rockstar Games.\n\nCheck out more upcoming games of 2025 and beyond to not miss a single beat."

            "article_content": "A witch who lives in a cemetery with human corpses has revealed how she leads a paranormal, supernatural lifestyle.\n\nWren Harris is a qualified Clinical Aromatherapist, Massage Therapist and Reiki Practitioner, and she\u2019s been a witch for 26 years. The 41-year-old, who\u2019s from Leicestershire, explains how she\u2019s always felt more at home in \u2018supernatural settings\u2019, which is why she lives in a three-bedroom house in a cemetery.\n\nWren shares her home with husband Justin, 50, and their children, and explains that she never turns away any visitor who is in need of help to locate the grave of a loved one buried near her home. To share her experiences with the supernatural, Wren runs an Instagram account under the name of \u2018@the_cemetety_witch\u2019 and has over 36,000 followers.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"When we first moved in I felt the presence of a man in our bedroom near the fireplace and moving towards the window, almost like a piece of video playing out,\" Wren said. \"He was not aware of me and seemed to be going about his business. I have also felt a presence near my bed on several occasions, like someone was standing there.\n\n\"We also had some activity in the lounge when we first moved in, some loud noises and bangs that had no source. All the activity seemed to stop once we settled. Recently our youngest daughter has experienced something. She couldn't put it into words but refused to sleep in the bedroom for about six months. Otherwise, our house has a sense of deep peace and things have largely settled now that we have been here a while.\n\n\"I was drawn to the space next to our house and initially thought it might be a small area for us to use, but it turns out that it's where babies are buried. Often they were buried without headstones in Victorian England because they were expensive and deaths amongst children were extremely common. I've had several miscarriages myself and feel protective over this part of the cemetery and wonder if that's why I was drawn to it.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nAlthough this would be alarming to most, Wren refuses to allow trolls who spread \"fear and hatred\" to affect her and is instead focused on making witchcraft accessible and challenging dangerous and outdated beliefs. \"There are always those people who go out of their way to locate Witchcraft accounts and leave negative comments. Usually these people have closed, private accounts and don't leave themselves open in the way that I do,\u201d said Wren.\n\n\"Sadly, most of these people are ardent Christians who have a warped view of Witchcraft. Under a picture of a late friend who was prominent in the Druid community, someone on Instagram left the comment that he was, 'now burning in hell.' The irony was not lost on me that this person who was claiming that their way is the only way and that they are morally superior, was the person spreading fear and hatred. They left a number of aggressive comments across my account denouncing me as all kinds of evil. But I don't let these comments get to me.\"\n\nWren's journey with witchcraft began when she found a book on the occult when she was only twelve years old. She says that she immediately felt a sense of familiarity like she had returned \"home\". It has also allowed her to \"love and accept\" herself and \"strive to do better\" and her parents were supportive of her newfound practice.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) Image: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe explained: \"When I was about 12, I found a book in my parents' loft called Cult and Occult by Francis King. It had been put aside to sell at a car boot sale. It covered topics such as sacred geometry, palmistry and dowsing. There was a section on British Witchcraft and I was mesmerised by the photographs; there was something about them that seemed incredibly familiar as if I'd gone 'home'. Not long after this experience, I went on a trip to Avebury Stone Circle and West Kennet Long Barrow with my school, leaving me enchanted further.\n\n\"Between these two experiences a whole new world had opened up to me. At about age 14 or 15 my mum paid for a subscription to a magazine called \"Mind, Body & Spirit\u201d. It was a ring binder collection where you received a new candle or crystal or tarot card each week, and that opened my eyes further.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 18 I joined the Pagan Federation and the Children of Artemis - two organisations which helped me step onto my path properly and led me to start meeting other like-minded folk. In recent years I have written for Witchcraft magazines and websites, reviewing books in Witchcraft, and been involved in the Pagan community both online and in person.\"\n\nWren tries to incorporate Witchcraft into her daily routine. She explains: \"Our house is extremely cold so I currently start the day with a cup of something hot, stirring in good vibes and setting my intentions for the day. I usually light some incense and a candle and set about the tasks of the day. Often we'll get a knock on the door for cemetery business, delivery men trying to find our address or people trying to locate graves. When my husband comes home we have a cup of tea together and make dinner, which again involves a bit of magic in its preparation. Many of my daily rituals and tasks involve some form of Witchcraft. Each waking moment is a chance for intention setting and opportunity. Each waking moment is a chance for joy and celebration.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe says that it gives her life more meaning and allows her to be completely authentic. \"Witchcraft is a lifestyle for me,\" Wren said. \"It is my beliefs, my attitudes, my practices. It is an opportunity for me to stand in my authentic self. It is an opportunity to embrace the turn of the Wheel and celebrate the deep meaning of the seasons as we navigate our way through the year, deepening our connection to nature.\n\n\"These celebrations add context and meaning to life and the passing of time. This path has helped me love and accept myself as an individual, made me strive to do better, and truly embrace the important things in life.\"\n\nWren is also extremely passionate about helping other Witches on their spiritual journeys and challenging negative perceptions of Witchcraft.\"I'm passionate about Witchcraft and would love to team this with the enthusiasm of others starting out on their path,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd really like to help and inspire new witches by sharing what I've learned by releasing my own personal Grimoire and mentoring in some way. I feel I have stepped into the Crone aspect of my life and Witchcraft journey, and it is now time to widen the circle by sharing my experience and knowledge.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"I am passionate about educating others on the topic of Witchcraft, making it accessible and dispelling myths. And I feel sorry for people who are driven to spend their time judging others. I truly wish the best for them and hope they can find a kinder way in their treatment of others moving forward. I think that we are very lucky in the UK in that we are more likely to be laughed at for calling ourselves witches, rather than being persecuted, which is absolutely brilliant, but I do think there is some element of not being taken seriously.\"\n\nWren also offered some advice for those who are interested in Witchcraft or leading a more spiritual life. \"What drives many Pagans is a deep love for nature and the desire for self-development,\" she said. \"We're also a very friendly bunch that love a good celebration. Buy some books on the subject, maybe approach some experienced witches for advice, and get reading and practising. Embrace who you are and don't compare you or your journey to others. The truth is that the learning on this path never stops - that's the beauty of it.\n\n\"The word \"witch\" is just a label that doesn't need to be adopted if it doesn't feel right. Some people lead magical lives without even realising it. That there are magical acts embedded in our everyday lives such as blowing out candles on a birthday cake and making a wish, drawing images in the air with a sparkler, or lighting a candle in church with loving intention.\n\n\"We all celebrate similar things, for example, the celebration of light in winter, which is celebrated by festivals spanning various religions. That those who follow this path are just like you and me.\""

            "article_content": "Understanding genetic influences on weight\n\nRecent advancements in genetics have shed new light on the complex relationship between our genes and weight management. Research conducted by the University of Essex has uncovered 14 specific genes that significantly influence how individuals respond to weight-loss strategies. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that weight loss is solely a matter of diet and exercise, offering a deeper understanding of why people experience such varied results despite similar efforts.\n\nThese findings not only highlight the biological factors at play but also open new avenues for personalized approaches to weight management. As scientists delve deeper into this genetic landscape, the potential for tailored solutions that cater to an individual\u2019s unique genetic profile becomes increasingly promising.\n\nBreakthrough research findings\n\nA landmark study conducted on 38 adults aged 20 to 40 analyzed over 1,000 genetic variants to determine their impact on weight loss. The researchers observed dramatic differences in outcomes, even among participants following the same diet and exercise routines. This study highlights the importance of genetics in shaping metabolism, fat storage, and the body\u2019s ability to burn calories efficiently.\n\nKey findings from the study revealed that individuals with certain genetic markers experienced improved fat metabolism and greater efficiency during exercise. This suggests that genetics may hold the key to unlocking more effective weight-loss strategies, particularly for those who struggle with conventional methods.\n\nKey genetic markers and their impact\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries is the role of the PARGC1A gene, which affects mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Approximately 20-40% of the global population carries this gene variant, which has been linked to improved fat-burning capabilities during physical activity.\n\nThe PGC-1\u03b1 protein, regulated by this gene, plays a critical role in determining how efficiently the body uses energy. Individuals with this genetic advantage may find it easier to lose weight through exercise, as their bodies are better equipped to metabolize fat.\n\nAlso, researchers identified other genes that influence factors like appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity, and the body\u2019s response to caloric restriction. These genetic markers create a unique profile for each individual, shaping their weight-loss potential and response to various interventions.\n\nExercise interaction with genetics\n\nWhile genetics provide a framework for weight management, they require activation through physical activity to be effective. The study emphasized that even individuals with favorable genetic traits saw minimal results without regular exercise. This underscores the importance of combining genetic predispositions with an active lifestyle.\n\nParticipants who exercised consistently experienced significantly greater weight loss compared to those with similar genetic profiles who led sedentary lives. The findings suggest that physical activity acts as a catalyst, enabling individuals to fully leverage their genetic potential.\n\nFor those without advantageous genetic markers, the study provides hope that dedication to exercise and healthy eating can still lead to meaningful results. Genetics may provide an edge, but they are not the sole determinant of success.\n\nFuture implications for weight management\n\nThe insights gained from this research pave the way for a future where weight-loss strategies are tailored to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. Personalized weight management programs could include genetic testing as a standard component, helping individuals identify the most effective approaches based on their unique profiles.\n\nFor instance, someone with a genetic predisposition for slow fat metabolism might benefit from a higher-protein diet and strength-based exercise routines. Conversely, those with genes favoring fat-burning could focus on cardiovascular workouts for optimal results.\n\nHowever, the study also cautions against relying solely on genetic information. Healthy lifestyle habits remain crucial, and genetics should be seen as a tool to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014traditional weight-loss efforts.\n\nPersonalized weight-loss strategies\n\nThe idea of using genetic data to craft individualized weight-loss plans is both exciting and practical. By understanding how specific genes impact metabolism, appetite, and energy use, healthcare providers can offer targeted recommendations that maximize results.\n\nFor example, genetic insights could help determine which types of exercise are most effective for a given individual or identify dietary patterns that align with their body\u2019s unique needs. These personalized strategies could lead to more sustainable weight loss and improved overall health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe discovery of 14 genes that influence weight-loss effectiveness marks a turning point in our understanding of weight management. While traditional methods like diet and exercise remain essential, this research highlights the critical role of genetics in shaping individual outcomes.\n\nAs we move toward a future of personalized healthcare, integrating genetic information into weight-loss programs could revolutionize the way we approach fitness and nutrition. By combining scientific insights with healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve lasting success in their weight-loss journeys.\n\nThis emerging field offers hope to those who have struggled with weight loss, providing a path toward more effective and tailored solutions. The intersection of genetics and weight management is not just a scientific breakthrough\u2014it\u2019s a promise of a healthier, more inclusive future."

            "article_content": "The thing you need to know about OpenAI, according to OpenAI, is that its only goal is to solve \u201cthe most important challenge of our time\u201d in order to benefit all of humanity and the whole world.\n\nThat will continue to be the case, the organization said in an announcement on Friday, even as it restructures itself from a corporation controlled by a nonprofit to a stand-alone corporation that happens to throw a lot of money at an affiliated nonprofit.\n\nHow does this restructuring help OpenAI fulfill its mission of benefiting all humans and things non-human? Well, it\u2019s simple. OpenAI\u2019s \u201ccurrent structure does not allow the Board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission.\u201d Under the new structure, OpenAI\u2019s leadership will finally be able to raise more money and pay attention to the needs of the billionaires and trillion-dollar tech firms that invest in it. Voila, everyone benefits.\n\nNot mentioned in the press release is the fact that a year ago the non-profit board that oversaw OpenAI unsuccessfully tried to give CEO Sam Altman the boot for \u201coutright lying\u201d in ways that, according to former board member Helen Toner, made it difficult for the board to ensure that the company\u2019s \u201cpublic good mission was primary, was coming first\u2014over profits, investor interests, and other things,\u201d\n\nWith its new structure, OpenAI wants to maintain at least a facade of altruism. The for-profit company will be incorporated as a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation, which means that its board can consider how the company\u2019s actions impact stakeholders like employees and customers in addition to its fiduciary responsibility to shareholders (Corporate law experts have pointed out that normal corporations are also perfectly free to do this).\n\nOther publicly traded Delaware Public Benefit Corporations include Laureate Education, which operates a string of for-profit universities around the world, including one that was accused multiple times of misleading students about the cost of its degree programs (Laureate sold Walden University prior to the university settling a class action lawsuit earlier this year for $28.5 million). Another is Lemonade Inc., an insurance company that once advertised, and quickly apologized for, an AI feature it claimed could detect fraudulent customers by analyzing their faces.\n\nMixed in with all the effective accelerationist saviorism in OpenAI\u2019s announcement, is the clear message that the new company plans to raise a ton more money to further its drive toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). According to reporting from The Information, OpenAI and Microsoft have defined AGI as systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits. You know, the hallmark of intelligence.\n\nWhat will become of the nonprofit that currently oversees the company is less clear, although it certainly won\u2019t be pinching pennies. It wasn\u2019t a very traditional nonprofit to begin with, having quickly churned through $137 million in donated cash from Elon Musk and other tech moguls in addition to more than $100 million in free computing from Google, Microsoft, and others in order to create generative AI systems that now benefit for-profit corporations.\n\nAfter the corporate transition is complete, the nonprofit won\u2019t have any oversight duties at OpenAI but it will receive shares in the new for-profit company and be \u201cone of the best-resourced non-profits in history,\u201d according to OpenAI\u2019s press release. That will allow it to \u201cpursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, it won\u2019t be long before we all start benefitting from its charity."

            "date": "19h",
            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "Payments trends in 2024 and beyond are largely impacted by technology and the state of the economy. We\u2019re seeing a decline in discretionary spending, and an increase in the number of ways consumers like to make payments. Plus, AI and biometrics are also impacting payment security and fraud prevention.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll walk you through a few digital payment trends\u200b to watch as you prepare your business for the future of payment processing.\n\n1. Diversified payment methods\n\nOne of the more well-known global payment trends\u200b is payment method diversity. There are so many ways to make payments these days. I can choose cash, card, mobile app, QR code, tap to pay, buy now and pay later (BNPL), or even cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a survey by Square, preferences are pretty widespread across the board. While 58% of consumers still use cash, 57% prefer mobile wallets, and 53% use QR code payments. Another 44% use traditional credit and debit cards, 44% use touchless card payments, and 43% use BNPL.\n\nBNPL is particularly notable, as it\u2019s now being adopted in more industry verticals than before. Groceries, for example, may be available for purchase via BNPL. In fact, BNPL grocery purchases increased by 40% between 2023 and 2024, according to Deloitte. This is a direct response to the current economic and political climate, which is causing a decrease in discretionary spending.\n\nThe list of payment options will only continue to grow as the economy moves further away from cash and check and towards innovative payment methods like NFC or biometric payments. This also means considering options like subscriptions, cryptocurrency, saved payments, bill splitting, peer-to-peer (P2P), and gift cards.\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting stat from Deloitte: 70% of consumers say their store choice is highly influenced by whether or not the store offers their preferred payment method. It is therefore important for businesses to keep up.\n\nRelated: Best crypto payment gateways\n\nCash vs cashless\n\nToday\u2019s consumers like convenience and options. I remember when it was just a cash or credit world\u2014now, consumers can choose to pay for their purchases in many ways.\n\nHowever, according to data from Square, about 58% of shoppers still prefer cash. In fact, some trends are even indicating a move back to cash and away from digitization.\n\nSo, there\u2019s really no clear winner in a cash vs. cashless debate. The real answer for businesses is to create ways to allow customers to pay with or without cash.\n\nRelated: What is a cashless society? From speculation to near-reality\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\u2014like Apple Pay and Google Pay\u2014are another payment trend that has been around for a while but continues to impact businesses everywhere, especially as this technology evolves.\n\nPer Deloitte, 57% of consumers prefer to pay with mobile wallet apps. Digital wallets actually made up 37% of transaction value for e-commerce payments and 15% of POS payments in North America in 2023.\n\nContactless pay can also fall under the category of mobile payments. Mobile payments involve the use of NFC technology so a customer can hold up their phone or smartwatch to the reader rather than having to insert a chip or swipe a card. The contactless payment market is also expected to see major growth\u2014at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 113% through 2029, according to Juniper Research.\n\nRelated: Top mobile payment methods\n\nCrypto payments\n\nCryptocurrency payments skyrocketed in popularity when they were first introduced. The trend did lose some steam partly due to regulatory challenges, currency volatility, susceptibility to fraud, and low confidence in the currency\u2019s viability over the long term, perhaps thanks to the FTX scandal and collapse.\n\nWith this doubt, the crypto payments market is only forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2029.\n\nHowever, since Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, crypto and bitcoin have seen a resurgence of popularity in the United States.\n\n2. Biometrics features\n\nBiometric payments are experiencing a surge in growth, with forecasts to grow at a CAGR of 113.6% from 2024 through 2028, per Juniper Research. Some forecasts even say it will be the norm within the next decade. These payments incorporate biometric technology\u2014usually in the form of fingerprint or facial recognition\u2014to improve both data privacy and transaction convenience.\n\nSecurity is a top concern for businesses, both themselves and their customers. This is especially important when it comes to payments\u2014there\u2019s lots of sensitive information going around, so businesses are always looking for ways to tighten things up from a security perspective. Biometric payments are another layer of security that can help accomplish this.\n\nNot only does biometric authentication help boost security, but it also makes login and connection more efficient. I can\u2019t tell you how many passwords I have to remember\u2014if I can use my fingerprint or my face to authenticate something instead, that\u2019s one less password I have to keep track of. And remember, shoppers love efficiency and convenience.\n\n3. AI to facilitate and fight fraud\n\nFraud is always a threat to businesses and consumers. According to Avidchange\u2019s B2B Payment Security report, more than three-quarters of businesses have experienced payment fraud in the past year alone.\n\nSpeaking of security, AI is another payment trend to watch. And this can work in businesses\u2019 favor or, in a worst-case scenario, fraudsters\u2019 favor. Globalpayments reports that as many as 43% of businesses have plans to employ AI technology to help with fraud detection.\n\nWhile AI is an amazing tool to detect fraudulent transactions and add a layer of security, it also makes the work of a hacker much more accessible.\n\nRather than manually decoding payment information, hackers can tap into AI technology to make it easier to accomplish their tasks. In fact, Deloitte actually predicts that AI could enable losses to fraud of up to $40 billion by 2027. So, it\u2019s important to use payment technology that integrates the latest and most advanced security features.\n\n4. Instant payments\n\nWhile consumers love the convenience of being able to pay with anything other than cash, this has also added to delays when it comes to being able to access said cash.\n\nDigital payments often come with a waiting period\u2014for example, if I make a purchase with my credit card at a store, it might take a day or two for the charge to show up. Likewise, when I transfer money from PayPal or Venmo to my account, I usually have to wait a few days to receive the funds in my bank account.\n\nThese delays don\u2019t gel with our instant gratification society. So, payment technology is adapting to instant payments. For example, if I want to receive my PayPal or Venmo funds right away, I can actually pay a fee for an instant transfer.\n\nInstant payments are actually expected to make up 22% of transactions by 2028, per Capegemini\u2019s World Payments Report 2025. It\u2019s also believed that more instant payment availability will also facilitate more digital payment adoption by both businesses and consumers alike. JPMorgan reports about 80% of finance professionals believe faster payments will positively impact business.\n\nBut time will tell on this one\u2014only about 5% of global banks have advanced business technology, so there\u2019s still work to do.\n\n5. B2B is going digital\n\nB2B payments used to be largely check-based. But checks are quickly becoming antiquated in the payments industry. In fact, 80% of B2B transactions used to be paid by check\u2014that figure is now closer to one-third. And only about 5% of businesses are even prepared to make vendor and supplier payments by check.\n\nYou can see the decline in cash and check in B2B payment trends in the chart below. In 2019, they made up half of all B2B payments. Now, they account for less than one-third. Digital ACH transfers are making the most headway, but card and wire payments also experienced a slight increase."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

Elizabeth Benassi, who began working at Maximus UK Services in 2022 at the age of 18, claimed she was unfairly targeted for her choice of footwear, despite other colleagues wearing similar shoes without repercussions.\n\nBenassi\u2019s case was heard at an employment tribunal in Croydon, south London, which ruled in her favour. The tribunal found that the company displayed a \u201cdesire to find fault\u201d with the young employee and had failed to inform her about its dress code policy.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBenassi, employed for just three months, argued that she was singled out and treated \u201clike a child\u201d by her manager, who criticised her trainers. She told the tribunal that most of her colleagues were in their twenties, but as the youngest employee, she was subjected to excessive scrutiny and \u201cmicromanagement\u201d because of her age.\n\nEmployment Judge Forwell noted that Benassi was unfairly confronted about her footwear upon arriving at the office. \u201cNo allowance was made for the fact that she was new and may not have been familiar with the dress code,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIt was therefore a clear unfairness and indicates a desire to find fault.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal also rejected the agency\u2019s claim that Benassi had been made aware of the dress code policy. Judge Forwell pointed out that had such information been provided, it would likely have been mentioned in an email exchange at the time.\n\nMaximus UK Services, a company that provides recruitment services for the Department for Work and Pensions, denied any wrongdoing. However, the tribunal found the company guilty of victimisation and awarded Benassi \u00a329,187 in compensation.\n\nWhile the tribunal sided with Benassi on the issue of victimisation, her additional claim of age-related harassment was dismissed.\n\nThe case has sparked discussions about the treatment of young workers in the workplace and the potential for age-based discrimination. The tribunal\u2019s ruling underscores the importance of clear communication around workplace policies, as well as the need for fair treatment of new employees."

            "article_content": "Part 1: From the Roots of the Web to Columbia SC Website Design Excellence\n\nWeb design isn\u2019t just about making a website look pretty\u2014though that\u2019s often the initial impression people get when visiting a business online. It\u2019s about weaving a story, engaging visitors, and guiding them through an experience they\u2019ll remember. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve spent nearly two decades perfecting this craft, transforming how businesses in Columbia, South Carolina, and beyond connect with their audiences. Let me tell you, when you\u2019ve worked through every trend, from neon-tinted text on black backgrounds in the early 2000s to today\u2019s minimalist, responsive designs, you start to see the web as more than just code and graphics; it becomes an ecosystem of endless possibilities.\n\nThe Evolution of Design: From HTML Tables to Responsive Frameworks\n\nLet\u2019s rewind a little to the early 2000s. Websites back then were like those department store mannequins from the \u201890s\u2014awkwardly posed, overly dressed, and not very functional. Everything was laid out using HTML tables, CSS was still in its infancy, and JavaScript? Well, it was more likely to crash your browser than enhance your experience. In Columbia, SC, website design was no exception. Local businesses were just dipping their toes into the digital pond, and a \u201ccontact us\u201d form was considered cutting-edge.\n\nFast forward to today, and everything has changed. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have turned the design process into something akin to Lego-building. You pick your components, snap them together, and voil\u00e0! But here\u2019s where it gets tricky: while these frameworks make development faster, they also come with their downsides. Bootstrap sites, for instance, can sometimes look overly similar, which is something Web Design Columbia actively avoids. Cookie-cutter designs? Not on our watch.\n\nThe Intersection of Creativity and Technology\n\nA fascinating statistic from a 2023 global survey showed that 38% of website visitors will stop engaging with a site if the layout is unattractive or the content is poorly structured. That\u2019s why Columbia SC website design firms like ours emphasize aesthetics and functionality. Every pixel and line of code has a purpose.\n\nOne of our more unique projects was redesigning a legacy site that had been built on Joomla\u2014an oldie but a goodie in the content management world. The site was functional but far from user-friendly, and the client wanted something that could compete with modern platforms like Shopify or WordPress. After hours of brainstorming, we restructured their database, migrated their content, and built a sleek, responsive design that worked seamlessly on every device. Here\u2019s a fun fact: that site saw a 120% increase in user engagement within six months.\n\nResponsive Design: A Double-edged Sword\n\nResponsive design\u2014where your website automatically adjusts to fit any screen size\u2014is one of the most significant innovations in web design. But, like all technologies, it\u2019s not without its challenges. Take Columbia SC website design as an example: while mobile responsiveness is now a given, optimizing for speed on mobile devices remains a headache for developers worldwide. According to a Google report, 53% of mobile users will leave a site if it takes longer than three seconds to load.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve tackled this issue by combining the best server configurations with cutting-edge tools like Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights. We even use Cloudflare to reduce load times and improve security. But even with these tools, challenges persist. Older devices, for instance, often struggle with sites that rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. The balance between functionality and speed remains a dance we\u2019re perfecting.\n\nPlatforms of Choice: The Good, The Bad, and the Pricey\n\nWhen discussing Columbia, SC, website design, platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace must be mentioned. WordPress, which powers over 43% of the web, offers unparalleled flexibility, but its open-source nature can also be a curse. Owning a classic car is like owning a classic car: You can customize it endlessly, but without proper maintenance, it can break down.\n\nWix and Squarespace, on the other hand, cater to those who want a simpler, drag-and-drop solution. They\u2019re fantastic for small businesses just starting out but often lack the scalability needed as they grow. A client in Columbia once came to us frustrated that their Wix site couldn\u2019t handle the traffic spikes during their annual sale. We rebuilt their site on a more robust platform, ensuring it could grow alongside their business.\n\n\n\nThe Role of SEO in Modern Web Design\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) isn\u2019t just a buzzword; it\u2019s the lifeline of any website. Columbia SC website design services like ours incorporate SEO strategies right from the planning stage. But here\u2019s a reality check: even the best design can\u2019t mask poorly executed SEO. Google\u2019s algorithms are sophisticated, and they prioritize user experience above all else.\n\nOne of the common complaints we\u2019ve heard globally is about platforms like Shopify and Wix, where SEO capabilities are somewhat limited. While these platforms offer basic SEO features, they often fall short when compared to fully customizable options available on WordPress. That\u2019s why we emphasize starting with a clear SEO strategy, using tools like Semrush and Ahrefs to track performance, and continuously refining it.\n\nPart 2: The Heart of Columbia SC Website Design and What Lies Ahead\n\nColumbia\u2019s Unique Web Design Landscape\n\nColumbia, South Carolina, isn\u2019t just known for its southern charm and vibrant business community; it\u2019s also becoming a hotspot for innovative digital solutions. Web Design Columbia has been at the forefront, leveraging nearly two decades of experience to create designs that resonate with both local and global audiences. While the city might not have the tech reputation of Silicon Valley, it offers something unique\u2014a personal touch that prioritizes relationships over transactions.\n\nThis focus on collaboration sets Columbia, SC, website design apart. One memorable project involved a local nonprofit organization that needed to overhaul its aging Zen-Cart platform completely. We migrated their site to Shopify, ensuring a smooth transition without downtime. Here\u2019s the kicker: the new site\u2019s streamlined design and improved navigation led to a 200% increase in donor contributions within just three months. Success stories like these highlight the power of combining technical expertise with understanding community needs.\n\nWhen Design Meets Development\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about Columbia, SC, website design without diving into the synergy between design and development. Think of it like a duet: the designer sets the tone, and the developer brings the melody to life. But achieving harmony isn\u2019t always easy. Many businesses globally complain about miscommunication between these two roles, which can result in sites that look great but function poorly\u2014or vice versa.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve found that fostering collaboration between designers and developers is key. We use tools like Figma for wireframing and prototyping, ensuring that everyone\u2014clients included\u2014has a clear vision of the final product. Interestingly, a 2022 survey revealed that 60% of website redesigns fail to meet client expectations due to a lack of proper planning. That\u2019s why we emphasize transparency and iteration, involving clients at every process stage.\n\nThe Downsides of Modern Web Trends\n\nWhile modern web design trends like minimalism and parallax scrolling can be visually stunning, they also have pitfalls. Minimalist designs, for example, often sacrifice functionality for aesthetics. A user might love a site\u2019s clean, open look but get frustrated when basic navigation isn\u2019t intuitive.\n\nAnother trend that divides opinion is parallax scrolling, in which background images move slower than foreground content to create a 3D effect. While this can add depth and dynamism, it can also lead to slower load times and compatibility issues on older devices. Columbia, SC, website design projects must carefully weigh these pros and cons.\n\nOne of our more challenging projects involved incorporating parallax elements into a local restaurant\u2019s website. The result was visually spectacular, but we quickly realized that some older browsers struggled to handle the animations. By optimizing the code and offering a simplified version for less capable devices, we struck a balance that satisfied all users.\n\nGlobal Inspirations, Local Applications\n\nWeb design is a global language, but its application varies by region. In Columbia, South Carolina, businesses value authenticity and practicality\u2014traits that don\u2019t always align with the flashy, experimental designs you might see in tech hubs like New York or San Francisco. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Columbia, SC, website design lacks innovation.\n\nWe often draw inspiration from global trends and adapt them to fit local sensibilities. Take the rise of dark mode, for instance. Platforms like Twitter and Slack initially popularized this feature and has been praised for reducing eye strain and saving device battery life. While dark mode is trendy, we\u2019ve found that it doesn\u2019t always suit every brand\u2019s identity. A local healthcare provider, for example, might benefit more from lighter, more calming color schemes.\n\nThe Future of Columbia SC Website Design\n\nLooking ahead, the future of web design in Columbia\u2014and globally\u2014is shaping up to be exciting and complex. Technologies like AI and machine learning are beginning to influence how websites are built and maintained. Tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney are already assisting with content creation and design ideation, but they\u2019re not without their limitations. AI lacks the nuance of human creativity, so it\u2019s better used as an assistant rather than a replacement.\n\nIn Columbia, businesses are starting to embrace these technologies, but cautiously. Web Design Columbia has experimented with AI-driven analytics tools to predict user behavior and optimize design choices. While these tools provide valuable insights, they\u2019re only as good as the data they\u2019re fed. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nWhy Experience Matters\n\nIn an industry where trends change faster than you can say \u201cresponsive design,\u201d experience is a critical asset. Columbia, SC, website design firms like ours have weathered countless changes, from the rise of mobile-first strategies to the current emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nOne interesting fact: according to a 2023 report, websites built by experienced teams are 50% more likely to meet their performance goals than those built by less seasoned developers. That\u2019s because experience isn\u2019t just about knowing what works; it\u2019s about knowing what doesn\u2019t. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve learned to anticipate challenges and adapt quickly, ensuring every project succeeds.\n\nYour Digital Journey Starts Here\n\nWeb design is more than just a service; it\u2019s a partnership. Whether you\u2019re looking to revamp an outdated site or build something entirely new, the team at Web Design Columbia is here to guide you every step of the way. With nearly two decades of experience, a commitment to quality, and a deep understanding of Columbia, SC, website design, we\u2019re ready to help your business thrive in the digital age.\n\nContact us today, and let\u2019s create something extraordinary together. The web is your canvas\u2014let us help you paint your masterpiece."

            "article_content": "Understanding genetic influences on weight\n\nRecent advancements in genetics have shed new light on the complex relationship between our genes and weight management. Research conducted by the University of Essex has uncovered 14 specific genes that significantly influence how individuals respond to weight-loss strategies. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that weight loss is solely a matter of diet and exercise, offering a deeper understanding of why people experience such varied results despite similar efforts.\n\nThese findings not only highlight the biological factors at play but also open new avenues for personalized approaches to weight management. As scientists delve deeper into this genetic landscape, the potential for tailored solutions that cater to an individual\u2019s unique genetic profile becomes increasingly promising.\n\nBreakthrough research findings\n\nA landmark study conducted on 38 adults aged 20 to 40 analyzed over 1,000 genetic variants to determine their impact on weight loss. The researchers observed dramatic differences in outcomes, even among participants following the same diet and exercise routines. This study highlights the importance of genetics in shaping metabolism, fat storage, and the body\u2019s ability to burn calories efficiently.\n\nKey findings from the study revealed that individuals with certain genetic markers experienced improved fat metabolism and greater efficiency during exercise. This suggests that genetics may hold the key to unlocking more effective weight-loss strategies, particularly for those who struggle with conventional methods.\n\nKey genetic markers and their impact\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries is the role of the PARGC1A gene, which affects mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Approximately 20-40% of the global population carries this gene variant, which has been linked to improved fat-burning capabilities during physical activity.\n\nThe PGC-1\u03b1 protein, regulated by this gene, plays a critical role in determining how efficiently the body uses energy. Individuals with this genetic advantage may find it easier to lose weight through exercise, as their bodies are better equipped to metabolize fat.\n\nAlso, researchers identified other genes that influence factors like appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity, and the body\u2019s response to caloric restriction. These genetic markers create a unique profile for each individual, shaping their weight-loss potential and response to various interventions.\n\nExercise interaction with genetics\n\nWhile genetics provide a framework for weight management, they require activation through physical activity to be effective. The study emphasized that even individuals with favorable genetic traits saw minimal results without regular exercise. This underscores the importance of combining genetic predispositions with an active lifestyle.\n\nParticipants who exercised consistently experienced significantly greater weight loss compared to those with similar genetic profiles who led sedentary lives. The findings suggest that physical activity acts as a catalyst, enabling individuals to fully leverage their genetic potential.\n\nFor those without advantageous genetic markers, the study provides hope that dedication to exercise and healthy eating can still lead to meaningful results. Genetics may provide an edge, but they are not the sole determinant of success.\n\nFuture implications for weight management\n\nThe insights gained from this research pave the way for a future where weight-loss strategies are tailored to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. Personalized weight management programs could include genetic testing as a standard component, helping individuals identify the most effective approaches based on their unique profiles.\n\nFor instance, someone with a genetic predisposition for slow fat metabolism might benefit from a higher-protein diet and strength-based exercise routines. Conversely, those with genes favoring fat-burning could focus on cardiovascular workouts for optimal results.\n\nHowever, the study also cautions against relying solely on genetic information. Healthy lifestyle habits remain crucial, and genetics should be seen as a tool to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014traditional weight-loss efforts.\n\nPersonalized weight-loss strategies\n\nThe idea of using genetic data to craft individualized weight-loss plans is both exciting and practical. By understanding how specific genes impact metabolism, appetite, and energy use, healthcare providers can offer targeted recommendations that maximize results.\n\nFor example, genetic insights could help determine which types of exercise are most effective for a given individual or identify dietary patterns that align with their body\u2019s unique needs. These personalized strategies could lead to more sustainable weight loss and improved overall health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe discovery of 14 genes that influence weight-loss effectiveness marks a turning point in our understanding of weight management. While traditional methods like diet and exercise remain essential, this research highlights the critical role of genetics in shaping individual outcomes.\n\nAs we move toward a future of personalized healthcare, integrating genetic information into weight-loss programs could revolutionize the way we approach fitness and nutrition. By combining scientific insights with healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve lasting success in their weight-loss journeys.\n\nThis emerging field offers hope to those who have struggled with weight loss, providing a path toward more effective and tailored solutions. The intersection of genetics and weight management is not just a scientific breakthrough\u2014it\u2019s a promise of a healthier, more inclusive future."

            "article_content": "With 2025 expected to be one of the most explosive years yet for crypto, there\u2019s a sense of urgency among investors. The AI agent space is booming, and we\u2019ve uncovered three projects that could be the market\u2019s biggest winners in the year ahead.\n\nSelected for their boundary-pushing innovation, bullish momentum, and undervalued market potential, any one of these three tokens could be the next big crypto to explode. Join us as we break down why.\n\nNext big cryptos to invest in:\n\niDEGEN: Crypto\u2019s most unpredictable experiment Dasha: Making AI agents accessible for everyone ai16z: AI-driven investing on the blockchain\n\niDEGEN: Crypto\u2019s most unpredictable experiment\n\niDEGEN is what happens when a blank-slate AI is let loose into the world of Crypto Twitter and raised entirely by degens. Every hour, it tweets, learns, and evolves based entirely on what its audience feeds it, with no guardrails or filters in sight. Whether it\u2019s trolling politicians or dropping meme gold, nobody\u2014not even its creators\u2014knows what it\u2019ll do next.\n\nThe IDGN token is behind this social experiment. Mirroring the virality of iDEGEN\u2019s Twitter account, the response to the token\u2019s presale has been explosive. It uses an adaptive auction model to ramp up the drama, a massive divergence from the traditional fixed-price model.\n\nHere, IDGN\u2019s price adapts every five minutes based on demand. Prices rise 5% with consecutive buys or drop 5% when things cool off, helping drive intense FOMO and more than $8.9m into the presale. This market-driven process has helped push IDGN up more than 75,000% already, a signal that it could be one of the next biggest cryptos to hit exchanges.\n\niDEGEN is one of the few coins with a foothold in both the meme coin and AI agent spaces. That positions it to ride the meme coin supercycle and the unstoppable bullish trajectory of AI agents\u2014two trends forecast to dominate 2025. Set to hit exchanges on January 1st at a 10% premium, iDEGEN\u2019s magnetism might just make it the next biggest crypto.\n\nCheck out the iDEGEN website for more information.\n\nDasha: Making AI agents accessible for everyone\n\nLike iDEGEN, Dasha is pushing AI agents and crypto integration to new heights. It is a launchpad for creating and managing autonomous AI agents across platforms like Twitter and Discord. Dasha is designed to simplify the process, using a no-code environment to attract more entrants to the space, and powered by the ai16z Dao framework.\n\nDasha\u2019s VVAIFU token debuted in early November on Pump.fun, using a fair launch to promote equitable distribution of its roughly 999.9 million tokens amongst investors. While VVAIFU\u2019s price moved sideways until mid-November, it went on a parabolic run in a matter of days. It rose from around $0.00156 on November 15th to $0.181 on November 19th, marking an approximate 11,500% surge.\n\nGiven the growing movement of AI agents in the crypto space, Dasha could soon be the equivalent of Pump.fun in this area. It\u2019s relatively under-the-radar, holding a market cap of around $43 million at the time of writing, meaning it has plenty of potential to be the next crypto to explode in 2025.\n\nai16z: AI-driven investing on the blockchain\n\nai16z is an interesting experiment in the field of AI agents and decentralized finance. ai16z is effectively an autonomous venture capitalist, using an agent known as \u201cAI Marc\u201d\u2014based on a16z founder Marc Andreessen\u2014to invest in the next big crypto projects.\n\nAI Marc works alongside humans in the ai16z DAO, and token holders can participate in governance and benefit from the fund. Investors can pitch ideas for AI Marc to evaluate, and more token holdings equate to greater influence. The DAO also uses a \u201cMarketplace of Trust\u201d system that evaluates and ranks the reliability of its community members.\n\nAs of late December, ai16z had roughly $15 million under management and has sparked discussions about the future role of AI in venture capital. The AI16Z token has seen a similarly strong response, moving from around $0.02 on November 11th to a high of $0.90 roughly a month later, peaking with a market cap of just under $1 billion.\n\nWith ai16z blazing a trail and emerging as one of the most popular AI agents in recent weeks, there\u2019s a real chance it could be the next big cryptocurrency in 2025.\n\nLooking for the next big cryptocurrency? It might be these tokens\n\nCrypto thrives on innovation, and these three tokens represent the frontier of the market\u2019s next big thing. Each has shown an ability to capture significant momentum, and all are expected to make a huge impact in 2025. Stay up-to-date with these three\u2014they might just be the next big cryptos to explode."

I\u2019ve been seeing this girl \u201cAngie\u201d for eight months now. She is everything to me. I fell in love with her right away, and she said she loved me first within the first month.\n\nBut now, I get yelled at for basically everything I say. Like today, I called her for the first time at 2:30 p.m. and she answered the phone saying, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask what she\u2019s up to and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business\u201d and then goes, \u201cI\u2019m done talking now.\u201d This is a typical conversation for us.\n\nAnnie, I never cheated on this girl. I have always treated her well. Is it cheating if I just quit talking to her and start looking for someone else? The crappy part is that I don\u2019t want anyone else. But I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can put up with this. -- Should I Stay or Should I Go\n\nDear Should I Stay: Before you start looking for someone else, you need to tell Angie the relationship is over. Just because she isn\u2019t treating you well doesn\u2019t mean you should stoop to her level.\n\nAs for not wanting anyone else, you\u2019ll never know until you start looking. You\u2019d be amazed at what a clean break and a little bit of time can do.\n\nDear Annie: I will be inheriting a modest sum of money and want to gift some of it to my two married children. I also want to gift some money to my daughter\u2019s two young children to be used for future educational needs. My son and his wife don\u2019t have children and will likely not have any in the future. They lost beautiful twins born prematurely many years ago.\n\nI want to be fair and compassionate with the distribution of money. If I gift the same amount to my two children and a smaller amount to our two grandchildren, do you think my son will feel the distribution is unfair? I realize the inheritance is mine to do with as I please, but I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. We are all kind and level-headed people. -- Grandma in a Quandary\n\nDear Grandma: Your thoughtfulness and consideration for everyone\u2019s emotions show what a caring grandma you are.\n\nGifting the same amount to each child, plus additional funds earmarked for your grandkids' education, is a perfectly fair approach. But because your son and daughter-in-law experienced such a profound loss, it\u2019s wise to consider how this might affect them emotionally. If you want, you could contribute something unique to them as well -- a trip, for example -- to show extra consideration.\n\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\n\n"

            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Altria (NYSE: MO) owns the Marlboro brand, which has a roughly 41% market share in North America. That's huge and highlights the company's dominance in this geographic region. But the downside here is that Altria is only operating in this single region. If history is any guide, Altria's cigarette business will continue to worsen over the next three years.\n\nAltria may have made a big mistake\n\nA few years back, Altria spun off Philip Morris International as a separate company. Altria retained its North American operations while Philip Morris International ended up with the business outside of North America. The end result was to create a business that was being operated as a cash cow (Altria) and one that had more opportunity for growth (Philip Morris International). In fairness, that's basically what investors got, noting that Altria' dividend yield is a lofty 7.5% while Philip Morris International's yield is a far more modest 4.3%.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut there's some bad news here, too. Altria's cigarette volume fell 10.6% through the first nine months of 2024. Over the same span, Philip Morris International's volume rose 0.5%. To be fair, a 0.5% volume increase isn't exactly hitting it out of the park, but compared to a decline of 10.6% any positive number looks pretty darn good.\n\nIn the end, what this comparison highlights is that Altria spun off the strongest part of its business -- one that would have helped to offset the volume declines it is experiencing in North America. But that's just the beginning of the story. Philip Morris International has now entered North America with non-cigarette nicotine products. That's an area to which Altria is looking for growth, as it attempts to offset the declines it is experiencing in its core cigarette product. So Altria also created a competitor in its home market when it spun off Philip Morris International.\n\nHow bad is it for Altria?\n\nIn 2020, when cigarette volumes benefited from pandemic-related lockdowns, Altria's cigarette volume fell 0.4%. That was a high point, with the volume declines in 2021, 2022, and 2023 coming in at 7.5%, 9.7%, and 9.9%, respectively. Now add the drop of 10.6% through the first nine months of 2024 to that trend and you can see that Altria's cigarette business is getting worse, not better.\n\nExtend the 10% decline out three years from the third quarter of 2024 and quarterly volume will fall from 18.2 billion cigarettes to around 16.4 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Go two years out and the quarterly volume number declines to about 14.7 billion in 2026. Three years out brings the quarterly volume down to a bit below 13.3 billion in 2027. These are back of the envelope numbers, but a 10% rate of decline is clearly very bad.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Phil Ashley/Getty Images\n\nThe TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans.\n\nThis crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nAly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes\u2026 but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one.\n\nAlso: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is\n\nThousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem.\n\nThis ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. \ud83d\ude2e\n\nI'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.)\n\nLow key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. \ud83c\udf7f\n\nThat said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's.\n\nQuick Intro\n\nIf you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer.\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nI've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. \ud83d\ude80\n\nNeedless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses.\n\nBTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts.\n\nAll that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. \ud83d\ude05\n\nLet's recap how we got here\n\nThe TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024.\n\nByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. \ud83d\ude24\n\nHere is the recap:\n\nDeadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension).\n\nConsequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned.\n\nReason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government.\n\nTikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. \ud83d\ude43\n\nOn December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nIn response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban.\n\nAs of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain.\n\nIn addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. \ud83d\ude31\n\nTikTok ban could leave a void Meta won't fill\n\nTikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. \ud83d\ude33\n\nMeta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money.\n\nFor advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead\n\nTo understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible.\n\nThere are two main stages of awareness:\n\nIntent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you\u2026 you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward.\n\nDiscovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery.\n\nDiscovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly.\n\nStay with me; you need to understand this to see the void\u2026 \u23f3\n\nTikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\nSince TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers.\n\nWhat's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers.\n\nWithout TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThe biggest winners\u2026\n\nThe obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nGoogle is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine.\n\nYeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine.\n\nAmazon also stands to benefit.\n\nTikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful.\n\nAlso: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead\n\nOverall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people.\n\nI know what you are thinking: \"You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more.\" And I feel strongly about that.\n\nHowever, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. \ud83d\udd12\n\nLooking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day.\n\nThe biggest loser no one is talking about...\n\nByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. \ud83d\udcc9\n\nBut guess who's probably low-key pissed about this?\n\nShopify!\n\nAlso: This pocket camera has fully replaced my iPhone for video shooting\n\nShopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. \ud83e\udd1d\n\nTikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales.\n\nTikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions.\n\nAll I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhat next?\n\nIf you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you.\n\nThe obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem.\n\nThe real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it.\n\nHere's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience.\n\nI've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs.\n\nThe pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. \ud83d\udce2\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThink about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform.\n\nIf you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn.\n\nMy two cents\n\nAs someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. \ud83e\udd74\n\nAs a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry.\n\nAs a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out.\n\nAs a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price.\n\nAs a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld.\n\nAs an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it.\n\nThat said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote\u2026\n\n\"It's not happening to you. It's happening for you.\" \ud83e\udd17\n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times.\n\n\ud83d\ude07 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you.\n\nP.S. \ud83d\udce9 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Combined, the billion-dollar disasters of 2024 resulted in at least 418 fatalities and caused significant economic loss in the regions impacted, according to NOAA.\n\nIn this May 22, 2024, file photo, residents and first responders go through the damage after a tornado tore through Greenfield, Iowa. Multiple deaths and injuries were reported from a series of tornadoes and powerful storms that hit several Midwestern states. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe cost of the damage from billion-dollar disasters is so extensive for 2024 that NOAA is still tallying up the final numbers on several events, Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at NOAA, told ABC News. The full report will be released on Jan. 9, according to NOAA.\n\nThe agency has been tracking billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. since 1980, analyzing the most impactful and most common weather and climate hazards annually, Smith said. These types of events can include drought, wildfire, hurricanes, flooding, heat waves, winter storms and severe storms that contain threats like hail and high wind damage, Smith said.\n\nThe silver lining of analyzing the most expensive disasters allows scientists and emergency managers to learn from them, Smith added.\n\n\"From all of this, we're trying to show how the frequency and the cost of these impacts affect American lives and livelihoods in different regions in different states, using the best public and private sector data partners,\" Smith said. \"It provides a climatology of showing where the hot spots are across the country from year to year for different weather and climate extremes.\"\n\nCost of disaster\n\nFour hundred billion-dollar disasters have occurred since then, exceeding losses of $2.78 trillion, according to the agency.\n\nIn this Oct. 10, 2024, file photo, an aerial view shows destruction at the Spanish Lakes country club in Fort Pierce, Florida, in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. John Falchetto/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAnd the number of climate and weather events to exceed $1 billion in losses has been growing exponentially in the last several decades, Smith said.\n\nWhile the annual average number of billion-dollar disasters between 1980 and 2023 is 8.5 events, the annual average from the past five years is 20.4 events per year, according to NOAA.\n\nThe frequency has been increasing rapidly since about 2009-2010, according to a model designed by Charchit Shukla, a Ph.D student in industrial and manufacturing systems engineering at Iowa State University.\n\nWhile the impacts of many major weather-related events are being amplified by climate change, the combination between a growing population and more infrastructure on the coast are also to blame for the way weather and climate disasters are impacting communities, Cameron MacKenzie, associate professor in industrial and manufacturing systems engineering at Iowa State University, told ABC News.\n\nThese are some of the most impactful billion-dollar disasters of 2024:\n\nHurricane Helene\n\nHurricanes were, by far, the most impactful weather-related disasters on humanity and the economy in 2024, Smith said. Over the past 45 years, tropical cyclones have inflicted more than $1 trillion in damage, Smith said.\n\nIn this Sept. 27, 2024, aerial view, power crews work on the lines after Hurricane Helene passed offshore in Crystal River, Florida. Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida's Big Bend with winds up to 140 mph and storm surges. Joe Raedle/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"They're very powerful destructive events, with multiple hazards: storm surge, high wind and, of course, flooding, along our coastlines -- and even inland from the coast, we have a lot of population, a lot of assets at risk,\" he said.\n\nThe back-to-back hurricanes that barreled into the Gulf Coast of Florida before causing widespread damage far beyond initial landfall began with Hurricane Helene.\n\nHelene made landfall on Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 24 bringing up to 15 feet of storm surge to the coast before causing damage in Georgia, western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic flash flooding once it reached the mountain region of Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nIn this Sept. 29, 2024, file photo, Swannanoa, N.C., residents walk through devastating flood damage from the Swannanoa River. The remnants of Hurricane Helene caused widespread flooding, downed trees, and power outages in western North Carolina. Travis Long/The News & Observer TNS via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe impacts as Helene made its track were \"quite extreme\" and extensive, Smith said.\n\nThe storm killed 225 people, according to NOAA. The full extent of the damage has yet to be determined.\n\nHurricane Milton\n\nCommunities all over the Southeast were still reeling from Helene when Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, on Oct. 9.\n\nThe Category 3 storm brought storm surge up to 10 feet along the coast and spawned dozens of tornadoes across the southern peninsula of Florida that damaged homes, businesses vehicles and other infrastructure.\n\nIn this Oct. 10, 2024, file photo, a drone image shows the dome of Tropicana Field which has been torn open due to Hurricane Milton in St. Petersburg, Fla. Bryan R. Smith/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton combined will likely tally above $100 billion combined, Smith said, adding that the extent of the damage is still being assessed.\n\n\"Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton hitting the west coast of Florida within two weeks of each other was quite anomalous,\" Smith said. \"And that's a compound disaster with cascading impacts.\"\n\nTwenty-four people died as a result of Milton, according to NOAA.\n\nHurricanes Debby and Beryl\n\nTwo Category 1 storms proved they were well capable of causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, on Aug. 5 before it made a second landfall near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, three days layer.\n\nIn this Aug. 7, 2024, file photo, an Arby's restaurant looks devastated by a tornado associated with Tropical Storm Debby, in Moncks Corner, South Carolina. Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/Getty Images, FILE\n\nAfter its initial landfall, Debby marched up the East Coast, bringing heavy rain, flash flooding, river flooding and strong winds to several states. The remnants of the storm fueled flooding across parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and southeastern New York as it merged with another system in the region. The stretch of unsettled weather also produced an EF-1 tornado that impacted Buffalo, New York.\n\nHurricane Beryl was the second named storm of the season, making landfall in Texas on July 8, where it produced widespread high wind damage as the storm and caused significant power outages for millions of people for several days.\n\nBeryl also produced more than 50 tornadoes across eastern Texas, western Louisiana and southern Arkansas.\n\nIn this July 8, 2024, file photo, an aerial view shows a destroyed home in Surfside Beach, Texas, after Hurricane Beryl made landfall. Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nDebby is estimated to have caused $2.5 billion in damage, while Beryl is estimated to have caused $7.2 billion in damage according to NOAA.\n\nTornado outbreaks\n\nBetween June 24 and 26, states like Nebraska, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Massachusetts were impacted by severe thunderstorms that brought tornadoes, damaging winds and hail. The notable events include an EF-3 tornado hit Whitman, Nebraska, and the surrounding area as well as a tornado that impacted Providence County, Rhode Island.\n\nThat event cost about $1.7 billion in damage, according to NOAA.\n\nThe Central and Eastern U.S. experienced an outbreak of more than 79 tornadoes that developed between July 13 and July 16.\n\nIn this June 6, 2024, file photo a badly damaged home can be seen on Dogwood Drive in Gaithersburg, Maryland, after the home was hit by a fallen tree. The tornado that hit last night caused injuries to five people who were in this house when the twister struck. Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThirty-two tornadoes that spawned on July 15 broke the record for the Chicago region for the most tornadoes in one day.\n\nOther states that saw the most impact were Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and New York. Considerable damage to homes, businesses and other businesses were recorded.\n\nMore than 1,000 reports of high wind and hail damage were also recorded during the multi-day event, which is estimated to have cost $2.4 billion.\n\nNew Mexico wildfires\n\nMultiple wildfires that sparked in New Mexico from June 17 to July 7 damaged homes, vehicles, businesses, agriculture and other infrastructure.\n\nIn this June 20, 2024, file photo, burnt cars and structures are shown as the South Fork Fire continues in Ruidoso, New Mexico. Anadolu via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe South Fork Fire, near the town of Ruidoso, was the most impactful. Spreading rapidly due to strong winds, the South Fork Fire destroyed more than 1,000 structures.\n\nThe New Mexico wildfires caused an estimated $1.7 billion in damage, according to NOAA."

            "article_content": "Believers must regain the use of the mind for God\u2019s glory:\n\nSome cynics might think that my title offers an oxymoron. \u2018What, do Christians actually think?\u2019 Yes, I get that: too often believers do not use their minds. And some might even relish that sad reality. Too many of them think that Romans 12:2 says this: \u201cBe transformed by the removing of your mind.\u201d But it in fact says this: \u201cBe transformed by the renewing of your mind.\u201d\n\nThe biblical Christian should never be in that camp. The importance of the mind, of thinking, of truth, of reason, and of the intellect is stressed throughout Scripture, and is found in the pages of church history. And Jesus told us what the greatest commandment is: \u201cLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind\u201d (Matthew 22:34-40; Mark 12:28-34; and Luke 10:25-8 \u2013 all drawing from Deuteronomy 6:4-9).\n\nThe truth is, one of the things I most often say to Christians (or at least want to say to them) is this: \u2018You really need to start using the mind that God gave you instead of letting it go to waste.\u2019 So many believers need to begin to think, and to think carefully, for God\u2019s glory.\n\nHere are 30 quotes by 17 Christian authors (out of so many) stressing the importance of loving God with our minds and with the totality of our being:\n\nHarry Blamires\n\n\u201cThere is no longer a Christian mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thesis amounts to this. Except over a very narrow field of thinking, we Christians in the modern world accept, for the purpose of mental activity, a frame of reference constructed by the secular mind and a set of criteria reflecting secular evaluations. There is no Christian mind; there is no shared field of discourse in which we can move at ease as thinking Christians by trodden ways and past established landmarks.\u201d\n\nWilliam F. Buckley\n\n\u201cThe purpose of an open mind is to close it, on particular subjects. If you never do \u2013 you\u2019ve simply abdicated the responsibility to think.\u201d\n\nG. K. Chesterton\n\n\u201c[Beware] a hardening of the heart with a sympathetic softening of the head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point of having an open mind, like having an open mouth, is to close it on something solid.\u201d\n\nWilliam Lane Craig\n\n\u201cEvangelicals have been living on the periphery of responsible intellectual existence. The average Christian does not realize that there is an intellectual war going on in the universities and in the professional journals and scholarly societies. Christianity is being attacked from all sides as irrational or outmoded, and millions of students, our future generation of leaders, have absorbed this viewpoint. This is a war which we cannot afford to lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Christian scholars and pastors who need to be intellectually engaged with the issues. Christian laymen, too, need to be intellectually engaged. Our churches are filled with Christians who are idling in intellectual neutral. As Christians, their minds are going to waste. One result of this is an immature, superficial faith. People who simply ride the roller coaster of emotional experience are cheating themselves out of a deeper and richer Christian faith by neglecting the intellectual side of that faith. They know little of the riches of deep understanding of Christian truth, of the confidence inspired by the discovery that one\u2019s faith is logical and fits the facts of experience, of the stability brought to one\u2019s life by the conviction that one\u2019s faith is objectively true.\u201d\n\nJonathan Edwards\n\n\u201cAll truth is given by revelation, either general or special, and it must be received by reason. Reason is the God-given means for discovering the truth that God discloses, whether in his world or his Word. While God wants to reach the heart with truth, he does not bypass the mind.\u201d\n\nOs Guinness\n\n\u201cA leading problem in Western evangelicalism [is] anti-intellectualism. Anti-intellectualism is a disposition to discount the importance of truth and the life of the mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntellectualism is not the answer to anti-intellectualism. Our passion is not for academic respectability, but for faithfulness to the commands of Jesus\u201d.\n\n\u201cPrivacy is harder than ever when everyone is invited to be linked in, connected and transparent to others, but it matters. Reading books is time consuming, but it matters. Reflection is easily drowned out when life is fired at us point-blank, but it matters. Independent thinking is hard when the social media reinforces group-think, but it matters. Thinking for ourselves is difficult when it is so much easier to download an expert opinion, but it is essential to the freedom of our own agency, so it matters. Conversations with an iron-sharpens-iron quality are rarer when minds seek carbon-copy approval from others in their own bubble, but they matter. History is more crucial than ever when the relentless modern focus is on the present and the future, but it matters. The courage to hold unfashionable convictions is more difficult when social media mobs give the thumbs-up or thumbs-down like a Roman Emperor, but it matters.\u201d\n\nC. S. Lewis\n\n\u201cGod is no fonder of intellectual slackers than of any other slackers. If you are thinking of being a Christian, I warn you: you are embarking on something that is going to take the whole of you, brains and all. But fortunately, it works the other way round. Anyone who is honestly trying to be a Christian will soon find his intelligence being sharpened: one of the reasons why it needs no special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education itself. That is why an uneducated believer like Bunyan was able to write a book [The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress] that has astonished the whole world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd because our approvals and disapprovals are thus recognitions of objective value or responses to an objective order, therefore emotional states can be in harmony with reason (when we feel liking for what ought to be approved) or out of harmony with reason (when we perceive that liking is due but cannot feel it). No emotion is, in itself, a judgment; in that sense all emotions and sentiments are alogical. But they can be reasonable or unreasonable as they conform to Reason or fail to conform. The heart never takes the place of the head: but it can, and should, obey it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood philosophy must exist, if for no other reason, because bad philosophy needs to be answered.\u201d\n\nMartyn Lloyd-Jones\n\n\u201cIn view of the nature of this kingdom, we must learn to think in a new way. This is the great problem of the Christian life, and this is, indeed, the theme of all the New Testament epistles. All these epistles have one great object, and that is to teach us how to think in a Christian manner. The fact that you are born again does not mean that you automatically think as a Christian. If it did, there would have been no problems in the churches at Rome or Corinth or anywhere else; indeed, you would never have needed a New Testament epistle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great trouble in the Christian life is ever that we must re-learn how to think. The old way of thinking is of no value here; we are in an entirely new realm. So that is why the Apostle says, at the end of 1 Corinthians 2, \u2018We have the mind of Christ\u2019 (v 16). We need this mind, and we must learn to cultivate and to develop it and to let it govern our thinking on all these various problems and difficulties.\u201d\n\nJ. Gresham Machen\n\n\u201cThe church is perishing today through the lack of thinking, not through an excess of it.\u201d\n\nCharles Malik\n\n\u201cThe problem is not only to win souls but to save minds. If you win the whole world and lose the mind of the world, you will soon discover you have not won the world. Indeed it may turn out that you have actually lost the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest danger confronting American evangelical Christianity is the danger of anti-intellectualism. The mind in its greatest and deepest reaches is not cared for enough.\u201d\n\nJ. P. Moreland\n\n\u201cThe role of intellectual development is primary in evangelical Christianity, but you might not know that from a cursory look at the church today. In spite of this, if we are to have Christ formed in us (Galatians 4:19), we must realize the work of God in our minds and pay attention to what a Christlike mind might look like. As our Savior has said, \u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind\u2019 (Matthew 22:37). To do this, we cannot neglect the soulful development of a Christian mind.\u201d\n\nThink: The Life of the Mind and the Love of God by Piper, John (Author), Noll, Mark A. (Foreword)\n\nJohn Piper\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to overstate the case. It\u2019s not about going to school or getting degrees or having prestige. It\u2019s not about the superiority of intellectuals. It\u2019s about using the means God has given us to know him, love him, and serve people. Thinking is one of those means. I would like to encourage you to think, but not to be too impressed with yourself when you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThinking is indispensable on the path to passion for God. Thinking is not an end in itself. Nothing but God himself is finally an end in itself. Thinking is not the goal of life. Thinking, like nonthinking, can be the ground for boasting. Thinking, without prayer, without the Holy Spirit, without obedience, without love, will puff up and destroy (1 Cor. 8:1). But thinking under the mighty hand of God, thinking soaked in prayer, thinking carried by the Holy Spirit, thinking tethered to the Bible, thinking in pursuit of more reasons to praise and proclaim the glories of God, thinking in the service of love\u2014such thinking is indispensable in a life of fullest praise to God.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarfield taught at Princeton Seminary for thirty-four years until his death in 1921. He reacted with dismay toward those who saw opposition between prayer for divine illumination and rigorous thinking about God\u2019s written Word. In 1911 he gave an address to students with this exhortation: \u2018Sometimes we hear it said that ten minutes on your knees will give you a truer, deeper, more operative knowledge of God than ten hours over your books. \u201cWhat!\u201d is the appropriate response, \u2018than ten hours over your books, on your knees?\u2019\u201d\n\nFulton Sheen\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing to find in the world today is an argument. Because so few are thinking, naturally there are found but few to argue. Prejudice there is in abundance and sentiment too, for these things are born of enthusiasms without the pain of labour. Thinking, on the contrary, is a difficult task; it is the hardest work a man can do \u2013 that is perhaps why so few indulge in it.\u201d\n\nR. C. Sproul\n\nWe \u201clive in the most anti-intellectual period in the history of Western Civilization\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor the soul of a person to be inflamed with passion for the living God, that person\u2019s mind must first be informed about the character and will of God. There can be nothing in the heart that is not first in the mind. Though it is possible to have theology in the head without its piercing the soul, it cannot pierce the soul without first being grasped by the mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Word of God can be in the mind without being in the heart; but it cannot be in the heart without first being in the mind.\u201d\n\nJohn Stott\n\n\u201cKnowledge is indispensable to Christian life and service. If we do not use the mind that God has given us, we condemn ourselves to spiritual superficiality and cut ourselves off from many of the riches of God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nDallas Willard\n\n\u201cTo serve God well we must think straight. Crooked thinking, intentional or not, always favours evil. And when the crooked thinking gets elevated into orthodoxy, whether religious or secular, it always costs lives.\u201d\n\nRavi Zacharias\n\n\u201cThe danger of a simplistic faith is simplistic answers.\u201d\n\n[1987 words]"

That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

            "article_content": "Understanding genetic influences on weight\n\nRecent advancements in genetics have shed new light on the complex relationship between our genes and weight management. Research conducted by the University of Essex has uncovered 14 specific genes that significantly influence how individuals respond to weight-loss strategies. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that weight loss is solely a matter of diet and exercise, offering a deeper understanding of why people experience such varied results despite similar efforts.\n\nThese findings not only highlight the biological factors at play but also open new avenues for personalized approaches to weight management. As scientists delve deeper into this genetic landscape, the potential for tailored solutions that cater to an individual\u2019s unique genetic profile becomes increasingly promising.\n\nBreakthrough research findings\n\nA landmark study conducted on 38 adults aged 20 to 40 analyzed over 1,000 genetic variants to determine their impact on weight loss. The researchers observed dramatic differences in outcomes, even among participants following the same diet and exercise routines. This study highlights the importance of genetics in shaping metabolism, fat storage, and the body\u2019s ability to burn calories efficiently.\n\nKey findings from the study revealed that individuals with certain genetic markers experienced improved fat metabolism and greater efficiency during exercise. This suggests that genetics may hold the key to unlocking more effective weight-loss strategies, particularly for those who struggle with conventional methods.\n\nKey genetic markers and their impact\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries is the role of the PARGC1A gene, which affects mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Approximately 20-40% of the global population carries this gene variant, which has been linked to improved fat-burning capabilities during physical activity.\n\nThe PGC-1\u03b1 protein, regulated by this gene, plays a critical role in determining how efficiently the body uses energy. Individuals with this genetic advantage may find it easier to lose weight through exercise, as their bodies are better equipped to metabolize fat.\n\nAlso, researchers identified other genes that influence factors like appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity, and the body\u2019s response to caloric restriction. These genetic markers create a unique profile for each individual, shaping their weight-loss potential and response to various interventions.\n\nExercise interaction with genetics\n\nWhile genetics provide a framework for weight management, they require activation through physical activity to be effective. The study emphasized that even individuals with favorable genetic traits saw minimal results without regular exercise. This underscores the importance of combining genetic predispositions with an active lifestyle.\n\nParticipants who exercised consistently experienced significantly greater weight loss compared to those with similar genetic profiles who led sedentary lives. The findings suggest that physical activity acts as a catalyst, enabling individuals to fully leverage their genetic potential.\n\nFor those without advantageous genetic markers, the study provides hope that dedication to exercise and healthy eating can still lead to meaningful results. Genetics may provide an edge, but they are not the sole determinant of success.\n\nFuture implications for weight management\n\nThe insights gained from this research pave the way for a future where weight-loss strategies are tailored to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. Personalized weight management programs could include genetic testing as a standard component, helping individuals identify the most effective approaches based on their unique profiles.\n\nFor instance, someone with a genetic predisposition for slow fat metabolism might benefit from a higher-protein diet and strength-based exercise routines. Conversely, those with genes favoring fat-burning could focus on cardiovascular workouts for optimal results.\n\nHowever, the study also cautions against relying solely on genetic information. Healthy lifestyle habits remain crucial, and genetics should be seen as a tool to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014traditional weight-loss efforts.\n\nPersonalized weight-loss strategies\n\nThe idea of using genetic data to craft individualized weight-loss plans is both exciting and practical. By understanding how specific genes impact metabolism, appetite, and energy use, healthcare providers can offer targeted recommendations that maximize results.\n\nFor example, genetic insights could help determine which types of exercise are most effective for a given individual or identify dietary patterns that align with their body\u2019s unique needs. These personalized strategies could lead to more sustainable weight loss and improved overall health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe discovery of 14 genes that influence weight-loss effectiveness marks a turning point in our understanding of weight management. While traditional methods like diet and exercise remain essential, this research highlights the critical role of genetics in shaping individual outcomes.\n\nAs we move toward a future of personalized healthcare, integrating genetic information into weight-loss programs could revolutionize the way we approach fitness and nutrition. By combining scientific insights with healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve lasting success in their weight-loss journeys.\n\nThis emerging field offers hope to those who have struggled with weight loss, providing a path toward more effective and tailored solutions. The intersection of genetics and weight management is not just a scientific breakthrough\u2014it\u2019s a promise of a healthier, more inclusive future."
