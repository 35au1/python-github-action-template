(Youtube/The Age Of Disclosure)\n\nIn the trailer he said: \"The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\"\n\nHe praised the documentary on social media, saying: \"The Age of Disclosure is the most revelatory, credible, and historic documentary ever made about UAP, non-human intelligent life, the Government\u2019s involvement, and the bi-partisan disclosure effort.\"\n\nIf that's true then this is pretty much what all those UFO hunters and true believers have been waiting for, someone saying they have been a first-hand witness to the evidence of non-human intelligent life.\n\nAdvert\n\nAmong the other contributors to the documentary are various high ranking US politicians including the director of national intelligence during Barack Obama's time in office.\n\nMeanwhile, senior CIA official Jim Semivan claimed that 'UAPs are here, they are real and they are not human'.\n\nFormer Department of Defense official Christopher Mellon called it the 'biggest discovery in human history' while his fellow former DoD member Luis Elizondo said there was 'information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species'.\n\nIs this what we've all been waiting for?"

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019d no idea\u201d: The Pink Floyd song David Gilmour wasn\u2019t comfortable with\n\nWhen David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in late 1967, he had a mountain to climb. Not only was he drafted in to help his friends circumvent the astounding collapse in the mental health of their leader, Syd Barrett, but within just a few months, he\u2019d be required to replace his old friend. Gilmour had played in bands before, but supplanting such a revered titan of the psychedelic trend was a different matter entirely.\n\nAfter a period of cutting their teeth at London\u2019s UFO Club, which saw Barrett and the group hone their incongruous psychedelic style, they released their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, in August 1967. Blending Barrett\u2019s take on pop with an improvisational spirit, rock and pioneering use of studio effects, it was profoundly psychedelic but also something else. The record was as if Barrett had opened a tiny door in the back of his mind, allowing the listener to sample his surreal LSD-coated otherworld within. It was like a planet from the hit sci-fi series Star Trek with the surreal features of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland.\n\nDespite such an acclaimed and influential record, Barrett\u2019s mental health would sadly plummet not long after its release, and by April of the following year, the band had ejected him. They simply could not go on with a frontman who was so erratic and inconsistent. They were left to finish their highly-anticipated second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, without him.\n\nNaturally, A Saucerful of Secrets has always been regarded as an oddity in Pink Floyd\u2019s back catalogue, featuring a young group with a new lineup trying to find a way forward after Barrett\u2019s departure. This saw bassist Roger Waters step up as the band\u2019s leader, and each member shared songwriting duties to alleviate the burden.\n\nBecause of this transitional nature, A Saucerful of Secrets has also long been deemed one of the band\u2019s worst efforts. However, it does contain great moments that point to where they would head now that Waters was in control and Gilmour was impressing himself on proceedings.\n\nOne of these is \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019. Written by Waters, it tapped into the oddity of Barrett\u2019s work with Gilmour\u2019s noir-esque guitar line at the start, the over-pronounced English accent, and strange backing vocals. It\u2019s also significant as it saw Gilmour sing the majority of the lead vocals, and the serene moments of release, \u201cMrs Clegg, you must be proud of him\u2026\u201d, sonically evoke the later grandeur of their work on the likes of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nDespite \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019 being a crucial moment for Gilmour and Pink Floyd, speaking to Guitar Heroes in 1983, he explained how uncomfortable the song made him feel at the time. Responding to the suggestion that he was trying to sound like Jimi Hendrix on it, he soberingly conceded that he had no clue what he was doing at the time. He was still forming his now-iconic approach to the six-string\n\nRecalling how uncomfortable working on the song was, he said: \u201cNo, not really. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was trying to play at the time to be quite honest. I\u2019d really no idea. What I was used to playing, the style I had, didn\u2019t fit Pink Floyd at the time, and I didn\u2019t really know quite what to do. Gradually, over the years, my style changed to fit Pink Floyd, and Pink Floyd changed to fit my style.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to characterise his style back then, the frank Gilmour replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think I had one really.\u201d"

            "article_content": "A new organization, U.F.O. 101, has been formed to attract those interested in local phenomena, UAP, discussions, research and legends. It is set up to be a welcoming and friendly group where folks can share personal observations, post videos/ photos, relate experiences and discuss.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of stories,\u201d said David McWhorter, one of the founders of the group.\n\nHe is hoping the group will be a place where people in the area will want to talk about UFOs and related phenomena without fear of being ridiculed. He believes it will be interesting to see how many have had similar experiences.\n\nThe first meeting of the group was Saturday, Jan 18. Membership has taken off with 171 at the first meeting. Thirty were physically in attendance and 141 attended via Zoom. Ages ranged from teenagers to retirees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been curious,\u201d one man said on Zoom. \u201cAlways interested.\u201d\n\nSadly, those attending via Zoom didn\u2019t get to enjoy the U.F.O. 101 decorated cookies.\n\nStreaming was made possible through library representative Tillie Jamison. Information on the new club is available on the New Carlisle Library Facebook page and website, newcarlislelibrary.org in addition to the club\u2019s own Facebook page at \u201cU.F.O. 101\u201d. There are already more than 120 followers. Email address is ohioufo101@gmail.com\n\nSocial media expert Stacy Frazier from Medway facilitated the Zoom connections and played a video of a local UFO sighting near Lake and Scarff.\n\nDuring a discussion time Irwin and Karen McWhorter encouraged others to share their experiences seeing orbs and triangular shaped objects in New Carlisle, Donnelsville, Crystal Lake, and near WPAFB. There have been quite a few seen over the years.\n\n\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d one man commented.\n\nGroup members talked about related topics such as Rh negative blood and Bigfoot. A questionnaire was distributed and aimed at helping a person decide if they really had seen a UFO or had related but forgotten experiences in the past.\n\nAccording to David McWhorter, there will be no dues and hopefully a newsletter will be published in the future. He is looking for suggestions of guest speakers and interesting books or websites for research. He manages the Facebook page and is hoping to keep discussions going.\n\nThis group will be meeting every third Saturday at 2 p.m. at the New Carlisle Public Library, 111 E. Lake Ave, New Carlisle. Streaming will be available via the \u201cU.F.O.101\u201d Facebook page."

Photo: Mojahid Mottakin/Shutterstock\n\nA Chinese startup named DeepSeek has taken the lead in the AI race, with its assistant app becoming the most popular free app on Apple's US App Store, surpassing ChatGPT, according to data firm Sensor Tower. The app, powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model, was launched on January 10 and has quickly gained attention in the United States.\n\nDeepSeek claims its AI model competes with the best in the world, even though it was trained using less expensive Nvidia H800 chips, which are not the latest technology, according to a report by Reuters. The company says it spent less than $6 million on training, a figure that has surprised many in the tech industry. These details, while debated, have raised questions about whether US restrictions on exporting advanced chips to China are working.\n\nSince 2021, the US government has imposed strict rules to prevent China from accessing high-end chips needed for AI development, states the report. However, DeepSeek's success suggests that competitive AI models can still be built with less powerful hardware, challenging assumptions about the effectiveness of these restrictions.\n\nDeepSeek, a small startup from Hangzhou founded in 2023, is part of a growing group of Chinese companies developing AI. Unlike its competitors, DeepSeek is the first to earn significant recognition in the US tech industry for creating an AI model that matches, or even outperforms, leading US systems."

It\u2019s a day dedicated to recognizing the achievements of the National Geographic Society, an organisation that has played a crucial role in advancing our knowledge of science, geography, history, and cultures through its iconic magazine, documentaries, and educational programs.\n\nThe roots of National Geographic go back to 1888, when the National Geographic Society was founded in Washington, D.C. Since then, it has become one of the most well-known and respected platforms for exploration, scientific research, and storytelling. Over the years, National Geographic has captured the imaginations of millions of people through breathtaking photography, compelling stories, and educational content that cover a wide range of topics\u2014from the depths of the ocean to the farthest reaches of outer space.\n\nNational Geographic Day serves as a reminder of the organisation\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of human understanding. It highlights the importance of conservation, exploration, and environmental sustainability. The day encourages people to learn more about the world\u2019s natural wonders, endangered species, and diverse cultures, fostering a sense of responsibility to protect and preserve the planet for future generations. In addition to its traditional work, National Geographic also focuses on inspiring young people to become scientists, explorers, and conservationists. The organization has launched several initiatives to engage students and teachers, providing them with tools and resources to learn about the world in interactive and meaningful ways. National Geographic\u2019s educational outreach efforts help nurture the curiosity of young minds and encourage them to take action toward creating a more sustainable future.\n\nOn National Geographic Day, schools, museums, and environmental organisations may hold special events, such as exhibits, film screenings, and educational activities. People around the world are encouraged to share their own stories of discovery, whether it\u2019s through travel, science, or their daily lives. The day brings people together in celebration of the wonders of our planet and the boundless possibilities for exploration and learning."

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nAI is already reshaping industries and society on a global scale. IDC predicts that AI will contribute $19.9 trillion to the global economy by 2030, comprising 3.5% of GDP. This momentum is exemplified by the recent announcement of \u201cProject Stargate,\u201d a partnership to invest up to $100 billion in new AI-focused data center capacity. This is all indicative of the tremendous activity going on with AI development. On a single day, AI made headlines for discovering proteins to counteract cobra venom, creating a Star Trek-style universal translator and paving the way for true AI assistants.\n\nThese and other developments highlight individual achievements, as well as their interconnected progress. This flywheel of innovation is where breakthroughs in one domain amplify advancements in others, compounding AI\u2019s transformative potential.\n\nSeparating signal from noise\n\nEven for someone who follows AI developments closely, the rapid technological breakthroughs and diffusion across industries and applications is dizzying, making it highly challenging to not only know and understand what is going on, but understand the relative importance of developments. It is challenging to separate the signal from noise.\n\nIn the past, I might have turned to an AI industry analyst to help explain the dynamics and meaning of recent and projected developments. This time, I decided instead to see if AI itself might be able to help me. This led me to a conversation with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. The 4o model might have worked as effectively, but I expected that a reasoning model such as o1 might be more effective.\n\nI asked o1 what it thought were the top AI trends and why. I started by asking for the top 10 to 15, but over the course of our collaborative dialog, this expanded to 25. Yes, there really are that many, which is a testament to AI\u2019s value as a general-purpose technology.\n\nIn dialog about leading AI trends with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds of inference-time \u201cthinking,\u201d o1 responded with a list of trends in AI development and use, ranked according to their potential significance and impact on business and society. I asked several qualifying questions and made a few suggestions that led to slight changes in the evaluation method and rankings.\n\nMethodology\n\nRankings of the various AI trends are determined by a blended heuristic that balances multiple factors including both quantitative indicators (near-term commercial viability) and qualitative judgments (disruptive potential and near-term societal impact) further described as follows:\n\nCurrent commercial viability: The trend\u2019s market presence and adoption.\n\nLong term disruptive potential: How a trend could significantly reshape industries and create new markets.\n\nSocietal impact: Weighing the immediate and near-term effects on society, including accessibility, ethics and daily life.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the overall AI trend rankings, each trend receives a long-term social transformation score (STS), ranging from incremental improvements (6) to civilization-altering breakthroughs (10). The STS reflects the trend\u2019s maximum potential impact if fully realized, offering an absolute measure of transformational significance.\n\nLevels of social transformation associated with top AI trends.\n\nThe development of this ranking process reflects the potential of human-AI collaboration. o1 provided a foundation for identifying and ranking trends, while my human oversight helped ensure that the insights were contextualized and relevant. The result shows how humans and AI can work together to navigate complexity.\n\nTop AI trends in 2025\n\nFor tech leaders, developers and enthusiasts alike, these trends signal both immense opportunity and significant challenges in navigating the many changes brought by AI. Highly-ranked trends typically have broad current adoption, high commercial viability or significant near-term disruptive effects.\n\nTable of top 10 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for social impact. Specific use cases \u2014 like self-driving cars or personal assistant robots \u2014 are not considered individual trends but are instead subsumed within the broader foundational trends.\n\nHonorable mention list: AI trends 11 \u2013 25\n\nOne can quibble whether number 11 or any of the following should be in the top 10, but keep in mind that these are relative rankings and include a certain amount of subjectivity (whether from o1 or from me), based on our iterative conversation. I suppose this is not too different from the conversations that take place within any research organization when completing their reports ranking the comparative merits of trends. In general, this next set of trends has significant potential but are either: 1) not yet as widespread and/or 2) have a potential payoff that is still several or more years away.\n\nWhile these trends did not make the top 10, they showcase the expanding influence of AI across healthcare, sustainability and other critical domains.\n\nTable of top 11 to 25 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for societal impact.\n\nDigital humans show the innovation flywheel in action\n\nOne use case that highlights the convergence of these trends is digital humans, which exemplify how foundational and emerging AI technologies come together to drive transformative innovation. These AI-powered avatars create lifelike, engaging interactions and span roles such as digital coworkers, tutors, personal assistants, entertainers and companions. Their development shows how interconnected AI trends create transformative innovations.\n\nThe flywheel of AI innovation: Interconnected advancements in AI technologies drive transformative progress, where breakthroughs in one domain amplify developments in others, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation leading to new uses.\n\nFor example, these lifelike avatars are developed using the capabilities of generative AI (trend 1) for natural conversation, explainable AI (2) to build trust through transparency and agentic AI (3) for autonomous decision-making. With synthetic data generation, digital humans are trained on diverse, privacy-preserving datasets, ensuring they adapt to cultural and contextual nuances. Meanwhile, edge AI (5) enables near real-time responsiveness and multi-modal AI (17) enhances interactions by integrating text, audio and visual elements.\n\nBy using the technologies described by these trends, digital humans exemplify how advancements in one domain can accelerate progress in others, transforming industries and redefining human-AI collaboration. As digital humans continue to evolve, they not only exemplify the flywheel of innovation, but also underscore the transformative potential of AI to redefine how humans interact with technology.\n\nWhy are AGI and ASI so far down the list?\n\nThe future is, indeed, hard to predict. Many expect artificial general intelligence (AGI) to be achieved soon. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said recently: \u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d However, that is different from saying that AGI is imminent. It also does not mean that all agree on the definition of AGI. For OpenAI, this means \u201ca highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d\n\nMark Zuckerberg said he believes that in 2025 Meta will \u201chave an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer\u201d that can write code. That is clearly economically viable work and could be used to claim the arrival of AGI. Perhaps, but even Altman is now saying that AGI is not arriving soon.\n\nSource: https://x.com/sama/status/1881258443669172470\n\nGoogle Deepmind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis said recently on the Big Technology podcast that AGI is likely \u201ca handful of years away.\u201d He added, however, that there is a 50% chance another one or two significant breakthroughs on the order of the transformer model that led to generative AI will still be needed to fully achieve AGI.\n\nSuperintelligence, too, could eventually be achieved in the next 5 to 10 years. Altman and Elon Musk have said as much, although the consensus expert opinion is closer to 2040 \u2014 and some believe it will never be achieved. Amara\u2019s Law reminds us that we tend to overestimate the effect of any technology in the short run and underestimate the effect eventually. If achieved, the impact of superintelligence would be enormous \u2014 but at present, this \u201cif\u201d precludes this from the top 10 list.\n\nChoosing the right AI collaborator(s)\n\nAfter taking on this venture, I discovered some crucial elements to consider in the choice of AI collaborators. While o1 offered valuable insights into leading AI trends, its cutoff date for training data was October 2023, and it lacks web browsing capabilities. This became clear when it initially suggested No. 12 for agentic AI, a trend that has advanced rapidly in the last several months. Rerunning the analysis with the 4o model, which includes web browsing, led to a more proper ranking of agentic AI at No. 3.\n\nPer ChatGPT: \u201cApologies for any confusion earlier. Given the rapid advancements and the significant attention agentic AI is receiving in 2025, it would be appropriate to rank it at No. 3 on the list of top AI trends. This adjustment reflects its growing impact and aligns with recent analyses highlighting its importance.\u201d\n\nIn much the same way, I had a conversation with o1 about the placement of AI in education, healthcare and life sciences. However, 4o suggested that their order in the ranking be reversed, that healthcare should be No. 11, and education No. 12.\n\nView from the 4o model on the relative ranking for AI in healthcare versus AI in education.\n\nI agreed with the rationale and switched the order. These examples show both the challenges and benefits of working with the latest AI chatbots, and both the necessity and value of human and machine collaboration.\n\nSocial transformation rankings\n\nBelow is a summary of the STS rankings, offering a comparative view of the top 25 AI trends for 2025 and their potential long-term impact. These rankings highlight how AI trends vary in their potential to reshape society, from near-term enablers like generative AI and agentic AI, to longer-term innovations such as quantum AI and brain-computer interfaces.\n\nSummary of the top 25 AI trends for 2025, ranked by how profoundly each trend might reshape society at its fullest realization.\n\nNavigating AI\u2019s transformative impact\n\nWhile some AI breakthroughs are here now or seem just around the corner, others like AGI and ASI remain speculative, reminding us that there is much more to come from AI technologies. Yet it is already clear that AI, in all its manifestations, is reshaping human affairs in ways likely to become even more profound over time. These changes will extend to daily life and could even challenge our understanding of what it means to be human.\n\nAs AI continues to redefine industries and society, we are only at the beginning of a dramatic technological renaissance. These trends, ranging from generative models to humanoid robots powered by AI, highlight both the promise and complexity of integrating AI into our lives.\n\nWhat is particularly striking about these 25 trends is not just their individual significance, but the interconnectedness of their progress. This flywheel of AI innovation will continue to amplify progress, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of breakthroughs that redefine industries and society. As these trends evolve, revisiting this analysis in six to 12 months could reveal changes in the rankings and how the flywheel of innovation continues to accelerate progress across industries.\n\nLeaders, developers and society must monitor these advancements and ensure they are directed toward fair outcomes, striking a balance between innovation and responsibility. The next five years will define AI\u2019s trajectory \u2014 whether it becomes a tool for societal benefit or a source of disruption. The choice is ours.\n\nGary Grossman is EVP of technology practice at Edelman and global lead of the Edelman AI Center of Excellence."

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nPayment trends in Asia are changing how businesses and people transact \u2014 from the digital-first economies of China and Singapore to the quickly changing markets of Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nThis shift is not merely a matter of convenience; it is emblematic of an increasingly complex convergence between state-of-the-art technology, consumer desires for seamlessness, and the region\u2019s particular socio-economic landscape.\n\nEmerging trends such as cross-border payment systems and open banking initiatives are breaking down traditional barriers, fostering greater connectivity and efficiency in Asia\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHowever, the rapid progress comes with challenges. The shift toward digitised payments brings heightened concerns about cybersecurity, fraud, and regulatory compliance. As Asian markets surge, they face the dual challenge of safeguarding digital infrastructure while ensuring financial inclusion and bridging technological gaps between advanced and developing economies.\n\nThis article explores five key trends changing how we pay today while pushing the narrative for a more efficient, powerful financial ecosystem in Asia.\n\n1. China Leads Again in Digital Payment Adoption\n\nDigital payment adoption is soaring across Asia, with CNBC highlighting the region\u2019s leadership in this segment, driven largely by Southeast Asians emerging as the most avid users of digital wallets.\n\nAs of June 2024, China maintains its leadership in digital wallet adoption, with over 88% of mobile internet users\u2014 approximately 969 million individuals \u2014 engaging in mobile payments. Back in 2023, digital wallets accounted for 82% of China\u2019s e-commerce spending and 66% of physical purchases, totalling around US$7.6 trillion in transactions, CNBC reports.\n\nAlipay and WeChat Pay dominate China\u2019s digital payment landscape, making it the largest and most influential wallet market globally, according to Worldpay\u2019s The Global payments Report 2024.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, digital payment transactions are projected to exceed US$1 trillion by 2025. According to a study by Bain & Company, Google, and Temasek, 53% of industry experts believe that consumer tech platforms, rather than pure-play fintechs, are more likely to drive disruption in financial services.\n\nIn 2023, credit card payments comprised 52.2% of all cashless transactions in Japan. However, the country has shown that its consumers\u2019 reliance on credit cards and electronic money has gradually decreased, while QR code and barcode payments have experienced remarkable growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic Times reported that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) facilitated over 15,547 crore transactions worth INR 223 lakh crore (US$258.59 billion) in India from January to November 2024. In 2025, UPI is expected to become an omnipresent network, transforming connected devices into potential payment endpoints through messaging platforms like WhatsApp.\n\n2. Real-Time Payments Bridging Asia Pacific Borders\n\nReal-time and cross-border payments are becoming a reality, thanks to regional collaborations and technological advancements. Project Nexus of Singapore, for example, aims to connect real-time payment systems across the region, further facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. This initiative demonstrates the growing focus on regional collaboration in the payments sector.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate efforts, such as Visa\u2019s initiatives to enable QR code payments across borders, are further driving the adoption of real-time cross-border payments.\n\nReal-time payments are surging across Asia-Pacific, are expected to grow from 49.2 billion in 2022 to 96.2 billion by 2027. Singapore\u2019s PayNow and Thailand\u2019s PromptPay have established a successful cross-border linkage, while Malaysia\u2019s DuitNow and Indonesia\u2019s QRIS integration has been operational for a few years already.\n\nThis trend is driven by a combination of regional cooperation, corporate innovation, and technological advancements, setting the stage for a more interconnected and efficient financial ecosystem in the region.\n\n3. Embedded Finance Hailed as the Future of Fintech\n\nThe embedded payments market is expected to reach a global transaction value of US$2.5 trillion by 2028, according to a LexisNexis study. In Asia, the adoption of embedded finance is creating opportunities across diverse sectors.\n\nChina, a global leader in digital wallet adoption, has its embedded finance market seamlessly integrating payments into consumer apps at scale thanks to its extensive digital wallet adoption. Platforms like WeChat and Alipay allow their users to conduct transactions for everyday purchases, transportation, and even healthcare services effortlessly.\n\nIndia\u2019s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is another backbone of embedded payments. The transformative impact of UPI underscores the potential of integrated financial systems.\n\nWith nearly 300 million individuals and 50 million merchants in India relying on UPI for transactions, it has become the country\u2019s most widely used payment method, the World Economic Forum reports. Its influence is now reaching beyond India\u2019s borders, with countries like Singapore and the UAE adopting the system, marking its growing global presence.\n\nIn Japan, while cash is still widely used, embedded finance is starting to gain momentum and expected to hit US$ 36.29 billion by 2029, according to Business Wire. Rakuten has also introduced its own cryptocurrency wallets and exchange systems there, bringing embedded finance to new levels by allowing Rakuten Cash balance recharges via Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe global embedded finance market is projected to reach US$384.8 billion by 2029, while traditional banks stand to gain $92 billion in additional revenue from SMEs through embedded finance by 2025, LexisNexis also reports.\n\nKey benefits of embedded finance include faster payment processing, improved operational efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction, making it an attractive proposition for financial and non-financial businesses alike.\n\nAs Asia continues to lead global payment trends, embedded finance is unlocking new possibilities for innovation, inclusivity, and growth, positioning the region as a pioneer in shaping the future of financial services.\n\n4. Open Banking APIs Are Shaping the Future of Payments\n\nOpen banking is on the brink of rapid expansion in Southeast Asia, though progress varies across countries. This trend is fostering innovation and competition in the financial services sector.\n\nIn Singapore, the government-backed API Exchange is promoting API standardisation. Indonesia\u2019s Standard National Open API (SNAP) , on the other end, was launched to support the country\u2019s Indonesian Payment System Blueprint (BSPI) 2025 initiative, with the purpose to drive efficiency for bank digital payments.\n\nIn Hong Kong, HSBC introduced its first open banking feature on the local HSBC HK app, enabling its clientele to view account balances from Bank of China Hong Kong and Hang Seng Bank in real time. This was enabled via the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\u2019s Interbank Account Data Sharing (IADS) initiative.\n\nOpen banking APIs has the potential bolster B2B payments in the region. According to PYMNTS, APIs could potentially solving the complexity around account payable, account receivables, approval workflows and more, enabling more efficient and secure transactions between businesses, which is typically just one part of the entire process.\n\nIn the context of B2B payments, APIs allow financial institutions, payment processors, and business software platforms to seamlessly integrate payment capabilities into their existing systems. By simplifying the integration process, it lowers the barriers for businesses to adopt digital B2B payment solutions, enabling smoother transitions and greater accessibility.\n\nThis development could likely to have a significant impact on the overall payments ecosystem in Asia.\n\n5.The Need for Robust Cybersecurity Measures to Combat Financial Crime\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s digital economy is on track to exceed USD 300 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2025, presenting significant financial crime challenges, reports PwC. Non-bank financial service entrants, new to the system, often lack the robust cybersecurity infrastructure necessary to combat sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nThis deficiency is exacerbated by the growing consumer demand for faster payments with minimal checks, increasing vulnerability to financial crimes. The adoption of preventive technologies like biometrics and in-session analytical solutions is essential for comprehensive protection.\n\nMastercard has made efforts underway to phase out passwords with tokenization and biometrics by 2030 while in terms of Asian countries adopting the digital identity, Singapore is a pioneer with Singpass, a Smart Nation initiative.\n\nUsing biometrics, Singpass enables secure and convenient access to 800+ government agencies and businesses and over 2,700 services. Meanwhile, Malaysia is making steady strides with its MyDigital ID initiative, paving the way for advanced digital identity solutions, including eKYC verification in the near future.\n\nNotably, while Singapore and Malaysia rank high globally for cybersecurity based on the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2020, other Southeast Asian nations like Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia are ranked 99th, 131st, and 132nd out of 182 countries, respectively, PwC reports also.\n\nThis disparity suggests a pressing need to enhance cybersecurity across the region. Implementing digital IDs and related authentication mechanisms can play a pivotal role in counteracting criminal activities.\n\nA unified approach against financial crime is essential, and reliance on cross-border digital IDs may be key to eradicating synthetic ID fraud. Increased sharing of tactical information through intergovernmental or public-private partnerships could enable greater financial transparency and build stronger defences against financial crime.\n\nAsia\u2019s Digital Financial Frontier \u2013 Opportunities and Challenges Ahead\n\nAs we look towards 2025 and beyond, it\u2019s clear that Asia\u2019s payment landscape is at the forefront of global financial innovation. The region\u2019s embrace of digital wallets, real-time payments, BNPL services, cryptocurrencies, open banking, and advanced cybersecurity measures is creating a dynamic and interconnected financial ecosystem.\n\nThis transformation is not just about convenience; it\u2019s about financial inclusion, economic growth, and technological leadership.However, with great innovation comes great responsibility. As these trends accelerate, regulators, businesses, and consumers must work together to ensure that this digital financial revolution remains secure, inclusive, and sustainable.\n\nThe challenges of cybersecurity and regulatory compliance loom large, but so do the opportunities for unprecedented financial access and economic empowerment. Asia\u2019s payment trends for 2025 paint a picture of a region that is not just adapting to the future of finance, but actively shaping it.\n\nFrom China\u2019s dominance in digital payments to the rise of cryptocurrency in Vietnam and Indonesia, from the cross-border innovations in Singapore and Thailand to the BNPL boom across Southeast Asia, the region is setting the pace for global fintech innovation.\n\nAs we navigate this rapidly evolving landscape, one thing is certain: the way we think about and use money is changing forever, and Asia is leading the charge. The future of payments is not just digital \u2013 it\u2019s dynamic, diverse, and decidedly Asian.\n\nSource of image: edited from Freepik"

            "article_content": "You may not know it, but right now there\u2019s a huge cosmic rave party happening far, far above our heads. The chief partygoers are known as supermassive black holes. These mysterious objects can have masses several million or billion times that of the sun and are so dense that they warp spacetime around them.\n\nAs far as astronomers know, all galaxies harbour a supermassive black hole at their very centres. In some galaxies, large amounts of interstellar gas are spiralling around the supermassive black hole and getting pulled in beyond the event horizon and essentially onto the black hole. This process creates a huge amount of friction and energy, which can cause the \u201crave\u201d I\u2019m talking about \u2013 releasing huge amounts of light at many different colours and frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nIn some cases, the black hole will even spew jets of plasma, millions of light years across intergalactic space. The plasma gas is so hot that it\u2019s essentially a soup of electrons moving close to the speed of light. These plasma jets glow at radio frequencies, so they can be seen with a radio telescope and are, aptly, named radio galaxies. In a recent episode of the astronomy podcast The Cosmic Savannah, I likened their appearance to two glow sticks (the plasma jets) poking out of a ball of sticky tack (the galaxy). Astronomers hypothesise that the plasma jets keep expanding outwards as time passes, eventually growing so large that they become giant radio galaxies.\n\nBy 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered\n\nMillions of normally sized radio galaxies are known to science. But by 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered. They were considered rare. However, a new generation of radio telescopes, including South Africa\u2019s MeerKAT, have turned this idea on its head: in the past five years about 11 000 giants have been discovered.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s newest giant radio galaxy find is extraordinary. The plasma jets of this cosmic giant span 3.3 million light years from end to end \u2013 over 32 times the size of the Milky Way. I\u2019m one of the lead researchers who made the discovery. We\u2019ve nicknamed it Inkathazo, meaning \u201ctrouble\u201d in isiXhosa and isiZulu. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been a bit troublesome to understand the physics behind what\u2019s going on with Inkathazo.\n\nThis discovery has given us a unique opportunity to study giant radio galaxies. The findings challenge existing models and suggest that we don\u2019t yet understand much of the complicated plasma physics at play in these extreme galaxies.\n\nHere comes \u2018trouble\u2019\n\nThe MeerKAT telescope is in the Karoo, is made up of 64 radio dishes, and is operated and managed by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. It\u2019s a precursor to the Square Kilometre Array, which will, when it commences science operations around 2028, be the world\u2019s largest telescope.\n\nMeerKAT has already been pivotal in uncovering some of the hidden treasures of the southern sky since it was first commissioned in 2018.\n\nThis is the third giant radio galaxy that my collaborators and I have discovered with MeerKAT in a relatively small patch of sky near the equator, around the size of five full moons, that astronomers refer to as the \u201cCosmos field\u201d. We pointed MeerKAT at Cosmos during the early stages of the most advanced surveys of distant galaxies ever conducted: the International Gigahertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (Mightee).\n\nThe Mightee team, a collaboration of astronomers from around the world, and I first published the discovery of the two other giant radio galaxies in Cosmos in 2021.\n\nWe spotted Inkathazo more recently in my own MeerKAT follow-up observations of Cosmos, as well as in the full Mightee survey.\n\nHowever, Inkathazo differs from its cosmic companions in several ways. It doesn\u2019t have the same characteristics as many other giant radio galaxies. For example, the plasma jets have an unusual shape. Rather than extending straight across from end-to-end, one of the jets is bent.\n\nAdditionally, Inkathazo lives at the very centre of a cluster of galaxies, rather than in relative isolation, which should make it difficult for the plasma jets to grow to such enormous sizes. Its location in a cluster raises questions about the role of environmental interactions in the formation and evolution of these giant galaxies.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s exceptional capabilities are helping us to unravel this cosmic conundrum. We\u2019ve created some of the highest-resolution spectral maps ever made for giant radio galaxies. These maps track the age of the plasma across different parts of the galaxy, providing clues about the physical processes at work.\n\nThe results revealed intriguing complexities in Inkathazo\u2019s jets. Some electrons within the plasma jets receive unexpected boosts of energy. We think this may occur when the jets collide with hot gas in the voids between galaxies in a cluster. This gives us hints about what sort of plasma physics might be happening in these extreme parts of the universe that we didn\u2019t previously predict.\n\nA treasure trove\n\nThe fact that we unveiled three giant radio galaxies by pointing MeerKAT at a single patch of sky suggests that there\u2019s likely a huge treasure trove of these cosmic behemoths just waiting to be discovered in the southern sky. The telescope is incredibly powerful and it\u2019s in a perfect location for this kind of research, so it\u2019s ideally poised to uncover and learn more about giant radio galaxies in the years to come.\n\nKathleen Charlton, a master\u2019s student at the University of Cape Town, was the lead author of the research on which this article was based\n\nThe author, Jacinta Delhaize, is a lecturer at the University of Cape Town\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence.

            "article_content": "National Geographic Day, celebrated annually, honors the spirit of exploration, discovery, and understanding the world around us. It\u2019s a day dedicated to recognizing the achievements of the National Geographic Society, an organisation that has played a crucial role in advancing our knowledge of science, geography, history, and cultures through its iconic magazine, documentaries, and educational programs.\n\nThe roots of National Geographic go back to 1888, when the National Geographic Society was founded in Washington, D.C. Since then, it has become one of the most well-known and respected platforms for exploration, scientific research, and storytelling. Over the years, National Geographic has captured the imaginations of millions of people through breathtaking photography, compelling stories, and educational content that cover a wide range of topics\u2014from the depths of the ocean to the farthest reaches of outer space.\n\nNational Geographic Day serves as a reminder of the organisation\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of human understanding. It highlights the importance of conservation, exploration, and environmental sustainability. The day encourages people to learn more about the world\u2019s natural wonders, endangered species, and diverse cultures, fostering a sense of responsibility to protect and preserve the planet for future generations. In addition to its traditional work, National Geographic also focuses on inspiring young people to become scientists, explorers, and conservationists. The organization has launched several initiatives to engage students and teachers, providing them with tools and resources to learn about the world in interactive and meaningful ways. National Geographic\u2019s educational outreach efforts help nurture the curiosity of young minds and encourage them to take action toward creating a more sustainable future.\n\nOn National Geographic Day, schools, museums, and environmental organisations may hold special events, such as exhibits, film screenings, and educational activities. People around the world are encouraged to share their own stories of discovery, whether it\u2019s through travel, science, or their daily lives. The day brings people together in celebration of the wonders of our planet and the boundless possibilities for exploration and learning."

            "article_content": "Mark Thomson is professor of experimental particle physics at the University of Cambridge and was executive chair of the UK\u2019s Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) until his confirmation as CERN\u2019s next Director-General by the CERN Council in December. His five-year mandate will begin in January 2026.\n\nWhat motivates you to be CERN\u2019s next Director-General?\n\nCERN is an incredibly important organisation. I believe my deep passion for particle physics, coupled with the experience I have accumulated in recent years, including leading the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, DUNE, through a formative phase, and running the Science and Technology Facilities Council in the UK, has equipped me with the right skill set to lead CERN though a particularly important period.\n\nHow would you describe your management style?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. My overarching approach is built around delegating and trusting my team. This has two advantages. First, it builds an empowering culture, which in my experience provides the right environment for people to thrive. Second, it frees me up to focus on strategic planning and engagement with numerous key stakeholders. I like to focus on transparency and openness, to build trust both internally and externally.\n\nHow will you spend your familiarisation year before you take over in 2026?\n\nFirst, by getting a deep understanding of CERN \u201cfrom within\u201d, to plan how I want to approach my mandate. Second, by lending my voice to the scientific discussion that will underpin the third update to the European strategy for particle physics. The European strategy process is a key opportunity for the particle-physics community to provide genuine bottom-up input and shape the future. This is going to be a really varied and exciting year.\n\nWhat open question in fundamental physics would you most like to see answered in your lifetime?\n\nI am going to have to pick two. I would really like to understand the nature of dark matter. There are a wide range of possibilities, and we are addressing this question from multiple angles; the search for dark matter is an area where the collider and non-collider experiments can both contribute enormously. The second question is the nature of the Higgs field. The Higgs boson is just so different from anything else we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s not just unique \u2013 it\u2019s unique and very strange. There are just so many deep questions, such as whether it is fundamental or composite. I am confident that we will make progress in the coming years. I believe the High-Luminosity LHC will be able to make meaningful measurements of the self-coupling at the heart of the Higgs potential. If you\u2019d asked me five years ago whether this was possible, I would have been doubtful. But today I am very optimistic because of the rapid progress with advanced analysis techniques being developed by the brilliant scientists on the LHC experiments.\n\nWhat areas of R&D are most in need of innovation to meet our science goals?\n\nArtificial intelligence is changing how we look at data in all areas of science. Particle physics is the ideal testing ground for artificial intelligence, because our data is complex there are none of the issues around the sensitive nature of the data that exist in other fields. Complex multidimensional datasets are where you\u2019ll benefit the most from artificial intelligence. I\u2019m also excited by the emergence of new quantum technologies, which will open up fresh opportunities for our detector systems and also new ways of doing experiments in fundamental physics. We\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what can be achieved with entangled quantum systems.\n\nHow about in accelerator R&D?\n\nThere are two areas that I would like to highlight: making our current technologies more sustainable, and the development of high-field magnets based on high-temperature superconductivity. This connects to the question of innovation more broadly. To quote one example among many, high-temperature superconducting magnets are likely to be an important component of fusion reactors just as much as particle accelerators, making this a very exciting area where CERN can deploy its engineering expertise and really push that programme forward. That\u2019s not just a benefit for particle physics, but a benefit for wider society.\n\nHow has CERN changed since you were a fellow back in 1994?\n\nThe biggest change is that the collider experiments are larger and more complex, and the scientific and technical skills required have become more specialised. When I first came to CERN, I worked on the OPAL experiment at LEP \u2013 a collaboration of less than 400 people. Everybody knew everybody, and it was relatively easy to understand the science of the whole experiment.\n\nMy overarching approach is built around delegating and trusting my team\n\nBut I don\u2019t think the scientific culture of CERN and the particle-physics community has changed much. When I visit CERN and meet with the younger scientists, I see the same levels of excitement and enthusiasm. People are driven by the wonderful mission of discovery. When planning the future, we need to ensure that early-career researchers can see a clear way forward with opportunities in all periods of their career. This is essential for the long-term health of particle physics. Today we have an amazing machine that\u2019s running beautifully: the LHC. I also don\u2019t think it is possible to overstate the excitement of the High-Luminosity LHC. So there\u2019s a clear and exciting future out to the early 2040s for today\u2019s early-career researchers. The question is what happens beyond that? This is one reason to ensure that there is not a large gap between the end of the High-Luminosity LHC and the start of whatever comes next.\n\nShould the world be aligning on a single project?\n\nGiven the increasing scale of investment, we do have to focus as a global community, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a single project. We saw something similar about 10 years ago when the global neutrino community decided to focus its efforts on two complementary long-baseline projects, DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. From the perspective of today\u2019s European strategy, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) is an extremely appealing project that would map out an exciting future for CERN for many decades. I think we\u2019ll see this come through strongly in an open and science-driven European strategy process.\n\nHow do you see the scientific case for the FCC?\n\nFor me, there are two key points. First, gaining a deep understanding of the Higgs boson is the natural next step in our field. We have discovered something truly unique, and we should now explore its properties to gain deeper insights into fundamental physics. Scientifically, the FCC provides everything you want from a Higgs factory, both in terms of luminosity and the opportunity to support multiple experiments.\n\nSecond, investment in the FCC tunnel will provide a route to hadron\u2013hadron collisions at the 100 TeV scale. I find it difficult to foresee a future where we will not want this capability.\n\nThese two aspects make the FCC a very attractive proposition.\n\nHow successful do you believe particle physics is in communicating science and societal impacts to the public and to policymakers?\n\nI think we communicate science well. After all, we\u2019ve got a great story. People get the idea that we work to understand the universe at its most basic level. It\u2019s a simple and profound message.\n\nGoing beyond the science, the way we communicate the wider industrial and societal impact is probably equally important. Here we also have a good story. In our experiments we are always pushing beyond the limits of current technology, doing things that have not been done before. The technologies we develop to do this almost always find their way back into something that will have wider applications. Of course, when we start, we don\u2019t know what the impact will be. That\u2019s the strength and beauty of pushing the boundaries of technology for science.\n\nWould the FCC give a strong return on investment to the member states?\n\nAbsolutely. Part of the return is the science, part is the investment in technology, and we should not underestimate the importance of the training opportunities for young people across Europe. CERN provides such an amazing and inspiring environment for young people. The scale of the FCC will provide a huge number of opportunities for young scientists and engineers.\n\nWe need to ensure that early-career researchers can see a clear way forward with opportunities in all periods of their career. This is essential for the long-term health of particle physics\n\nIn terms of technology development, the detectors for the electron\u2013positron collider will provide an opportunity for pushing forward and deploying new, advanced technologies to deliver the precision required for the science programme. In parallel, the development of the magnet technologies for the future hadron collider will be really exciting, particularly the potential use of high-temperature superconductors, as I said before.\n\nIt is always difficult to predict the specific \u201creturn on investment\u201d on the technologies for big scientific research infrastructure. Part of this challenge is that some of that benefits might be 20, 30, 40 years down the line. Nevertheless, every retrospective that has tried, has demonstrated that you get a huge downstream benefit.\n\nDo we reward technical innovation well enough in high-energy physics?\n\nThere needs to be a bit of a culture shift within our community. Engineering and technology innovation are critical to the future of science and critical to the prosperity of Europe. We should be striving to reward individuals working in these areas.\n\nShould the field make it more flexible for physicists and engineers to work in industry and return to the field having worked there?\n\nThis is an important question. I actually think things are changing. The fluidity between academia and industry is increasing in both directions. For example, an early-career researcher in particle physics with a background in deep artificial-intelligence techniques is valued incredibly highly by industry. It also works the other way around, and I experienced this myself in my career when one of my post-doctoral researchers joined from an industry background after a PhD in particle physics. The software skills they picked up from industry were incredibly impactful.\n\nI don\u2019t think there is much we need to do to directly increase flexibility \u2013 it\u2019s more about culture change, to recognise that fluidity between industry and academia is important and beneficial. Career trajectories are evolving across many sectors. People move around much more than they did in the past.\n\nDoes CERN have a future as a global laboratory?\n\nCERN already is a global laboratory. The amazing range of nationalities working here is both inspiring and a huge benefit to CERN.\n\nHow can we open up opportunities in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nI am really passionate about the importance of diversity in all its forms and this includes national and regional inclusivity. It is an agenda that I pursued in my last two positions. At the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, I was really keen to engage the scientific community from Latin America, and I believe this has been mutually beneficial. At STFC, we used physics as a way to provide opportunities for people across Africa to gain high-tech skills. Going beyond the training, one of the challenges is to ensure that people use these skills in their home nations. Otherwise, you\u2019re not really helping low- and middle-income countries to develop.\n\nWhat message would you like to leave with readers?\n\nThat we have really only just started the LHC programme. With more than a factor of 10 increase in data to come, coupled with new data tools and upgraded detectors, the High-Luminosity LHC represents a major opportunity for a new discovery. Its nature could be a complete surprise. That\u2019s the whole point of exploring the unknown: you don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there. This alone is incredibly exciting, and it is just a part of CERN\u2019s amazing future."

            "article_content": "What does an ideal computer science building at Stanford look like? For Benji Welner \u201927, it looks a lot like the newest addition to Stanford\u2019s campus \u2014 the almost finished Computing and Data Science complex, known as CoDa.\n\nThe building\u2019s designers \u201care doing all sorts of weird things, and they really all work,\u201d said Welner, one of several students to already take advantage of the building\u2019s study space.\n\nBuilt with the goal of catalyzing interdisciplinary work between the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities and Sciences, CoDa has been five years in the making. Architects began working on the project in 2019 and construction took place from 2022 to 2024. CoDa will now house the popular computer science (CS) major, both data science majors \u2014 the B.S. and the B.A. \u2014 and the symbolic systems major, along with research labs and space for collaborative work. Faculty began moving into the building just last week on Jan. 21, and the building is now open to Stanford affiliates.\n\nChris Mentzel M.S. \u201915, the executive director of Stanford Data Science, is hopeful that the design of the building will help foster interdepartmental collaboration. \u201cThe design of the building has people from different departments on every floor. It has a lot of meeting areas and it has a lot of open public spaces,\u201d said Mentzel.\n\nStanford Data Science, not to be confused with the data science program that grants undergraduate degrees, is a research unit under the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. Their mission, according to their website, involves connecting data science discoveries with other labs and institutions on campus to \u201cenable data-driven discovery at scale.\u201d\n\nStanford Data Science previously borrowed space in Wallenberg Hall. It is now one of many programs that will now be housed in the CoDa. Excited to have a home base, Mentzel and the rest of Stanford Data Science have already moved into their offices on the other side of Jane Stanford Way.\n\nMentzel is particularly excited about the central set of red staircases, which resemble a double helix.\n\n\u201cThat stairwell actually is connected to the kitchens and open public seating for everyone on the Stanford campus to come and enjoy on all four floors \u2014 so there\u2019s kind of natural places for people to be and connect, even for people who aren\u2019t occupants of the building,\u201d he said.\n\nThe design process for the CoDa complex was thorough and collaborative, according to Kevin Manalili, Director of Facilities and Planning for the School of Engineering.\n\n\u201cWe involved focus groups of faculty, staff and students to help define the desired look and feel, with a mix of offices, meeting rooms, community spaces and large classrooms,\u201d Manalili said.\n\nManalili acknowledged that the project had its challenges, including being \u201cinterrupted by the pandemic, last-minute vendor changes and supply-chain shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt required lots of time and effort, but we worked extremely well together,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to its interdisciplinary focus, the CoDa complex balances a focus on research with a focus on students. Manalili noted that the garden level on the ground floor will be mostly undergraduate focused, with classrooms, group rooms for TA office hours and flexible indoor and outdoor work spaces. The upper floors will serve as workspaces for the research initiatives housed in the building. Bridging the two, the first floor will house administrative services for many undergraduate majors and a new coffee shop, Voyager Craft Coffee. For Manalili, \u201cCoDa provides much needed collaboration spaces and room for department growth.\u201d\n\nVoyager Craft Coffee is new to Stanford\u2019s campus, although they already have a location at neighboring Santa Clara University. Menu items include traditional drinks and pastries, as well as signature dishes such as avocado hummus toast and a \u201cpull-apart-uffin\u201d monkey bread muffin.\n\nMentzel hopes the coffee shop will be a draw for students and faculty alike.\n\n\u201cYou need good coffee if you\u2019re going to have community, just the fuel that keeps people talking and connected,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to a new coffee spot, students can look forward to comfortable chairs, monitor and video conference capability, natural lighting and a modern feel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an architect or an architecture major,\u201d Welner said, \u201cbut there\u2019s art that is part of the building in a very natural way and that makes each piece playful and entertaining in its own right.\u201d\n\nThough the building is still undergoing final touches, and Voyager coffee will not move in until February, students have already begun taking advantage of the space. Sparsely populated for the time being, students believe the CoDa complex is poised to become a favored study hub.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tons of rooms and I\u2019m really excited for when this eventually becomes popularized. I anticipate spending a lot of time here,\u201d Welner said."

            "article_content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI Assistant on Monday overtook rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple's App Store in the United States.\n\nPowered by the DeepSeek-V3 model, which its creators say \"tops the leaderboard among open-source models and rivals the most advanced closed-source models globally\", the artificial intelligence application has surged in popularity among U.S. users since it was released on Jan. 10, according to app data research firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThe milestone highlights how DeepSeek has left a deep impression on Silicon Valley, upending widely held views about U.S. primacy in AI and the effectiveness of Washington's export controls targeting China's advanced chip and AI capabilities.\n\nAI models from ChatGPT to DeepSeek require advanced chips to power their training. The Biden administration has since 2021 widened the scope of bans designed to stop these chips from being exported to China and used to train Chinese firms' AI models.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 used Nvidia's H800 chips for training, spending less than $6 million.\n\nAlthough this detail has since been disputed, the claim that the chips used were less powerful than the most advanced Nvidia products Washington has sought to keep out of China, as well as the relatively cheap training costs, has prompted U.S. tech executives to question the effectiveness of tech export controls.\n\nLittle is known about the company behind DeepSeek, a small Hangzhou-based startup founded in 2023, when search engine giant Baidu released the first Chinese AI large-language model.\n\nSince then, dozens of Chinese tech companies large and small have released their own AI models, but DeepSeek is the first to be praised by the U.S. tech industry as matching or even surpassing the performance of cutting-edge U.S. models.\n\n(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista.

In addition, the trailing 12-month (TTM) trend in revenue shows that after a spike between FY21 and FY22 amid the post-pandemic boom, the revenue growth for each of the five companies has fallen below the levels seen five years ago, impacted by a slack in the demand for discretionary projects - long-term contracts which are transformational in nature - amid the rising focus of clients to achieve cost efficiency for existing processes.The TTM method tends to smoothen out quarterly volatility thereby offering a better understanding of the long-term trend. Considering the TTM dollar denominated revenue, the aggregate revenue of the top five IT exporters recorded a year-on-year growth of 2.4% in the December quarter, led by 5.3% growth in the country's third largest IT exporter HCLTech's TTM revenue at $13,771.8 million and 4% in $30,077 million revenue reported by TCS , the largest IT exporter. On the other hand Wipro and Tech Mahindra , the fourth and the fifth largest Indian IT exporters by that order showed a drop of 3.6% and 2.1% respectively in their TTM revenues. For Infosys , the second largest IT exporter, TTM revenue rose by 3% to $6,263.3 million.Though the December quarter TTM revenue growth for the sample was the highest in four quarters, it has been on a gradual decline compared with the growth ten quarters ago. For instance, it peaked at 18.1% in the March 2022 quarter on the back of a tepid 1.7% increase in the year-ago quarter affected due to the Covid pandemic. However, since the March 2022 quarter, it has gradually fallen.The top line growth is expected to pick up in the coming quarters amid hopes of a revival in discretionary projects. Each of the top companies continued to report a sustained momentum in new deal wins in the December quarter thereby improving revenue visibility. In rupee terms, the sample's aggregate revenue rose by 0.9% to \u20b91.7 lakh crore while net profit grew by 3.7% to \u20b928,126 crore in the December quarter. HCLTech reported the strongest growth of 3.6% and 8.4% in revenue and net profit at \u20b929,890 crore and \u20b94,591 crore in that order."

            "article_content": "Agentic artificial intelligence is set to transform business this year, replacing workers as the technology can think and make decisions, offering companies the chance to cut costs\n\nListen to this article\n\nAccording to Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025.\n\nLeading businesses in Thailand have begun to embrace agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to pilot selective tasks, in a bid to explore its benefits.\n\nThe term refers to an AI system with enhanced autonomy, decision-making capabilities and adaptability. Agentic AI systems autonomously plan and take actions to meet user-defined goals, offering the promise of a virtual workforce that can offload and augment human work.\n\nAccording to global research and consultancy Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025 that is poised to drive innovation, offering significant business benefits by providing a virtual workforce of AI agents.\n\nHowever, the implementation of agentic AI also presents challenges, particularly in ensuring that these autonomous systems are aligned with the intentions of both the providers and users.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish robust safeguards and guardrails that guarantee AI's actions remain consistent with the desired outcomes, said Gartner.\n\nThe company predicts by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, enabling 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made autonomously.\n\nFirst in the region\n\n\"In 2025, agentic AI will be a key trend, combining AI and automation,\" said Anothai Wettayakorn, managing director of IBM Thailand.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI marks a significant shift in the future of work, with AI agents autonomously executing tasks, collaborating with human workers, and driving value across businesses, he said.\n\nIn Thailand, IBM successfully completed a pilot initiative using generative AI (GenAI) to automate laboratory orders, enhancing patient diagnosis and improving confidence, quality and speed in treatment.\n\nThis collaboration took place with Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, an affiliate of Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Medicine.\n\nThis was the first agentic AI use in Southeast Asia for healthcare, said Mr Anothai.\n\nAfter an eight-month pilot and an investment of 10 million baht, IBM's agentic AI technology leverages existing automation in the hospital's laboratory and hospital data system to speed up patient services.\n\nThe initiative minimises repetitive tasks for doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij Lojanapiwat, faculty dean at the university.\n\nIBM's client engineering team worked alongside the faculty to build a model using IBM AI platforms to analyse and interpret doctors' notes, recommend treatment pathways, and automatically handle laboratory orders.\n\nAI can suggest pathology laboratory tests based on a patient's medical record and trends, and doctors can then verify the suggestions.\n\nOnce approved by doctors, the AI automates the lab orders and schedules the patient's follow-up appointments, alleviating the workload for both doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij.\n\nThe collaboration complemented the hospital's recent implementation of a fully automated medical laboratory system.\n\nBuilt on transparent, reliable data and global AI governance standards, this initiative was meant to improve service efficiency and support medical decision-making with accurate and comprehensive insights, enhancing treatment quality and speed, according to IBM.\n\nThe project eases high-volume workloads, reducing the time spent in the lab order process and on scheduling patient appointments. As a result, it cuts the time spent by patients in medical check-ups at the hospital by 30-40 minutes, down from the current 150 minutes, he said.\n\nThe hospital has around 1.6 million patients a year. For the project, physicians also help to train the AI system.\n\n\"This milestone highlights our vision to lead in service excellence, treatment and research -- not just in Chiang Mai or Thailand, but across Southeast Asia,\" said Dr Bannakij.\n\nDr Krit Khwanngern, deputy dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, said the system does not store patients' real names, instead anonymising them to protect sensitive data and comply with the Personal Data Protection Act.\n\nIn the future, the hospital will analyse patient medical check-up data and use it to offer preventive healthcare services on a more personalised basis, said Dr Krit.\n\n\"Agentic AI is leveraged with the digital improvements we've invested in over the past few years by integrating different systems from physicians, nurses, pharmacies, and electronic medical records for both inpatient and outpatient care. This provides a strong data infrastructure on the back end, which leads to improved services on the front end,\" he said.\n\n\"We also invested 300 million baht in cybersecurity to ensure strong capabilities to secure sensitive data.\"\n\nThe project was successful because of the ability of the hospital's in-house teams to work together with external tech experts, while its physicians have technical knowledge that can design systems to serve users' needs, said Dr Krit.\n\nThe hospital continues to adopt advanced technologies, he said.\n\nThe faculty piloted IBM's AutoAI to support the development of patient service apps, enabling data scientists to write code more efficiently and reduce development time for future apps that will enhance patient treatment and services, said Dr Krit.\n\nMany executives note that humans will still be required to operate AI in a responsible manner.\n\nAgentic AI in banking\n\n\"2025 will be the year of agentic AI and we've been working on responsible agentic AI since the beginning of this year,\" said Ruangroj Poonpol, chairman of Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG), the technology arm of Kasikornbank.\n\nAgentic AI will be an essential tool for KBTG to accelerate its organisational transformation, he said. An AI agent can perceive, make decisions, take action and achieve goals in its own environment.\n\n\"It's a digital workforce without the need of a vacation, providing even more productivity uplift than before. We need to upskill, reskill, and learn how to use it and when to use it,\" said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nIn 2025, KBTG will focus on fostering collaboration between humans and AI, while ensuring a human-centric approach, he said. With human-AI convergence for value creation, KBTG's performance will be faster and more productive than ever, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nHe said this focus will be driven by a few elements, including the use of new platforms to efficiently manage AI agents, enabling seamless collaboration with human workers.\n\nOne of the platforms is AthenaMind, an internal tool designed as an AI agent creation hub, or \"AI agent factory\", for building AI agents for various applications.\n\nAnother element is an agentic orchestration, involving the design of new operational workflows to enable AI agents and humans to work together more effectively and drive business outcomes.\n\nFor example, KBTG introduced an AI coding assistant to improve software development, reducing software developers' working hours by 20%. So far, more than 500,000 lines of code have been generated using AI.\n\nThe next step is to evolve this AI assistant into a fully functional AI coding agent, capable of independently writing code from start to finish based on clear requirements, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nKBTG equips its employees with the right mindset, skills, and an open work culture to integrate AI into their daily tasks, he said. The company achieved 100% AI literacy, ensuring all employees are knowledgeable and prepared to work alongside AI technology in their roles.\n\nKBTG wants this human-AI convergence project to generate more than 10 billion baht in business impact by 2029, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nRetail uses\n\nAxel Winter, chief executive of Xponential, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform and innovation consultancy, said the opportunities for AI agents are vast in the retail sector.\n\n\"For example, agents could dynamically create promotions based on real-time data such as customer sentiment, inventory levels and sales trends,\" he said.\n\nThey can also generate and deploy marketing campaigns across various channels, which are particularly relevant in the fast-paced Southeast Asian e-commerce landscape.\n\n\"It's important to recognise not all AI technologies being promoted are fully mature, and the field is in constant flux. It is vital to remain flexible, keep a close eye on both established vendors and the open-source community, and be prepared to adapt and innovate rapidly,\" said Mr Winter.\n\nWidespread in 2026\n\nPhiphat Prapapanpong, director of advanced insights at Bluebik Group, a SET-listed tech consulting firm, said the adoption of AI-driven agentic workflows, which leverage GenAI capabilities with business processes, will emerge as a key trend in AI development.\n\n\"This year marks the beginning of the agentic AI era, with large enterprises -- particularly banks, insurance companies and retailers -- starting to pilot its use internally,\" he said.\n\nBy next year, Mr Phiphat said he expects agentic AI to become more widespread and transition into full deployment.\n\nHe said organisations piloting agentic AI aim to enhance employee productivity without additional hiring. For example, procurement processes can use agentic AI to seek better prices and sourcing.\n\nJob losses and opportunities\n\nPanutat Tejasen, a pioneer in AI development, said the adoption of agentic AI is accelerating because it can integrate with business workflows, delivering tangible results for return on investment.\n\nHe said many jobs will be replaced as agentic AI takes over tasks. For example, roles in customer service, procurement and data entry are likely to be automated.\n\n\"You will see machine agents communicating with other machines. A procurement agent, for example, will negotiate with a sales agent, with less human involvement,\" said Mr Panutat.\n\nHe said agentic AI will also open up new opportunities in software development.\n\nThanachart Numnonda, executive director of IMC Institute, a tech research and training firm, said agentic AI is still being used for specific and small-scale tasks.\n\n\"This opens up new opportunities for developers to build agentic AI services tailored for businesses,\" he said.\n\nMr Thanachart said he does not think agentic AI will make the SaaS business obsolete, as it still requires software as its foundation.\n\n\"Humans are still in the loop and work alongside AI,\" he said."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek has rolled out AI models that are a lot cheaper than OpenAI's offerings.\n\nAI models are mostly trained on public data, making differentiation challenging.\n\nDeepSeek's open-source models challenge OpenAI's proprietary approach.\n\nThe cost of using AI models has been plunging as competition intensifies and it becomes increasingly easy to catch, match, and even beat the top-performing offerings.\n\nHaving a leading AI model is nowhere near as special as it was two years ago. These models are mostly trained on data that's publicly available on the internet, so they're not that much different from each other. Standing out in this crowd and charging premium prices is increasingly difficult.\n\nIn recent weeks, DeepSeek has taken this pricing dynamic to a new level. The Chinese AI lab rolled out models that are as good as, or better, than the best products from OpenAI, the pioneering creator of ChatGPT.\n\nThat's impressive. But what's potentially more disruptive is how cheap DeepSeek's models are.\n\nBernstein tech analysts studied DeepSeek's offerings in recent days and found that the Chinese AI lab is massively undercutting OpenAI on price.\n\n\"DeepSeek's pricing blows away anything from the competition, with the company pricing their models anywhere from 20-40x cheaper than equivalent models from OpenAI,\" the analysts wrote in a note to investors on Sunday.\n\nDeepSeek and OpenAI pricing compared Bernstein Research\n\nThe chart above shows the cost of \" tokens ,\" which have become the raw material of generative AI. Chatbots and AI models break down words and other inputs into these tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about three-quarters of a word.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWhen AI companies are handling prompts and other model inputs and outputs, they often charge users based on a per-token price. DeepSeek's Reasoner model costs 55 cents for every 1 million tokens inputted. Meanwhile, OpenAI's o1 model charges $15 for the same number of tokens, according to Bernstein.\n\nThe Bernstein analysts also noted that DeepSeek's models are open-source, which means they are available to anyone who wants to work with them, for free. That's a contrast to OpenAI, which keeps its top models proprietary and closed, while charging relatively high prices for the products.\n\n\"The whole thing brings up some very interesting questions about the role and viability of proprietary versus open-source efforts that are probably worth doing more work on,\" the Bernstein analysts wrote.\n\nDeepSeek's newly-released flagship model is now No. 1 on Apple's free apps chart \u2014 just ahead of ChatGPT."

            "article_content": "Yet, over the past years, we\u2019ve seen the emergence of a confluence of factors (including sourcing from automated, AI-generated social media trawls and strongly politicized information collection), which will inevitably create a distortion in conflict data. And it will have a detrimental effect on what people will come to know about conflict, how we respond to or engage with threats and risks, whose security we value and whose human rights we uphold.\n\nAs conflict rates continue to rise, we need accurate, reliable and good-faith evidence to stem the tide.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent decision to stop independent fact-checking on Facebook and Threads, starting in the U.S., is a culmination of all this. Of course, it\u2019s not like Facebook\u2019s fact-checking was holding back the wave of misinformation \u2014 and the decision to move away from often highly politicized decisions does have merit. However, this comes at a moment when we\u2019re experiencing a decrease in the quality and quantity of accurate information; public consciousness is against expertise that challenges preconceived ideas; and both public and private information flows prioritize fast data \u2014 regardless of quality.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly an audience for fast information: Most young people get their news through brief, visual messages \u2014 if they get any at all. And in order to grab attention in this ecosystem, conflict news often pushes extremely unreliable death tolls or blame narratives that are simplistic and skewed, resulting in a conflict news cycle that is both brutal and perversely entertaining.\n\nThere\u2019s also little pushback against highly exaggerated and unproven fatality counts that are put out to emphasize the depth of destruction. The number of people killed in conflict is extremely difficult to measure accurately \u2014 even when that conflict is extensively covered, like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. In cases of largely forgotten conflicts, like that in Sudan, who is going to check whether it was actually 100,000 or 150,000 people who were killed? (In reality, both these numbers are exaggerations, yet both appeared in print in major publications this week.)\n\nWho checks these figures? My team and I do."

            "article_content": "I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a Mario and Zelda machine ever since. It\u2019s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch\u2019s best trick \u2014 pick-up-and-play portability \u2014 while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.\n\nBut the Nintendo Switch 2, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be the console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use its detachable Joy-Cons\u2019 many tricks, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC \u2014 or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.\n\nThe Switch 2\u2019s newly magnetic Joy-Con. Gif: Nintendo\n\nThe Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. If history\u2019s any indication, it should easily sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was almost nothing to play but Zelda, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip \u2014 but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the largest and most welcoming libraries of all time, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.\n\nSo: How can the budding handheld PC revolution escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won\u2019t say I know for sure, but I did just check the industry\u2019s temperature at CES 2025, the world\u2019s biggest tech show \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.\n\nHandheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck\u2019s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the 8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Lenovo Legion Go S, to the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2, and the giant 11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon, even the largest Windows handhelds didn\u2019t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.\n\nThere are four places I think the industry has to change \u2014 and maybe, band together \u2014 if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.\n\nA year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo\u2019s handhelds in particular. (The new one\u2019s on the left.) Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto\n\nOperating system\n\nBuyers need to know that their game will be ready to play when they press the power button on a handheld. That\u2019s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it\u2019s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded \u2014 but it\u2019s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.\n\nThat\u2019s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today\u2019s version of handheld Windows.\n\nFirst, Lenovo revealed it would produce the first authorized third-party handheld to ship with Valve\u2019s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows \u2014 something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds as soon as this April. Third, a Microsoft executive told The Verge that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining \u201cthe best of Xbox and Windows together.\u201d\n\nThese moves are heartening, as it\u2019s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn\u2019t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They\u2019re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too \u2014 to the point that today, a community-created fork of Valve\u2019s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience than Windows.\n\nIt\u2019s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we\u2019ve already seen the Deck can\u2019t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers don\u2019t see the raw sales numbers to bring big multiplayer games like Fortnite or Valorant to SteamOS. (They say cheaters are too big a risk.)\n\nBut, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet hard \u2014 not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won\u2019t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.\n\nNo other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, with a claim that was apparently false or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it\u2019d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.\n\nCES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they\u2019re not necessarily a bad idea! Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nScreen\n\nThis one\u2019s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should universally adopt a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.\n\nMany PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won\u2019t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld without a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate \u2014 VRR was the Asus ROG Ally\u2019s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals\u2019 chips offered the same FPS.\n\nLastly, HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s screen, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they\u2019re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It\u2019s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today\u2019s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.\n\nIs a screen like the one I\u2019m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.\n\nChips and battery\n\nUnless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom Aerith and Sephiroth parts for the Steam Deck feel like the only ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD\u2019s new Z2 line might not be all that different.\n\nAMD\u2019s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn\u2019t originally for handheld; they\u2019re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.\n\nThe Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it\u2019s looking at running its Legion Go S\u2019s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.\n\nAMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company\u2019s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC\u2019s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it\u2019s not a leap forward. That may require AMD\u2019s even newer RDNA 4 graphics, and it may require bespoke processors.\n\nThe MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath if you\u2019re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s why MSI hasn\u2019t fully launched the Claw as expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel certainly has bigger fish to fry right now than making custom handheld chips. \u201cIt\u2019s not a market that we\u2019re actively pursuing, but it\u2019s a market we\u2019re happy to enable,\u201d Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. \u201cIt is somewhat extracurricular,\u201d he added, explaining that it\u2019s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. \u201cWe\u2019re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.\u201d.\n\nSome manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today\u2019s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack \u2014 the Asus ROG Ally X doubled the size of its predecessor\u2019s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it\u2019s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can only be partially engineered away.\n\nWe need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.\n\nThe Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior. Photo by The Verge\n\nPrice\n\nThe PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo\u2019s lunch.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 \u2014 around $380 in today\u2019s money \u2014 and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve\u2019s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.\n\nOnly the least expensive model of Lenovo\u2019s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S will lower that bar to $499 this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it\u2019s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell said it was \u201cpainful\u201d but \u201ccritical\u201d to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the razor-and-blades business model where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that\u2019s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world\u2019s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.\n\nBut not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss less than a year after its debut. So it\u2019s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S\u2019s price, for example.\n\nTo compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of portable Xboxes or PlayStations or Steam Machines, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum."

            "article_content": "You may not know it, but right now there\u2019s a huge cosmic rave party happening far, far above our heads. The chief partygoers are known as supermassive black holes. These mysterious objects can have masses several million or billion times that of the sun and are so dense that they warp spacetime around them.\n\nAs far as astronomers know, all galaxies harbour a supermassive black hole at their very centres. In some galaxies, large amounts of interstellar gas are spiralling around the supermassive black hole and getting pulled in beyond the event horizon and essentially onto the black hole. This process creates a huge amount of friction and energy, which can cause the \u201crave\u201d I\u2019m talking about \u2013 releasing huge amounts of light at many different colours and frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nIn some cases, the black hole will even spew jets of plasma, millions of light years across intergalactic space. The plasma gas is so hot that it\u2019s essentially a soup of electrons moving close to the speed of light. These plasma jets glow at radio frequencies, so they can be seen with a radio telescope and are, aptly, named radio galaxies. In a recent episode of the astronomy podcast The Cosmic Savannah, I likened their appearance to two glow sticks (the plasma jets) poking out of a ball of sticky tack (the galaxy). Astronomers hypothesise that the plasma jets keep expanding outwards as time passes, eventually growing so large that they become giant radio galaxies.\n\nBy 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered\n\nMillions of normally sized radio galaxies are known to science. But by 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered. They were considered rare. However, a new generation of radio telescopes, including South Africa\u2019s MeerKAT, have turned this idea on its head: in the past five years about 11 000 giants have been discovered.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s newest giant radio galaxy find is extraordinary. The plasma jets of this cosmic giant span 3.3 million light years from end to end \u2013 over 32 times the size of the Milky Way. I\u2019m one of the lead researchers who made the discovery. We\u2019ve nicknamed it Inkathazo, meaning \u201ctrouble\u201d in isiXhosa and isiZulu. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been a bit troublesome to understand the physics behind what\u2019s going on with Inkathazo.\n\nThis discovery has given us a unique opportunity to study giant radio galaxies. The findings challenge existing models and suggest that we don\u2019t yet understand much of the complicated plasma physics at play in these extreme galaxies.\n\nHere comes \u2018trouble\u2019\n\nThe MeerKAT telescope is in the Karoo, is made up of 64 radio dishes, and is operated and managed by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. It\u2019s a precursor to the Square Kilometre Array, which will, when it commences science operations around 2028, be the world\u2019s largest telescope.\n\nMeerKAT has already been pivotal in uncovering some of the hidden treasures of the southern sky since it was first commissioned in 2018.\n\nThis is the third giant radio galaxy that my collaborators and I have discovered with MeerKAT in a relatively small patch of sky near the equator, around the size of five full moons, that astronomers refer to as the \u201cCosmos field\u201d. We pointed MeerKAT at Cosmos during the early stages of the most advanced surveys of distant galaxies ever conducted: the International Gigahertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (Mightee).\n\nThe Mightee team, a collaboration of astronomers from around the world, and I first published the discovery of the two other giant radio galaxies in Cosmos in 2021.\n\nWe spotted Inkathazo more recently in my own MeerKAT follow-up observations of Cosmos, as well as in the full Mightee survey.\n\nHowever, Inkathazo differs from its cosmic companions in several ways. It doesn\u2019t have the same characteristics as many other giant radio galaxies. For example, the plasma jets have an unusual shape. Rather than extending straight across from end-to-end, one of the jets is bent.\n\nAdditionally, Inkathazo lives at the very centre of a cluster of galaxies, rather than in relative isolation, which should make it difficult for the plasma jets to grow to such enormous sizes. Its location in a cluster raises questions about the role of environmental interactions in the formation and evolution of these giant galaxies.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s exceptional capabilities are helping us to unravel this cosmic conundrum. We\u2019ve created some of the highest-resolution spectral maps ever made for giant radio galaxies. These maps track the age of the plasma across different parts of the galaxy, providing clues about the physical processes at work.\n\nThe results revealed intriguing complexities in Inkathazo\u2019s jets. Some electrons within the plasma jets receive unexpected boosts of energy. We think this may occur when the jets collide with hot gas in the voids between galaxies in a cluster. This gives us hints about what sort of plasma physics might be happening in these extreme parts of the universe that we didn\u2019t previously predict.\n\nA treasure trove\n\nThe fact that we unveiled three giant radio galaxies by pointing MeerKAT at a single patch of sky suggests that there\u2019s likely a huge treasure trove of these cosmic behemoths just waiting to be discovered in the southern sky. The telescope is incredibly powerful and it\u2019s in a perfect location for this kind of research, so it\u2019s ideally poised to uncover and learn more about giant radio galaxies in the years to come.\n\nKathleen Charlton, a master\u2019s student at the University of Cape Town, was the lead author of the research on which this article was based\n\nThe author, Jacinta Delhaize, is a lecturer at the University of Cape Town\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence.

            "article_content": "The research was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (\u211623-71-01047). The research findings have been published in the Physica Scripta.\n\nResearch into quantum physics often requires the use of complex mathematical models to describe open systems. The main problem in describing quantum systems is the solution of nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations, which describe systems with nonlocal interactions. Such equations do not always yield exact solutions, and when they do, they often do not cover the full range of physical situations. Asymptotic methods provide approximate solutions and cannot claim to be absolutely accurate. Nevertheless, asymptotic methods help to describe the system dynamics to a considerable extent.\n\nOur project deals with equations with the so-called non-Hermitean part, i.e., open systems. Real systems are exactly like this, since our world is infinite, i.e. a closed system is always only an approximation on any scale. We use the method of quasi-classical approximation to describe open quantum systems, which is something between classical Newtonian mechanics and quantum mechanics. And, of course, it is only relatively \u2018simplified\u2019, because you still need to be a specialist in the corresponding field of knowledge to understand and make use of it. The challenge of working with this kind of equations is that they do not assume exact solutions except for a very small number of specific cases. Therefore, we have to use asymptotic (approximate) methods, \u2014 says Anton Kulagin, co-author of the study and associate professor at TPU's Division for Electronic Engineering.\n\nTo verify their calculations, the researchers compared the results with already known exact solutions or approximate models, published experimental data, and also used numerical verification methods, although these often do not provide a complete understanding of the physical processes. According to the scientists, analytical and numerical methods that can solve such nonlinear equations are very limited.\n\n\u201cNumerical solutions to equations are like exploring a black box. You define some input data and get the output data. You can only guess what was actually going on inside in terms of the physics of the process. Analytical methods, on the contrary, can explicitly state some physical regularities and explain the underlying processes. However, they are limited in describing quantum systems, especially when it comes to nonlinear nonlocal interactions between components and non-trivial geometry due to the complexity of the resulting mathematical constructions. Our approach seems to be the only possible solution to this class of problems with the same level of generality\u201d, \u2013 adds the scientist.\n\nThe TPU approach can form the basis for understanding the physics of solutions to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and, consequently, the nature of superconducting vortices. In addition, the TPU scientists' research can help describe the dynamics of superfluid gases, which are used to create erasable masks in atom lithography."

            "article_content": "Listen to article\n\nIn the history of mankind, few ideas have profoundly reshaped how we understand nature and its processes. One such breakthrough was the advent of quantum mechanics, which emerged a century ago and continues to transform our understanding of reality. In recognition of this milestone, the UN has declared 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ) to celebrate the centenary of this revolutionary field.\n\nQuantum mechanics is more than a branch of physics; it is the foundation of modern science. Just as Darwin's theory of evolution revolutionised biology, quantum principles have become essential for understanding the physical world. The term \"quantum\" refers to the discrete packets of energy (quanta), through which matter interacts. Early in the 20th century, physicists like Max Planck and Albert Einstein introduced this concept to explain phenomena that classical mechanics, established by Isaac Newton, could not address.\n\nBy 1925, quantum mechanics evolved into a new framework that challenged conventional thinking. Werner Heisenberg, a key figure in this revolution, redefined how scientists understood motion and energy at the subatomic level. Alongside other pioneers like Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Heisenberg discovered that particles do not have precise positions and velocities. Instead, they exist in a state of probability, making their behaviour inherently uncertain. This radical departure from common-sense ideas has been validated repeatedly, proving that classical physics is only an approximation of reality, applicable mainly at the macroscopic scale.\n\nThis uncertainty, while perplexing, has enabled scientists to answer some of nature's deepest mysteries. Quantum mechanics explains why atoms hold together, how stars generate light, and why the universe is stable. Beyond the theoretical, its principles have revolutionised technology. For instance, lasers used in fiber-optic communications and transistors, the building blocks of modern electronics, owe their existence to quantum ideas. These technologies power the internet, smartphones and countless devices that define contemporary life.\n\nYet, quantum mechanics is far from complete. Despite its success in explaining a wide range of phenomena, questions remain. The nature of dark matter, the integration of gravity into quantum theory, and the mechanics of quantum measurement are unresolved puzzles. These challenges inspire ongoing research, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\nThe potential of quantum science extends far beyond its current achievements, holding the promise to reshape the future of technology and our understanding of the universe. Quantum computers, which harness the principles of superposition and entanglement, are poised to tackle problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computing. These machines could revolutionise fields such as medicine by accelerating drug discovery, optimising molecular simulations, and enabling the creation of more effective therapies. In climate science, quantum algorithms could model complex systems with unprecedented accuracy, aiding in the development of solutions to combat climate change and predict environmental shifts.\n\nQuantum technologies, such as ultra-secure communication systems leveraging entanglement for unbreakable encryption, have the potential to revolutionise industries like finance, defence and healthcare. Additionally, quantum sensors promise enhanced precision in fields like navigation and medical imaging, while quantum networks could enable a global quantum internet for instantaneous and secure communication.\n\nThe IYQ is not just a tribute to the past; it is a call to action for the future. It aims to inspire students, educators and citizens from all walks of life to engage with the wonders of quantum science. Whether through understanding its role in everyday technologies or imagining its future applications, everyone has a part to play in this ongoing story."

            "article_content": "\u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d by Yuval Noah Harari is a sweeping and insightful exploration of our species\u2019 journey from its humble beginnings to the present day.\n\nSapiens explores the rise of Homo sapiens through key revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. This groundbreaking book examines how human history is shaped by \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies \u2013 that enable unparalleled cooperation. Harari investigates the impact of these revolutions on human society, from the dawn of agriculture and the rise of civilizations to the challenges of the modern world, including climate change, technological disruption, and the search for meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution: The book begins by examining the unique cognitive abilities that set Homo sapiens apart from other animals. Around 70,000 years ago, a \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d occurred, leading to the development of advanced language and the ability to create and believe in \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies. These shared fictions, while not objectively real, allow humans to cooperate flexibly on a massive scale, a feat unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This cooperation enabled the development of complex social structures, from small tribes to vast empires.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution: Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. This seemingly revolutionary shift, however, brought about significant drawbacks. Agriculture led to increased inequality, disease, and environmental degradation. Farmers, despite working harder than hunter-gatherers, often had less leisure time and a poorer diet. The domestication of plants and animals also led to the suffering of countless creatures.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution: Beginning in the 16th century, the Scientific Revolution challenged religious dogma and ushered in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Science provided humans with new tools and knowledge, allowing them to manipulate the natural world on an unprecedented scale. This revolution, however, also brought about new challenges, such as climate change, nuclear war, and the potential for technological disruption.\n\nModern Challenges: Harari explores the profound challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. These include climate change, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. He raises critical questions about the meaning of happiness, the future of humanity, and our relationship with technology.\n\nKey Themes:"
