            "article_content": "British UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee\n\nBritish UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee, has asserted that the images of a mysterious orb at Manchester Airport are unequivocally evidence of a UFO. Recently delving into so-called \"drone\" episodes at military installations across the UK, Lee is now scrutinising the curious event at Manchester Airport. The imagery, dating back to June, has sparked a wildfire of speculation on social media platforms like X (once known as Twitter) and Reddit, where it was shared. The footage depicts a round entity captured by an alleged co-pilot on the tarmac, seen either soaring in the sky or \"hovering\" just above ground near another plane. These events trail a spate of similar sightings, specifically several orbs spotted over Washington DC's supposed no-fly zone. The person who released the Manchester sighting description claimed the UAP matched the size of a small vehicle. Intrigued, Mark Lee has flagged this incident as particularly noteworthy. Drawing parallels with historical accounts, he mentioned: \"This blue orb sighting reminds me of UK researcher Timothy Good who wrote about the Australian government capturing an alien sphere in 1957 - it was made of an unknown substance and had no visible means of levitation.\"\n\nWARNING TAKEN FROM TWITTERCAPTION: UAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fansLINK: https://x.com/PNWMPA/status/1861843806074876103/photo/1\n\nLee elaborated that this peculiar object was apprehended at Woomera's Nuclear test facility in Australia and eventually found its way to the Wright Patterson Airforce Base in the USA, reports the Daily Star. Discussing the recent Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) activity he's been investigating, he stated: \"People are assuming that the UAP sightings at military bases in the East of England are Russian drones. But eye witnesses of locals who have seen these UAPs state that they move very slowly and if they are Russian how did they get here - have they flown all this way at such a slow speed\" Mark further revealed that his research for his new film - The Rendelsham UFO - The British Roswell - about an alleged UFO landing at a military base in Suffolk in 1980 (RAF Bentwaters) - has led him to believe that an alien intelligence is constantly monitoring our military bases (particularly those with Nuclear weapons). With global tensions currently high, he believes the alien presence has increased its surveillance using AI drones.\n\nUAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fans\n\nHe said: \"What we found with the Rendelsham UFO - was that an alien presence was monitoring the Nuclear weapons that were being stored at RAF Bentwaters as part of the NATO defence during the Cold War.\" However, a spokesperson from Manchester Airport dismissed any theories of extraterrestrial visitors in this case. He suggested that the most likely explanation is either a weather or helium balloon, and questioned the authenticity of the photograph showing an object hovering above the ground on the airfield. \"We have systems that pick up anything that could be a threat to aviation,\" he said. He stated: \"Anything that gives off a signal we would know about.\" He added that if there was anything on the airfield, as depicted in the photograph, it would be treated as a major incident, and no such disruption-causing event has occurred.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "As you scroll through your social media feed or let your favorite music app curate the perfect playlist, it may feel like artificial intelligence is improving your life \u2013 learning your preferences and serving your needs. But lurking behind this convenient facade is a growing concern: algorithmic harms.\n\nThese harms aren\u2019t obvious or immediate. They\u2019re insidious, building over time as AI systems quietly make decisions about your life without you even knowing it. The hidden power of these systems is becoming a significant threat to privacy, equality, autonomy and safety.\n\nAI systems are embedded in nearly every facet of modern life. They suggest what shows and movies you should watch, help employers decide whom they want to hire, and even influence judges to decide who qualifies for a sentence. But what happens when these systems, often seen as neutral, begin making decisions that put certain groups at a disadvantage or, worse, cause real-world harm?\n\nThe often-overlooked consequences of AI applications call for regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with this rapidly evolving technology. I study the intersection of law and technology, and I\u2019ve outlined a legal framework to do just that.\n\nSlow burns\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of algorithmic harms is that their cumulative impact often flies under the radar. These systems typically don\u2019t directly assault your privacy or autonomy in ways you can easily perceive. They gather vast amounts of data about people \u2014 often without their knowledge \u2014 and use this data to shape decisions affecting people\u2019s lives.\n\nSometimes, this results in minor inconveniences, like an advertisement that follows you across websites. But as AI operates without addressing these repetitive harms, they can scale up, leading to significant cumulative damage across diverse groups of people.\n\nConsider the example of social media algorithms. They are ostensibly designed to promote beneficial social interactions. However, behind their seemingly beneficial facade, they silently track users\u2019 clicks and compile profiles of their political beliefs, professional affiliations and personal lives. The data collected is used in systems that make consequential decisions \u2014 whether you are identified as a jaywalking pedestrian, considered for a job or flagged as a risk to commit suicide.\n\nWorse, their addictive design traps teenagers in cycles of overuse, leading to escalating mental health crises, including anxiety, depression and self-harm. By the time you grasp the full scope, it\u2019s too late \u2014 your privacy has been breached, your opportunities shaped by biased algorithms, and the safety of the most vulnerable undermined, all without your knowledge.\n\nThis is what I call \u201cintangible, cumulative harm\u201d: AI systems operate in the background, but their impacts can be devastating and invisible.\n\nWhy regulation lags behind\n\nDespite these mounting dangers, legal frameworks worldwide have struggled to keep up. In the United States, a regulatory approach emphasizing innovation has made it difficult to impose strict standards on how these systems are used across multiple contexts.\n\nCourts and regulatory bodies are accustomed to dealing with concrete harms, like physical injury or economic loss, but algorithmic harms are often more subtle, cumulative and hard to detect. The regulations often fail to address the broader effects that AI systems can have over time.\n\nSocial media algorithms, for example, can gradually erode users\u2019 mental health, but because these harms build slowly, they are difficult to address within the confines of current legal standards.\n\nFour types of algorithmic harm\n\nDrawing on existing AI and data governance scholarship, I have categorized algorithmic harms into four legal areas: privacy, autonomy, equality and safety. Each of these domains is vulnerable to the subtle yet often unchecked power of AI systems.\n\nThe first type of harm is eroding privacy. AI systems collect, process and transfer vast amounts of data, eroding people\u2019s privacy in ways that may not be immediately obvious but have long-term implications. For example, facial recognition systems can track people in public and private spaces, effectively turning mass surveillance into the norm.\n\nThe second type of harm is undermining autonomy. AI systems often subtly undermine your ability to make autonomous decisions by manipulating the information you see. Social media platforms use algorithms to show users content that maximizes a third party\u2019s interests, subtly shaping opinions, decisions and behaviors across millions of users.\n\nThe third type of harm is diminishing equality. AI systems, while designed to be neutral, often inherit the biases present in their data and algorithms. This reinforces societal inequalities over time. In one infamous case, a facial recognition system used by retail stores to detect shoplifters disproportionately misidentified women and people of color.\n\nThe fourth type of harm is impairing safety. AI systems make decisions that affect people\u2019s safety and well-being. When these systems fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. But even when they function as designed, they can still cause harm, such as social media algorithms\u2019 cumulative effects on teenagers\u2019 mental health.\n\nBecause these cumulative harms often arise from AI applications protected by trade secret laws, victims have no way to detect or trace the harm. This creates a gap in accountability. When a biased hiring decision or a wrongful arrest is made due to an algorithm, how does the victim know? Without transparency, it\u2019s nearly impossible to hold companies accountable.\n\nClosing the accountability gap\n\nCategorizing the types of algorithmic harms delineates the legal boundaries of AI regulation and presents possible legal reforms to bridge this accountability gap. Changes I believe would help include mandatory algorithmic impact assessments that require companies to document and address the immediate and cumulative harms of an AI application to privacy, autonomy, equality and safety \u2013 before and after it\u2019s deployed. For instance, firms using facial recognition systems would need to evaluate these systems\u2019 impacts throughout their life cycle.\n\nAnother helpful change would be stronger individual rights around the use of AI systems, allowing people to opt out of harmful practices and making certain AI applications opt in. For example, requiring an opt-in regime for data processing by firms\u2019 use of facial recognition systems and allowing users to opt out at any time.\n\nLastly, I suggest requiring companies to disclose the use of AI technology and its anticipated harms. To illustrate, this may include notifying customers about the use of facial recognition systems and the anticipated harms across the domains outlined in the typology.\n\nAs AI systems become more widely used in critical societal functions \u2013 from health care to education and employment \u2013 the need to regulate harms they can cause becomes more pressing. Without intervention, these invisible harms are likely to continue to accumulate, affecting nearly everyone and disproportionately hitting the most vulnerable.\n\nWith generative AI multiplying and exacerbating AI harms, I believe it\u2019s important for policymakers, courts, technology developers and civil society to recognize the legal harms of AI. This requires not just better laws, but a more thoughtful approach to cutting-edge AI technology \u2013 one that prioritizes civil rights and justice in the face of rapid technological advancement.\n\nThe future of AI holds incredible promise, but without the right legal frameworks, it could also entrench inequality and erode the very civil rights it is, in many cases, designed to enhance.\n\nSylvia Lu, Faculty Fellow and Visiting Assistant Professor of Law, University of Michigan\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It is not strange, but a possibility in a movie, done in meta, where real people portray themselves, and told in a found footage filmmaking.\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Alexa Miro straddles between real and reel in \u201cStrange Frequencies: Taiwan Killer Hospital,\u201d an official entry at this year\u2019s Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).\n\nShe is bringing her actress and celebrity personality to it while interpreting a newbie ghosthunter.\n\nThis is not strange, but a possibility and a \u201creality\u201d in a movie, done in meta, where real people portray themselves, and told in a found footage filmmaking. The genre is horror.\n\nThere are aspects in it that also inform the audience that what they\u2019re watching remains a film, if one may add.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I\u2019ve always been passionate (about) and a fan of horror,\u201d said Alexa in a recent press conference for the film that also stars Enrique Gil, Rob Gomez, Jane de Leon, MJ Lastimosa as her fellow ghosthunters, with tarot reader Raf Pineda and content creator Ryan \u201cZarckaroo\u201d Azurin.\n\n\u201cPangarap ko rin at napanood ko kasi ito (it\u2019s also a dream and I also watched it),\u201d added Alexa of doing a horror movie and \u201cGonjiam: Haunted Asylum,\u201d where \u201cStrange Frequencies\u201d was based on. The latter is a local adaptation.\n\nAlexa joins fellow amateur ghosthunters Enrique Gil, Rob Gomez, Jane de Leon and MJ Lastimosa, with tarot reader Raf Pineda and content creator Ryan \u2018Zarckaroo\u2019 Azurin in a project that documents paranormal activities in a haunted, offbeat place.\n\nThe narrative is somehow born out of the situation when Zarckaroo, described as \u201ca local video creator known for filming actual footage in some of the region\u2019s most haunted places and offbeat places,\u201d in a piece of information given to this paper, invites Enrique to do an episode for the former\u2019s YouTube channel. They both decide to turn it into a film, where the talents of Alexa, Jane, MJ and Rob have been tapped by Enrique, who takes on the role of an actor and co-producer.\n\n\u201cParang naisip rin lang namin what if tayo din ang mag-shoot (we also thought that we should be the ones filming the scenes),\u201d shared Alexa. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any camera crew there, so kami, kami lang ang pumasok sa hospital. Nandun din yung appreciation na na-form namin for the camera (people), the people behind the cameras, behind the scenes because we know yung pagod na pinagdadaanan nila (after that, we\u2019ve become more appreciative of the camera people. We know what they\u2019re going through and the dedication they put in their work).\u201d\n\nThe individual and collective journey of the celebrities and their characters unfolds when they enter an abandoned and haunted hospital. The amateur ghosthunters bravely foray into it to see for themselves possible strange frequencies that roam around and lurk within it.\n\n\u201cHindi ako takot kasi sa mga ganyan (I\u2019m not afraid of things such as this),\u201d said Alexa about supernatural occurrences. \u201cPangarap ko talaga siya simula nung bata ako na maka-explore din ako around the world (it has been a dream since I was young to explore around the world).\u201d\n\nAside from going to the usual tourist spots, Alexa was perhaps referring to dark tourism, in which eerie places with paranormal activities form part of a tourist itinerary.\n\nThat\u2019s what Zarckaroo has been doing and sharing content about what is described as \u201cthe most haunted places and offbeat places.\u201d\n\nAs she portrayed herself as Alexa, the celebrity, and Alexa, the ghosthunter character, she had her fair share of spooky experiences.\n\n\u201cMeron kaming mga kasama na sensitive sila sa ganun (we were joined by people who are sensitive to \u2018strange frequencies\u2019). They would feel, see or hear stuff. I personally also experienced something on the first day of the entire shoot,\u201d said she.\n\nThat happened when they wrapped their first shooting day up. From the film location and on the way to their homebase, the vans carrying the cast and crew would go through a tunnel.\n\nAlexa recalled that prior to entering the tunnel, she had this heavy feeling, and \u201csomeone\u201d seemed to be whispering to her to avoid the tunnel and tell the driver to take another road.\n\nAlexa shrugged it off because she didn\u2019t want everybody to worry. But she was feeling some kind of \u201cenergy\u201d that made her movements constricted. Some noticed a change in her. They showed their concern about her. Alexa cried and when their van finally passed through the tunnel, she felt that \u201cenergy\u201d had left her. Everyone prayed for Alexa.\n\nIt had been a norm for them to do cleansing and rituals and pray before and after filming.\n\nGadgets malfunctioning, a table collapsing, and hearing someone mimicking their voices on a device were some of the \u201cstrange\u201d experiences they had on set.\n\n\u201cI think wina-warn-ningan kami ng mga spirits or something to be careful and \u2018wag masyadong makulit (the spirits were warning and telling us to be careful and not to be playful),\u201d said she.\n\nThe film enthusiasts and moviegoers are given the creative space to see for themselves how Alexa, the actress, and Alexa, the character, are, in a way, \u201cone and the same,\u201d as the two Alexas cross the boundary that separates real and reel and that intersects them.\n\nProduced by filmmaker Erik Matti and Dondon Monteverde, and in partnership with Enrique, \u201cStrange Frequencies\u201d opens on Dec. 25 in cinemas nationwide."

            "article_content": "A Settlement Plagued by Misfortune\n\n\n\nThe Dudley Curse: Fact or Folklore?\n\n\n\nModern-Day Mystery\n\n\n\nIn the heart of Connecticut lies a chilling legend\u2014a ghost town so shrouded in mystery that stepping foot there is not only discouraged but outright illegal. Dudleytown, a deserted settlement within the Dark Entry Forest in Cornwall, Connecticut, is infamous for its eerie history, supernatural lore, and a supposed curse that has haunted the land and its settlers.Dudleytown was established in the early 1740s when members of the Dudley family, along with others, settled in the valley. Named after the family, this area initially served as farmland. However, due to the region\u2019s infertile soil and rocky terrain, many residents left by the 19th century in search of better opportunities.The town\u2019s decline wasn\u2019t just about agriculture\u2014it was riddled with peculiar deaths and inexplicable tragedies. Nathaniel Carter, one of the settlers, lost six family members to cholera before relocating to New York, where his remaining family members were tragically killed. Similarly, Gershon Hollister died under mysterious circumstances while building a barn, and his neighbor, William Tanner, was said to be tormented by visions of creatures emerging from the woods at night.General Herman Swift, a Revolutionary War hero, faced personal tragedy when his wife was struck by lightning on their porch. Overcome with grief, he, too, met a tragic end. Stories of mysterious deaths and bizarre occurrences led many to believe the town was cursed.Legend has it that the misfortunes of Dudleytown trace back to a curse on the Dudley family. This curse allegedly began with Edmund Dudley, an English nobleman executed for treason during King Henry VIII\u2019s reign. His descendants, said to be plagued by death and disaster, carried this supposed curse to America. However, historians have found no direct link between Edmund Dudley and the Dudleys of Dudleytown, debunking this aspect of the legend.Despite this, the stories persisted, bolstered by unexplained phenomena reported by residents. Some claimed to see ghostly figures lurking in the forest, while others spoke of \"phantom hands\" touching trespassers who dared to explore the abandoned site.By 1900, Dudleytown was entirely deserted. The last family to live there either vanished or perished, leaving only crumbling cellar holes and stone foundations as remnants of the town. In 1918, Dr. William Clarke purchased the land and attempted to make it a vacation home. However, his wife reported terrifying encounters with creatures in the woods, prompting the couple to abandon the property.Dr. Clarke later helped establish the Dark Entry Forest Association, which aimed to preserve the forest and protect it from further intrusion. Today, the site is private property, and trespassers face legal action.Despite warnings from the Connecticut State Police, thrill-seekers and ghost enthusiasts still attempt to visit Dudleytown, drawn by tales of paranormal activity. Many claim to feel an inexplicable presence, with some reporting being touched by unseen forces. These chilling accounts, combined with the area's dark history, continue to fuel the town\u2019s reputation as one of America\u2019s most haunted locations.Dudleytown remains a compelling tale of tragedy, mystery, and folklore\u2014a ghost town that, for better or worse, refuses to fade into obscurity."

            "article_content": "Residents of Central Alberta, Canada, recently observed stunning light pillars illuminating the winter sky. These vertical columns of light, mistaken for paranormal activity, are actually a natural optical illusion formed by ice crystals reflecting light under specific weather conditions\n\nRecently in Central Alberta, Canada, residents witnessed a beautiful spectacle of light pillars that illuminated the night sky during the winter. These columns of light appear to rise from the ground and stretch up into the dark, creating an ethereal visual spectacle. While many people are led to believe that these columns of light are paranormal, they are, in fact, a natural optical illusion that is created under specific weather conditions.\n\nThe Science Behind Light Pillars\n\nLight pillars are a phenomenon that is formed when the light sources like streetlights or building lights reflect off tiny hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The ice crystals are as small as 0.02 mm in diameter and function like mirrors. As light hits the ice crystals, it is reflected, giving the appearance of vertical columns shooting into the sky. The illusion can be almost magical, with beams of light soaring high above the ground to cast a shimmering glow over the dark sky.\n\nCheck out the visuals here\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada \ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form. For example, these photos were taken at\u2026 pic.twitter.com/F3Rk55UXaV \u2014 Malinda \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea (@TreasChest) November 26, 2024\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada \ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form. For example, these photos were taken at\u2026 pic.twitter.com/F3Rk55UXaV \u2014 Malinda \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea (@TreasChest) November 26, 2024\n\nConditions for Light Pillars to be Perfect\n\nLight pillars might be mystical-looking, but they have been well understood by meteorologists. They are not associated with otherworldly or paranormal activity. Generally, the phenomenon is most common in colder climates, especially during the winter months when the temperatures plummet. Ideal conditions for light pillars include temperatures ranging from -10\u00b0C to -40\u00b0C, high humidity, and still air. Under these conditions, ice crystals form and reflect the light, thus creating this fantastic visual effect.\n\nAlberta, along with other cold regions like Russia and parts of Scandinavia, is an ideal location for witnessing this extraordinary natural wonder. While the light pillars may seem to originate directly from the light sources, they are actually an optical illusion, created by the reflection of light off the suspended ice crystals, often located high in the atmosphere.\n\nA Winter Marvel in Alberta\n\nFor those in Alberta, who have to bear the bitter cold, light pillars provide a moment of awe amidst the harsh winter conditions. Despite the freezing temperatures and biting wind-chill, the phenomenon offers a reminder of the mysterious beauty that nature can create. The stunning display transforms the icy winter landscape into a celestial wonder, providing residents and observers with an unforgettable winter experience.\n\nALSO READ: Rare First Edition Of Harry Potter Book \u2013 One Of Only 500 Copies \u2013 Sells For \u20b938 Lakh At UK Auction"

The discovery, announced on Thursday in a paper in the journal Science, is direct evidence that different kinds of human relatives, with distinct anatomies and gaits, inhabited the same place at the same time, the paper\u2019s authors say.\n\nIt also raises questions about the extent of the species\u2019 interactions with each other.\n\n\u201cThey might have walked by one another,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, an evolutionary anthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh who led the study. \u201cThey might have looked up in the distance and seen another member of a closely related species, occupying the same landscape.\u201d\n\nBased on skeletal remains found in the region, Dr. Hatala\u2019s team attributed the footprints to Paranthropus boisei and Homo erectus, two types of hominins, the group consisting of our human lineage and closely related species. Paranthropus boisei had smaller brains along with wide, flat faces and massive teeth and chewing muscles; Homo erectus more closely resembled modern human proportions and are thought to be our direct ancestors."

            "article_content": "December is almost here, which means it is almost the start of the Advent season.\n\nWhile many equate Advent with calendars full of treats leading up to Christmas Day on Dec. 25, Advent is also a term that comes out of Western Christianity and is the season encompassing the four Sundays (and the weekdays) leading up to the celebration of Christmas, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nAdvent started as a time for remembrance and a sign for Christians to be open and ready for the second coming of Christ and held to traditional items and events like a wreath with candles, a large feast at the end of the four Sundays and of course the Advent calendar.\n\nMany of the traditions around Advent have been adopted by mainstream culture as part of traditions for people who celebrate Christmas \u2014 especially the Advent calendar, which has taken a place in the holiday season for many whether they are Christian or not.\n\nHere's a look at the traditions some Christians uphold during this time of year and how some of the traditions came to be mainstream.\n\nWhat is Advent?\n\nAdvent is the start of the Christian church's liturgical year. It starts four weeks ahead of Christmas, which usually is the last Sunday in November or the first Sunday of December. The start date changes every year.\n\nThe term Advent is from \"ad-venire\" in Latin and means \"to come to\".\n\nThe Catholic church sees it as, \"a time of preparation that directs our hearts and minds to Christ\u2019s second coming at the end of time and to the anniversary of Our Lord\u2019s birth on Christmas.\"\n\nDuring this time, the Christian faith has followers that reflect on scriptures of what they believe to be the second coming, but also a time for penance before Christmas with feasts, presents and more.\n\nWhen is Advent 2024?\n\nThe start of Advent is Sunday, Dec. 1 and runs through Christmas Eve of Tuesday, Dec. 24.\n\nWho celebrates Advent?\n\nWhile some of the traditions of Advent are seen leading up to the Christmas holiday, Advent itself is associated with Western Christianity \u2014 Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Episcopalians, Lutherans and many other Protestant churches mark the roughly month-long period with special observance.\n\nHow did we get Advent calendars?\n\nAdvent calendars were adopted at some point in the 19th century by German Lutherans as a way to mark the days of the season leading up to Christmas. Most of the time the days leading up were marked by Bible readings or pieces from the Christian Christmas story.\n\nAs times changed, so did the Advent calendar.\n\nThere are now hundreds of Advent calendars available that don't always quite cover the days' Advent is observed and usually starts on Dec. 1. Calendars help herald the arrival of Christmas by marking each day with something like a piece of candy, a small gift and even have full-size products, depending on how much you want to spend.\n\nIn recent years, Advent calendars of every shape and size are available from the ones you buy at the grocery store with a piece of chocolate to Advent calendars with make-up, FUNKO pops and Squishmellows. Swarovski even has their own Advent calendar that sells for $1,200."

Not all attempts have been well received, so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Humane AI Pin, a brainchild of Apple veterans, failed to make a splash, despite blending an AI-first voice-driven user interface and a cool laser projector doubling as a screen on your palms. The story of the Rabbit R1 hasn't been particularly inspiring either. A few others, like the Plaud Note Pin, are trying to solve a niche problem.\n\nYet, there is no shortage of companies trying to shoehorn AI into mainstream products. Some of the attempts are rather ingenious, but a few elicit confused chuckles. In the past couple of years, and especially in the wake of the generative AI revolution, we have seen some rather astounding AI-charged products.\n\nWhat follows is a list of those kinds of unexpected offerings \u2014 you may find yourself wondering why such pointless products exist, or realizing these are the gadgets you've always needed.\n\nAdvertisement"
