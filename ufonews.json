It\u2019s the largest collection of UFO sighting documents in the country, and maybe the world.\n\nNow, thanks to a partnership with Rio Rancho Public Schools, the amateur collectors who kept all these records safe over the years are finally making them available to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally overwhelming. People don\u2019t have any conception until they come here how much material that we\u2019re talking about. And it really, I think, makes people pause and realize there\u2019s a lot more to this UFO subject than I ever thought,\u201d said David Marler, executive director of the National UFO Historical Records Center.\n\nMarler knows the idea of a UFO records archive probably sounds silly to some folks, but he says that skepticism is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t care what your take is on the UFO subject. In fact, we welcome differing opinions, differing perspectives,\u201d said Marler.\n\nThe National UFO Historical Records Center is a nonprofit organizing hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents, news clippings, photos, videos and more evidence from across the globe all under one roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional historical archive dedicated to a non-traditional subject. We want serious research to be conducted here in the hopes ultimately of maybe gaining a better insight into this mystery that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for 75 plus years,\u201d said Marler.\n\nHe says there are countless connections to be discovered now that all these case files are together.\n\n\u201cSome organizations interviewed witnesses that the other did not, and vice versa, and sometimes there\u2019s new insights provided by one investigative organization that was never obtained by this one,\u201d said Marler. \u201cThe more minds, the more set of eyeballs we have looking at the data as with any subject, the better we\u2019re going to be if we truly want to try to understand what we\u2019re dealing with when we talk about UFOs.\u201d\n\nMarler\u2019s collection \u2013 which used to live inside his Rio Rancho home \u2013 is largely a collection of other collections sent in from fellow UFO archivists. With all this extra space donated by Rio Rancho Public Schools, Marler says they\u2019re ready for more.\n\n\u201cWe have about 10 to 12 other collections that are also in the queue,\u201d Marler said. \u201cTwo individuals I know in Ohio have stated, \u2018You\u2019re already in my will. If anything happens to me, my material is coming to Rio Rancho.'\u201d\n\nWhether or not you believe in aliens, Marler says the overwhelming amount of documentation is worth preserving.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important because it is an element of history, it is an element of our culture. So that\u2019s really how we try to view it,\u201d said Marler. \u201cIf we can\u2019t define the answers to the UFO mystery, maybe in 40, 50, 60, years someone might, but they can only do that by looking at the data.\u201d\n\nWhile this is a public archive, it\u2019s a not a free for all. Marler says you\u2019ll have to submit a request on their website to set up a time to come and visit. The idea is that you\u2019ll have full access to everything inside.\n\nBut why would Rio Rancho Public Schools get involved with something like this.\n\n\u201cOur students find the subject matter of UFO investigation very intriguing. And so we want to do is we want to use that as a catalyst in order to get students involved in other types of learning,\u201d said RRPS Chief Operating Officer Michael Baker. \u201cSo we think that the parents, as long as the students are learning, we\u2019re not trying to persuade thinking one way or another, we think we\u2019re going to see some really good benefits from this area.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials say the partnership is expected to last at least five years.\n\nAnother New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect."

        "article_content": "Earlier this year, Medal, a startup known for its video game clipping features, launched a cross-platform AI assistant called Highlight. Now the company is spinning off Highlight into a new entity, which has raised $10 million in a funding round.\n\nGeneral Catalyst led the funding round with Valor, SV Angel, and Conviction Embed participating in the round. Medal also put in $3 million in the new entity out of $13 million it raised in July.\n\nMedal\u2019s co-founder, Pim de Witte, is the only common link between Medal and Highlight now, as the latter has its own team, including Haris Butt, who was VP of Design at productivity company ClickUp, Medal co-founder Josh Lipson, and Medal\u2019s first head of growth Mark Bond.\n\n\u201cWe started Highlight as a research project within Medal. We wanted to explore the translation layer between LLMs (large language models) and what\u2019s going on your screen. But we realized to grow quickly and hire engineers for a specific app by offering them equity, Highlight needs to be a separate entity,\u201d de Witte told TechCrunch over a call.\n\nHighlight is a cross-platform desktop app that lets you attach your screen, a voice note, or a document as context and then ask questions to an LLM. The app can also transcribe your calls from system audio, so you can ask questions about a particular meeting later.\n\nYou can perform actions that have become pretty common with AI assistants, such as summarizing, rewriting, highlighting, and explaining the context attached to the app at the time of querying.\n\nIn July, the company had opened its platform for developers to build apps on top of Highlight. However, the startup realized that this approach would limit custom actions to a handful of developers. With the latest version, the company will allow users to prompt their way to a custom action like summarizing the first 10 minutes of a meeting. Highlight also wants to open up prompts to the community of users, helping one person discover a useful automation someone has created.\n\nFor developers with programming knowledge, the company plans to open an agentic framework that will allow them to use parts of your system and do small tasks \u2014 such as summarizing documents in a particular folder \u2014 in the background.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to create virtual employees so you can start delegating some of your tasks to them and have more time on your hands,\u201d de Witte said.\n\nImage Credits:Highlight\n\nWith today\u2019s announcement, the company is releasing a push-to-talk shortcut and new conversations app that records your meetings.\n\nNiko Bonatsos, managing director at General Catalyst, told TechCrunch over email that Highlight is easy to understand for users because of the on-screen context and the lack of complex prompts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been underwhelmed by the fact that most consumer-facing AI companies only let you interact with them via chat interfaces \u2026 This demonstrates a lack of imagination and frankly limits what is possible with this powerful new technology. We are very encouraged with the bold design choices that Pim and his team have made so far,\u201d Bonatsos said, pointing out that Highlight\u2019s combination of automation and on-screen context allows users to utilize AI better.\n\nHighlight AI is free to use for now, but the company wants to adopt a pricing plan based on the word count processed by the assistant down the line."

        "category": "ai+app",
        "date": "17h",
        "source": "TechCrunch",
        "article_content": "In a pitch to investors last spring, Anthropic said it intended to build AI to power virtual assistants that could perform research, answer emails, and handle other back-office jobs on their own. The company referred to this as a \u201cnext-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching\u201d \u2014 one it believed that could, if all goes according to plan, automate large portions of the economy someday.\n\nIt took a while, but that AI is starting to arrive.\n\nAnthropic on Tuesday released an upgraded version of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model that can understand and interact with any desktop app. Via a new \u201cComputer Use\u201d API, now in open beta, the model can imitate keystrokes, button clicks, and mouse gestures, essentially emulating a person sitting at a PC.\n\n\u201cWe trained Claude to see what\u2019s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \u201cWhen a developer tasks Claude with using a piece of computer software and gives it the necessary access, Claude looks at screenshots of what\u2019s visible to the user, then counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor in order to click in the correct place.\u201d\n\nDevelopers can try out Computer Use via Anthropic\u2019s API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI platform. The new 3.5 Sonnet without Computer Use is rolling out to Claude apps, and brings various performance improvements over the outgoing 3.5 Sonnet model.\n\nAutomating apps\n\nA tool that can automate tasks on a PC is hardly a novel idea. Countless companies offer such tools, from decades-old RPA vendors to newer upstarts like Relay, Induced AI, and Automat.\n\nIn the race to develop so-called \u201cAI agents,\u201d the field has only become more crowded. AI agents remains an ill-defined term, but it generally refers to AI that can automate software.\n\nSome analysts say AI agents could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars that they\u2019re pouring into AI. Companies seem to agree: According to a recent Capgemini survey, 10% of organizations already use AI agents and 82% will integrate them within the next three years.\n\nSalesforce made splashy announcements about its AI agent tech this summer, while Microsoft touted new tools for building AI agents yesterday. OpenAI, which is plotting its own brand of AI agents, sees the tech as a step toward super-intelligent AI.\n\nAnthropic calls its take on the AI agent concept an \u201caction-execution layer\u201d that lets the new 3.5 Sonnet perform desktop-level commands. Thanks to its ability to browse the web (not a first for AI models, but a first for Anthropic), 3.5 Sonnet can use any website and any application.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s new AI can control apps on a PC. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\n\u201cHumans remain in control by providing specific prompts that direct Claude\u2019s actions, like \u2018use data from my computer and online to fill out this form\u2019,\u201d an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cPeople enable access and limit access as needed. Claude breaks down the user\u2019s prompts into computer commands (e.g. moving the cursor, clicking, typing) to accomplish that specific task.\u201d\n\nSoftware development platform Replit has used an early version of the new 3.5 Sonnet model to create an \u201cautonomous verifier\u201d that can evaluate apps while they\u2019re being built. Canva, meanwhile, says that it\u2019s exploring ways in which the new model might be able to support the designing and editing process.\n\nBut how is this any different than the other AI agents out there? It\u2019s a reasonable question. Consumer gadget startup Rabbit is building a web agent that can do things like buying movie tickets online; Adept, which was recently acqui-hired by Amazon, trains models to browse websites and navigate software; and Twin Labs is using off-the-shelf models, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, to automate desktop processes.\n\nAnthropic claims the new 3.5 Sonnet is simply a stronger, more robust model that can do better on coding tasks than even OpenAI\u2019s flagship o1, per the SWE-bench Verified benchmark. Despite not being explicitly trained to do so, the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet self-corrects and retries tasks when it encounters obstacles, and can work toward objectives that require dozens or hundreds of steps.\n\nThe new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model\u2019s performance on various benchmarks. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nBut don\u2019t fire your secretary just yet.\n\nIn an evaluation designed to test an AI agent\u2019s ability to help with airline booking tasks, like modifying a flight reservation, the new 3.5 Sonnet managed to complete less than half of the tasks successfully. In a separate test involving tasks like initiating a return, 3.5 Sonnet failed roughly a third of the time.\n\nAnthropic admits the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet struggles with basic actions like scrolling and zooming, and that it can miss \u201cshort-lived\u201d actions and notifications because of the way it takes screenshots and pieces them together.\n\n\u201cClaude\u2019s Computer Use remains slow and often error-prone,\u201d Anthropic writes in its post. \u201cWe encourage developers to begin exploration with low-risk tasks.\u201d\n\nRisky business\n\nBut is the new 3.5 Sonnet capable enough to be dangerous? Possibly.\n\nA recent study found that models without the ability to use desktop apps, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, were willing to engage in harmful \u201cmulti-step agent behavior,\u201d such as ordering a fake passport from someone on the dark web, when \u201cattacked\u201d using jailbreaking techniques. Jailbreaks led to high rates of success in performing harmful tasks even for models protected by filters and safeguards, according to the researchers.\n\nOne can imagine how a model with desktop access could wreak more havoc \u2014 say, by exploiting app vulnerabilities to compromise personal info (or storing chats in plaintext). Aside from the software levers at its disposal, the model\u2019s online and app connections could open avenues for malicious jailbreakers.\n\nAnthropic doesn\u2019t deny that there\u2019s risk in releasing the new 3.5 Sonnet. But the company argues that the benefits of observing how the model is used in the wild ultimately outweigh this risk.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s far better to give access to computers to today\u2019s more limited, relatively safer models,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThis means we can begin to observe and learn from any potential issues that arise at this lower level, building up computer use and safety mitigations gradually and simultaneously.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Anthropic\n\nAnthropic also says it has taken steps to deter misuse, like not training the new 3.5 Sonnet on users\u2019 screenshots and prompts, and preventing the model from accessing the web during training. The company says it developed classifiers to \u201cnudge\u201d 3.5 Sonnet away from actions perceived as high-risk, such as posting on social media, creating accounts, and interacting with government websites.\n\nAs the U.S. general election nears, Anthropic says it is focused on mitigating election-related abuse of its models. The U.S. AI Safety Institute and U.K. Safety Institute, two separate but allied government agencies dedicated to evaluating AI model risk, tested the new 3.5 Sonnet prior to its deployment.\n\nAnthropic told TechCrunch it has the ability to restrict access to additional websites and features \u201cif necessary,\u201d to protect against spam, fraud, and misinformation, for example. As a safety precaution, the company retains any screenshots captured by Computer Use for at least 30 days \u2014 a retention period that might alarm some devs.\n\nWe asked Anthropic under which circumstances, if any, it would hand over screenshots to a third party (e.g. law enforcement) if asked. A spokesperson said that the company would \u201ccomply with requests for data in response to valid legal process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no foolproof methods, and we will continuously evaluate and iterate on our safety measures to balance Claude\u2019s capabilities with responsible use,\u201d Anthropic said. \u201cThose using the computer-use version of Claude should take the relevant precautions to minimize these kinds of risks, including isolating Claude from particularly sensitive data on their computer.\u201d\n\nHopefully, that\u2019ll be enough to prevent the worst from occurring.\n\nA cheaper model\n\nToday\u2019s headliner might\u2019ve been the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet model, but Anthropic also said an updated version of Haiku, the cheapest, most efficient model in its Claude series, is on the way.\n\nClaude 3.5 Haiku, due in the coming weeks, will match the performance of Claude 3 Opus, once Anthropic\u2019s state-of-the-art model, on certain benchmarks at the same cost and \u201capproximate speed\u201d of Claude 3 Haiku.\n\n\u201cWith low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data\u2013like purchase history, pricing, or inventory data,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post.\n\n3.5 Haiku will initially be available as a text-only model and later as part of a multimodal package that can analyze both text and images.\n\n3.5 Haiku\u2019s benchmark performance. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nSo once 3.5 Haiku is available, will there be much reason to use 3 Opus? What about 3.5 Opus, 3 Opus\u2019 successor, which Anthropic teased back in June?\n\n\u201cAll of the models in the Claude 3 model family have their individual uses for customers,\u201d the Anthropic spokesperson said. \u201cClaude 3.5 Opus is on our roadmap and we\u2019ll be sure to share more as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Maybe.\n\nSusan Crane, a program manager for the Oak Park Park District, won\u2019t say what\u2019s there, but evidently it was enough to hire a team of paranormal investigators to find out exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\nAnd they\u2019re inviting interested spectators to join them on a \u201cthrilling journey through the dimly lit corridors and eerie rooms of this renowned estate, rumored to be a hotspot for supernatural activity,\u201d according to materials provided by the Park District.\n\nOn Friday, anyone over 21 can see, feel or hear for themselves what all lurks in the old home during a Park District event featuring paranormal experts Other Side Investigations.\n\nCrane said it will be OSI\u2019s first investigation for the Park District, though they\u2019ve been active in the Midwest for years. The team has been on site for preliminary inspection, however and Crane hosted another Pleasant Home ghost investigation a few years ago. But she\u2019s keeping mum about whatever she learned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say a word,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put any ideas into anybody\u2019s head. And when they came to look at the house, I didn\u2019t say anything. I can tell you one thing \u2014 there\u2019s nothing harmful or evil or anything like that. That\u2019s as specific as I want to get.\u201d\n\nThe event, listed on the Park District\u2019s website, has been a hot ticket item, with almost all 50 spots already gone \u2014 Crane said only about eight $50 tickets remain. At the very least, visitors are guaranteed a snack, a beverage and a tour of one of the oldest and grandest addresses in Oak Park.\n\nCrane said she wanted the event to be, above all, a fun night out for people. A chance to see friends, see history and tour a beautiful, restored local property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old house, it was built in 1897,\u201d Crane said. \u201cWe manage two homes; both are over 100 years old. This is another way to make the patrons engaged and see the historic houses. The Pleasant Home is one of the earliest examples of prairie style architecture in the country, so it\u2019s well-known to architecture buffs and the tour is another way for people to enjoy the home.\u201d\n\nVisitors will also get to learn a bit more about what it takes to detect the paranormal. The OSI team will divide the 50 people into two or three smaller groups and introduce attendees to their gear first \u2014 equipment to measure light, temperature, noise and more.\n\n\u201cThere is a science behind it, it\u2019s not just them talking about what they feel and what they may or may not see,\u201d Crane said.\n\nFrom there the tour will continue through the home, room by room, looking, listening and feeling things that just aren\u2019t right, maybe a cold spot, a strange, sudden bump or maybe a slight glimmer in a mirror, a face in the shadow something fleeting something you\u2019re sure you saw and you hope was caught on film.\n\nWhatever happens, Crane is ready for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think when we\u2019ve done it in the past, it\u2019s been really well received and I\u2019m looking forward to Friday night.\u201d\n\nAnd who knows. Maybe the house is looking forward to the visit, too.\n\nJesse Wright is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press."

Brittany Fournier photo\n\nclick to enlarge Slevin uses every device and method in his and his team's toolbox to find out what's really going down. Bill Slevin photo\n\nWhen world-famous paranormal investigator Bill Slevin spoke during our interview about ghosts and demons, the recording device on my computer started to skip around. Listening back on our conversation, portions became fuzzy, especially as he spoke about exorcisms. The hair stood up on my neck, but the Coral Springs resident was such a compelling storyteller that it was hard to stop chatting.Slevin has been investigating these unknown forces for 35 years but has experienced paranormal events his whole life. Growing up in the 1970s and '80s, nobody talked about supernatural things. \"I never knew what an empath was. I just knew I would go places and feel weird things,\" he recalls. As an empath, he felt other people's emotions and sometimes carried them with him. As a kid, he was also into horror movies and was never scared \u2014 except when he sawHe was curious about paranormal experiences and started to research everything he could about them. He went on to get his PhD in parapsychology and metaphysical humanistic science and has studied quantum physics and mechanics.The first of his more than 1,000 residential haunting jobs was in 1989. A friend brought him in on a frightening investigation. \"Demons are very rare; it's not like TV,\" he says. \"It happened to be a rare demonic case. The guy with me got full-on attacked. That team never did this again, but it gave me a million questions.\" He realized this was his calling. \"I really wanted to know what was real and what was not,\" Slevin says.He and his team at the nonprofit Paranormal Existence Research Society (PERS) are based out of Coral Springs, with teams in other Florida cities, Georgia, Nebraska, the UK, Italy, and Greece. They don't charge people for their work \u2014 it's all free \u2014 but if someone out of state wants to work with them, they will let them pay for travel. \"We don't feel it's ethical [to charge] because it's not 100 percent science.\" His team is a diverse group of talents and includes a Peruvian shaman, hypnotherapist, licensed psychologist, mediums, and psychics.\"We're a mix of intuition and science,\" he says. \"We help these people no matter what.\" That includes people who are suffering from mental illness or substance use issues. Slevin works a day job as an IT director for a psychiatric drug and alcohol treatment facility, which has provided him with the knowledge to identify when clients are suffering from these issues and not an actual haunting.When they first get asked to investigate, the team interviews the clients. If they take the case, they go to the homes at night using a combination of his empath abilities and certain devices. \"Being IT and paranormal \u2014 a very bad mix,\" he jokes. \"I have a ridiculous amount of equipment.\" They experiment with audio and video tools and observe environmental cues with a healthy amount of skepticism. They first assess to see if there are natural causes for the experiences of the clients, like animals in the walls, and they determine if it's a case of the paranormal.\"Everything is energy. When you die, your energy doesn't die. Energy can't be destroyed or created,\" he says. The most common thing his team finds is residual hauntings, in which a person leaves behind energy. He remembers a haunting incident in New Jersey when a client in an old house said that every day at 7 p.m., they heard footsteps up the stairs. The team heard them but couldn't connect with a spirit. It was likely, he says, a \"footprint\" left by someone who passed that walked there daily. The solution? To cleanse the area is something his team teaches people to do for themselves. \"Anybody can wave sage around the house, and it's not going to do anything. It's your intention [that matters],\" and even then, energy can return.To cleanse or protect themselves and their clients, they respect the religious and spiritual beliefs of the people they're helping. If someone is Jewish, for instance, they won't come in waving crucifixes. Unless, that is, if they suspect it's a demonic entity, then they'll use everything in their arsenal to protect themselves.It's usually not anything that sinister. Even funky energy from living clients can cause hauntings. \"Sometimes people can watch five hours of, and now they're panicked, and they can actually manifest stuff to the house. It might not be real.\" He says parapsychology studies have shown that \"a lot of Poltergeist activity is caused by teenagers. That their energy shift is so strong, especially females, that it can actually make things move,\" he says. \"It's not going to pick up a couch and throw it across the room.\"In South Florida, you may not have very old houses, but there are a lot of Indigenous American burial grounds. He used to bring new members of his team to Belgrade, Florida, where there was a 280-acre abandoned prison in the middle of a sugarcane field. \"Because you can say you're into this, but when you're in an abandoned prison at two o'clock in the morning, there's a lot of activity in that place,\" he says. There's now a warehouse built in that spot. \"If they'd built houses there, I'd be going door to door to drop off my card.\"Slevin educates the public about issues related to the supernatural. He's the director and manager of the Warren Legacy Foundation for Paranormal Research, founded by Lorraine Warren and Chris McKinnell, the grandson of Ed and Lorraine Warren, who investigated the Amityville haunting. He speaks as a celebrity guest at conferences and has appeared on TV, radio, podcasts, magazines, and newspapers. He's been on the cover ofmagazine five times.He also spoke about demonology on the Travel Channel documentary, which also streams on Discovery+ and Max. It explores a possible mass possession at the Miami Aerospace Academy High School in 1970. Students ripped doors off the hinges, one girl levitated, and another boy jumped out of the second-floor window unscathed, landing face-first on the concrete and then threw the security guard across the parking lot. The interviewing process unnerved him because when the producers asked specific demonology questions, he didn't want to share any misinformation with the public. He says they're very real but very rare.Slevin will speak at upcoming events at the Coconut Grove and Coral Springs libraries. At his library shows, you can hear more of Slevin's spooky stories, learn about haunted places in South Florida, and see evidence that the paranormal is actually quite normal."

        "article_content": "ABOVE: Gender bias and workplace toxicity fuel mental health deterioration and drive many mid-career female scientists out of academia. \u00a9 iSTOCK,useng\n\nEmbracing change is never easy. The hills and valleys of life are often defining moments, serving as a catapult for growth. In academia, like all other aspects of life, course correction takes courage. An increasing number of successful mid-career scientists grapple with the difficult decision to leave academia for greener pastures, with almost 50 percent leaving within ten years of publishing their first paper.1 Universities are losing their top talent as scientists confront waning motivation, misaligned ideals, workplace toxicity, inequalities, poor work-life balance, clinical burnout, and mental health deterioration.2\u20135 For some, the process between the first niggling of discontent to the first step out of the ivory tower is long, arduous, and fraught with guilt. For others, it is a natural career trajectory towards new measures of success and growth opportunities.\n\nFalling Out of Tune in Academia\n\nGreg Tietjen, chief executive officer of Revalia Bio, lives life like a jazz musician, riffing off opportunities that bridge the many facets of his existence. Tietjen, who also happens to be a jazz guitarist, is a biophysicist/biomedical engineer with a faculty position at Yale University until recently. \u201cI grew up with a deep love and passion for science. I loved space and astrophysics; it was like a bridge to a world beyond the one I was in,\u201d Tietjen said. After high school, he completed an English degree and considered becoming a writer, so that he could translate the complexities of the human experience.\n\nImprovisation and the Path to Self Discovery\n\nGreg Tietjen is both a cofounder and the chief executive officer of Revalia Bio. Yale University\n\nTietjen also played guitar in college, a passion that intensified after graduating, but a physical impairment prevented him from pursuing a musical career. \u201cI was at my wit's end and starting to think about what I should do with my life when fate intervened.\u201d A fall while playing soccer changed the trajectory of Tietjen\u2019s life. One shattered elbow and several surgeries later, he was told he may never hold a guitar again, let alone earn a living from it. Tietjen described receiving the news as \u201ca huge relief.\u201d He recalled lying in his hospital bed contemplating his next move: \u201cI will turn the page; I'm not giving up, but I have to do something different.\u201d He revisited his childhood love of science and mapped out the path to a scientific academic career, starting with an undergraduate degree in physics, followed by a graduate degree in biophysics, and eventually a faculty position.\n\nTietjen pursued a career in translational science, intent on using his skills and knowledge to help patients. \u201cI was missing the humanities part of my brain, that feeling of connection to purpose,\u201d Tietjen said. He joined a clinical department at Yale University and excelled at the challenges of establishing and growing his lab, including securing National Institutes of Health funding and other milestones of professorship. \u201cIt was amazing. The plan I had laid out for myself in the hospital bed came true. It was really profound.\u201d\n\nDissonant Chords\n\nAs Tietjen climbed the academic ranks, he felt a dissonance between his identity as a professor and his inner sense of purpose. The rigors and monotony of academic responsibilities dampened the sparks of passion and inspiration. \u201cYou start to get pulled in all these other directions,\u201d Tietjen said. \u201cTo make that leap from where I was about to get promoted to associate professor, I'd have to jump through additional hurdles, and from there [to becoming a] tenured professor. I didn't feel the motivation to do all that.\u201d Working in an academic setting also limited the type of translational research that interested Tietjen. He began to feel that leaving academia would put him in a better position to derive more immediate satisfaction from his work and to align more closely with his identity and world view. Driven strongly by the need to feel happy and fulfilled in his work, Tietjen soon began considering alternative career paths.\n\nFear keeps people in this loop of dissatisfaction. It's scary to prioritize happiness over certainty and make a choice to walk away from it all to create something even better.\n\n\u2013 Greg Tietjen, Revalia Bio\n\nAfter 10 years as a postdoctoral fellow and faculty member, Tietjen left academia in the same way he entered, with a jazz performer\u2019s knack for fearlessly traversing the next improvisational bridge towards self discovery. \u201cI wouldn't say that I got burned out. Part of what has allowed me to jump through different fields is this intuition around realizing my full potential,\u201d Tietjen said. He saw burnout often amongst his colleagues though, and attributes this to a disconnect between what academics would like to achieve and what they can accomplish when their energy is distributed in many different directions. \u201cI'm not one to judge or demonize the institutions I've been a part of which have unlocked so much potential for me, but I think what can happen in these large organizations is that things become harder than they need to be. Friction builds up over time, and people get tired of losing that energy to the environment instead of seeing the forward momentum [of their research].\u201d\n\nFinding Resonance\n\nTietjen views his academic journey as a process of self discovery and growth. \u201cThere was something deeper I was meant to do. When I saw that I felt like I didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said. Tietjen cofounded Revalia Bio, a startup that builds on his academic work. Free from the constraints of pursuing translational research in an academic environment, he was able to align more closely with the scientific passions that motivated him. Tietjen\u2019s company runs human organ trials using resuscitated donor organs, which are sustained outside the body with perfusion machines like those used in clinical settings. \u201cIt's like a reinvented version of a first-in-human clinical trial. Now you can do experiments that you could never do in any other setting, on the real human system,\u201d Tietjen said. He hopes this work will transform patient care and create a profoundly impactful legacy for organ donors and their families. Tietjen described the immediacy of this work as deeply satisfying. \u201cWe receive this incredibly precious gift of a human organ. My promise to that donor family and to every physician that has enabled this is that we're going to drive massive impact, not just write papers and win awards and grants. It has to change the experience of patients and care providers.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tietjen, humans best thrive when they align with their deep drivers of joy. Trying different things and seeing what resonated helped Tietjen understand what made him happy. \u201cWe don't focus on helping people find the resonance, as much as we do setting standards everyone has to follow,\u201d he explained. Tietjen described the fear of change as a significant challenge for both scientists and organizations. \u201cFear keeps people in this loop of dissatisfaction. It's scary to prioritize happiness over certainty and make a choice to walk away from it all to create something even better.\u201d Tietjen believes the goal should be to maximize human potential rather than shoehorn people into roles that make them unhappy. Personal measures of success are shifting towards feelings of impact and the undeniable reality that life is fleeting. \u201cYou have no idea how much time you have on earth and if you spend it doing things that you don't want to, you may have wasted all that. I've seen people confront that a lot more.\u201d\n\nFacing Workplace Toxicity\n\nMental health is the elephant in the bright halls of academia. Elizabeth Nesika (name changed to protect identity), a former tenured biogeochemist at a small liberal arts college, never imagined that a toxic workplace culture would catalyze her mental health deterioration and precipitate the decision to leave her dream job.\n\nI don't like to think of myself as leaving academia because I was burned out. I was bullied out.\n\n\u2013 Elizabeth Nesika\n\nNesika was ecstatic when she was first offered the position. She described it as one of those experiences in life when the stars align just so. She was thrilled to have the opportunity to combine her passions for environmental science and mentoring. \u201cAt the beginning, it was pretty good. Exhausting, but that's just how it is,\u201d Nesika recalled. \u201cBut there were things that seemed amiss, like I hadn\u2019t been told the whole truth when I was being recruited, specifically around facilities.\u201d Nesika\u2019s first year was one of the most successful in her academic career. \u201cI got two NSF grants and had two high profile publications. It meant that I got a lot of attention in my first year and was on the [departmental] website a lot,\u201d she said, recalling that this attention was not well received by all her colleagues.\n\nNesika multi-tasked the mammoth responsibilities of academic science and continued to push through the challenges, focusing on the things she loved most about her job, amongst which were mentoring students. \u201cI loved the ability to have this huge impact on their lives, much in the same way that I had the privilege of having when I was younger. It was the reason I went to get my PhD, I wanted to be that for someone,\u201d Nesika said. \u201cI had all these amazing students. I loved my classes, I loved my research, and I loved most of my colleagues. It\u2019s like when you get course evaluations. Most of them are positive, but it's really hard not to focus on those few negative ones.\u201d\n\nApproaching the Exit Ramp\n\nNesika travelled the long and winding road towards the academic exit ramp amid what she felt was an insidious drip of toxicity consisting of backhanded remarks, gender biases, gas lighting, minimizing accomplishments, and bullying. \u201cLittle by little I felt less wanted. Resources were withheld from me. I ended up paying for things for my classes out of my research budget and startup,\u201d she recalled. Nesika also sat on various committees and voiced her opinions during meetings. As a junior faculty member at the time, she noticed the inherent power dynamics between junior and tenured faculty. \u201cI really didn\u2019t read the room correctly. I didn\u2019t recognize that \u2018we want to hear from everyone\u2019 wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nOver time, Nesika\u2019s mental health declined, and she realized that tenure would not solve her workplace challenges. Her therapist expressed deep concern for Nesika\u2019s well being and facilitated a medical leave. The tipping point for Nesika came after her department underwent an external evaluation. She was pulled aside by two of the evaluators who suggested that she explore other job opportunities because it was unlikely she would find the support she sought in her current environment. \u201cThat was what led to me applying for jobs, it was the validation I needed. Things had gotten progressively worse,\u201d she said. By the time Nesika left, she was the sixth woman in STEM to leave her small liberal arts college, all for some combination of personal and work-life balance reasons. \u201cMy closest colleague [left] the year after me, and I don\u2019t have a single professor friend who didn\u2019t feel some level of burnout,\u201d she said. Nesika herself was exhausted before leaving academia. Her workload made her less able to cope with the workplace negativity directed towards her.\n\n\u201cI don't like to think of myself as leaving academia because I was burned out. I was bullied out,\u201d Nesika said. \u201cDid I work too much? For sure. But that was in direct response to trying to achieve enough to get a tenure track job.\u201d\n\nNavigating New Roads\n\nNesika felt lost, and when she wrote openly on social media about her experiences, several women in senior positions reached out to provide mentorship. She described the ongoing support from her mentors and friends as \u201camazing and lovely,\u201d particularly the validation she received. \u201cThey told me that it was not okay what was happening to me. Otherwise, I might have been the frog boiling in water.\u201d Nesika also hired a career coach who helped her consider her values and goals, and how they align with her work identity in a more fulsome way. \u201cI don't know if I could have done it with therapy alone, [which] was about surviving. Now, it's about healing and moving towards thriving. The amount of progress I've made on my mental health in the last six months is shocking, I feel like I'm free,\u201d she said.\n\nAs part of this progress, Nesika acknowledged the importance of setting healthy boundaries and realistic expectations. \u201cI bought into this idea that my department was going to be my family and support system and when that didn\u2019t work, and in fact was the opposite, I didn\u2019t have an alternative model to fall back on,\u201d she said. Nesika has also navigated feelings of failure and guilt for leaving her career in academia. \u201cI don\u2019t have it anymore, but [I had] tons of guilt for leaving my friends and colleagues in that toxic space and guilt for that sunk cost that I had put into my career and feeling like a failure,\u201d she described. Nesika now advocates against the pain Olympics that academics engage in\u2014the competition that rewards the highest tolerance for being overworked. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend that I haven\u2019t partaken. It\u2019s hard to be in that space and not have it influence how you behave.\u201d\n\nAdvocating for Change\n\nNesika applied for academic jobs at other institutions but was unable to get her foot in the door. With each rejection she felt as though she was being sentenced to return to the toxic environment she was trying to leave. In her search for a new path, she prioritized opportunities that enabled her to advocate for making science more inclusive, and eventually transitioned to the science policy space. As a scientist, activist, and educator, Nesika continues to apply her passion for advocacy to broaden participation and increase equity, inclusivity, and justice in science.\n\nNesika emphasizes the importance of clarifying a workplace\u2019s code of conduct when applying for jobs. \u201cThat includes things above and beyond what\u2019s legally acceptable. Rules that can be enforced around workplace conduct. Just be clear about their expectations for you and your expectations for yourself,\u201d she said. Recalling her time in academia, Nesika feels little remorse. \u201cI don't regret working there. I'm a better researcher, a better person, a better mentor, [and] a better communicator because of that job. Like any toxic relationship, I wish I had left earlier. But I couldn't tell you when that would have been.\u201d\n\nExperiencing the Fallout of Burnout\n\nAndrew Pelling, a former professor of physics and biology at the University of Ottawa, retired amid a wildly successful career. Pelling is famous for his work using fruits and vegetables for tissue regeneration and creating an open-source DIY cell culture incubator from scavenged trash items. Like the grocery aisle produce he used in his stem cell experiments, Pelling\u2019s approach to science is fresh, combining a knack for biohacking with an appreciation for play and exploration. His lab hosted a diverse group of scientists, artists, and engineers, endowed with the creative freedom to engage in vibrant cross-pollination of ideas.\n\nPelling described the process of scientific discovery as hard and heartbreaking, with incredibly sweet moments in between. \u201cYou're usually completely alone in a dark microscope room when you realize you've discovered something new. It's a special thing to be holding that new piece of knowledge, you are the only person holding on to it in that moment. For me, that's where the addiction started,\u201d Pelling said. He also found tremendous satisfaction in mentoring students. \u201cThat\u2019s what drove me to academia. When I started seeing [the mentorship] piece fall to the wayside that was a signal to me that something was not right. Something had to give.\u201d\n\nThe Bridge to Burnout\n\nAndrew Pelling is founder of multiple startup companies and an adjunct professor at the University of Ottawa. Peter Thornton\n\nPelling left academia because of clinical burnout, one of the many mental health concerns that researchers increasingly face.6 \u201cIt was a long time coming, not a sudden thing,\u201d he said. He described the experience of becoming a full professor in 2018 as anticlimactic. Shortly afterwards, he began asking himself: \u201cWhat\u2019s the next challenge?\u201d He was advised to consider joining the ranks of upper administration but decided against it. \u201cThat's a great path for some people, but not for me. It's not satisfying enough,\u201d Pelling said.\n\nHe began accepting other roles that limited his academic focus. \u201cI was doing a lot and already starting to think it's time to move to something new. This went on for four or five years, to the point where I was pretty burnt out.\u201d Between managing a lab, mentoring students, reviewing papers and grants, serving on committees, starting several companies, consulting, speaking, and travelling, Pelling reached his tipping point. \u201cIt all added up, and at the end of 2022, those final straws broke my back.\u201d\n\nAs Pelling struggled with clinical burnout, he realized it was impacting his mentoring. \u201cI was getting more frustrated with my students. I've always loved working with students and was not feeling that anymore. Once I started to admit to myself that I was burnt out, I realized I had to step back. I wasn't serving my students.\u201d After months of soul searching, he decided to leave academia. \u201cIt's hard because for almost 30 years, this has been my identity. That was tough to grapple with,\u201d Pelling said. \u201cI made a decision in late 2022 but wanted to make sure I landed the plane smoothly.\u201d He told his dean he would take 18 months to wrap up. \u201cThat day I felt amazing. This unbelievable weight came off my shoulders. I had not realized I'd been carrying all this stress and anxiety. It was definitely the right move.\u201d\n\nReflections on Academic Life\n\nPelling described academia as lacking work-life balance. The intense focus on a specific topic is a basic requirement for driving discovery, but it is easy to get carried away. The increasingly arduous demands on professors to take on additional roles creates a slippery slope towards burnout. \u201cIt\u2019s your identity, all the time, 24/7. It caught up with me [after] a lot of bad decisions. It's normalized, this type of life,\u201d Pelling said. \u201cWe're trying to do research at the bench. We're not ever trained to manage people, money, and bureaucracy, or to teach. We\u2019re thrown into these things. Some of us are good at it, some of us are not, and it just all piles on every day. For me it just got to be way too much.\u201d\n\nAcademic science uses imperfect metrics to measure outcomes and impact. Much of this is driven by the need to create accountability for publicly funded projects and balance the responsibilities of universities. However, this creates an environment that is challenging to navigate, ultimately driving away academics who do not want to deal with the operational burdens. \u201cThere are a lot of academics leaving. As I was going through the process, I just kept meeting one mid-career professor after another who had left. It's just all over the place. They get burned out. We must be more intentional about how we design these systems so that we're not burning out our top talent,\u201d Pelling said.\n\nTeaching Moment\n\nPelling\u2019s exit from academia is perhaps one of his greatest lessons for his students. Graduate students are eager to discuss non-academic career trajectories, but there are not many opportunities to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s still very rare; most professors haven't spent time in the private sector,\u201d Pelling said. His advice to students is to attend graduate school only if there is a tangible goal for being there. \u201cIf you want to do fundamental research and spend a lot of time deeply thinking about the fine details of a specific area, go to grad school. But it shouldn\u2019t be the default or backup plan. I\u2019ve never seen anybody really thrive who went to grad school because they graduated from undergrad and that\u2019s what you do next.\u201d\n\nPelling\u2019s decision to leave academia validates the value of course correction, at any career stage. \u201cLet's say you're two years into a PhD, and already put all that time in. That's not an easy conversation but you have to, if you're not happy, make the call. I've met with students to have those conversations, and I really probed them on this,\u201d Pelling said. He dissuades students from spending years in graduate school unhappy and encourages them to do the hard work of considering what they want. \u201cLife is so short; you need to be pursuing things that drive you deep down. There is a responsibility on your shoulders to figure that out. If you don't know what you want, you're going to be rudderless.\u201d\n\nAct Two\n\nPelling views his years in academia as an asset. \u201cThere's so much there I don't think we give ourselves enough credit for, the value you can bring to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm lucky I get to see that in the private sector, how all those skills are translating over. I feel like I may do an even better job in my second act.\u201d In celebration of act two, Pelling and his wife are planning a trip to the Arctic, far up into the Northwest Passage, a trip they delayed for years. Pelling looks forward to the forced disconnection from the internet and outside world. \u201cWe like this type of thing. A few years ago, we went to the Serengeti, camping in the wild for a few weeks. Once I'm back, I'll start to think more carefully about stuff.\u201d\n\nPelling has not yet made plans for his post-academic career. He described the advice he received from other former academics who now hold senior scientific and leadership positions outside of academia. \u201cEvery single one of them told me to take the time and stop. End that portion of your career and make sure it ends well.\u201d Pelling wants to avoid overextending himself with new opportunities but intends to continue working with his start-up companies in active or advisory roles. \u201cI'm very sensitive to taking on too much too soon. I do not want to immediately start overdoing it again, because I know my instinct is to say yes to everything. I'm trying not to make the same mistakes again.\u201d"
