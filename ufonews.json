Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d. Lenticular clouds were visible on Thursday and Friday mornings in North-east England.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "INSTITUTE, W.Va. \u2013\u2013 Local volunteers will donate their time over the next dozen weeks to gather food for local food banks in Kanawha and Putnam Counties. The 44th annual United Food Operation food drive kicked off Friday. It\u2019s a 12 week effort to collect as much non-perishable food as possible to be passed along to the region\u2019s needy.\n\n\u201cWe do our pre-planning and get everything together and as we\u2019re talking to the pantries, they\u2019re running out of food. The need is so great we\u2019ve got to keep this going,\u201d said Elaine Harris, UFO Chairperson.\n\nEach Friday through April, the organization will accept donations of food at their warehouse in Institute to be distributed to a dozen food banks across two counties.\n\n\u201cOur warehouse is right off the Institute exit, there will be a big sign. We can take food and store it there and then distribute to the food banks,\u201d she explained.\n\nThis year the American Postal Workers Union Local 133 has joined the effort. The union members are employed at the U.S. Postal Service Processing Center at Southridge. The facility had originally been slated for closure, but thanks to efforts by the community and West Virginia\u2019s Congressional delegation it was saved and will stay in place. Harris said the organization wanted to get involved in the food drive out of gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their way of giving back to the community because the community was so very involved and supportive of them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur members are very excited to take part in this,\u201d Tim Holstein, Vice President of APWU Local 133, said in a news release. \u201cWe have a table set up in front of the union office at the plant and at the Main Post Office and are asking everyone to bring canned/nonperishable food to donate. One can of food could make a difference in someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe effort accepts any non-perishable goods. They\u2019ll take them at the warehouse each Friday or they can also make arrangements to pick up large donations. Harris said it\u2019s a never ending labor of love.\n\n\u201cThe need is so great. This is working people falling through the cracks. This is how we started this program almost 45 years ago,\u201d she said."

Things take a dark turn when Charlie, Annie's daughter, dies. They begin experiencing paranormal events in their lives.\n\nThrough a paranormal tale, the film explores various interesting themes such as dealing with grief and secrets that many people hide from their families.\n\nHere is the official synopsis of Hereditary:\n\n\"A grieving family is haunted by tragic and disturbing occurrences.\"\n\nWho was the demon in Hereditary?\n\nThe demon in the film is King Paimon who is revealed to be the reason behind all the torment the Graham family has been facing. In the finale of the film, we realize that Ellen, Annie's mother, was a worshipper of King Paimon and followed his cult.\n\nA still from Hereditary | A24 YouTube\n\nHereditary was the first feature film of Ari Aster as a director. It stars Toni Collette, Gabriel Byrne, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro, and Ann Dowd. Ari lent his voice in a scene but his role remains uncredited.\n\nThey tried to bring Paimon into the real world through a human body. In one scene, Annie comes across a book of spells that gives her details about the cult King. He opts for a male body to possess, which defies the usual trope most horror films follow. The need to only have a male host really gives a unique twist to the entire storyline.\n\nIn the last act of Hereditary, we see Peter being possessed by King Paimon, and the latter succeeds in entering the real world. The chilling finale of Hereditary contributed to it becoming a major success. We see everyone hailing Peter (now possessed by Paimon) as the King. The Paimon eventually takes control over the entire family and becomes the head of the cult.\n\nPaimon becomes a relentless force that will not leave the family. He is responsible for their entire misery and pain and will continue to control them. Through these events, we also realize that Joan only approached Annie so that Paimon could eventually find a good male host.\n\nIs the demon in Hereditary based on a real incident?\n\nWhile the entire storyline of Hereditary is fictional, the element of King Paimon is reportedly taken from a real-life book written in the 17th century. As per Screen Rant, it is called The Lesser Key of Solomon. The book works as a guide to summon different kinds of demonic entities. One of them mentioned in the book is named Paimon, just like in the film.\n\nThe book mentions details of Paimon's abilities and powers. While Paimon is one of the demons mentioned, the book still has many more. This opens up some possibilities for a potential sequel to Hereditary in the film.\n\nAri Aster was asked about his sequel plans by Thie Week Media, and he responded by saying that he had an idea. But he didn't reveal much details about the same. If a sequel is announced, fans of the first film would be really happy as they want to know how the Graham family would deal with the Paimon coming to life.\n\nHereditary managed to subvert several tropes that are associated with the horror genre. This includes how a possessed person would look like. Unlike other films, Peter doesn't look different after the demon enters his body. His mannerisms change drastically. These ideas can be further explored if a sequel takes place.\n\nTrending\n\nFor more such stories, stay tuned to Soap Central.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "article_content": "A staple in Minnesota\u2019s science innovation and education has hit a major milestone. The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis is celebrating 50 years of bringing electricity and scientific education to life.\n\nThe museum has become a hub for scientific research, exhibition and archiving, including a rare book and instrument collection, as well as exhibits about electricity, architecture and more.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just a profound love of learning and exploring and discovery at this organization,\u201d the museum\u2019s vice president of programs Anika Taylor said. \u201cI absolutely adore opportunities to work with visitors who are here exploring something and to see them make a connection or make a discovery, or have a moment of sort of lighting up.\u201d\n\nEarl Bakken, famous for co-founding Medtronic and creating the first external wearable battery-powered pacemaker, founded the museum in 1975 in hopes of becoming a research center focused on \u201cElectricity in Life.\u201d It now also includes exhibits about plants, medicine and even Mary Shelley and her book \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d a special inspiration of Bakken\u2019s.\n\nTurn Up Your Support MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all.\n\nAs a child, Bakken spent his time building and taking apart different electronic devices. When he saw the movie version of \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d he knew he wanted to pursue a career in electrical engineering, which he studied at the University of Minnesota.\n\nTaylor says the Mary Shelley exhibit is truly a favorite.\n\n\u201cI just love it, because there are so many fun stories and ideas that connect to this exhibit, the story of who Mary Shelley was and what led her to write that story, the notion that this is sort of our first example of science fiction, and that science fiction has, in turn, also inspired science and inspires the public to consider the science that we do in different ways because we can explore it in fictional realms.\u201d\n\nThe Bakken Museum. pictured on Sept. 18, 2020, is located on the West shore of Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis. Found by Earl Bakken in 1975, it is features interactive exhibits for all ages and STEM education programs. Courtesy of the Bakken Museum\n\nInterim Vice President of Advancement Stu Silberman says what makes the Bakken special is how it \u201cinvests in the future of the state of Minnesota while leveraging its wonderfully historic past.\u201d A past that started before the museum became a nonprofit and was established at its current location on Bde Maka Ska in 1975. Before that, Bakken had been collecting artifacts and literature at his company\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe Bakken is a popular field trip destination with hands-on opportunities like the shock circle that plays with static electricity that sticks students\u2019 hair on its ends or the Bakkenspiel, an interactive musical workshop. Heather Walch, a board member, loves seeing students light up.\n\n\u201cMy absolute favorite part is the kids that are visiting the Bakken when they learn something new, and they don\u2019t really realize they\u2019re learning anything because it\u2019s fun and it's just filled with giggles,\u201d Walch said.\n\nThrough its STEM education program, the Bakken Museum has begun taking educational programs on the road to sites and schools across the state where educators spend a week with students.\n\nTaylor hopes the museum continues to change its \u201chidden gem\u201d persona.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming to visit our museum or whether it\u2019s bringing us out to whatever corner of the state folks are in, we\u2019d love to get as many people involved in celebrating this 50th year,\u201d she said.\n\nThe museum will be hosting events throughout the year to mark its milestone birthday, including a party in October and family discovery day events throughout the year, as well as their \u201cBakkenalia\u201d 21+ events."

            "article_content": "We\u2019ve been waiting for a big ChatGPT upgrade for months now, but OpenAI has yet to announce one. Sure, the company had a monster month of announcements in December. OpenAI took the o1 reasoning model out of beta, making it available to more ChatGPT users. The text-to-video Sora tool is now available to users in certain markets. The o3 reasoning model has also been announced and is currently undergoing testing.\n\nThese are just a few of the AI announcements OpenAI made in December, but there\u2019s no word on when the GPT-4o upgrade will drop. Unofficially, reports say that ChatGPT GPT-5, or whatever it ends up being called, is running behind schedule, as OpenAI has had issues training the next-gen AI model. OpenAI isn\u2019t the only AI company experiencing such problems.\n\nSam Altman has been hyping OpenAI\u2019s accomplishments recently, teasing potential ChatGPT features to come in 2025 while also talking about the larger goals. AGI (artificial general intelligence) is the next big thing, an AI that can tackle any task just like a human would. After AGI, we get to artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is AI that exceeds the capabilities of the human mind.\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\u201d Altman said in a blog post recently, adding that OpenAI is already starting to look at superintelligence development.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHow close are we to that big AI breakthrough? Some people think the recent excitement that some OpenAI engineers are displaying online suggests that the company is indeed close to some sort of big advancement in AI.\n\nSome AI fans noticed the recent teasers from OpenAI employees, as well as an essay from an AI researcher who goes by the name of \u201cGwern\u201d online.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 AI Researcher Gwern just dropped the latest essay on OpenAI o3, o4, o5\n\n\n\nHere are a few important points from the essay:\n\n\n\n\u2013 openAI may have chosen to keep its \"o1-pro\" model private, using its computational resources to train a more advanced model like \"o3\", similar to the\u2026 https://t.co/p10BXXjuQH pic.twitter.com/Zcu7a1uY7C \u2014 Haider. (@slow_developer) January 16, 2025\n\nGwern theorized that OpenAI may hold the key to developing AGI and superintelligence. A powerful reasoning model like the o1 or o1 pro can produce the data needed to train more advanced reasoning models.\n\nThe essay author in the tweet above also said they\u2019re surprised OpenAI isn\u2019t keeping o1-pro private so they can use it for training o3 and newer models. Eventually, AI models will train themselves, leading to the big AGI and ASI breakthroughs we\u2019re waiting for.\n\nGwern suggests that OpenAI may already be on the verge of a big breakthrough, or they\u2019ve already done it behind closed doors:\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why OAers are suddenly weirdly, almost euphorically, optimistic on Twitter, watching the improvement from the original 4o model to o3 (and wherever it is now!) may be why. It\u2019s like watching the AlphaGo Elo curves: it just keeps going up\u2026 and up\u2026 and up\u2026 There may be a sense that they\u2019ve \u2018broken out\u2019 and have finally crossed the last threshold of criticality, from merely cutting-edge Al work, which everyone else will replicate in a few years, to takeoff \u2013 cracked intelligence to the point of being recursively self-improving and where o4 or o5 will be able to automate AI R&D and finish off the rest.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about OpenAI being close to the next massive improvement in AI but also the future beyond that. Access to superintelligence will make subsequent AI developments easier and more efficient because an AI mind will handle the next innovations.\n\nAlso, in a scenario where OpenAI might be close to AGI and ASI, it would obtain an incredible advantage over competitors. Other AI firms that have not established their own superintelligence will have to develop AI with traditional methods. In contrast, OpenAI would have ASI employing its own discoveries to create better AI, and it\u2019ll do it more efficiently.\n\nThis is all speculation at this point, as OpenAI has yet to make any announcements. But it\u2019s all based on the recent hype from Sam Altman and other OpenAI engineers. Of course, they always seem to go out of their way to hype OpenAI\u2019s efforts on social media, so this all could simply be more of the same.\n\nAlso, if and when ChatGPT AGI and ASI are reached, don\u2019t expect it to be affordable or even available publicly. At least, not initially. OpenAI rivals might be just as close to AGI and ASI, but they might be more restrained in teasing imminent breakthroughs.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also the safety aspect to consider. Artificial intelligence, from the current ChatGPT models to AGI and ASI, will have to be aligned with humanity\u2019s interests so it doesn\u2019t develop its own agenda, which could almost certainly endanger our species.\n\nBack to GPT-5, it\u2019ll still be interesting to see what OpenAI does next in terms of ChatGPT upgrades. More news about o3 should come soon. Then, GPT-4o will celebrate its first anniversary this summer. Some sort of upgrade for the base ChatGPT model is surely due soon."

            "article_content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) have historically focused their virtual health care enforcement efforts on \u201ctraditional\u201d telemarketing, broker, runner, and related schemes. These arrangements generally involve sales agents, recruiters, or marketers who direct patients to purported telemedicine companies, which then enter into payment arrangements with physicians and/or non-physician practitioners for the provision of medically unnecessary health care services. The practitioners often have limited or no interaction with the supposed patients, do not review or have access to patient medical records, and order or prescribe medically unnecessary items or services from a predetermined list.\n\nIn July 2022, the OIG formalized its concerns regarding such arrangements in a Special Fraud Alert. As noted by the OIG, these schemes implicate multiple civil and criminal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the civil False Claims Act (FCA), and criminal fraud statutes. The OIG further stated that these arrangements have the potential for considerable harm to both federal health care programs and program beneficiaries, including (1) inappropriate increases in costs for medically unnecessary items and services, (2) patient harm or delayed clinical services, and (3) corruption of medical decision-making.\n\nWhile DOJ and the OIG have continued to pursue and investigate telefraud schemes, two cases announced in 2024 demonstrate a shift in telemedicine enforcement from \u201ctraditional\u201d schemes to more sophisticated investigations and potential criminal exposure in certain matters.\n\nFirst, in June 2024, Ruthie He, the founder, CEO, and clinical president of Done Global (Done), and David Brody, clinical president of Done and the sole physician shareholder of Done Health, P.C., were indicted, arrested, and arraigned in a first-of-its-kind telemedicine criminal prosecution (see our prior post here). Both He and Brody face a seven-count indictment alleging conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nThe indictment alleges that He and Brody orchestrated a scheme to generate over $100 million in revenue by inappropriately offering Adderall and other stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Among other allegations, the defendants purportedly violated the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine and directed practitioners to prescribe and renew Adderall prescriptions without clinical justification. The practitioners were allegedly paid based upon an above-market pay structure tied to the number of patients ultimately receiving prescriptions. Indeed, the indictment asserts that prescribing practitioners often were not licensed in the states where prescriptions were issued and that Adderall and other stimulants were ordered in violation of state physician supervision requirements.\n\nThe prosecution of He and Brody is proceeding in federal court in the Northern District of California before Judge Breyer. In October 2024, He\u2019s bond was revoked, and she was remanded to custody as a flight risk. On December 2, 2024, He filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, moved to compel disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion asserts that the indictment fails to satisfy the knowledge requirement under the Controlled Substances Act, that the health care fraud conspiracy elements have not been adequately alleged, and, in the alternative, that He should be entitled to grand jury materials. On December 16, 2024, DOJ opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing the sufficiency of the indictment and contesting the disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion to dismiss is currently pending.\n\nIn addition to He and Brody, several other Done personnel have cases pending in the Northern District of California. Two Done nurse practitioners and an executive leader have cases pending before Judge Breyer. In the last related case, a Done physician has entered a plea agreement.\n\nSecond, also in June 2024, a behavioral health telemedicine holding company and its practice affiliates (collectively, Supportive Care) agreed to pay approximately $4.6 million to resolve allegations related to the submission of false claims to Medicare and the Connecticut Medicaid program. Interestingly, DOJ alleged that the telemedicine company submitted false claims for \u201ctelehealth originating site facility fees.\u201d Under the applicable Medicare billing code, telehealth originating site fees are only billable when the originating site (in this case the nursing facility) provides administrative and clinical support for the telehealth patient. Instead, here, the telemedicine company and its affiliates billed for the originating site facility code.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ alleged that Supportive Care submitted false claims for psychological services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. DOJ alleged, however, that the beneficiaries were not in fact residing in the nursing facilities and had been transferred to various hospitals and admitted as inpatients. The settlement resolved both sets of FCA allegations.\n\nThese two cases demonstrate that DOJ and the OIG are expanding their investigation and enforcement activities beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d telefraud arrangements into more complex areas. In the Done prosecution, DOJ is seeking to criminally enforce allegedly fraudulent telehealth activity implicating compliance with state corporate practice and physician supervision requirements. In the Supportive Care resolution, DOJ and the OIG focused on the alleged failure to adhere to telehealth-specific codes. Both matters portend a trend likely to continue in 2025 whereby a maturing telehealth industry is subject to more sophisticated government investigations.\n\n[View source.]"

By making it easier to create robot interfaces, it will save users significant time on setup and allow for fast and seamless robot integration across diverse applications.\u201d\n\nCompatible with all ABB robots on the OmniCore controller platform, AppStudio offers unprecedented flexibility and ease for creating customized robotic user interfaces.\n\nAfter installing the software, users can repurpose a previously used setup or select from a cloud-based library of templates, models, modules, and examples enabling them to select options in twenty languages.\n\nAlternatively, customized interfaces can be created to fit any device and application, including the OmniCore FlexPendant, tablets, and mobile phones.\n\nAppStudio also supports customers migrating from the IRC5 controller to the OmniCore platform, significantly reducing the time needed to rebuild interfaces from days to minutes. This feature ensures a smooth transition to the latest technology, enhancing efficiency and productivity.\n\nWith intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, AppStudio offers simplified configuration where users can add icons, dropdown menus, buttons, and other functions to tailor the interface to their specific needs.\n\nIt also supports more advanced users, who can build custom interface elements using a JavaScript-based component kit, enabling a high degree of customization. Once developed, these elements can be shared with other users for streamlined project collaboration.\n\nOnce an interface has been created, it can be deployed to the ABB robot or a digital twin in ABB's RobotStudio\u00ae programming tool. Through this connection, the robot can be programmed to carry out specific commands, such as performing an action or opening a gripper.\n\nTogether with ABB's Wizard Easy Programming tool and RobotStudio, AppStudio makes the ABB robot portfolio one of the easiest to program, marking the start of a new chapter that will see robots being opened to a new audience of potential users."

            "article_content": "The Apache Software Foundation has recently announced the general availability of Apache Hudi 1.0, the transactional data lake platform with support for near real-time analytics. Initially introduced in 2017, Apache Hudi provides an open table format optimized for efficient writes in incremental data pipelines and fast query performance.\n\nOriginally developed at Uber as an incremental processing framework on Apache Hadoop and submitted to the Apache Software Foundation in 2019, Hudi is designed to bridge the gap between database-like functionality and open data lakehouse architectures. Hudi\u2019s main strength lies in its ability to support both near real-time and batch queries simultaneously.\n\nThe latest release introduces new features aimed at transforming data lakehouses into what the project community considers a fully-fledged \"Data Lakehouse Management System\" (DLMS). Vinoth Chandar, creator of the Hudi Project at Uber and CEO at Onehouse, writes:\n\nHudi shines by providing a high-performance open table format as well as a comprehensive open-source software stack that can ingest, store, optimize and effectively self-manage a data lakehouse. This distinction between open formats and open software is often lost in translation inside the large vendor ecosystem in which Hudi operates. Still, it has been and remains a key consideration for Hudi\u2019s users to avoid compute-lockin to any given data vendor.\n\nReleased under an Apache License 2.0, Hudi 1.0 introduces a new secondary indexing system designed to enhance query performance and reduce data scanning costs. Users can now create SQL-based indexes on secondary columns, significantly speeding up query execution. The release also includes expression-based indexing, similar to a feature in PostgreSQL, which replaces traditional partitioning strategies to enable more flexible and efficient data organization. When the preview was announced last year, Boris Litvak, principal software engineer at Snyk, wrote:\n\nAmong the big 3 ACID storage formats on Object Storage, Apache Hudi 1.0 (beta) is the first one introducing \"functional indexes\" over the data. We usually call it \"secondary indexes\" in SQL DB jargon. When will Delta.io and Apache Iceberg follow?\n\nSource: Apache Hudi Blog\n\nThe release introduces support for partial updates, which improves storage and compute efficiency by allowing updates to specific fields instead of entire rows. Additionally, non-blocking concurrency control enables multiple streaming jobs to write to the same dataset without causing bottlenecks or failures. Discussing the database architecture, Chandar adds:\n\nRegarding full-fledged DLMS functionality, the closest experience Hudi 1.0 offers is through Apache Spark. Users can deploy a Spark server (or Spark Connect) with Hudi 1.0 installed, submit SQL/jobs, orchestrate table services via SQL commands, and enjoy new secondary index functionality to speed up queries like a DBMS.\n\nHudi 1.0 introduces enhancements to the storage engine, including the adoption of a log-structured merge (LSM) tree for efficient timeline management. This supports long-term data retention and ensures high-performance query planning, even for datasets containing billions of records. Bhavani Sudha Saktheeswaran, software engineer at Onehouse and Apache Hudi PMC, comments:\n\nWhether you're building an open data platform, streaming into the data lakehouse, moving away from data warehouses, or optimizing for high-performance queries, Hudi 1.0.0 makes it easier than ever to work with lakehouses.\n\nSaktheeswaran and Saketh Chintapalli, software engineer at Uber, presented a session on incremental data processing with Apache Hudi at QCon San Francisco. The session recording is available on InfoQ."

            "article_content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nAreas like the western US face increasing numbers of wildfires.\n\nAs Los Angeles firefighters battle remaining hotspots more than a week into deadly blazes, scientists and engineers hope growing availability of satellite data will help in the future.\n\nTech-focused groups are launching new orbiters as space launches get cheaper, while machine learning techniques will sift the torrent of information, fitting it into a wider picture of fire risk in a changing environment.\n\nSatellites \"can detect from space areas that are dry and prone to wildfire outbreaks.... actively flaming and smoldering fires, as well as burnt areas and smoke and trace gas emissions. We can learn from all these types of elements,\" said Clement Albergel, head of actionable climate information at the European Space Agency.\n\nDifferent satellites have different roles depending on their orbit and sensor payload.\n\nLow Earth orbit (LEO) is generally less than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) above the surface\u2014compared with up to 14 km for an airliner.\n\nSatellites here offer high-resolution ground images, but see any given point only briefly as they sweep around the planet.\n\nGeostationary satellites orbit at around 36,000 km, remaining over the same area on the Earth's surface\u2014allowing for continuous observation but usually at much lower resolution.\n\nAs climate change brings growing numbers of wildfires encroaching on human-inhabited areas, that resolution can be crucial.\n\nIn Los Angeles, \"there are satellite observations, but it's very hard to determine\u2014is it my house that's on fire? Where exactly is this?,\" said WKID Solutions' Natasha Stavros, a wildfire expert who has also worked at NASA.\n\n\"Some people stay because they don't really understand... that's where this idea (that) we need more observations available comes from.\"\n\n'More fire than we know'\n\nBrian Collins, director of Colorado-based nonprofit Earth Fire Alliance, plans a new low-orbit satellite \"constellation\" to complement existing resources.\n\nIt will sport a sensor with a resolution of five meters (16 feet), much finer than ESA's current Sentinel-2 satellites that can see objects only 10 meters wide.\n\nThis means \"we're going to learn very quickly that there is more fire on the Earth than we know about today, we're going to find very small fires,\" Collins predicted.\n\nEFA aims to launch four satellites by the end of 2026, the first in just a few weeks, at a total cost of $53 million.\n\nThat figure is a \"drop in the bucket\" against the property damage and lives lost to wildfires, said Genevieve Biggs of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which has financially supported EFA's satellite project.\n\nIt would take the whole planned swarm of 55, costing a total $400 million, to reach Collins' aim of imaging every point on Earth at least once every 20 minutes.\n\nDozens of satellites in orbit could \"both detect and track fires... at a cadence that allows decisions to be made on the ground,\" Collins said.\n\nLess grandiose efforts include Germany-based OroraTech, which on Tuesday launched the first of at least 14 shoebox-sized FOREST-3 \"nanosatellites\".\n\nThe system will \"deliver ultra-fast wildfire alerts and high-quality thermal data,\" chief executive Martin Langer said in a statement.\n\nThe Moore foundation is also backing a geostationary satellite project dubbed FUEGO.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the film, Israelis described what it was like to experience the deadliest day for Jews since World War II as the Oct. 7 attacks unfolded, with around 1,200 people killed, 5,000 injured and 251 taken hostage. And in Gaza, where more than 40,000 people have reportedly been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliation against Hamas, Palestinians described \u2014 and recorded \u2014 the horrors of large-scale devastation.\n\nAs outrage over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza deeply divided American campuses and in some places devolved into hate-filled rhetoric and arrests, this June 2024 documentary with Retro Report investigated how universities responded, how powerful interests joined the fray, and how the conflict over the conflict ultimately spiraled out of control.\n\nThis documentary, updated in May 2024, offered a sweeping examination of the critical moments over the course of the past three decades leading up to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the role of a central player: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn this January 2024 documentary, correspondent Ramita Navai investigated rising support for militant groups, including Hamas, since the Oct. 7 attack, Israel\u2019s military campaign in the West Bank, and the implications for a region on edge.\n\nThis December 2023 documentary with The Washington Post examined how Hamas was able to breach Israel\u2019s vaunted security barrier and carry out the attack that ignited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nRe-released in October 2023, this seminal 2002 documentary examined how the Israeli-Palestinian peace process begun at Oslo in the 1990s was derailed and ultimately undone by the dynamics of politics and violence. The documentary included interviews with key figures from both sides of the negotiating table, including Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Saeb Erekat and Ehud Barak.\n\nExplore more from FRONTLINE on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

            "article_content": "The inauguration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last Friday ushers in a new chapter for Venezuela, marked by deep socioeconomic wounds. The ongoing financial crisis \u2014 arguably the population\u2019s greatest source of discontent \u2014 persists despite a modest reactivation of consumption. Crisis and political conflict remain intertwined, and after a decade of catastrophic governance and escalating tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, the Maduro government now faces an especially turbulent period.\n\nThe evidence of electoral fraud, which Maduro has been unable to convincingly refute, have heightened international pressure. Both the United States and the European Union have stepped up sanctions, and Maduro is bracing for a new wave of isolation. As in the past, this isolation is likely to exacerbate the nation\u2019s economic struggles.\n\nThe start of Maduro\u2019s new mandate follows three years of moderate economic recovery, a relative improvement considering the depths from which Venezuela has emerged. This recovery was preceded by a historic economic contraction that drastically altered the nation\u2019s landscape over the past decade. Amid this unprecedented economic crisis \u2014 exacerbated by the political isolation of Chavismo \u2014 in 2020, the Maduro government began to distance itself from the statist orthodoxy outlined in the Plan de la Patria, its flagship economic program. Instead, it adopted a series of market-oriented reforms in an effort to stabilize the economy.\n\nThe partial dollarization of the monetary system, the introduction of new exchange and fiscal policies, a more business-friendly stance, and a shift in the treatment of international capital have led to a reduction in year-on-year inflation, a recovery in purchasing power, and some improvement in trade. However, the damage to Venezuela\u2019s productive and social fabric had already been done. The socioeconomic collapse experienced between 2014 and 2020, during Maduro\u2019s presidency, delivered a devastating blow to the nation\u2019s economic framework. This trauma has left many Venezuelans struggling to fully recover from its far-reaching effects.\n\nDuring the years of strict economic controls, company takeovers, conflicts with capital, and excessive bureaucratization, Venezuela\u2019s economy contracted by more than 80%. The local industrial sector was decimated, and now operates at just 30% of its capacity. Thousands of businesses went bankrupt. A wave of nationalizations severely undermined the country\u2019s ability to respond to economic challenges. Hyperinflation, which peaked at an astronomical 9,500% in 2019, wreaked havoc on the economy, devastating the financial stability of millions. Meanwhile, the oil industry, once the backbone of Venezuela\u2019s economy, collapsed under the weight of a fixed exchange rate policy and pervasive corruption in the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Income poverty doubled, and now affects an estimated 80% of the population, according to the Venezuelan Academy of Economic Sciences (ANCE).\n\nAccording to the ANCE, the current level of income poverty in Venezuela is 2.6 times higher than the Latin American average. Income distribution is also among the most unequal in the region, with the wealthiest 10% controlling 37% of the nation\u2019s income.\n\nThe crisis of the past decade left profound scars: wages were decimated, prices soared, shortages of essential goods became widespread, and public services deteriorated dramatically. This collapse triggered a mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans, many of whom fled the country on foot, seeking refuge across South America.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of Venezuela, under Maduro\u2019s control, stopped publishing monthly economic data. Media censorship also worsened. The ruling party\u2019s popularity, which began to decline in 2014, has not recovered since. In 2019 and 2020, the national economy displayed metrics comparable to those of a war-torn nation, with GDP contracting by a staggering 30 percentage points, according to estimates from private consulting firms.\n\nThe popular social assistance programs created by the Chavista government \u2014 such as the Barrio Adentro preventive health initiative, the Mi Casa Bien Equipada goods transfer program, Mercal\u2019s cheap food markets, and the Cuban-assisted Comprehensive Diagnostic Centers \u2014 collapsed during the crisis, largely due to widespread corruption among government officials.\n\nThe minimum monthly wage, traditionally around $400, has dropped to just $3. The government provides periodic bonuses every four weeks, but without retroactive benefits, these only raise the effective minimum wage to $150 per month.\n\nInternational sanctions, particularly from the United States, were introduced in 2016 in response to the political crisis driven by popular discontent. These sanctions significantly restricted Maduro\u2019s ability to explore alternative trade options or revitalize the oil industry. The global search for new markets, spurred by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, fostered a period of cautious d\u00e9tente between Caracas and Washington, leading to a modest revival in the oil sector. However, with the return of Donald Trump to the White House, it is likely that sanctions on Venezuelan oil will tighten further.\n\nNational revenues, heavily reliant on crude oil extraction, hit a critical low point in the last decade, with production dropping from nearly 3 million barrels per day to just 300,000 in 2019. Today, after significant challenges, production is slowly approaching the 1 million mark again.\n\nSince 2016, for the first time in its history, remittances from emigrants have become a significant source of Venezuelan tax revenues. The exodus of between seven and eight million people, according to United Nations estimates, represents an unprecedented event in recent Latin American history, highlighting the severity of Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and the erosion of its citizens\u2019 political rights. Despite implementing measures like food rationing based on the last digit of each citizen\u2019s identity card, the Maduro government has refused to acknowledge its responsibility for the crisis or the existence of a Venezuelan diaspora.\n\nThe disastrous performance of the Chavista administration triggered a political shift. In December 2015, the Venezuelan opposition achieved a decisive victory in the parliamentary elections, sending shockwaves through Chavismo. In response, Chavismo moved quickly to consolidate control over all state institutions. This led to the absolute concentration of power in the hands of Maduro and a select group of loyalists, while the government implemented social programs aimed at maintaining Chavista support and building networks of loyalty.\n\nMaduro introduced the Carn\u00e9 de la Patria, a document offering access to a range of digital subsidies, though the contributions are now minimal, along with the CLAP food bags, which are part of the Local Supply and Production Committees. While the population continues to accept these initiatives, surveys consistently show a sharp decline in popularity. However, any assistance remains inadequate given the collapse of the country\u2019s productive activity. In the meantime, Venezuelans are facing a period marked by political uncertainty and looming economic instability.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

            "article_content": "Open this photo in gallery: A search and rescue team searches the remains of a home burned by the Palisades Fire, in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles on Jan. 14.David Ryder/Reuters\n\nJohn Rapley is an author and academic who divides his time between London, Johannesburg and Ottawa. His books include Why Empires Fall (Yale University Press, 2023) and Twilight of the Money Gods (Simon and Schuster, 2017).\n\n\u201cWhen one suffers, we all suffer.\u201d We\u2019re starting to see, in our daily lives, how apt this bit of biblical wisdom may be.\n\nFor many Canadians, the Los Angeles wildfires bring back unpleasant memories of the fires that ravaged this country in 2023. But more than merely triggering recollections and compassion for those suffering right now, the destruction in California is likely to ricochet through our economy, hurting all of us.\n\nWhen asked if climate change is behind individual incidents like these wildfires, scientists are usually reluctant to attribute cause. But what they are much more confident in saying is that the altered weather and environmental patterns resulting from climate change ensure that the overall intensity and severity of these events will rise.\n\nThe evidence bears them out. The incidence of such extreme weather events has risen some sevenfold since the 1960s, and so too has their economic toll. The Los Angeles fires are now expected to be the costliest disaster in U.S. history, with initial estimates of damages in the US$250-billion range \u2013 and climbing fast.\n\nThat may seem like pocket change in a US$27-trillion economy. Moreover, the cleanup and rebuilding that follow disasters give a jolt to output, which is why economists have long been able to regard them with equanimity. However, a hit to national output of nearly a full percentage point becomes a lot more substantial if it starts recurring often. After all, the Los Angeles wildfires arrived just a few months after a trifecta of hurricanes knocked an estimated 10 per cent off the Florida economy.\n\nBy coincidence, the wildfires broke out in the same week that Munich Re issued its annual report on the total global cost of natural catastrophes, which last year came to some US$320-billion, of which US$140-billion was insured. While this might again seem manageable in a US$100-trillion world economy, the problem is that the average annual costs of such events are now rising more rapidly than global output. That\u2019s not accidental. In the week all this was happening, the Copernicus Observatory reported that last year, for the first time, the planet breached the target set in the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels.\n\nBeyond that threshold, the risks and effects of climate change were expected to rise sharply. It\u2019s now clear that the planet is warming faster than anticipated. And with that, we can expect the incidence and ferocity of climate events, and their attendant costs, to keep rising with equal speed. Over time, climate change will thus erode growth until, ultimately, it could potentially stop it altogether.\n\nWhile that won\u2019t happen in the near future, which is why so many of us are willing to dismiss worries about climate change, what is happening now is that asset prices are starting to feel the pinch. Insurance companies are being forced to reprice insurance policies in areas prone to extreme weather events, making some properties uninsurable and thereby lowering their resale value. That in turn knocks the chain of assets backed by real estate, such as banks and real estate investment trusts. Some analysts even believe the U.S. may be just one big disaster away from a financial crisis.\n\nYet perversely, at the same time some properties are becoming worthless, the prices of others are soaring. Given the city\u2019s sudden scarcity of housing, Los Angeles has become a seller\u2019s market, and rents are increasing dramatically. Yet again, in the sea that is the U.S. economy, such local spikes amount to a drop in the nationwide inflation bucket. The problem is, given that inflationary pressures are rising once more, the growing number of these localized price shocks will accelerate the long-term increase in inflation that many economists expect will result from climate change.\n\nThat, in turn, will support the rise in long-term interest rates we\u2019re now seeing, as central banks try to tamp down inflation. Many market analysts believe we\u2019ve entered a long-term bear market in bonds, with rising yields that boost long-term borrowing costs. With credit costs rising, other markets are already starting to feel the heat, the U.S. stock market having wiped out all the gains of the postelection \u201cTrump bump.\u201d\n\nSlowing economic growth, rising prices, more expensive loans, falling investment portfolios. Yet given the current anemic state of the economy, many politicians are still calling to scrap climate-friendly policies and use cheap carbon-based energies to boost growth. Many voters, eager to see immediate gains, concur.\n\nHowever, as is becoming apparent, the more we try to grow the economy using carbon-based energy, the faster these feedback loops will multiply, slowing the economy. We\u2019ll eventually end up running to a standstill, then falling backward."

            "article_content": "Recent data breaches have highlighted the critical need to improve guest Wi-Fi infrastructure security in modern business environments. Organizations face increasing pressure to protect their networks while providing convenient access to visitors, contractors, temporary staff, and employees with BYOD. Implementing secure guest Wi-Fi infrastructure has become essential for authenticating access, protecting data, maintaining compliance across all geographies, and ensuring business continuity.\n\nEvolved security solutions now combine zero-trust architecture with cloud-based captive portals to enhance network protection. These systems enable organizations to implement strict access controls, verify every device's security status, and maintain network separation. Through advanced features like conditional access and device registration, businesses can now offer secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining complete visibility and control over their network resources.\n\nChallenges in Wi-Fi Security Today\n\nDistributed organizations implementing guest Wi-Fi networks face increasingly sophisticated security challenges. The complexity of implementing and managing secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining network integrity has become a critical concern for both IT administrators and Security practitioners.\n\nCommon security vulnerabilities\n\nModern guest Wi-Fi networks face several significant security threats:\n\nLack of Network Micro-Segmentation: Networks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.\n\nNetworks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data. Weak Encryption: Most of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association.\n\nMost of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data.\n\nAttackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data. Inadequate Authentication: Some networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks.\n\nSome networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks. Rogue Access Points (APs): Attackers can set up rogue APs mimicking legitimate Guest Wi-Fi to lure users and steal sensitive information.\n\nIf not properly secured, the Wi-Fi guest networks pose significant security risks. Weak access controls allow unauthorized users to exploit the network, leading to data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. A critical issue is the lack of network segmentation; without proper isolation, attackers on the guest network may access internal systems, risking data breaches.\n\nInsufficient authentication and weak password practices further heighten vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement VLANs, strict authentication, and active monitoring. A well-segmented guest network helps maintain security while offering convenient access to visitors.\n\nWhy is BYOD the most critical category to monitor?\n\nBYOD introduces a mix of unmanaged and potentially insecure devices into the network. These devices often lack corporate-level security controls and might already be compromised with malware, creating a direct entry point for attackers once connected to the network.\n\nIf the attacker has access to the network through a BYOD, sensitive corporate data accessed via BYOD devices may increase the likelihood of unintentional or malicious data leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the potential actions that can be implemented to mitigate such issues :\n\nProper Network Segmentation\n\nAsset inventory\n\nEncryption\n\nAuthentication Mechanism (like Captive Portal)\n\nProfiled Security Policies\n\nMonitoring and Threat Detection\n\nZero Trust Approach\n\nPotential consequences for businesses\n\nSecurity breaches in guest Wi-Fi networks can have devastating impacts on organizations. Recent studies indicate that 40% of businesses have experienced information compromise through public Wi-Fi networks. The financial implications are significant, with some companies reporting ransomware payments exceeding $1 million to recover their data.\n\nBeyond immediate financial losses, businesses face:\n\nDamage to brand reputation and customer trust\n\nDisruption of normal business operations\n\nPotential loss of intellectual property\n\nCompromise of internal network resources\n\nLegal and compliance considerations\n\nOrganizations must navigate complex regulatory requirements when implementing guest Wi-Fi management systems. The legal framework includes multiple layers of compliance, they need to warrant the security level for their network while ensuring the confidentiality of the users' data, and they need to cooperate with the authorities when required while complying with limited data retention period obligation. It is even more difficult for international organizations because they need to monitor and stay updated on any regulations' changes in various countries and jurisdictions, operating at international levels creates diverse and even contradictory obligations, for example, the data retention policies are different among countries, in France, it is required to retain data logs for 1 year, but it is 6 years in Italy, while the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires users' data to be deleted after the purposes have been achieved. Some key regulations need to be taken into consideration:\n\nTherefore, businesses must implement proper documentation, monitoring systems, and security controls to maintain compliance with these regulations. Regular security audits and network infrastructure updates are essential to maintaining legal compliance while providing secure guest access.\n\nLeveraging Cloud Captive Portals for Enhanced Security\n\nCloud-based captive portal solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern network security infrastructure. These sophisticated systems provide organizations with centralized control over guest access while maintaining robust security protocols.\n\nHow Cloud Captive Portals Work\n\nCloud-captive portals function as gateway systems that authenticate users before granting network access. The system intercepts initial connection attempts and redirects users to a secure login page. Organizations can implement various authentication methods, including:\n\nSocial login integration\n\nSponsor\n\nDeclarative Email\n\nSMS Authentication\n\nThese solutions operate without additional hardware requirements, making them infrastructure-agnostic and instantly deployable across global locations.\n\nIntegration with Zero Trust frameworks\n\nModern Cloud Captive Portals should align seamlessly with Zero Trust security principles by implementing continuous verification and limited access protocols.\n\nThe integration enables:\n\nDevice Profiling & Authentication\n\nIntegrity\n\nAccess Control\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\nAutomation\n\nTraffic Monitoring & Compliance\n\nRequired security features to deploy a cloud captive portals solution\n\nModern captive portal solutions shall incorporate multiple layers of security protection. Innovative solutions now integrate with leading security solutions, enabling administrators to implement granular access controls and URL filtering.\n\nCloudi-Fi platform supports comprehensive compliance requirements through regional data center deployment, ensuring adherence to local privacy regulations. Automated encryption of personal data and transparent collection processes provide users and administrators complete control over information handling.\n\nAdvanced features include integration with cloud-based security platforms, enabling:\n\nCloud firewall implementation\n\nContent filtering capabilities\n\nBandwidth Control\n\nAutomated device onboarding\n\nThese capabilities offer a robust security framework that protects both the organization's network and user data while maintaining seamless access for authorized users.\n\nBenefits of a Zero Trust Captive Portal Solution\n\nThe implementation of Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift in securing guest Wi-Fi networks, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more comprehensive verification model. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations manage and secure guest network access.\n\nZero Trust Cloud Captive Portal solutions provide a scalable, centralized access control layer across multiple sites or large office campuses. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, they allow seamless deployment without needing extensive on-prem hardware, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and secure, device-specific access. The cloud-based platform dynamically scales to handle high volumes of traffic and multiple entry points, while continuously monitoring user behaviors. This architecture not only simplifies management but also enhances security, as threats are isolated, and access is tightly controlled based on identity, device, and risk assessment, all through a unified, cloud-driven approach.\n\nAdapting Zero Trust principles for guest access\n\nOrganizations must carefully adapt Zero Trust principles to maintain security while ensuring a seamless guest experience. The implementation requires a balanced approach that considers security requirements and user convenience. Key adaptation strategies include:\n\nRole-based permissions for the access control\n\nSponsoring, social login with MFA, mail address, \u2026 for user authentication\n\nSegmentation for network isolation\n\nTime-limited access tokens for session management\n\nBenefits of traditional security models\n\nZero Trust Architecture offers significant advantages compared to conventional security approaches. The model eliminates the inherent vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security by implementing continuous verification and granular access controls.\n\nThe transformation from traditional to zero-trust security brings multiple operational improvements:\n\nEnhanced Security Posture Elimination of lateral movement threats\n\nReal-time threat detection and response\n\nComprehensive audit trails Operational Efficiency Automated device onboarding\n\nCentralized policy management\n\nSimplified compliance reporting\n\nThe architecture's ability to maintain strict security controls while supporting dynamic access requirements makes it particularly effective for guest Wi-Fi environments. By implementing least-privilege access principles, organizations can ensure that guests receive only the necessary network resources while maintaining complete visibility and control over all network activities.\n\nIntegrating Zero Trust principles with cloud-based management platforms enables distributed organizations to effortlessly scale their guest Wi-Fi security efficiently. This combination offers network and security administrators powerful tools for monitoring network usage, enforcing security policies, and responding to potential threats in real time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transformation of guest Wi-Fi security through cloud-captive portals and Zero Trust Architecture marks a significant advancement in corporate network protection. Modern organizations require robust security solutions that extend beyond traditional perimeter defenses. The combination of continuous verification, granular access controls, and advanced monitoring capabilities creates a comprehensive security framework that addresses current and emerging threats while maintaining operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness leaders must recognize the critical role of secure guest Wi-Fi in maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data.

Alongside that were children's toys made of clay, cartonnage (a material used to make funerary masks and coffins) as well as funerary masks that covered mummies.\n\nThere were also winged scarabs, beads and funerary amulets.\n\nAdvert\n\nMore basic offerings were also present, including a pottery table used for bread, wine and meat. Archery bows were also present in the tomb.\n\nZahi Hawass (Mohamed Elshahed/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Hawass himself, he said the find could 'reconstruct history' as it has been told.\n\nThe hope is that it will now provide a fuller picture of the lives people had, as well as the culture they were a part of, in Ancient Egypt.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe ancient city of Luxor is famous for housing the Valley of the Kings, included the world famous King Tutankhamun's tomb, discovered in 1922.\n\nEgypt is full of surprises (Mohamed Elshahed/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSituated 340 miles from the Pyramids of Giza, it is known as the 'world's greatest open-air museum'.\n\nThe recent find is different to, say, Tutankhamun, who was buried in a constructed tomb. This week's revelation showed burial chambers carved in to rock to create tombs in the environment that surrounded Ancient Egyptians."

            "article_content": "Astronaut James Irwin salutes in front of the landing module of the Apollo 15 on the moon in 1971.\n\nThe internet is absolutely full of myths and urban legends about space and just about everything else, so readers must be a skeptical these days.\n\nFrom claims of aliens crashing on Earth and UFOs being hidden on military bases, to Mars being abnormally large and the moon turning green, space tends to attract some outlandish or at least highly unproven claims that should be vetted carefully.\n\nHere are some of the biggest space myths and conspiracy theories that just won't go away.\n\n1. The Apollo moon landings were fake\n\nNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin assemble the American flag on the moon during their Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969. NASA astronauts on the International Space Station marked the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch with a video message on July 16. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nTwelve NASA astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, but in the decades since Apollo 11 astronauts first set foot on the moon, many theories have been put forward claiming that the whole Apollo program was staged. However, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has since released photos of the landing sites as they appear on the lunar surface many years later.\n\nSome of the questions moon landing deniers ask are \"Why are there no stars in the sky in the moonwalkers' photos? Why are the U.S. flags fluttering on the surface? Why do you see footprints in the pictures, but no marks from the lunar modules that landed there?\"\n\nIt turns out those questions are easy to answer than you may think.\n\nThere are no stars in the sky for the same reason you don't see stars during the day on Earth, according to NASA: The bright glow of daylight on the surface washes them out.\n\nU.S. flags planted into the lunar soil had metal rods sewn in them to appear as though they were moving, according to NASA. Without these wires, the flag would have hung straight down, making for a pretty lackluster photo prop.\n\nAnd the lunar modules, though heavier, didn't put prominent marks in the surface in some places because their mass was more evenly distributed than the astronauts' weight was in their boots.\n\n2. NASA is a lie\n\nNASA's Artemis 1 moon rocket arrives at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building on Sept. 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA's Kennedy Space Center)\n\nSome people actually believe NASA's whole function is not to explore space, but to generate space-related hoaxes. (The Apollo moon landing is a famous example that we'll explore in the next slide.) People who believe this conspiracy, sometimes flagged with the hashtag \"#NASAhoax\" on social media, will say that amazing space pictures of Mars, Pluto and even Earth are fake, computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nNASA was formed in 1958 \"to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes,\" according to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law shortly after the start of the space race against the Soviet Union.\n\nSince then, NASA has launched hundreds of satellites into orbit around Earth, the moon and several other worlds. In fact, NASA spacecraft have orbited, flown by or landed on every planet in the solar system. NASA also sends astronauts into orbit, where they conduct research at the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n\n\nIf you're not convinced, you are free to travel to Florida's Space Coast to watch a rocket launch for yourself. It's also quite easy to see the space station and other satellites with your own eyes with the help of a satellite tracker.\n\n3. The Earth is flat\n\nEarth as seen from space (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThis myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space \u2014 which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.\n\n\n\nOne way of demonstrating to yourself that the Earth is round is to consider how orbits of satellites work. Satellites constantly \"fall\" around the Earth as they are pulled around by our planet's gravity; they just need to be traveling fast enough at a high enough altitude to not slam into the atmosphere. Or, you can look at the amazing pictures taken by astronauts at the ISS.\n\n4. Planet Nine will kill us\n\nArtist's illustration of the hypothetical Planet Nine, which may lie undiscovered in the outer solar system. (Image credit: Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nIn April 2016, the New York Post tweeted, \"A newly discovered planet could destroy Earth as soon as this month.\" The newspaper was referring to Planet Nine, a theoretical planet at the edge of the solar system. An accompanying video also claimed that the new planet would be throwing all sorts of asteroids and comets at Earth, which would supposedly end up pummeling our planet.\n\n\n\nAlthough the existence of a ninth planet has not been confirmed, astronomers are actively looking for one to help explain motions of some objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects beyond Neptune. If the planet is actually found, the planet will pose no threat to us, according to the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown (who is one of the original backers of the Planet Nine theory).\n\n5. Alien research is happening at Area 51\n\nArea 51's restricted area covers over 90,000 acres (36,000 hectares) . (Image credit: Roger Holden via Getty Images)\n\nThe 1996 movie \"Independence Day\" is one of the main sources of the Area 51 hoax, which claims that aliens and their technology \u2014 recovered from crashed flying saucers \u2014 are being studied secretly at a classified military base about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. Some people in the area around the base claim that they have seen strange lights or objects flying in or out of this area.\n\n\n\nWhile the testing and development conducted at Area 51 is classified, the U.S. government has acknowledged its existence (although the CIA officially calls it \"Homey Airport\" or \"Groom Lake\").\n\nA part of Edwards Air Force Base, the area was a known location for high-technology airplane flights in the 1960s and 1970s. It first served as a proving ground for Lockheed U-2 and A-12 OXCART spy planes as early as 1955. UFO sightings reported in the area were indeed unidentified objects, but only because the planes were top-secret \u2014 not because they were flown by aliens.\n\n6. There is a killer planet known as \"Nibiru\"\n\nArtist's conception of the fictional rogue planet Nibiru, or Planet X. Nibiru does not exist, so don't be fooled. (Image credit: gilderm | sxc.hu)\n\nConspiracy theorists say another dangerous planet is Nibiru, which was first mentioned in the 1976 book \"The Twelfth Planet,\" by Zecharia Sitchin. In the book, Sitchin translated ancient Sumerian cuneiform and claimed that the text is proof of a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru that orbits the sun every 3,600 years.\n\n\n\nYears later, self-proclaimed psychic Nancy Lieder claimed to have communicated with extraterrestrials who said Nibiru would collide with Earth in 2003. When that didn't happen, the date was moved to 2012 (and linked, of course, with the 2012 doomsday predictions). Of course, the collision never occurred, the world didn't end in 2012 and no astronomer has ever found a planet on a collision course with Earth.\n\n7. There is a face on Mars\n\nThe original 'Face on Mars' image taken by NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, in grey scale, on July, 25 1976. Image shows a remnant massif located in the Cydonia region. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took a picture of what appeared to be a face on Mars. Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.\n\n\n\nNASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.\n\n8. The moon Iapetus is an alien Death Star\n\nSaturn's moon Iapetus. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIapetus is a moon of Saturn that looks somewhat like the infamous Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with a large crater that resembles the fictional weapon's superlaser focus lens. The Death Star is a planet-killing machine that destroys entire worlds with its outrageously powerful laser. It was prominently featured in the 2016 movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" as well as in 1977's \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\"\n\n\n\nA Daily Mail article published in May 2016 claimed Iapetus is an artificial object crafted by aliens. As \"evidence,\" the article cited a photo taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. In the photo, there's a line around the moon's equator that resembles the equatorial trench around the Death Star.\n\nBut this line isn't nearly as interesting as the Death Star's trench, which houses the battle station's engines, thrusters and docking bays. That line is nothing more than a mountain ridge, and Iapetus is actually just made up of boring old rock and ice. Cassini has flown by the moon to take pictures several times without being blasted by deadly alien lasers.\n\nSaturn's moon Mimas, with it's giant crater Herschel, also looks surprisingly like the Death Star.\n\n9. Saturn's hexagon is alien technology\n\nThis movie, made from images obtained by Cassini's imaging cameras, is the first to show Saturn's hexagon in color filters and the first movie to show a complete view from the north pole down to about 70 degrees north latitude. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/Hampton University)\n\nSaturn's hexagon was first spotted when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by the giant, ringed planet in 1980. The bizarre, six-sided structure on the round planet's north pole caused quite the stir, because straight lines and polygons are not so common in nature.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the Voyager returned its first images of Saturn's strange feature, even stranger theories arose to explain it, including that it was somehow related to alien technology, or perhaps even was a gateway to hell. The hexagon is not artificial, but rather a weird-looking hurricane at Saturn's pole.\n\nNASA has done several flybys of this region with the Cassini spacecraft, studying the haze particles and other features of the storm, to try to learn more about its unusual properties.\n\n10. Mars is as big as the moon\n\nThe solar system to scale. The diameter of Jupiter (middle, with red spot) is about 11 times that of Earth (third planet from the left). Mars is the second-smallest planet in the solar system (fourth planet from left). (Image credit: Lunar and Planetary Institute)\n\nOriginating in 2003, the infamous Mars hoax asserts that Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in the 60,000 years prior, and that the planet will appear as large as the full moon. What started out as a misconstrued email turned into a recurring rumor that gets reshared every August and, naturally, has spread to social media as it became more popular.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mars is indeed relatively close to Earth in a cosmic sense, it will never be as large as the full moon. It will appear as a red dot in the sky, just as the ancient astronomers saw it. If you'd like to see Mars magnified, take out a telescope or look at one of NASA's spectacular Mars pictures."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them.

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "MAJMA\u2019 Lagos Graduates New Set Of Students\n\nThe Secretary General, Association of Arab Universities, and Egypt former Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Professor Amr Ezzat Salama, has said that societal progress should not solely be measured by advancements in natural sciences, because unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity.\n\nSpeaking at the graduation ceremony of the 2023 and 2024 classes from the MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Lagos in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah studies, Salama stated that human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\n\nHe, therefore, underscored the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness.\n\nSalama urged the graduates to remain steadfast in adhering to the values derived from the Holy Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah, adopting a balanced approach in faith, conduct, and service to their communities while spreading noble values.\n\n\u201cThe Arabic language, chosen by Allah as the medium for His final revelation, is the language of the Holy Qur\u2019an, the Sunnah, prayer, pilgrimage, supplication, and the rich Islamic civilization that has flourished across centuries. For every Muslim, understanding Islam in its true essence cannot rely solely on translated works but must come directly from the original texts written in Arabic.\n\n\u201cDuring the medieval era, the Islamic kingdoms that thrived in East and West Africa played a significant role in rooting the Arabic language among local populations and transferring Islamic civilization and thought.\u201d\n\nCongratulating the graduates, Salama stated that the academic degrees are the fruit of hard work and dedication which will serve as keys to their next endeavours.\n\n\u201cI also encourage you to equip yourselves with Islamic knowledge while keeping pace with advancements in science and technology, particularly in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This revolution has introduced a new reality, demanding advanced skills in fields like artificial intelligence, automation, and big data.\n\n\u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution and AI technologies have significantly transformed the nature of jobs, creating an urgent need to balance applied sciences and humanities. This ensures that technological progress becomes a tool for building societies, not a threat to them.\n\n\u201cI must stress the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness. Societal progress is not solely contingent on advancements in natural sciences.\n\n\u201cThe unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity. Human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\u201d\n\nSalama argued that the youths are the primary drivers of development and its ultimate beneficiaries. \u201cTherefore, we must continue investing in young people through education, training, and skill development to ensure they remain innovative and distinguished in this era of rapid transformation.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Association of Arab Universities is to solidify the true image of Islam and its noble message to humanity. The association supports academic and scientific endeavours aimed at spreading the teachings of Islam based on its primary sources, the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah.\n\n\u201cNotably, the Association\u2019s Sharia Colleges Network plays a leading role in publishing research and studies in Islamic sciences across Arab universities.\n\n\u201cIn our discussions with leaders in Nigeria, the Association seeks to strengthen collaboration with Nigerian academic institutions, particularly in Arabic language education, Islamic studies, and historical research. The Association has also organised training programmess for students of the Research and Training Complex at Arab universities, reaffirming its commitment to supporting higher education and serving the issues of the Islamic nation.\u201d\n\nIn his presentation on the goals and aspirations of the institute, President, MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Professor Saheed Ahmed Rufai, highlighted the centre\u2019s area of focus to principally be around training in Islamic Revealed Studies (English, Arabic), Arabic Studies (Arabic, English), Educational Studies (English, Arabic), General Studies (English) and other possible areas of societal need.\n\nHe also said that the centre would be engaging in research and publications, counseling as well as speaking with the target audience being residents of Nigeria who want to learn Arabic and/or further their Islamic education though it would not be blind to interested persons from outside Nigeria if they are willing and able to sponsor the above persons.\n\nRufai said that the channel of engagement for its training, publications and public speaking will be through website, social media and conventional media along with in-person classes, online instruction, distance learning and directed self-study.\n\nAs the centre looks into the future including expanding its reach, Rufai said that it needs support to have its own building, computers, office furniture, office equipment, bus, library and broadband internet.\n\nOne of the special guests at the event, Pro-chancellor/ Chairman, Governing Council of Summit University, Offa, Kwara State, Alhaji Rafiu Adisa Ebiti, also tasked Muslims to learn and deeply understand Arabic language as a pathway to understanding the teachings of Qur\u2019an and the voice of Allah.\n\nAt the event, diploma, advanced diploma and post graduate diploma certificates in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah were presented to graduates trained through MAJMA Training and Research Centre, Lagos.\n\n"
