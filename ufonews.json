FOX 5 New York\n\nManhattan Alien Abduction: 35 years later\n\nOne of the most famous \u2014 or infamous \u2014 alleged close encounters in the city is now the subject of \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction\u201d on Netflix, with Linda Napolitano\u2019s claims the subject of as much attention as they were doubt.\n\nNapolitano, then 41, lived with her husband and two sons in an apartment near the Brooklyn Bridge at the time of the alleged abduction 35 years ago.\n\nThe native New Yorker said that on the night of Nov. 30, 1989 she was lifted out through her apartment wall in a beam of light, soared above the East River into the sky over Manhattan, and into a clam-like alien spaceship that appeared to contain volcanic fire.\n\nNapolitano shared her story with Budd Hopkins, a ufologist who was in the midst of documenting a case study centered around what he believed to be a credible individual.\n\n5 Manhattan resident Linda Napolitano claimed she was abducted by aliens in 1989. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe alleged abductee\u2019s hypnotic regression in the days after the event is shown in the docuseries.\n\n\u201cOh I feel like electricity just went through me,\u201d Napolitano says in one exchange with her eyes closed and Hopkins leaning over her, head in his hand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone in the room,\u201d the allegedly hypnotized Napolitano says in the footage.\n\n5 Napolitano\u2019s alleged alien encounter was featured in the Netflix documentary series \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction.\u201d Courtesy of Netflix\n\nShe then describes being lifted through her solid door, floated in the air in her nightgown, and drawn into a fiery clam.\n\nInterview footage, both contemporary and from the early 90s, show witness accounts of varying credibility and veracity. Many critics later poked holes in her claims.\n\nThe Mysterious \u2018Near Miss\u2019\n\nA commercial plane had a \u201cnear miss\u201d with a cylindrical object off the coast of New York that has yet to be identified or explained, according to Congressional testimony from Pentagon representatives from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\nAn airline crew reported to the Federal Aviation Administration that their commercial plane \u2014 from an unnamed airline \u2014 had a \u201cnear miss with a \u2018cylindrical object\u2019 while over the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d\n\nThis undated encounter was just one of more than 20 reports made over the past year that have stumped AARO investigators, with agency director Jon Kosloski describing them as \u201ctrue anomalies.\u201d\n\nKosloski revealed to a congressional oversight committee that the agency received 757 reports of sightings from May 1, 2023 and June 1 of this year.\n\nThe \u201cclose call\u201d off the coast of New York is considered one of 21 anomalous cases that require further investigation, according to the agency.\n\nJohn Lennon\u2019s close encounter\n\n\u201cImagine\u201d that: John Lennon reported seeing a UFO in New York on Aug. 23, 1974.\n\nThe famed singer-songwriter said in an interview after the event that he had seen an unique aircraft zooming around the East River from his apartment.\n\n\u201cUp there, I saw a UFO,\u201d Lennon said to an interviewer, pointing to his penthouse apartment that overlooks the water.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd it went down the river, turned right at the United Nations, turned left, and turned down the river.\n\n5 John Lennon claimed to have seen a UFO in New York City in 1974. Photo by Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a helicopter, and it wasn\u2019t a balloon, and it was so near,\u201d Lennon said, animatedly to the interviewer.\n\nLennon described the craft as being \u201csilent\u201d and \u201cdark.\u201d He said it was round, black or gray in the middle, with blinking lights that looked like \u201clight bulbs\u201d circumscribed on the sides, and was completed with a red light on its top.\n\nLennon tried to take photos of the craft \u2014 none of which came out legibly \u2014 and even called the cops, who said they had received other calls about an object flying through the sky, according to The New Daily.\n\nLennon also commemorated the occurrence in the liner notes of his album \u201cWalls and Bridges,\u201d writing, \u201cOn the 23rd Aug. 1974 at 9 o\u2019clock I saw a U.F.O.\u201d\n\nLatest mystery\n\nEarlier this week, a local news station aired video that incidentally showed a mysterious orb appearing to zoom down the Hudson River.\n\n5 The blue orb was caught on camera during a helicopter news report. FOX 5 New York\n\nA local report on congestion pricing aired a random four-second clip of the lower Manhattan skyline, the Hudson River and parts of New Jersey.\n\n\n\nIn that clip, a mysterious blue orb can be seen apparently zooming down the Hudson River and past the camera.\n\nAvi Loeb, a theoretical physicist, cosmologist and Harvard professor, believes the apparent orb is a trick of the lights.\n\n\u201cThis is most likely an optical artifact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera, namely a bright spot from the reflection of sunlight as the camera gradually changes its orientation relative to the sun and the ground,\u201d Loeb tells The Post.\n\nOthers believe that it was a physical object merely affected by the speed of the helicopter and the angle of the camera."

            "article_content": "A congressional hearing this month calling for greater government transparency on UFOs is one of the latest events spurring public interest in aliens.\n\nBut beyond many people\u2019s fascination with the nuts and bolts of unidentified objects flying at physics-defying speeds and trajectories lies a yearning for enlightenment and transcendence, says Northeastern psychology professor David DeSteno.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to spawn new spiritual movements that could replace or become incorporated into more traditional religions in some instances, he says.\n\nA UFO religion?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common view among religious scholars that religion has always been about powerful beings coming down from the sky and human beings going up,\u201d says DeSteno, who has a podcast called \u201cHow God Works: The Science Behind Spirituality.\u201d\n\nA belief in superior alien technology and guidance \u201cfills that God-sized hole\u201d in the hearts of people who have abandoned mainstream faith practices, he says.\n\nIndividuals are connecting through meetups for meditation sessions intended to contact aliens and for skywatching parties in an attempt to witness superior UFO technology that many believe comes from other worlds, DeSteno says.\n\n\u201cThey are looking for new ways to be spiritual because they feel that need in their life,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t feel the mainstream churches and temples and religions are meeting their needs, so this became an avenue that\u2019s open to people, especially because it seems like it might be science based,\u201d DeSteno says.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s 2020 release of the \u201ctic tac\u201d and \u201cgo fast\u201d videos that appear to show flying vehicles performing unearthly feats helped fuel public belief that there is something in the skies that\u2019s vastly superior to human capability.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of new religions that form in a year,\u201d DeSteno says. \u201cThe ones that take off are the ones that speak to the moment. And I think that, right now, this is one.\u201d\n\n\u2018Blacker than black\u2019\n\nDuring the Nov. 13 hearing by the House Oversight Committee, which included the testimony of military officials, U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia said, \u201cWe have evidence that we are detecting things, and we know that we don\u2019t understand them, and this is worth investigating.\u201d\n\nSix days later, the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities heard that a law enforcement officer investigating the appearance of a large orange globe reported seeing an auto-sized object that was \u201cblacker than black\u201d shoot from the ground into the sky faster than any drone.\n\nThe idea of aliens having power greater than humans can conceive has religious overtones, DeSteno says.\n\nPowerfully good \u2013 or bad?\n\nWhile many people attempting to commune with aliens believe they are here to help humanity heal from disease and become more spiritual, others aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cThere are beliefs in certain Christian communities that (aliens) might be demons,\u201d DeSteno says.\n\nEven the eminent physicist Stephen Hawking advised humanity to shun potential alien contact, pointing out that things did not go well for Native Americans when Christopher Columbus arrived on the scene.\n\nIt\u2019s oftentimes true that \u201cwhen more powerful groups conquer other groups, they enslave them,\u201d DeSteno says. \u201cWe have no idea if (aliens) are beneficent beings.\u201d\n\nUFO cults?\n\nBelief in godlike aliens resulted in tragedy for individuals belonging to the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult in 1997.\n\nThirty-nine cult members killed themselves in the belief a spaceship would follow the appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet and whisk their consciousness off to the heavens.\n\nThey thought the media, government and corporate interests were hiding the truth about aliens from the public.\n\nThat nerve is currently being struck by the Pentagon\u2019s annual All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) report, which states that while many cases of UFOs remain unresolved, there is no evidence of extraterrestrial activity among hundreds of cases that were investigated and closed.\n\n\u201cCult is a tricky word because we often call small religions cults,\u201d DeSteno says, even though they may go on to become mainstream religious movements.\n\nHe says whatever the belief system of a new religion is, members need to make sure they are not being exploited by a charismatic leader.\n\nConspiracy theories are problematic, in that they allege the government is \u201cintricately, intimately involved\u201d in suppressing evidence of UFOs, DeSteno says.\n\nAre UFOs in religious texts?\n\nHe says texts from epic Hindu poetry to the Judeo Christian Bible describe phenomena that seem very similar to UFOs and aliens in modern eyes.\n\nThe most well-known might be the Old Testament account of the priest Ezekiel encountering sparkling wheels rimmed with eyes in the sky, a vision that is meant to represent the omnipresence of God.\n\nInstitutions like the Catholic Church have recognized that aliens may exist, and if they do \u201cthey were created by God, too,\u201d DeSteno says.\n\nAs for his own beliefs, DeSteno says, \u201cI would say it would be incredibly surprising if there were no other life in the vastness of the universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether they\u2019re here or not, or whether they\u2019d be friend or foe, remains an open question.\u201d\n\nWritten by Cynthia McCormick Hibbert/ Northeastern University."

Learn More.\n\nIn advance of the upcoming 2025 Jubilee, the Vatican unveiled a digital twin of the iconic St. Peter\u2019s Basilica this week that will provide an immersive experience for millions of people from around the world without having to visit Rome. It partnered with artificial intelligence leader Microsoft and Iconem, a French startup specializing in the digital conservation and preservation of heritage sites, to develop the 3D replica of the centuries-old basilica, a centerpiece of the Catholic faith constructed in 1506.\n\nIn 2023, a team of experts used cameras, laser scanners, and drones to collect 400,000 high-resolution images of St. Peter\u2019s. The massive 20-petabyte amount of data collected over more than a month is equivalent to five million DVDs that, stacked atop one another, would reach up to 6,000 meters high. The team used cutting-edge AI technology to piece the images together into a realistic digital recreation of the basilica. The photos will also be used to identify parts of the structure needing repairs.\n\n\u201cIt is literally one of the most technologically advanced and sophisticated projects of its kind that has ever been pursued,\u201d Microsoft president Brad Smith said at a press conference unveiling the effort.\n\nUsing Technology to Connect History, Arts, and Religion\n\nMicrosoft has been working with the Vatican since Pope Francis called for the ethical use of AI and emerging technologies in 2018. The company previously created a 3D holographic model of Mont-Saint-Michel, a tidal island commune and abbey in France.\n\nOn an ordinary day, the Vatican sees about 50,000 visitors. More than 30 million pilgrims from across the world are expected to visit for Jubilee 2025, announced by Pope John Paul II in 2000. To accommodate those who can\u2019t make the trip, the digital twin is accessible online to anyone who wants to visit.\n\nThe Vatican will deploy other AI-powered technologies and will launch a new website and app next month. The website will feature virtual views, streaming religious services, and podcasts of prayers and homilies.

            "article_content": "When Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024 in mid-June, we knew the vision Apple laid out would take time to complete. iOS 18 did not deliver any AI features during the first beta tests over the summer, a big indication that the iPhone 16 would launch without any AI features on board.\n\nLeaks made it clear that Apple will start rolling out Apple Intelligence in phases, with the first feature set to drop about a month after the iPhone 16. Apple confirmed it all while also turning the delayed AI features into the biggest selling point for the new iPhones.\n\nWith November almost over, iOS 18 lacks ChatGPT integration (unless you\u2019re on the latest beta), and the smarter Siri that can control apps better than before isn\u2019t coming until next spring.\n\nIt turns out that Apple might employ a similar approach for iOS 19. Some features might be unveiled at WWDC 2025, but you might have to wait until 2026 to enjoy them on devices that support Apple Intelligence. Among them, we\u2019ll get a new \u201cLLM Siri\u201d chatbot that Apple is developing. The LLM Siri would be similar to ChatGPT. That is, it\u2019ll let you conduct conversations identical to what ChatGPT can do.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nThe Siri experience coming via the iOS 18.4 update can\u2019t do that. As Mark Gurman explains in his latest Power On newsletter, the first version of Apple Intelligence will make \u201ccosmetic\u201d changes. You get the new user interface, and support for typing questions to Siri instead of speaking them.\n\nMore interesting ar Siri\u2019s new abilities to access user data for contextual information about the user and control third-party apps via the new App Intents software. However, Gurman points out that Siri isn\u2019t getting a ChatGPT-like model for these tasks:\n\nThese upcoming upgrades will make Siri easier to use on a day-to-day basis, but it\u2019s not the brain transplant that the service really needs. Siri is still based on an outdated infrastructure \u2014 AI models that have been overtaken by the technology used by ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. Siri hasn\u2019t yet been rebuilt for the generative AI age, even if Apple is trying to create the impression that it has.\n\nThat\u2019s why Apple partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT into iOS 18. Siri can\u2019t match that functionality.\n\nBut Apple is developing a Siri chatbot of its own, which is called LLM Siri internally. Apple is reportedly actively running and testing the new service. LLM Siri will be more conversational and use Apple\u2019s large language models.\n\nChatGPT app running on an iPhone. Image source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nWhile that\u2019s an exciting development, albeit unconfirmed, it\u2019s not exactly good news. Apple plans to unveil the LLM Siri at WWDC 2025, when iOS 19 will be announced. However, LLM Siri will not become available until the spring of 2026.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the LLM Siri chatbot that will be released in 2026. Gurman says that a \u201clarger-than usual number of features scheduled for iOS 19 (beyond the new Siri) are already postponed until spring 2026 (when iOS 19.4 debuts).\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily surprising, considering what we saw with iOS 18. Maybe it\u2019s for the best, too. I\u2019d rather get polished, finished features on my iPhone than beta tests getting released commercially with warnings that I might encounter issues. The delay to 2026 wouldn\u2019t even be that big. After all, Apple\u2019s biggest rivals are struggling with their own AI upgrades. Apple has time to catch up after having started late in the game.\n\nThat said, Gurman doesn\u2019t say which iOS 19 features will be delayed to 2026 and whether they\u2019re all AI functionalities."

No longer just hunting for lost souls but claiming she\u2019s saving them as well.\n\nMary Hels says she has always had a close connection to the supernatural. Which inspired her to start her team, Spirit Haven Investigations several years ago. However, after noticing the aggressive tactics usually taken by self-proclaimed ghost hunters, she knew she wanted to do something different.\n\n\"Spirit haven is about saving souls, not only the living souls,\" Hels explained. \"Those of us that need to know Jesus and don\u2019t realize it, but we have loved ones, that died that didn\u2019t know Jesus either.\u201d\n\nHels says her connection to the paranormal started from as young as 10. Now after several years of trying to document spirits, she feels what those possible wandering souls really need is saving.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much you tell them to go away, the longer they\u2019re here the madder they\u2019re gonna get,\" she said. \"So convert them. Convert them, even though they\u2019re passed ask em\u2019, Would you like to have Jesus in your life?\u201c\n\nFrom her living room altar, she does her sermons over the web. Reaching a small congregation of only a few dozen, but she said she\u2019s not limiting her members to the living.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already dead, that\u2019s worst case scenario,\" Hels explained. \"Why keep kicking them in the head? If they love you so much that they\u2019d rather be with you than where their eternity is, embrace them. \u201c"

            "article_content": "A man browsing Google Maps of the Nullarbor Plain in Southern Australia stumbled upon a strange \"scar\" pattern, prompting further investigation by scientists.\n\nPeople have discovered all sorts of oddities while browsing through Google Maps, from \"aliens\" and camera-hogging cats to the answer to decades-old cold cases and meteor impact sites. In this latest find, a caver searching for caves and karsts in the southern Australian outback saw an unusual feature around 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) north of the Trans-Australian Railway, and 90 kilometers (56 miles) east-north-east of an old railway settlement named Forrest. It's a big one too, measuring around 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) long and between 160 and 250 meters (525 and 820 feet) wide.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInvestigating the mark, Matej Lipar, Adjunct Research Fellow at the School of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Curtin University, looked back at older Google satellite imagery, discovering that it first appeared sometime between November 16 and 18, 2022.\n\n\"Blue circular patterns appeared alongside the scar, indicating pools of water associated with heavy rain,\" Lipar explained in a piece for The Conversation. \"Upon closer investigation, we realised the scar was created by a ferocious tornado that no-one knew had occurred.\"\n\nThe team visited the site and also looked at other historical weather data from the time to investigate the possibility further.\n\n\"The weather patterns during this period were marked by the passage of a strong cold front from west to east, coupled with tropical moisture, creating an environment conducive to severe weather,\" Lipar writes in a new study. \"Cloud imagery indicated intensive cloud cover over the region on 17 November 2022, and nearby weather stations recorded significant rainfall, correlating with the observed scar formation.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTornados have been reported plenty of times in Australia before, and have been seen on every continent other than Antarctica.\n\nMonitoring them is of course important, given their destructive capabilities. Though no human settlements or property were nearby, it appears that in November 2022 we missed a reasonably big one. Looking at the weather patterns and marks, the team was able to estimate its strength.\n\n\"The characteristics of the scar, including its cycloidal marks indicative of suction vortexes activity, and the analysis of associated weather patterns, indicate a tornado moving in an eastward direction and swirling clockwise, with an estimated strength within the F2 or even F3 category on the Fujita scale, with wind speeds likely exceeding 200 [kilometers (124 miles) per hour],\" Lipar added, estimating that it lasted between seven and 13 minutes.\n\nCycloidal marks helped the team determine the culprit was a tornado. Image credit: Matej Lipar/Google Earth\n\nThe team believes this discovery is particularly important, given how this region is devoid of potential eye-witnesses to tornados, and the lack of infrastructure and property that can alert scientists to the weather phenomenon, ultimately by being damaged by them.\n\nOnly three tornadoes have been documented in the Nullarbor Plain, but they could occur more frequently and go unnoticed due to the area's remoteness. The team suggests that further use of satellite imaging could help study tornados in similarly remote regions, and perhaps even using machine learning could help to identify other tornados we may have missed.\n\n\"The improved understanding of tornadoes in such regions can enhance predictive capabilities and aid in the timely dissemination of warnings, ultimately contributing to better preparedness and risk mitigation strategies,\" Lipar concluded.\n\nWhich is a pretty cool thing to come, ultimately, from a man idly browsing Google Maps in search of caves.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe study is published in the Journal of Southern Hemisphere Earth Systems Science."

            "article_content": "Flagstaff\u2019s Lowell Observatory recently opened the long-awaited Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center. Hundreds of visitors flocked to the new exhibits, which aim to connect people to the universe in unexpected ways. You can feel the texture of Saturn\u2019s rings, jam to the music of interstellar space, and even smell moondust.\n\nA brass band ushers in the ribbon cutting ceremony. Three years of construction and $53 million led up to this moment. Despite gray skies and a few flakes of snow, a large crowd is on hand to give a resounding cheer as the doors officially open.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Lowell Observatory's sole trustee, William Lowell Putman, cuts the red ribbon to officially open the doors to the Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nLowell Observatory has been an active research facility for more than a century (it\u2019s famous for the discovery of Pluto in 1930) but executive director Amanda Bosh says bringing in the public is part of their mission, too.\n\n\"It\u2019s not enough to just learn things about the universe,\" Bosh says. \"If you don\u2019t spread that out and tell everybody else about it, then it doesn\u2019t benefit people as much as it could, so that is a big part of who we are and what we do.\"\n\nFor Bosh, it\u2019s about expanding perspectives: \"Connecting to the night sky connects us to who we are, how we came to be humans.\"\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Exhibits in the Stardust gallery at Lowell Observatory's new Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nThat theme is clear in the new Stardust gallery\u2019s interactive exhibits. One family creates a hip hop mix out of the sounds of space, while nearby Haley Johnson uses a touchscreen to design a space mission to Saturn\u2019s largest moon Titan, exclaiming in delight when the activity is finished, \"I did it! I completed my research!\"\n\nFor some in the crowd, Lowell has always been a treasured part of the community. Sandra and Saylor Darling are newlyweds who celebrated their engagement here on Mars Hill.\n\n\"It's so beautiful,\" Sandra says of the new discovery center.\n\n\"This is making me so proud,\" Saylor adds. \"We're going to invite all our friends back.\"\n\nThey each sniff a silver tube that offers a whiff of the hydrocarbons found in moondust, and have wildly different reactions: \"It's almost pleasant,\" Sandra says, while Saylor interrupts: \"I think it's horrid.\"\n\nSamantha Christensen of Lowell Observatory led the design of the new exhibits. \"Everyone learns in a different way, so the more senses we can engage, we figure, the better,\" she says.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Kids play in the children's gallery, which has quieter areas with puzzles and games as well as interactive exhibits and a slide.\n\nShe gestures to the new children\u2019s gallery, where joyful chaos reigns as kids make water vapor rings, toss parachutes into wind tunnels, and launch model rockets. One girl dissolves into giggles when her rocket falls to pieces during launch. Christensen says the hands-on activities teach the scientific process: \"It's an opportunity to fail,\" she says, \"but fail in a fun way.\"\n\nTwelve-year-old Metta Kuehn says the rocket launching is one of her favorite activities: \"You pressurize it,\" she explains, \"and then you hit a button and the rocket shoots. It's really loud but really fun.\"\n\nKuehn has big dreams for her future: she wants to be the first person on Mars.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Opening weekend included live theater performances, a one-person show about the importance of imagination in science.\n\nAnd the kids here may be just starting out with a passion for science, but some grownups in the crowd are coming from illustrious careers. Famed comet hunter David Levy says he first saw Lowell in 1967 before it had a visitor center.\n\n\"Coming here today is like being wrapped in a cloud of passion and love for the night sky,\" Levy says. \"I\u2019ve been happy as a clam all day.\"\n\nAs night falls, visitors make their way to the open-air planetarium on the building\u2019s roof. It\u2019s just like any planetarium except the starry skies are real, not a projection.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Visitors enter the Stardust gallery, which has exhibits that engage nearly all the senses, including smell.\n\nLowell\u2019s historian Kevin Schindler says this is his favorite part: \"Seeing people come up here every night, and listening to them ooh and aah\u2014even if there\u2019s no program or anything, just looking up and seeing the night sky, or seeing the Milky Way in the night sky and being stunned by it.\"\n\nSchindler says they\u2019re all making their own discoveries, just as astronomers have done on this spot for more than a century.\n\n\"The need to explore and to look up and wonder, that\u2019s part of us,\" he says.\n\nA gasp rises from the crowd as they learn a bright star overhead is the planet Saturn. It\u2019s what every scientist and educator at Lowell was waiting for: that moment of awe."

The offer I like for new bettors, due to its low entry point, is a bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets instantly. More experienced bettors can get a $1K first-bet safety net promo, which serves as insurance if your first wager loses. Here\u2019s how to get either of these bet365 promos.\n\nClick any link or banner on this page and you\u2019ll be brought to the bet365 signup page on the bet365 app or website. Enter your email, create a password, enter your name, date of birth and last four of your Social Security Number to confirm your identity Upload an accepted form of ID (license, passport, state ID card or military card) Select your preferred banking option, confirm your account and deposit at least $10 Make your first bet of at least $5 and you\u2019ll get $150 in bonus bets after that wager settles Your first bet must be made at -500 odds or greater (-10,000 will not count, but +110 qualifies) One leg of any parlay must be made at -500 odds to qualify If you chose the $1K first-bet you\u2019ll get your bonus bets (in the amount of your first wager) approximately one hour after your first wager settles as a loss. The bonus bets have no cash value and cannot be withdrawn\n\nHow to use your bet365 bonus code for Eagles vs. Rams on Sunday Night Football\n\nThe Eagles head to Los Angeles to face the Rams in a game that is significantly more important for Los Angeles. Philadelphia has won six straight, while the Rams are basically in must-win mode every week in order to keep their playoff hopes alive.\n\nFor that reason, I\u2019m would use my first-bet safety net promo from bet365 on Rams' moneyline. Sure, it goes against all logic, but since when has the NFL been logical? The more desperate team wins when the teams are relatively equal (the Eagles are a bit better, but it\u2019s not a significant edge). I would take a shot at the Rams at +130 and if they lose, I\u2019ll get my wager back in the form of bonus bets.\n\nAs for the bet $5, get $150 offer, I would suggest betting an anytime TD scorer parlay with this promo because it\u2019s a low investment for a potentially huge reward.\n\nThe Rams' secondary has been very bad this year (22nd in NFL at 223.3 ypg) and DeVonta Smith (hamstring) is out, so I would look at an A.J. Brown anytime TD scorer prop at +110. I would parlay that with Brown to score the first TD (+700), and a Dallas Goedert anytime TD at +300. A $5 bet on that parlay would pay $331. If you hit it great, if not, you still get $150 in bonus bets."
