Each weekday, catch up on the 5 most pressing stories to start your morning in 3 minutes or less. Sign Up\n\nIn March of 1953, two women asleep in a remote area of the Big Tujunga Canyon were awoken by a bright light flooding around their cabin. Inexplicable time loss, an alien abduction account and years of searching for answers were to follow.\n\nThis was the first in a string of UFO accounts that one local researcher called \u201cThe Tujunga Canyon Contacts,\u201d making this stark landscape just about 30 minutes north of downtown L.A. what she called a hotbed of UFO encounters.\n\nInvestigators in the field point to the incident as one of the earliest modern day abduction experiences, but even in the town that gave us Close Encounters of the Third Kind, it\u2019s not a story many Angelenos have heard.\n\nListen \u2022 4:31 Listen: When L.A. was a hotbed of UFO accounts Why haven't more people heard about these stories?\n\nSlender entities and beams of light\n\nAt an isolated cabin in the Big Tujunga Canyon, two women were terrified by an experience they had beginning around 2 a.m. on March 22, 1953. According to the women, bright lights and a deathly stillness were followed by an alien abduction in which one of them said they were taken on board a UFO by slender entities with elongated, mask-like faces.\n\nOne of Sara Shaw's drawings from 'The Tujunga Canyon Contacts' Courtesy Anomalist Books )\n\nBoth women\u2019s accounts \u2014 and several others \u2014 are described in detail in the book The Tujunga Canyon Contacts by Ann Druffel and D. Scott Rogo. To protect them from backlash, the pseudonyms Sara Shaw and Jan Whitley were used in the book, first published in 1980.\n\nShaw and Whitley would undergo regressive hypnosis sessions in order to try and pull recollections of the incident from their memory. Shaw had her hypnosis session led by Dr. Martin Reiser, who founded the LAPD\u2019s Behavioral Sciences Services in 1968 .\n\nIn a second hypnosis session with a different doctor by the name of Bill McCall, Shaw recalled her abduction experience in 1953:\n\nShaw: I\u2019m starting to float. I\u2019m starting to float towards it.\n\n\n\nMcCall: What do you mean you\u2019re starting to float toward it? Shaw: Well, they\u2019re walking with me, but my feet aren\u2019t on the ground\n\n\n\nMcCall: They were on the ground when you came out of the house. How come they\u2019re not on the ground now?\n\n\n\nShaw: Well, there\u2019s a beam of light. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s almost like a...\n\n\n\nMcCall: Now you see a beam of light?\n\n\n\nShaw: I\u2019m on the beam of light....\n\n\n\n(Excerpt from \"The Tujunga Canyon Contacts,\" Anomalist Books)\n\nShaw would go on to recall being examined aboard the spaceship by the entities with some type of scanner. She said they even imparted to her a cure for cancer.\n\nThese accounts and several others in the Tujunga Canyon area were investigated extensively by Druffel, who died in 2020 . In fact, Shaw\u2019s encounter predates one of the earliest and most studied modern day alien abduction stories, that of Barney and Betty Hill in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in 1961.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely a very early case in the pantheon of alien abductions,\u201d said Rob Kristoffersen , the New York-based host of the Our Strange Skies podcast where he studies UFO encounters throughout history.\n\nAnother Sara Shaw drawing from 'The Tujunga Canyon Contacts' Courtesy Anomalist Books )\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a case that gets talked about a lot... But, I think it\u2019s one of the more important cases that should be looked at more,\u201d Kristoffersen said.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t more people, even in L.A., heard about this abduction account in our own backyard?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a queer story\u201d\n\nParanormal researcher Dr. C.S. Matthews says it might be because it\u2019s less \u201chardcore\u201d than some of the abduction accounts out there. These aliens did not seem to be violent or malicious.\n\n\u201cI actually think that part of the reason also is because it\u2019s a queer story. And the UFO community even today has had a real tendency toward being real conservative, kind of right wing,\u201d Matthews said from her home in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley.\n\nAll the women who came forward with their stories of otherworldly encounters in and around the Tujunga area were part of the LGBTQ community, and most, if not all, had some connection to Whitley. While Shaw and Whitley\u2019s initial encounter took place in the 1950s, it wasn\u2019t until the '70s that they brought their story to Druffel.\n\n\u201cOf course they weren\u2019t going to talk about these things in the 1950s. They wouldn\u2019t dare... These women were brave in coming forward. They had to be because they could lose a lot,\u201d Matthews said.\n\nAn older paper back version of 'The Tujunga Canyon Contacts' ()\n\nIn an article titled \u201c Tujunga Canyon Contacts: Revisited, Reconsidered ,\u201d Matthews writes: \u201c...anyone who remembers what small town lesbian communities were like before, say the 2000\u2019s (or even now in rural areas) can easily spot the dynamics of overlapping friend and romantic interests running just below the surface of the Tujunga Canyon accounts. Druffel\u2019s descriptions of their relationships echo the ethos of the time, allowing anonymity due to prohibitive social norms.\u201d\n\n\n\nA \u201cwindow area\u201d\n\nIn her book, Druffel describes the region where these and other UFO sightings happened as a \u201cwindow area,\u201d a place that repeatedly attracts unexplainable phenomena.\n\nPhantom rotorless helicopters, white orbs dancing in the sky and people chasing spaceships that disappear into the landscape: They all allegedly took place in and around the canyon.\n\n\u201cYou know, Big Tujunga Canyon can be kind of a creepy place,\u201d local historian and author Mike Lawler told LAist. \u201cBack in high school I would hear stories from friends about weird things that they saw out there.... It\u2019s kind of a desert mountain landscape and pretty spectacular... being so close to LA, it\u2019s phenomenal how wild it is. And in fact, people get lost there all the time.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really weird up here\u201d\n\nScreenwriter Richard Hatem of Pasadena hosts a podcast called Richard Hatem\u2019s Paranormal Bookshelf. You might also have seen his work in the form of the 2002 film The Mothman Prophecies .\n\nBig Tujunga Canyon at sunset Katherine Garrova )\n\nHe thinks the Tujunga Canyon contacts aren\u2019t very well-known, even in a town that gave us the shooting location for Elliot\u2019s home in Steven Spielberg\u2019s E.T.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard anyone bring it up,\u201d Hatem said. \u201cWeirdly, I don\u2019t think that L.A. is a city that trades much in its supernatural history, even though there\u2019s a ton of it.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing about the Tujunga contacts a few years ago from Kistoffersen, Hatem recalls eagerly driving 20 minutes west on the 210 Freeway to see the region for himself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really weird up here. It feels like we\u2019re a long way from Los Angeles... But I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m not staying up here too long. I don\u2019t want them knowing that I\u2019m thinking about them,\u2019\u201d Hatem said.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time to put Big Tujunga Canyon on the map with other UFO hotspots like Roswell or Area 51.\n\n"

        "article_content": "Apple has released a free software update that will inject its first dose of artificial intelligence into its iPhone 16 line-up as the trendsetting company tries to catch up with technology\u2019s latest craze\n\nApple is releasing a free software update that will inject its first dose of artificial intelligence into its iPhone 16 lineup as the trendsetting company tries to catch up with technology's latest craze.\n\nThe upgrade to the iOS 18 operating system on Monday arrives more than a month after four iPhone 16 models equipped with the special computer chip needed to power the AI features went on sale at prices ranging from $800 to $1,200. Last year's premium models \u2014 the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max \u2014 also possess a processor that will enable the AI technology after the software update is installed.\n\nRecent versions of Apple's iPad and Mac computer also can be updated with the software.\n\nCountries outside the U.S. won't be getting the AI software for their iPhones until next year at a date still to be determined. Apple spent the past five weeks testing the AI software among an audience of iPhone owners who signed up to help the company fine tune the technology.\n\nThe AI infusion is supposed to transform Apple\u2019s often bumbling virtual assistant Siri into a more conversational, versatile and colorful companion whose presence will be denoted by a glowing light that circles the iPhone\u2019s screen as requests are being handled.\n\nWhile Apple is promising Siri will be able to perform more tasks and be less prone to becoming confused, it won\u2019t be able to interact with other apps installed on the iPhone until another software update comes out at a still-unspecified date.\n\nOther AI features included in this software update will handle a variety of writing and proofreading tasks, summarize the content of emails and other documents. The AI also will provide a variety of editing tools to alter the appearance of photos and make it easier to find old pictures.\n\nOther AI tricks still to come in future software updates will include the ability to create customized emojis on the fly or conjure other fanciful imagery upon request. Apple also plans to eventually enable its AI suite to get a helping hand from OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT when users want it.\n\nMost of the AI features Apple introduced Monday are already available on Android-powered smartphones that Samsung and Google released earlier this year.\n\nIn an effort to distinguish its approach from the early leaders in AI, the iPhone\u2019s suite of new technology is being marketed as \u201cApple Intelligence.\u201d Apple is also promising its AI features will do a far better job protecting the privacy of iPhone owners by either running the technology on device or corralled in a fortress-like data center when some requests have to be processed remotely.\n\nBecause most iPhones currently in use around the world don\u2019t have the computer chip needed for Apple\u2019s AI, the technology is expected to drive huge demand for the new models during the holiday season and into next year, too. That\u2019s the main reason why Apple\u2019s stock price has soared 18% since the Cupertino, California, previewed its AI strategy at a conference in early June. The run-up has increased Apple\u2019s market value by about $500 billion, catapulting it closer to becoming the first U.S. company to be worth $4 trillion.\n\nApple will give investors their first glimpse at how the iPhone 16 is faring Thursday when the company posts quarterly financial information for the July-September quarter \u2014 a period that includes the first few days the new models were on sale.\n\nDemand for the high-end iPhone 15 models ticked upward as prices for them fell and the excitement surrounding Apple\u2019s entrance into the AI market ramped up, according to an assessment of the smartphone market during the most recent quarter by the research firm International Data Corp.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone shipments rose 3.5 percent from the same time last year to 56 million worldwide during the July-September period, second only to Samsung, according to IDC. The question now is whether Apple\u2019s gradual release of more AI will cause owners of older iPhones to splurge on the new models during the holidays, \u201cfuture-proofing their purchases for the long term,\u201d said IDC analyst Nabila Popal."

        "article_content": "Now that we have so many startups offering AI bots that can do everything from listening to your meetings and transcribing them, to taking notes and surfacing insights, companies in the space are being forced to differentiate themselves by offering additional feature sets and integrations.\n\nOne such company, Read AI is trying to do just that by integrating its AI bot with email, Slack and enterprise tools like HubSpot, Jira, and Confluence. And to accelerate its product development, the startup recently raised $50 million in a Series B funding round led by Smash Capital. Notably, the new round comes just six months after the startup raised a $21 million Series A.\n\nCo-founder David Shim told TechCrunch that the company has seen strong customer growth since its Series A earlier this year \u2014 it has had more than 100,000 new accounts created across enterprises and individual users \u2014 and the company sought to leverage that growth.\n\n\u201cIn less than six months, we\u2019ve doubled our sign-ups, active users, and [monthly recurring revenue], surpassing even our most aggressive projections. We\u2019re leveraging this momentum to raise now,\u201d he said.\n\nShim didn\u2019t disclose Read AI\u2019s valuation, but he did say that its valuation saw a bump to match its growth.\n\nBrad Twohig, co-founder and managing partner at Smash Capital, said that when investing, he often looks for companies that employ a product-led growth model, and Read AI fits that requirement well.\n\n\u201cI love finding companies in spaces that both cater to a large group of people and have an enterprise component at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nProduct evolution\n\nRead AI started supporting integrations with email, messages, and meeting apps earlier this year, and the company is today releasing a Chrome extension that can display your schedules, meeting reports, a quick add-to-meeting option, and insights from meetings.\n\nThe extension can highlight key points within lengthy email threads, and can create email drafts that take into context previous emails, messages, and meetings. It also highlights quick notes from meetings or Slack messages about the same topics in email threads.\n\nEmail clients from providers like Shortwave and Superhuman also offer similar capabilities.\n\nImage Credits:Read AI\n\nRead AI is offering the Chrome extension for free. Shim noted the new fundraise was another reason to develop and scale products like this and offer them without cost.\n\n\u201cWherever you work, we\u2019re pulling in that content, and we\u2019re giving you summaries, we\u2019re giving you recommendations. That\u2019s a bigger opportunity, but there is a bigger cost center associated with it. We\u2019re focusing on growing that market while maintaining the lead that we have on the meeting notes side,\u201d Shim said.\n\nImage Credits:Read AI\n\nSmash Capital\u2019s Twohig feels services that transcribe meetings are becoming a commodity, but Read AI\u2019s approach of deploying its AI bot everywhere can help it become a fine business.\n\n\u201cWe ran into Read AI as an assistant showing up at meetings and taking notes. But when we sat down with David, we understood a broader vision and concept of having a co-pilot anywhere. This tool can follow you through day-to-day tasks, keep helpful records, and allow you to be a better teammate.\u201d\n\nRead AI currently has 40 employees and the company aims to expand its staff to 100 people by the end of the Q1 2025.\n\nThe Series B round also saw participation from existing investors Madrona and Goodwater Capital."

Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Startup Untether launched an artificial intelligence chip on Monday that aims to power AI applications in cars, agricultural devices and other edge-case scenarios, the company said.\n\nThe flagship AI chips made by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are designed to run inside of data centers tied together with thousands or tens of thousands of others. Such installations require large amounts of energy and additional equipment and are often geared toward building, or training, large language models that power applications like ChatGPT.\n\nToronto-based Untether said its chips are designed to run the AI applications once a model is already built and can do so at a greater level of efficiency.\n\nThe market for chips that only run AI applications, also called \"inference,\" will dwarf the market for training by 2027, Untether's vice president of product, Bob Beachler, told Reuters in an interview. The company expects the inference market to grow to $102 billion by 2027.\n\n\"Where that inference is going to be deployed is everywhere,\" Beachler said.\n\nUntether's chip, called the 240 Slim, offers substantial performance but with significantly less energy, and is suited for use inside autonomous vehicles, autonomous agricultural equipment and in some data centers.\n\nMercedes-Benz has said it is working with Untether on its next-generation autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe chips made by Untether were developed around the open-source RISC-V tech. RISC-V technology competes with designs made by Arm Holdings.\n\nIn a recent peer-reviewed benchmark from nonprofit MLCommons, Untether's chips performed well in tests for the applications the hardware is designed for.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "article_content": "Standing below the hay loft, Julie Bukovich listened to the heavy grunts and creaks of the old barn as the sun set outside and the evening grew colder. She\u2019d been living with her boyfriend on the 19-acre Chesapeake farm for long enough that the sounds were familiar. But the feeling she\u2019d recently been getting \u2014 a sense, like an invisible presence, something hovering, something watching her \u2014 was new. On this March evening, she watched the expert she\u2019d called to investigate go to work.\n\nThe lanky, blue-eyed teenager strode through the barn, past rows of hanging tools and between stacks of horse feed. He held a bundle of smoldering sage above his head like an Olympic torch and left a trail of scented smoke.\n\n\u201cThank you. Thank you for being here,\u201d Bukovich said, opening a side door and pointing into a hallway, fumbling to find a light switch. \u201cIn there is where there\u2019s been a lot of activity.\u201d\n\nGhost hunter William Abbitt, 18, took a deep breath, pulled out a bottle of holy water that had been blessed by a Catholic priest in Virginia Beach, and stepped into the darkness.\n\nAbbitt isn\u2019t a devout follower of any one religion but knows items such as holy water and crucifixes calm the nerves of those who do or believe. He often suspects a haunting has more to do with faulty wiring, chemical-induced hallucinations or anxiety.\n\nHe walked into the dim hallway that led to a storage area, sprinkled the holy water on the far door and recited a Catholic prayer.\n\n\u201cSt. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection \u2026\u201d\n\nAbbitt started investigating suspected paranormal activities as a sophomore at Grassfield High School in Chesapeake. His reputation has grown among his peers as he\u2019s outlined cases on his website and in videos on a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploits of his team: WTCW Paranormal.\n\nHe has led WTCW Paranormal on 35 investigations into local lore and claims of the supernatural in Hampton Roads, at historical sites, businesses and homes. The group\u2019s mission is to research and remain skeptical. He isn\u2019t sure how much he believes in the supernatural. Which is why he got into the whole ghost thing in the first place.\n\n___\n\nWhen Abbitt was around 7, he, his mom and his two big sisters moved into a Virginia Beach house where doors opened and closed inexplicably and it felt like he was living with an angry spirit. \u201cClassic poltergeist activity,\u201d he now says.\n\nAfter the family moved to Chesapeake, he wanted to disbelieve what he remembered. Except he couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn high school, he started by reading the Bible and the Torah.\n\nHe moved to theology and dabbled in demonological literature with texts including Frank and Ida Mae Hammond\u2019s \u201cPigs in the Parlor: The Practical Guide to Deliverance\u201d and dove into mysticism with texts such as the anonymously authored grimoire \u201cThe Lesser Key of Solomon.\u201d He combed through online parapsychological studies and developed a disdain for TV shows that depicted paranormal investigations lacking the scientific method.\n\nToo many people, he thought, took the subject too lightly. Plus, he was having fun.\n\nAbbitt started saving money he made after school at Wendy\u2019s and during the winter break selling Christmas trees to buy equipment that he\u2019d read was essential for paranormal investigations: A camcorder with night vision; a digital audio recorder; flashlights and headlamps; six motion sensors; an infrared laser temperature reader in case ghosts prompt drops in temperature; an ambient temperature deviation device that doubles as a spirit box which cycles through radio frequencies and may be a useful tool for the dead to speak through; an EMF reader, based on hypotheses that ghosts cause shifts in electromagnetic field strengths; frankincense; myrrh; holy water; and walkie-talkies, all of which he stores in a traveling case.\n\nWTCW stands for the founders\u2019 first names: William, Tate, Chris and William. Abbitt is the only founder remaining. Two left the group to pursue other interests and one died this year. But on July 14, 2022, they were all together when they set out to conduct their first \u201cbig\u201d investigation.\n\nThe four of them spent part of the night at the Ferry Plantation House, which dates back to about 1830 and is said to have multiple spirits. Abbitt\u2019s camcorder caught a creaking sound like someone walking up the stairs.\n\nAt her farm in March, Bukovich found nothing funny about what she had experienced in and around her barn. She\u2019d been scared by an icky presence in the barn and showed Abbitt a recording on her security cameras which showed a bright orb of light floating in her driveway. She felt more at ease after his visit and liked the seriousness with which he performed the cleansing ritual in her barn. She felt heard.\n\n___\n\nAbbitt frequently posts online notices for new team members, and responses come in from teens to people older than 50. They want to be investigators, camera operators, psychics or demonologists for the team, which has fluctuated between two and eight people.\n\nRecently he got his first post-high school job working construction and uses it to fund WTCW Paranormal. In May, he investigated the Wells Theatre in downtown Norfolk with his then-newest team member. Sammi Cocuzzo, 25, a psychic from Chesapeake, was excited. According to the Wells, the theater is home to three ghosts, including Ned the Stagehand, who haunts the backstage fly rail where he used to raise and lower stage backdrops.\n\nOn a Friday morning, theater staff led the team backstage. The performance space was dark, and Abbitt handed out headlamps. Two team members stayed on the first floor, and he and Cocuzzo climbed a staircase toward a balcony overlooking the stage and Ned\u2019s favorite stomping grounds.\n\nStanding the dark, Cocuzzo lifted her hands to about chest height, one palm facing out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m picking up on a woman,\u201d she said, and spoke into Abbitt\u2019s nearby spirit box, hoping for a reply.\n\n\u201cNed, if you\u2019re here can you give us a sign? Can you manipulate this energy?\u201d she later asked.\n\nShe continued to ask questions. Abbitt stared at the EMF meter. Then, suddenly, they heard a bang from the staircase. It sounded like the thud of a heavy object after a fall, and Abbitt\u2019s walkie-talkie lit up.\n\nYes, Abbitt said. But no one had seen anything.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really active,\u201d Cocuzzo said, standing close to Abbitt. \u201cBut they are kind of chilling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, they aren\u2019t really messing with us right now,\u201d Abbitt said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good thing.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d brought his skepticism to the investigation, but in the moment he sounded like a believer.\n\nCocuzzo looked over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cI get the feeling that they like it here.\u201d\n\nColin Warren-Hicks, 919-818-8138, colin.warrenhicks@virginiamedia.com"

        "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2013 including the Nobel committees \u2013 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI\u2019s potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \u201cone of the most transformative technologies in human history\u201d. But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2013 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \u201cillusion of explanatory depth\u201d. Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \u201cillusion of exploratory breadth\u201d. Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nFinally, the \u201cillusion of objectivity\u201d. Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI\u2019s increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \u201cAI Scientist\u201d machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company\u2019s vision is to develop a \u201cfully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\u201d, where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2013 though critics said the system produced \u201cendless scientific slop\u201d.\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \u201caccelerate\u201d the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value, further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high, but we can\u2019t take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, calls to \u201ctrust the science\u201d can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritises the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2013 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalise the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \u201coutsourcing\u201d that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI? And how can researchers remain aligned with society\u2019s expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt\u2019s time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2013 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly.\n\nEhsan Nabavi is senior lecturer in technology and society, Responsible Innovation Lab, Australian National University.

The Stuttgart Regional Council\u2019s State Office for Monument Preservation just recently announced the find.\n\nNoteworthy for the remarkable quality of its preservation, the oak timber burial chamber still retains its floor, walls, and ceiling, making it the first fully preserved Celtic burial chamber found in Germany since 1890.\n\n\n\npicture alliance // Getty Images Roberto Tarpini, consultant and research assistant at the State Office for the Preservation of Monuments, stands at the burial chamber and explains the discovery and excavation of a completely preserved wooden burial chamber to representatives from politics and the media.\n\n\u201cThe newly discovered burial chamber represents an extraordinary testimony of our rich monument landscape,\u201d remarked local official Andrea Lindlohr at a press conference, \u201cAround 2,600 years after its construction, the [burial chamber] is still fully preserved. The archaeological heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is impressive and opens insights into long-gone periods and societies.\u201d\n\nThe timbers have yet to undergo a thorough analysis for the purposes of dating, but the burial chamber is assumed to have been built between 620 BCE and 450 BCE\u2014when the Celts roamed that region of Germany.\n\nRelated Story This Ancient Tomb Shows Off A Snake Fixation\n\nFound near the burial chamber was a wooden tool\u2014possibly one that was used in the building of the chamber itself. Experts have determined that it was made from the wood of an oak tree, chopped down in 585 BCE.\n\nGiven how long it\u2019s been since a burial chamber of this quality has been discovered in the region, and the myriad of advances in archaeological and analytical technology in those intervening years, this discovery offers an incredible opportunity to understand more about this period of history.\n\n\u201cThe Riedlingen grave is a stroke of luck for archaeology,\u201d noted Dirk Krausse, an archaeologist with the State Office for Cultural Heritage Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, \u201c...the scientific significance of this fully preserved Celtic chamber grave, investigated using modern methods, extends far beyond the boundaries of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and southern Germany.\u201d"

And its merchant services segment meets numerous ancillary needs for online sellers, allowing customers to handle most e-commerce selling-related functions within Shopify's ecosystem.\n\nSuch functionality has helped it compete with WordPress plug-in WooCommerce and no-code website builders such as Wix. It also enables merchants to sell without the fees that come with selling on Amazon's website.\n\nThese advancements helped it earn $3.9 billion in revenue in the first half of 2024, a yearly increase of 22%. Over the same period, its net loss was $111 million, down from a loss of $1.2 billion in the same year-ago period.\n\nStill, it earned $170 million in net income in the second quarter, indicating it has returned to profitability after backing away from a capital-intensive plan to build a fulfillment network. Also, the 60% rise in the stock price over the last year indicates that investors approved of the move to sell the fulfillment business.\n\nInvestors also seem to take its valuation in stride. The 83 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is not a useful measure considering the recent move to profitability, but investors will probably perceive its price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 14 as acceptable, given its rapid growth.\n\nThe stock does have challenges. The aforementioned 22% revenue growth is substantially slower than before and during the pandemic. Also, Shopify pushed through a price increase of up to 34% in February, and it is too early to tell if it will experience significant turnover with that decision.\n\nNonetheless, Grand View Research believes the global e-commerce industry will grow at a compound annual rate of 19% through 2030.

        "article_content": "Fractal's New Offering, EasyPay, Enables SaaS Companies to Launch Payments in Just One Day and Instantly Start Generating Revenue\n\nCINCINNATI, OH / ACCESSWIRE / October 28, 2024 / Fractal, Inc, a leading payment solutions for SaaS companies, today announced the launch of EasyPay, a new service that streamlines virtual payments and enables platforms to launch and introduce payments to their customer base in one day without code and hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies that offer APIs and libraries allow SaaS platforms to integrate payments, but for established software companies, particularly within construction, these processes are significantly more complex. Deployment must be carefully planned with hires to manage risk, underwriting, and support, plus months of development to set up payments effectively.\n\n\"Most companies have payments on their roadmap but delay implementation because of the complexity of making them a reality,\" said James Greaves, President and co-founder of Fractal. \"The investment of resources is overwhelming relative to the unknown reward. EasyPay eliminates the uncertainty and risk while allowing SaaS companies to capitalize on all of the upside potential to boost their top and bottom line immediately.\"\n\nUnlike other payment infrastructure companies, Fractal is built to serve the unique needs of SaaS in construction and heavy industry, where software companies have yet to adopt payments. EasyPay represents a step up in go-to-market speed compared to organizations' existing API or no-code offerings.\n\nEasyPay lets SaaS companies white label the solution on a subdomain or code snippet with all critical features needed to offer a full-suite digital payment solution. Features include quick payment entry, text, and mobile payments, links to order numbers, invoicing, financial reporting, customer portal, transaction logs, and card and ACH processing-all with unmatched security and speed.\n\nAs a platform, the number one way to add value and lock in customers to an organization's ecosystem is to add payments. However, traditional methods require an extraordinary amount of time, heavy development resources, and hiring to become experts in payment pricing, risk monitoring, and underwriting-and if done wrong, can be very costly. While newer methods from payment companies can be faster, mature SaaS companies still have to make investments in these areas while navigating the challenge of competing on price when not possessing their own infrastructure.\n\n\"We believe that EasyPay is the best of both worlds for mature SaaS companies that want to generate new revenue without making the upfront investment in time, people, and risk mitigation,\" said Brian Nichols, CEO and co-founder of Fractal. \"EasyPay has everything your customers need and will instantly increase the value of your SaaS products while creating an immediate revenue stream. It's the most streamlined path to integrated payments for mature SaaS companies, which can be used alongside Fractal's full suite of APIs and widgets to build more custom payment and reporting products over time.\"\n\nEasyPay is available now. More information here.\n\nContact Information\n\nSjoerd Martens\n\nsjoerd@publicize.co\n\n1-646-480-0356\n\nSOURCE: Fractal, Inc.\n\nView the original press release on newswire.com."
