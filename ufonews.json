        "article_content": "As Earthlings, we\u2019re curious about whether alien civilizations like ours are out there or if they exist at all\u2014which is why scientists were intrigued when a mysterious shard of metal exhibited signs that it might have come from intelligent minds on a distant planet.\n\nThis peculiar specimen fell to Earth around 1947 in a supposed UFO wreck that seemed linked to the infamous Roswell incident, which had members of the general public believing a flying saucer had crashed to Earth. It turned out that the debris found in Roswell was actually from a U.S. Air Force balloon meant to spy on Soviet nuclear experiments.\n\nThe true origins of the metallic specimen were debated for decades. Eventually, Blink-182 frontman and UFO enthusiast Tom DeLonge\u2019s To the Stars Academy got a hold of it. The organization independently researches possible alien phenomena, and the sample had an apparently unprecedented material structure that could indicate an extraterrestrial technosignature. Then, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) for the U.S. government, took over the investigation to learn more about the object\u2019s physical and chemical properties that made it potentially capable of inertial mass reduction\u2014levitation.\n\nThe object in question is a magnesium alloy whose main components are magnesium and zinc. It also contains bismuth, lead, and other trace elements.\n\nAARO asked Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to conduct an analysis in 2022 because scientists were especially interested in whether the sample was of terrestrial origin and if its bismuth content meant it could have possibly been used by aliens as a terahertz waveguide, a metal object that directs electromagnetic waves emitted by an energy source. ORNL was originally established during WWII to investigate things such as atomic weapons, and most of what its scientists investigate is still energy-related. However, the lab has also studied materials suspected to be extraterrestrial. This metal shard specimen \u201cpurportedly exhibits extraordinary properties,\u201d according to AARO and ORNL\u2019s recently published findings on the object.\n\nORNL scientists looked for evidence of life beyond our planet by studying the sample for possible biosignatures , which are naturally occurring substances associated with life, and technosignatures , which are signs of extraterrestrial technology that scientists especially seek out when searching for intelligent life. Some UAPs might have both.\n\nIn looking for alien biosignatures, ORNL scientists wanted to see whether the isotopes of the metals in this alloy were from Earth. Finding out where the metals originated meant investigating their isotopic signatures. These represent the ratios of different element isotopes in a material (when versions of the same element exist, but each has a different atomic mass.) Analysis showed that the isotopic signatures of magnesium and lead indicated a terrestrial origin. The magnesium\u2019s isotopic signature had undergone some fractionation, or separation of lighter and heavier isotopes, probably due to stress from heat and physical or chemical manufacturing processes. However, it was still within the normal range for magnesium that forms on Earth, not an alien biosignature.\n\nStrengthening the case for a local origin, the magnesium in this sample also showed a proportion of isotopes that occurs only in our solar system. Scientists know this because the isotopic signature of magnesium originally comes from a particular star-forming region and so is unique to each star system. Magnesium is an extremely common element in the universe, produced in great amounts by larger, older stars that scatter it into space when they die and go supernova. It is often recycled by young star systems, where it forms a unique isotopic signature, depending on the conditions.\n\nMoving on, the lead in the object also matched the isotopic signatures for lead that originates on Earth. These signatures are so distinct that there is no way they could have come from any other body\u2014even the moon.\n\nWith no alien biosignatures present in the sample, the ORNL scientists turned their attention to technosignatures. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that the crystalline structure of the magnesium was similar to the magnesium in alloys manufactured on Earth. With that confirmed, they tried to determine if the sample could have been part of a terahertz waveguide.\n\nWaveguides are metal objects that transmit electromagnetic waves. For example, the magnetron in your microwave oven transmits waves to the main oven cavity, where they heat up leftovers. A terahertz waveguide levels up this technology with much more intense terahertz waves, hypothetically enough to levitate an object if built using the right methods and materials.\n\n\u201cBased on the technologies developed by humans, waveguides can only channel radiation for purposes of communication, data collection, or heating but the conjecture for the UAP was that they were used for levitation,\u201d says Harvard University theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, Ph.D., who was not involved in the study. \u201cThat would represent a technology unknown to humans.\u201d\n\nTo qualify as a piece of alien technology, the sample would need to have a single layer of pure bismuth between layers of the magnesium alloy. This is because unadulterated bismuth can guide energy just like the magnetron in your microwave. Unlike anything in your microwave, bismuth is capable of directing terahertz waves. The problem is that the bismuth in this sample is neither pure nor in a single layer. There are multiple layers of bismuth between the magnesium layers, and the bismuth itself contains lead, both of which would disrupt its functioning as a waveguide.\n\n\u201cORNL has a high level of confidence that all data indicate the material was manufactured terrestrially\u2014albeit using an uncommon mixture of elements by today\u2019s standards\u2014and then incurred damage caused by mechanical and heat stressors,\u201d according to the report .\n\nAfter seeing the analysis, To the Stars released a statement on its website, anticipating a meeting between its own scientists and the ORNL team. In particular, To the Stars is hoping to learn more because \u201cthe reports do not offer a firm conclusion as to the origin and purpose of the material along with other seeming anomalies. [To the Stars] has more questions about both reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile we still don\u2019t know exactly where on Earth the mysterious sample came from, all indications show that it belongs to our own planet. There is a likely origin story behind this object\u2014it might be a product of post-WWII magnesium alloy research for lighter and stronger aircraft. Back then, magnesium alloys were poorly understood, according to the report.\n\nMaybe this artifact wasn\u2019t part of a larger piece of technology manufactured by alien hands, or whatever appendages and machines they might use. Still, this was a valuable exercise, because ruling out objects that originated on Earth only gives us a better idea of what really could be extraterrestrial."

        "article_content": "UFO 50 review\n\nThe 1980s reimagined as a collection of 50 \"small\" games, ranging from arcade racers to full-blown RPGs. Developer: Derek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer\n\nDerek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer Publisher: Mossmouth\n\nMossmouth Release: Sept 18th 2024\n\nSept 18th 2024 On: Windows\n\nWindows From: Epic Games, Steam\n\nEpic Games, Steam Price: \u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA\n\n\u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA Reviewed on: Intel Core-i7-11700F, 16GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, Windows 10\n\nYou can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.\n\nIt's also a funny collection, full of jokes and pranks at the player's expense. In one adventure game, tiles may fall on you without warning within seconds of your first movements. In a puzzle game about a chameleon, birds will slurp you up from inside logs just when you thought you understood the rules of camouflage. One medieval strategy game sees your units advance steadily and automatically forward, desperate to charge, unable to even think of defending. This game is called \"Attactics\"; the title alone a good gag.\n\nThere's also comedy (and satisfaction) in discovering exactly what each of these things is. Barbuta, the \"oldest\" game in the collection, is an unassuming and ancient homebrew Metroidvania that houses glitchy secrets and requires the patience and dedication of a child indoors on a rainy day to make progress. Rail Heist looks like a Sunset Riders-style shooter, but then invites you to play it as an Atari-era Hotline Miami, before you finally realise: \"Hang on, is this... an immersive sim!?\"\n\nVery few of the games give you any instructions, electing instead to just drop you in. It's a common complaint that modern games hold your hand too much, that they over-tutorialise, and fail to trust the player's perseverance or intelligence. So it's refreshing to get 50 games (albeit of varying depth) which implicitly trust the player to \"figure it out\". If your patience or brainpower does run out (and mine did a few times) you can simply eject the cartridge and play something else.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nTo take an example of one of the more compelling oddities, Mooncat is an comically obtuse platformer with some of the most counter-intuitive controls you will encounter this side of 1985. But if you stop and \"zoom out\" of your preconceived notions of what a controller's inputs ought to do, the idea behind it sort of makes sense. All the direction buttons move you left, and all the face buttons move right. Hey, why not? These are games diegetically invented four decades ago, and it's fun to read Mooncat as the product of a time long before each genre's control schemes developed any sense of orthodoxy.\n\nThe whole collection exists in this realm of tension, stretched out like a 40-year-long rubber band. If you squint, you can recognise the games of today between the pixels. Zoldath is a randomly generated explore 'em up set on an alien world where your tools are fuelled by mineral and plant pickups. In other words, it's No Man's Sky but in 1984. Meanwhile, the grid-based laser zappin' of Bug Hunter feels like an NES demake of Into The Breach (and is surprisingly moreish as a result). Velgress is a popcorn platformer that propels you ever higher through fear of decaying platforms. It is like Downwell but going up. That checks out. After all, the designer of Downwell is on the team of (real) developers who made the collection.\n\n1 of 4 Attribution\n\n\"Our goal,\" say this gang, \"is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.\" In this I'd say they succeed. Many of the games are built on design principles or novel gimmicks that simply wouldn't appear in the shooters and platformers of yore, and it's interesting to see where the creators draw a line in terms of what constitutes modern and \"classic\" game design. (They also inadvertantly make a compilation of games that fit the aesthetics of the \"indie darlings\" era of the 2010s, but probably because, uh, they are those darlings).\n\nThe modern twists are noticeable. Take the concept of \"lives\" for example. Mortal is a platformer in which you are given a generous 20 lives. But then you are expected to spend those lives turning yourself to stone blocks, or repeatedly launching yourself at the wall to create a step-ladder out of your rigid corpses, thus helping your next \"life\" get further into the level. Other modern ideas trickle into the games. You can hold down a button to skip long cinematics, for instance. And at least one game ranks you on a three-star scale at the end of every level, adapting the contemporary practice of mobile games.\n\nAgainst the aesthetics of a pixelated era, such features feel alien, yet weirdly compelling. Imagine watching Humphrey Bogart send a telegram in a 1950s noir, and then text starts appearing on-screen in a WhatsApp speech bubble. Imagine you are enjoying an Akira Kurosawa flick, and suddenly: an unmistakable drone shot. That's what playing UFO 50 is like. It's a compilation of double-takes, a comic provoker of \"huh\"s, an anachronism bonanza.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nIt works well mostly because it is so committed to the framing narrative: that this collection exists as a restoration project. There is a meta story (or maybe a \"meta-history\") to unravel, if you look closely. Each game has its own short developer note. And there's a terminal to enter cheat codes that I suspect will reveal some fun secrets (I didn't crack a single code). Taking it all in at once, the compilation is the story of a hobby's slow professionalisation. Even the menu screens of each game, when taken in chronological order and analysed like individual layers of polar ice, track the changes of their creative pioneers.\n\nEarly games are credited in plain text, made by a trio called \"Petter, Chun & Smolski\". Later games see personal names replaced by a business, \"LX Systems\", and then \"UFO Soft\". Eventually the games start sporting a professionally animated logo, complete with a pretty jingle. All personal calling cards are smoothed away. The enigmatic figure of a developer called Thorson Petter appears in early works, creator of games that are often painful or confounding to play, yet strangely sincere in their own user-agnostic way (guess who made Barbuta and Mooncat). Later, his name seems to disappear.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nOf course, you don't need to engage in any of this. You can just find the 25 games that include local multiplayer and go ballistic with a pal. There is built-in curation too, letting you filter the games broadly by genre. \"Quick play\" and \"reflex play\" cover some arcadey bops, while \"thinky games\" offers up all the puzzles. And even within these filters there exists a little surprise, a special screen for collectors and obsessives. Perhaps this is the time to say that if you subscribe to Retro Gamer and find yourself watching endless YouTube documentaries about the good old days of pixel platforming, then this will undoubtedly tickle you. It also feels purpose-built for students of game design. Any day now UFO 50 will appear in a video by Mark Brown, and people will wonder why they haven't heard of it (it's because you don't read RPS, you rubes!). Ahem.\n\nIf you're not that kind of person - not a retro freak or a game designer yourself - then it's a harder sell. There are games with deceptive depth, engaging enough to grab you by the \"one more turn\" glands. But you'll have to go in knowing that part of the fun is sifting through the pile to find those. I would flip through three or four games about angry football or samurai tennis with lazy channel-surfing curiosity, only for an hour to vanish like Batman on a nerdy dinosaur-worshipping worker placement game (it's called Avianos, it rules). This is part of the schtick. UFO 50 is not just about playing a bunch of small, tightly made games, it's also about chasing the buzz of discovering something that stands out.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nAs someone who has spent years curating games to an audience, I'm conflicted about that. It feels a bit like work. I used to trawl through itch.io every week for a free games column on this very site. I understand both the satisfaction and disinterest that comes from panning for gold dust, even in today's overwhelming gamepocalypse. It's definitely gratifying to rummage through UFO 50 and find an Avianos, a Velgress, a Mortal in the pile. But I also didn't get through all 50 of the games in the collection. I barely scratched half. I don't think I could face mining the entire bundle. (Fun side note: this isn't the first time we've been at the coal face with 50 short games, or even 300 in a pirate kart).\n\nMaybe an unfinished pile is to be expected, though. The internet is a capable devourer, and I look forward to reading user reviews about UFO 50 in a way I don't for many other recent releases. Players will be able to evangelize their favourites, list their unmissables, and get into role-playing flame wars about which game in the Campanella Trilogy was best. Perhaps someone out there will explain why you should not give up on the opaque works of Thorson Petter. That would be swell. I don't want to complete Mooncat, that baffling platformer, but I do want to watch the 20-minute retrospective from the bearded 50-year-old who has."

        "article_content": "Efforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right, UFO 50 is, for lack of a better term, a \u201cfictional\u201d game compilation, though the games are very real. Here, in their entirety, are 50 games\u2013not minigames, mind you, not little playable demos, but full-length, complete gaming experiences\u2013from a company that never existed. Developers Derek Yu (Spelunky), Jon Perry (Air Land & Sea), and musician Eirik Suhrke (Hotline Miami) spearheaded the project, but they and the other devs actually responsible for the games here are fully committed to the bit. If you beat a game here, it\u2019s the fictional devs of UFO Soft whose names you\u2019ll see on the staff roll. Instead, Yu and the others responsible are listed in the compilation\u2019s opening as \u201cthe UFO 50 Recovery Team.\u201d In this sequence, we see them digging an old gaming computer out of someone\u2019s storage unit and beginning the process of recovering these games for preservation in this collection. \u201cWhenever possible,\u201d we are told, \u201cthe integrity of the original software was preserved.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about.\n\nThe 50 games here present a picture of a company that, in 1982, took its tentative first step into game development with the challenging and mysterious adventure game, Barbuta (\u201cDeveloped secretly on company time, it almost got Thorson Petter fired,\u201d an in-game factoid tells us), and that, by 1989, was producing games like the vibrant, multi-genre Cyber Owls, \u201claunched alongside an original comic book series.\u201d At every step, UFO Soft was both responding to current gaming trends and establishing its own identity, producing games that tried to capitalize on popular new genres and tendencies in game design while also bearing their own distinctive authorship.\n\n\n\nAnd this, in my view, is essential to what makes UFO 50 so fascinating. Often, modern retro games wear their references a little too proudly, containing winking references to games of the past as if to say to you, \u201cWe know you like Classic Game X! We like Classic Game X, too! See, we\u2019re doing that thing you liked back when that game did it!\u201d There\u2019s none of that here in UFO 50. This game believably creates a kind of pocket dimension in which UFO Soft actually existed, creating games that capitalize on the rapidly improving game hardware of the 1980s but that aren\u2019t beholden to what everyone else was doing.\n\n\n\nBarbuta, for instance, feels roughly on par with something you might see on the MSX in the early 80s, while Cyber Owls feels akin to an elaborate blockbuster that might have arrived on the NES in 1989, when developers were figuring out how to make the most of that console\u2019s power. (Similarly, it doesn\u2019t cheat with trends or genres, either. UFO Soft makes a beat-em-up, for instance, but not before beat-em-ups exist.) But this isn\u2019t, thank goodness, a compilation in which you\u2019ll find one-to-one clones of the era\u2019s hits. There isn\u2019t UFO Soft\u2019s take on Super Mario Bros. here, though you\u2019ll certainly see elements from games you know and love, which makes it feel as if UFO Soft was around at that time and in conversation with what the rest of the game development landscape was doing. Sometimes I\u2019d dive into a game and say, \u201cOh, cool, this feels like it\u2019s riffing on Blaster Master,\u201d or \u201cOkay, I can definitely see elements of Space Taxi here,\u201d but these games also always felt distinctive, as if made by people with their own ideas, who wanted to make their own contribution to the medium.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo give you a quick sense of the breadth of what\u2019s on offer here, I\u2019m going to highlight five of the games that have stood out to me most in my time with UFO 50. (Remember, there are 50 games here. I\u2019ve played about ten hours of UFO 50 in all, so to say that I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what\u2019s available here is an understatement.) The one that\u2019s grabbed me the most right out of the gate is Valbrace, a tough action-RPG released, the game\u2019s fiction would have it, in 1988. I haven\u2019t made it very far yet, but its fusion of twitchy combat and first-person dungeon crawling is immediately appealing, and I\u2019m determined to level up my intrepid adventurer and find out what awaits in the dungeon\u2019s lower levels. It also reminded me of how, in the 1980s, it was always exciting if I equipped some new weapon or armor on a game character and their sprite changed. It\u2019s a little thing but it went a long way toward making the visuals feel more immersive and responsive to me as a player. Valbrace has that, and I felt that same little thrill I felt as a kid when I spotted it for the first time.\n\n\n\nNext, there\u2019s Rail Heist, a fascinating hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay with destructible environments in which each stage is a kind of puzzle. Playing as a member of a train-robbing crew in the Old West, you must figure out how to get the money on the locomotive out from under the noses of the lawmen guarding it. It\u2019s simultaneously strategic and kinetic, a real blast.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttactics is a fast-paced real-time tactics game for people like me who often avoid tactics games. Units from two opposing castles march toward each other automatically, but you can frantically grab your own units and slide them into advantageous formations to better withstand and conquer the enemy onslaught.\n\n\n\nPorgy is a gorgeous undersea adventure in which you pilot an adorable little submarine (with eyes!) to find upgrades and solve a mystery. The world is filled with both dangers (giant shark attacks!) and secrets just waiting to be discovered.\n\nFinally, the aforementioned Cyber Owls is a fitting game to close out UFO 50\u2019s chronology. Ostensibly released in 1989 and the \u201cfinal\u201d game in this compilation, Cyber Owls shows the developers at UFO Soft pulling out all the stops to make an elaborate multi-genre hit. The rogue commando group H.A.W.K. has acquired a doomsday weapon, putting the whole world in danger, and naturally, the president calls upon the only heroes who are up to the task of thwarting their deadly plans: the Cyber Owls. Each of the four missions your cadre of elite avian agents must undertake is wholly distinct: one\u2019s a beat-em-up, one\u2019s a Cabal-style shooter, one\u2019s a Metal Gear-esque stealth mission, and one\u2019s a side-scrolling vehicular shmup. What really makes it all work for me, though, is the way that it actually feels like it\u2019s based on a Saturday morning cartoon or comic book. As you progress, you encounter an assortment of villains who easily could have belonged to the rogue\u2019s gallery on a show that fused Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with G.I. Joe, and it feels like the devs gave some real thought to fleshing out this fictional late-80s IP.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, that very brief overview of five of the included games here\u2013just one tenth of the entire library\u2013is wholly inadequate at trying to convey the experience of actually playing UFO 50. For one, there are so many other types of experiences here. There\u2019s a game with Smash T.V.-style arena shooting. There\u2019s a first-person horror adventure game that plays similarly to Shadowgate or Deja Vu. There\u2019s a Japanese-style RPG set in a Wild West world. There\u2019s a strategic deckbuilder of sorts in which you try to have the right assortment of people in your Rolodex to ensure your parties are a rousing success. There\u2019s a wonderfully strange puzzle platformer in which you deliberately sacrifice your character\u2019s lives to create a path for the lives that follow. And so much more. The real point of UFO 50, if it can be said to have one, lies not in any individual game, as great as some of them are, but in the variety and richness of what they offer when collected here.\n\n\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about. You\u2019re probably not going to love all of them, but that\u2019s actually good, I would argue. UFO 50 would probably be a much safer and more limited collection if it felt calibrated for maximum mainstream appeal; part of what makes it so great is that, while a number of games here may not quite click with you, they will all probably really click with someone, in a way games only can when they take chances and feel like the work of individuals rather than a committee. There\u2019s joy and excitement in the act of exploration and discovery, in encountering something inscrutable and pushing up against it until it starts to click for you. (Pro tip: If you find a game particularly hard to penetrate, just let it sit on the title screen for a minute. There\u2019s a chance that, like many actual games of the era, it will start a demo sequence that at least offers some clue as to how to approach it.)\n\n\n\nAnd while some of these games might have been minor hits today on Steam if they were released independently, UFO 50 is so much more than the sum of its parts. Hopping around from game to game here, playing them alongside each other and in the context of each other, what emerges is not just a collection of fun, inventive, and incredibly varied games that could have been made in the 1980s, but weren\u2019t. This is an ode to innovation and game design itself, a celebration of those visionaries who, in gaming\u2019s early days, had fresh, original ideas and pushed a burgeoning art form to its limits in order to realize them. This is a tribute to the people behind one of the most exciting eras in game history, a time when new genres and new concepts were appearing all the time. And, in that way, it also feels to me like a statement about what matters most in game design. It\u2019s not the biggest budgets or the most polish. It\u2019s creativity and experimentation, a willingness to try new things and keep pushing a young medium forward. With any luck, we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n\n\n."

Some believe that it was just one of the many sky lanterns that are seen floating across the country\n\nA flying object that reportedly resembled a UFO was spotted flying over El Naranjo and Manzanillos, two neighborhoods located in the western city of Zit\u00e1cuaro\n\nFollowing the videos, some users took to X, formerly Twitter, to share their belief that aliens had made their way to Mexico.\n\n'That's that eye diamond UFO shape,' one person commented. '(Must) be some kind of organic ship.'\n\n'Spectacular video, contact between humans and alien races is getting closer and closer,' another X user chimed in. 'Anyone who continues to believe that it is a balloon, a drone, a hologram or something else is either blind or does not want to see reality.'\n\nHowever, others were quick to dispel the claims, pointing out that it was most likely just one of the many sky lanterns that float across the Mexican skies during the Globos de Cantoya festival.\n\nA large sky lantern floats towards a mountain outside of Paracho, a city in the western Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n, during the annual Globos de Cantoya festival\n\n'It may have been a test of a hot air balloon, as these balloons are very common in central Mexico and from a distance they can be confused with other objects,' another user explained.\n\nOne X user questioned the quality of the video but conceded that life probably exists outside our solar system.\n\n'So much technology, cell phones with too many mega pixels and images like that,' they said. 'I do believe that there is life on other planets, but some tests like this don't help much.'\n\nSome found humor in the alleged UFO sighting.\n\n'They went searching for atoles,' another X user said, referring to the traditional Mexican beverage that is made with water, masa (corn flour), piloncillo, (unrefined cane sugar), cinnamon and vanilla.\n\n'We will see more and more UFOs. And the government will make contact with them,' another person joked. 'We will obey in fear as always. But we will never see them.'"

        "article_content": "At its annual Snap Partner Summit on Tuesday, the Snapchat maker announced a series of new AI features coming to its app. Most notably, the app\u2019s My AI chatbot is being updated to work more like Google Lens, as it can now respond to more complex Snaps.\n\nYou can now snap a picture of a menu in a foreign language and send it to My AI to get an English translation, for instance. Plus, you can take a picture of a plant and send it to the chatbot to find out what it\u2019s called.\n\nYou will also be able to snap a picture of a parking sign and send it to the chatbot to quickly understand whether you can park at a specific location.\n\nSimilar features were first made available to mobile consumers by Google Lens.\n\nImage Credits: Snap\n\nThe launch is another indication that Snapchat is looking to make My AI more of a useful tool, as opposed to just an entertainment feature. A few months ago, Snapchat rolled out the ability for users to set in-app reminders and countdowns through My AI. The new features announced today add more useful functionality to the chatbot, as Snap is trying to get users to open up its social app when they have certain search queries.\n\nIn addition to the updates to My AI, Snap announced that its \u201cMy Selfie\u201d feature will enable AI-powered edits in Memories (saved Snaps) for Snapchat+ premium subscribers. This feature will be used to spruce up your existing Snaps by adding captions and Lenses to Snaps that you have stored in your Memories archive. For instance, if you saved a picture of yourself in your Memories, Snapchat may add a Lens on top of it to reimagine yourself as a Renaissance painting.\n\nImage Credits: Snap\n\nPlus, you can now opt in to appear in AI-generated images alongside your friends. For instance, the app may create an AI-generated Snap of you and your friend as lawyers or Olympic swimmers.\n\nSnapchat also announced that it\u2019s going to launch an AI-powered Lens that will allow users to see what they will look like in the future. The launch appears to be Snapchat\u2019s response to TikTok\u2019s popular old-age filter.\n\nElsewhere on the app, Snapchat revealed that it\u2019s rolling out improved HD video calls and Snap Mail, which lets you leave your friend a Snap if they don\u2019t answer your call. The app is also going to start showing local time zones in chats to make it easier for people to know when to connect with friends around the world."

The move happened shortly after a curious incident with her father in which he was unresponsive or frozen in time for several minutes while reading the newspaper one Sunday morning.\n\nHewins said her father told the family that they had to move to Bridgewater \u201cbecause God told him to.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Hewins described her paranormal experiences and encounters, or \u201cvisits,\u201d from extraterrestrials that she has experienced along with her twin sister, Audrey Hewins, as far back as they both can remember.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would tell my parents I was afraid to go to bed. I was afraid the bald men were going to get me,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cI was seeing all sorts of things behind the veil that people don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nLiving near the Hockomock Swamp and the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, sites where many strange occurrences have been reported, only intensified the experiences that the twins were having, Hewins said during the documentary interview.\n\n\u201cWe had the Hockomock swamp pretty much in our backyard,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there are many different extraterrestrial species that she sees and communicates with, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\n\u201cAll these beings are highly intelligent,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cAnd they know everything about us because they\u2019re telepathic.\u201d\n\nShe described a battle between the dark and the light side of these beings, which she called angels and demons. Hewins eventually realized how to repel the negative beings, by projecting love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery religion has pieces of the truth but, where they are in certain parts of the world, things are different. Things are interpreted differently,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there is a \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d happening in the world that is being helped along by extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s falling apart. If somebody doesn\u2019t intervene, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe this is a global intervention and they\u2019re doing it in steps.\u201d\n\nShortly after moving to Maine in 2006, the Hewins twins founded Starborn Support, a national online support group \u201cto assist and provide emotional support to those who feel they have had an extraterrestrial encounter,\u201d according to the group\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing this alone. A lot of people do it. That\u2019s why I started the support group,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nThe group hosts gatherings for \u201cexperiencers,\u201d those who report having a UFO or ET encounter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the interview on Sept. 11, Hewins, filmmaker Tyler Roberts, and film producer Jess Weiner gathered with other experiencers to call on ETs to visit and then watch the sky for UFOs.\n\nThe group saw several bright floating dots that could not be readily identified, but many were suspected satellites moving across the night sky.\n\nAccording to NASA\u2019s website, UFOs can be \u201crocket launches, comets, military jets, weather balloons, sounding rockets, satellites, meteors and fireballs, experimental craft (if you are lucky) and odd clouds (such as lenticular clouds, which are lentil-shaped and resemble flying saucers).\u201d\n\nIn recent years, UFOs, or as the federal government has started referring to them, unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, have gained mainstream attention with hearings held before the U.S. Congress.\n\nFilmmaker Tyler Roberts grew up in Billerica, which is a part of the triangle and home to what he referred to as the \u201cmost haunted road in Massachusetts.\u201d He feels like he is meant to tell the story he is crafting in his first feature-length film.\n\n\u201cThe more I think the world is black and white, the more gray I see,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also traveled to Bridgewater and Salem, Mass., where he encountered many synchronicities which led him to Hewins.\n\n\u201cThese are things I\u2019m running into, and I can\u2019t ignore them,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s slapping me in the face over and over again, saying \u2018tell the story.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts currently hosts a podcast, \u201cTotal Disclosure,\u201d in which he interviews people about UFOs and cover-up conspiracies, including credible sources like retired federal government officials.\n\nThere is a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for post-production expenses on Roberts\u2019 self-funded documentary. The trailer is expected to be released in October, just in time for \u201cspooky season,\u201d he said."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nVoyager 2 took this picture of Neptune in 1989. Credit: NASA\n\nAstronomers have uncovered the \"Neptunian Ridge,\" a newly identified feature in the distribution of exoplanets. This discovery, led by an international team including members of the University of Geneva, The NCCR PlanetS and the Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda (CAB), highlights the complex dynamics within the Neptunian Desert, a region with a scarcity of hot Neptunes, and the Neptunian Savanna, where these planets are more commonly found.\n\nBy understanding these critical zones, researchers gain valuable insights into the dynamic processes that influence the formation and evolution of close-in exoplanets. The discovery of the Neptunian Ridge is published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nTo visualize the vast extent of exoplanetary systems, researchers often plot the distribution of planets as a function of their radius and orbital period. It reveals patterns and regions of exoplanets with similar properties that astronomers try to understand.\n\nOne of the most puzzling regions is the \"Neptunian Desert\", where Neptune-sized planets are surprisingly scarce. This dearth of Neptunes in the distribution of planets orbiting close to their host stars is thought to result from intense stellar radiation stripping away the atmospheres of planets, eroding them and turning them into smaller planets.\n\nBeyond this harsh desert lies the \"Neptunian Savanna\", a less severe zone where Neptune-sized planets are more commonly found. In this region, the conditions allow these planets to maintain their gaseous envelopes, resulting in an area that is more populated with Neptunes that have migrated to orbits where they can survive the star's radiation. Understanding how the Neptunian Desert and Savanna are shaped has become a key question in exoplanet research.\n\nIntroducing the Neptunian Ridge\n\nThe new study focuses on the transition between the Neptunian Desert and the Savanna. The astronomers found an unexpected concentration of Neptune-sized planets at the edge of the Neptunian Desert\u2014a feature now termed the \"Neptunian Ridge\".\n\n\"We found an overdensity of planets in this region, indicating a sharp transition between the barren Neptunian Desert and the more populated Neptunian Savanna,\" explains Dr. Vincent Bourrier, Assistant Professor at the Astronomy Department of the UNIGE Faculty of Science and co-author of the study. This newly identified ridge marks a critical zone where planets have managed to migrate inward while resisting the intense radiation near their stars.\n\nUncovering the ridge: Methods and tools\n\nThe discovery was made possible by analyzing data from NASA's Kepler mission, corrected for observational biases using advanced statistical techniques. The researchers meticulously mapped the period-radius space of these exoplanets, revealing distinct regions that define the Neptunian landscape.\n\nThe team's analysis identified the Neptunian Ridge at orbital periods between 3.2 and 5.7 days, nestled between the Neptunian Desert and the Neptunian Savanna. This comprehensive mapping highlights the intricate processes involved in the migration and survival of these planets in close proximity to their stars.\n\nImplications for planet formation and evolution\n\n\"The Neptunian Ridge stands tall above the Desert and Savanna. It provides us with a key to understanding the physical mechanisms shaping the Desert,\" says Vincent Bourrier. Most Neptunes may be distributed over the Savanna and Desert early in their life by migrating within the disk in which they formed.\n\nThe existence of the Ridge suggests that some Neptune-size planets are brought to this region by a type of migration called high-eccentricity migration, which occurs later in their life and allow them to survive erosion from the stars.\n\nThese migration processes, coupled with photoevaporation, likely shape the distinct features observed in the Neptunian landscape. The similarities between the Neptunian Ridge and another feature in the exoplanet distribution, the hot Jupiter pileup, suggests that similar evolutionary processes may influence both groups of planets.\n\nAn ambitious observation program\n\nTo further unravel the mysteries of the Neptunian Desert and Savanna, a team of researchers led by UNIGE has secured a large-scale observational program using the high resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO mounted on the Very Large Telescope of ESO.\n\nThis program aims to conduct a comprehensive census of the orientation of planets' orbits within a sample of close-in Neptunes. This orientation depends on the migration process and will thus provide critical data on the formation and evolution of these planets, providing essential clues for understanding the particularities of the Neptune distribution.\n\n\"The Neptunian Ridge is just the beginning,\" concludes Amadeo Castro-Gonz\u00e1lez, Ph.D. student at the Center for Astrobiology in Madrid, and first author of the study. \"With upcoming results from this observational program, we'll be able to test our hypotheses about the origins and evolution of these intriguing worlds, providing a more comprehensive view of the close-in Neptunian landscape.\"\n\nMore information: A.

Unlike many larger financial institutions, Chase provides merchant accounts directly to small, mid-size, and enterprise-level businesses. If you want seamless multicurrency conversion to save on fees, Chase is a great option. Your customers can pay in their local currency, and you receive the proceeds in your own currency through a local Chase bank, avoiding double currency conversion costs. Why I chose Chase Very few major banking institutions would offer their merchant services directly to businesses like Chase does. With long-standing banking partners around the world, Chase is in a unique position to provide international merchants with seamless multicurrency management features, higher cross-border authorization rates, lower fees, and faster funding at no extra cost.

Why I chose Helcim Helcim\u2019s multicurrency management feature is limited, but it is the best choice for those looking to keep their transaction costs low.

You can keep using your Authorize.net account even if you migrate to a different merchant service provider to get better rates. Don\u2019t have an international merchant account yet?

Like Helcim, it provides businesses with a traditional merchant account that offers more stability as it\u2019s less prone to account holds. But in terms of features, Braintree is more similar to Stripe, as there are many customization possibilities available to users through developer-based integrations designs. Braintree offers discounted rates to nonprofits and while this is not unique, it should also be pointed out that Braintree\u2019s online flat rate fee is among the cheapest in the market. Why I chose Braintree Braintree is no slouch when it comes to multicurrency payments. It can process more than 130 currencies from 45 countries around the world and works with local banks to ensure the lowest crossborder fees. So paired with discounted rates for qualified Nonprofit 501(c)(3) transactions and low flat rate online fees for simple donations, Braintree is a quality choice for online nonprofits with global donors.

Lacks native invoicing features.\n\nRequires some coding skills to customize.\n\nNonrefundable transaction and chargeback fees\n\nPayPal: Best for accepting PayPal payments Our rating: 4.4 out of 5 PayPal helped launch the ecommerce market when it first came out with its consumer digital wallet in the 1990s. This made it possible for users to send and receive money anywhere in the world through the PayPal app. Eventually PayPal opened its services to businesses, allowing merchants to accept payments from anyone, anywhere as long as they have a PayPal account. This translates to over 100 currencies available to more than 400 million consumer and merchant accounts being served by the platform. PayPal has built partnerships with a variety of local banks and digital wallets. Why I chose PayPal What makes PayPal unique is its ability to work alongside other payment processors. PayPal integrates with any ecommerce checkout platforms as an add-on payment method. And with 400 million PayPal users around the world, it won\u2019t hurt having a PayPal checkout option on your website to grow your international clients. Pricing Monthly account fee: $0.\n\nOnline transaction fee: 2.59% + $0.49.\n\nKeyed-in transaction fee: 3.49% + $0.49.\n\nCrossborder fee: 1.5%.\n\nCurrency conversion spread: 4%.\n\nACH/Echeck fee: 3.49% + 49 cents, $300 cap (E-check).\n\nPayment gateway fee: $0-$25 per month.\n\nVirtual terminal fee: $$30 per month.\n\nSame-day funding: 1.5%.\n\nChargeback fee: $20 (for guest checkouts).\n\nVolume discount: Custom interchange plus rates for enterprise accounts. Visit PayPal\n\nFeatures\n\nWide variety of payment methods including unique PayPal checkout.\n\nSimple and advanced payment gateway customization tools.\n\nNumerous partnerships with local banks and popular online payment methods.\n\nPre-built integration with popular ecommerce platforms.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Scalable custom payment gateway.\n\nCryptocurrency checkout option.\n\nWell-established brand name. High currency conversion spread\n\nComplex transaction fee matrix\n\nAdd-on monthly fees for some payment services.\n\nHow do I choose the best international merchant account for my business?\n\nChoosing the right international merchant account provider should center around finding the option that supports your current business goals. So while every provider in our list offers a wide range of payment methods and level 1 PCI compliance, the key features below show where each system stands out the most.\n\nBest value-for-money\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to be impressed with a provider that carries all the bells and whistles, it may not be wise to be paying for a service that your business does not currently need. At the same time, the provider with the cheapest rates may not be the best choice if you have to pay add-on fees to access key payment features for your business.\n\nHelcim is a clear choice if you want to have access to many payment service features while keeping your fees low. Braintree\u2019s low transaction fees, zero add-on cost, and flexible online payment gateway tools is also a great option.\n\nMulticurrency management\n\nBeing able to process multiple currencies should be a core feature (not an add-on) when choosing an international merchant account service. Consider the areas where your target customers are located and make sure these are included in the provider\u2019s list of supported countries and currencies. Providers that support local payment methods will also help you minimize cross border fees.\n\nStripe, Chase, and PayPal lead our list of recommendations for managing multicurrency transactions with their many banking partnerships around the world.\n\nCustomizability and scalability\n\nWhen you sign up for a global merchant account, the goal should be that it can tailor their payment services to match your business needs. This means being able to customize your checkout pages with multiple languages, integrate important tools such as shipping management into the checkout process, and more.\n\nStripe and Braintree are clear standouts for customizability in our list. Choose Authorize.net if you need an international payment gateway that you can continue to use even if you decide to change merchant account providers.\n\nSecurity and fraud prevention\n\nSome of the riskiest types of non-cash transactions involve accepting online and cross-border payments. That\u2019s why, aside from ensuring that the provider is PCI compliant, you will want to customize your fraud prevention tools and have a way to track and respond to chargebacks on the same platform.\n\nAll of our recommended international payment processing companies are PCI compliant, but Stripe stands out for its highly customizable fraud prevention tools.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo build this guide, I put together an initial list of 14 popular international merchant account providers in the industry, including:\n\nPayPal.\n\nStripe.\n\nHelcim.\n\nPaymentCloud.\n\nChase Payment Solutions.\n\nAuthorize.net.\n\nBraintree.\n\nDurango Merchant Services.\n\nAmazon Pay.\n\n2Checkout.\n\nWorldPay.\n\nAdyen.\n\nWise.\n\nClearly Payments.\n\nFrom there, I evaluated each service against 4 criteria and 21 data points, focusing on pricing, payment services, and account features.\n\nThe scores were based on my personal experience exploring and testing each platform (when possible), plus feedback from real-life users that I gathered from reputable review sites. I also asked our payment and technology experts to weigh in on their knowledge of each provider\u2019s advantages and disadvantages.\n\nAfter careful evaluation, I narrowed down my choices to the top 6 that stood out as the best recommendations for a variety of business needs.\n\nThis article and methodology were reviewed by our retail expert, Meaghan Brophy"

        "article_content": "The significance of data privacy has surged to the forefront of public and corporate consciousness. With increasing incidents of data breaches and unauthorized access, businesses and individuals alike are faced with the challenge of safeguarding their sensitive information. As a result, data privacy software solutions have emerged as essential tools for managing and protecting personal and organizational data. This guide aims to explore the various aspects of these solutions, including their functionalities, benefits, and best practices for implementation, empowering users to make informed decisions about data protection in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nTypes of Data Privacy Software Solutions\n\nData privacy software solutions can be categorized into several types, each designed to address specific needs within an organization. These include encryption software, which protects data by converting it into a secure format that can only be read by those who have the decryption key. Data loss prevention (DLP) tools are another significant category, focusing on preventing unauthorized users from accessing, sharing, or transmitting sensitive information.\n\nNext, we have identity and access management (IAM) solutions that ensure individuals have the appropriate level of access to systems and data based on their role. Furthermore, privacy compliance software assists organizations in adhering to legal regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, providing tools that facilitate audits and compliance checks. Each category of software has unique functionalities that help businesses manage data privacy challenges more effectively.\n\nChoosing the right type of solution is crucial, as different organizations have different requirements based on size, industry, and regulatory obligations. Understanding these various categories helps businesses select the tools that best fit their privacy goals and risk management strategies. Looking at the Privacy Engine study about Data Subject Access Rights (DSAR) statistics worldwide, it is significant to note that a lot of organizations have had challenges with managing DSAR requests manually. Implementing the right data privacy software can alleviate these challenges and improve overall compliance efforts.\n\nKey Features to Look For\n\nWhen evaluating data privacy software solutions, it\u2019s essential to look for key features that enhance functionality and usability. Firstly, robust encryption capabilities are a must, as they protect sensitive information both in transit and at rest. Additionally, an intuitive user interface simplifies the management of complex data protection tasks, particularly for users who may not be technologically savvy.\n\nAnother critical feature is real-time monitoring, which allows businesses to detect and respond to data security incidents as they occur. This includes alerts for unauthorized access attempts or data transfers that fall outside predefined policies. Moreover, strong reporting capabilities are valuable, enabling organizations to generate compliance reports and analytics that inform ongoing data protection strategies.\n\nIntegration capability with existing IT systems is essential. The software should seamlessly connect with other tools and platforms in use, from cloud services to CRM systems, ensuring a synergistic ecosystem that promotes strong data privacy without overwhelming internal resources.\n\nBenefits of Implementing Data Privacy Solutions\n\nImplementing data privacy software solutions offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance an organization\u2019s overall security posture. One of the primary advantages is the reduced risk of data breaches, which can lead to severe financial and reputational harm. By deploying effective data protection tools, organizations can mitigate potential vulnerabilities and better safeguard sensitive information.\n\nThese solutions can improve customer trust and loyalty in a world where consumers are increasingly concerned about how their data is managed and protected, demonstrating a commitment to data privacy can be a competitive advantage. Organizations that employ full-fledged data protection strategies may find that their customers are more willing to engage and share information confidently.\n\nAdopting data privacy software can help streamline operations and compliance processes. With automated features for reporting and audits, businesses save time and resources that otherwise would be allocated to manual compliance efforts. This efficiency not only aids in regulatory adherence but also allows teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than being bogged down by administrative tasks.\n\nBest Practices for Implementation\n\nImplementing data privacy software solutions effectively requires careful planning and execution. First and foremost, organizations should conduct a thorough assessment of their current data privacy practices and identify any gaps that need addressing. This audit will inform the selection of software that specifically targets areas requiring improvement, ensuring that invested resources yield tangible benefits.\n\nInvolving key stakeholders from various departments during the implementation process is vital. This collaboration fosters buy-in and understanding across teams, ensuring that everyone is on board with the new practices and tools. Providing comprehensive training and resources for employees enhances the adoption of data privacy protocols, creating a culture of vigilance and accountability.\n\nIt is beneficial to continuously evaluate and update data privacy strategies and technologies in response to evolving threats and regulatory changes. By staying proactive and adaptable, organizations can ensure their data protection measures remain robust and relevant in an ever-changing landscape.\n\nCommon Challenges Faced\n\nWhile pursuing data privacy software solutions, organizations often encounter several challenges. One major difficulty is the complexity of implementing new systems, especially for large organizations with numerous legacy systems in place. This can lead to integration issues that hinder data protection rather than enhance it, necessitating thorough planning and investment in expertise.\n\nAnother hurdle is securing adequate buy-in from leadership and staff members. Resistance to change can stem from a lack of understanding of the importance of data privacy, or apprehension towards new technologies. Addressing these concerns through education and transparent communication regarding the necessity and benefits of data privacy measures is critical.\n\nBudget constraints can significantly impact the ability to procure and maintain effective data privacy solutions. Organizations must strive to balance cost with quality, seeking scalable solutions that provide necessary functionalities within budgetary limits. Identifying cost-effective solutions that do not compromise security is key to successfully overcoming this challenge.\n\nFuture Trends in Data Privacy\n\nLooking ahead, several emerging trends are shaping the landscape of data privacy software solutions. One notable trend is the increasing emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. These advancements facilitate more sophisticated data analysis and threat detection, improving the ability of organizations to respond to potential breaches swiftly.\n\nAnother trend is the growing importance of privacy by design. Organizations are now prioritizing privacy considerations in all stages of product development and software deployment. By embedding privacy into their systems from the outset, businesses can foster a proactive approach to data protection, rather than merely reacting to violations after they occur.\n\nAs global data protection regulations evolve, future solutions will likely need to incorporate multi-jurisdictional compliance capabilities. Organizations operating internationally will benefit from software that can streamline and automate compliance with varied laws across different regions, ensuring adherence while reducing the administrative burden.\n\nThe demand for robust data privacy software solutions will continue to grow as organizations recognize the significance of protecting their sensitive information. By staying informed and proactive, businesses can navigate this landscape confidently and maintain trust with customers while safeguarding their competitive advantage."
