Where are the aliens?\u201d\n\n5 Elon Musk sat down for an interview with Tucker Carlson on Monday and weighed in on what he believes is the true reason behind the UFO sightings across the US. @TuckerCarlson/X\n\nThe billionaire said there are over \u201c6,000 satellites\u201d in orbit and yet have \u201cnot once had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.\u201d\n\nSpaceX has over 6,300 active Starlink satellites in low-Earth orbit as of Sept. 2024, according to the non-profit satellite tracker CelesTrak.\n\nCarlson, 55, then asked why there are reports on Earth about the US military having to do \u201ca lot of maneuvering around objects they can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, unidentified flying objects are one thing, but there are always a bunch of classified programs that are underway,\u201d Musk shared.\n\nThe tech mogul claims that the government is likely regularly testing out \u201cnew aircraft, new missiles, and things\u201d that are classified at such a high level that even those high up in the chain of command in the US military may not be aware are being tested.\n\n5 The billionaire said there are over \u201c6,000 satellites\u201d in orbit and yet have \u201cnot once had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.\u201d @TuckerCarlson/X\n\n\u201cSome pilot sees something moving fast and says, \u2018Hey, I saw a UFO!'\u201d but it could be a new weapons program that is being experimented on a need-to-know basis.\n\nMusk, however, \u201cguaranteed\u201d that he would not keep that information from the public if he found any evidence of aliens.\n\n\u201cThe split second I see any evidence of aliens, I will immediately post that on the X platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will probably be our number one post of all time.\u201d\n\n5 Carlson, 55, then asked why there are reports on Earth about the US military having to do \u201ca lot of maneuvering around objects they can\u2019t explain.\u201d @TuckerCarlson/X\n\nIn 2023, Musk said that he hoped the little green men were real and, more importantly, friendly, but he didn\u2019t believe the government was hiding the existence of extraterrestrial beings from the public.\n\nHe argued that the government would villainize aliens if it knew of their existence to easily green-light military spending.\n\nWhile no recent alien sightings by service members were confirmed to be extraterrestrial life in the government report from 2023, Congress is requiring the Pentagon to look into its UFO files dating back to the end of World War II.\n\n5 An unidentified flying object was spotted off the east coast of the United States in 2015, photographed by the US Navy and released by the Department of Defense. US Navy\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence reviewed 366 newly identified military sightings of \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d \u2013 Pentagon jargon for UFOs.\n\nOf those, 26 were found to be drones, 163 were \u201cballoon or balloon-like entities,\u201d and six were \u201cattributed to clutter\u201d in the air.\n\nLast fall, the Pentagon launched a new portal where current and former service members, government employees, and contractors can report UFO sightings.\n\nThe Pentagon investigated nearly 300 UFO sightings between April 31, 2022, and April 30, 2023.\n\nSome of these flying objects exhibited \u201cconcerning performance characteristics,\u201d including high-speed travel and \u201cunusual maneuverability,\u201d according to the report.\n\nHowever, the report stated that \u201cnone of these UAP reports have been positively attributed to foreign activities.\u201d\n\nLast month, New York Sen.

        "article_content": "Phil Mogg on 50 years with UFO, life on the road and new band Moggs Motel\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Roberto Ricciuti/Redferns via Getty Images\n\nPhil Mogg is talking about the time in August 2022 when he almost died of a heart attack. \u201cI\u2019m good now. I think,\u201d he says, grinning, checking his pulse theatrically. \u201cHold on a minute\u2026 Who paid for the last round? No\u2026 I got lucky really.\u201d\n\nClassic Rock is catching up with Mogg in Brighton, where the veteran singer now lives, to discuss the apparent dissolution of his much-loved band UFO, as well as the latest repackaging of the band\u2019s sixth album, Lights Out. He also sheds light on the birth of a new solo project called Moggs Motel.\n\nIt\u2019s mid-January, and we are among the first customers to walk through the door of a pub near the railway station. For some unexplained reason we drink halves instead of pints, forgetting that doing that usually hastens consumption. Gradually the pub\u2019s early drinkers arrive. Those are gradually replaced by the lunchtime crowd. By the time we leave, following multiple exclamations of \u201cJust one more?\u201d, darkness is approaching.\n\nOn that August 2022 evening, Mogg, now 76 years old, was at home with his wife Emma, a former glamour model, when he started to feel unwell.\n\n\u201cI thought it was indigestion or heartburn. But it was quite a bit more than reflux. Emma was watching a comedy show, with a glass of wine, and I was going [mimes choking],\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s laughing at the TV, and I\u2019m realising it\u2019s serious \u2013 \u2018Hang on, I could be dying here.\u2019 So I popped to the hospital down the road.\u201d\n\nThe eventual outcome was that Mogg had two stents implanted into his coronary arteries, and doctors advised him to rest. That caused the cancellation of the final run of dates of UFO\u2019s farewell tour, Last Orders, which was scheduled to finish in Athens. \u201cIt was all a bit of a shock,\u201d he admits.\n\nResponding to the suggestion that Mogg looks after himself better these days \u2013 certainly compared with the levels of UFO\u2019s Bacchanalian heyday \u2013 he simply chuckles darkly. Doesn\u2019t he go to the gym?\n\n\u201cNot any more. I use gardening as the gym. You can do as much or as little as you want.\u201d\n\nUFO in 1974 - group portrait\n\nThe enforced cancellation of the final run of Last Orders shows suggested the end of the long road UFO had travelled for more than 50 years, and our meeting in Brighton comes a few days after the announcement of an online auction for the equipment used by the band on their US tours.\n\n\u201cBasically, all of that stuff is in storage. We may as well flog it,\u201d Mogg says.\n\nIt seems awfully final.\n\n\u201cWell, the situation was frustrating,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you commit to doing something, you should finish it, but it just wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d\n\nSo UFO are over, definitely, for good?\n\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no going back?\n\n\u201cNo. That really cool tour we did in the UK was it. For us to suddenly reappear again, the fans would say: \u2018Oi! I paid to see you on that last tour.\u2019 Some might think that a great thing. Me, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s topsy-turvy career is a tale worthy of an entire issue of Classic Rock. The line-up changes, mid-tour departures, fist fights between band members, reunions, and now belatedly blighted by funerals, often marinated in strong booze and heightened by Class-A drugs. Its plot twists would merit a soap opera were they not so implausible.\n\nRegularly in cahoots with co-founding bass player Pete Way (RIP), as the group\u2019s singular strand of consistency Londoner Mogg was right there at the heart of it all. He\u2019s been a singer, lyricist, ringleader, villain (during the 70s he punched the band\u2019s talismanic guitarist Michael Schenker, causing him to quit), bandleader (for the 1985 album Misdemeanor, Mogg rebuilt UFO from scratch), and clown (he fell off stage on at least one occasion). But now, after 56 years of all that and much more, the time has come for Phil Mogg to do something else.\n\npage divider\n\nBefore we get into that, there\u2019s the not-so-trifling matter of the new 2024 reboot of Lights Out, remastered and with the added bonus of a fabulous archive show from London\u2019s Roundhouse in 1977. Mogg is well aware of EMI\u2019s efforts to overhaul the band\u2019s catalogue.\n\n\u201cThose reissues are impressive, aren\u2019t they? It makes me think why we didn\u2019t do that [employ such a level of care] back in the day.\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cNo, I\u2019m joking. They\u2019re very nice.\u201d\n\nLike many artists, Mogg has a complicated view of the industry\u2019s quest to re-sell to the public records that they already own.\n\n\u201cThe labels are always looking for something new, and I find myself wondering who\u2019s going to buy it,\u201d he muses. \u201cIf these things come out again on vinyl, that\u2019s a selling point for me. From that perspective it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAs a curious aside, Mogg confides that he recently bought a copy of UFO\u2019s quintessential 1979 double live album Strangers In The Night from a second-hand record shop adjacent to the pub in which we sit. \u201cI didn\u2019t own an original version, so I bought one. Just to put it on the shelf, I guess, along with everything else. Everything goes into a cupboard or on to a shelf.\u201d\n\nAs the swan song of UFO\u2019s herculean first era with Schenker on guitar, Strangers still stands up as a brilliant record. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mogg says fondly, nodding. \u201cBut I tend to remember the funny bits [more than the music]. With Lights Out, making that album was a barrelful of laughs. It was a good, fun time, everybody was enjoying themselves and stuff.\u201d\n\nIncluding the supposedly \u2018difficult\u2019 Michael Schenker?\n\n\u201cYeah. He had his moments. You had to look out for them. No\u2026 I\u2019m kidding. Michael was fine.\u201d\n\nFor UFO, Lights Out and its follow-up Obsession were the best of times. With Schenker on board, having joined from the Scorpions in 1973, the band had toured heavily for Force It and No Heavy Pettin\u2019, released in 1975 and \u201976 respectively.\n\n\u201cWe also knew that either Lights Out was going to do something big for us, or it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cNo disrespect to Leo [Lyons, the former Ten Years After bass player who produced those two records], but we had to jump from where we were to somewhere else. That\u2019s when some investigation began \u2013 which producer had made the albums that we liked best. And Ron Nevison\u2019s name kept coming up.\u201d\n\nUFO onstage\n\nWith Nevison signed up as producer, UFO and their new keyboard player/second guitarist Paul Raymond set up in Air Studios at London\u2019s Oxford Circus. Having worked with The Who and Led Zeppelin, Nevison was a hard taskmaster. A real man\u2019s man. And he liked to let his charges know who was boss.\n\n\u201cOnly if you took any notice of him,\u201d Mogg says. \u201cI\u2019m sure that to most people Ron could be quite intimidating, but we had this way of subtly\u2026 sort of not letting him do that. He was right and he was the producer, but he had a knack of putting things that might rub people up the wrong way. Fortunately we all became pals. Ron made the band sound amazing. He gave us that extra push.\"\n\nLights Out was packaged in an eye-catching sleeve, shot in the bowels of London\u2019s Battersea Power Station and created by the immensely popular and acclaimed design team Hipgnosis.\n\n\u201cWho knows what was going on there,\u201d Mogg ponders, with a wave of his hand. \u201cThe idea came from them, Storm [Thorgerson] and Po [Powell]. I\u2019m not sure if they had taken a load of pictures of inside Battersea when they worked with Pink Floyd. You know, Battersea Power Station\u2026 lights\u2026 that was the connection. We lucked out working with them.\u201d\n\nLights Out became and remains UFO\u2019s highest-charting album in the USA, but Mogg rejects the suggestion that the band felt tantalisingly close to becoming The Next Big Thing.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t buy into such preconceived ideas,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe were still too busy telling ourselves: \u2018All of this is a bit good, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d\n\nRetaining Nevison, UFO went to California to make Obsession, where their great adventure continued, residing in hired luxury pads and driving rented cars.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own them,\u201d Mogg says, smiling, \u201cand years later you discover that you still owe money on them. It\u2019s a funny old world. But yeah, we enjoyed the experience to the maximum. We certainly paid for it to the maximum.\u201d\n\nHe chuckles when he recalls the group\u2019s respective choices of mode of transport.\n\n\u201cI went for the Trans Am with the eagle on the front \u2013 I took that off, I couldn\u2019t stand it. Michael got a Chevvy Stringray, and Pete went for the Camaro. Paul took over [Chrysalis labelmate] Robin Trower\u2019s Cadillac. For some reason Andy [Parker, drums] picked a Honda Civic. That still makes me laugh.\u201d On one notable occasion the band raced through Coldwater Canyon, although Mogg claims they \u201cremained just within the speed limit\u201d.\n\nPete Way and Phil Mogg (holding a tabloid newspaper)\n\nFrom the outside it looked as though UFO were English (and German) rock stars living the Californian dream.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d says Mogg. \u201cWe were working in LA, but it really didn\u2019t feel romantic in the sense you are implying.\u201d\n\nAll the same, by that point UFO had put in more than a decade of hard work and knew they were making great records. \u201cThe thought never occurred to us,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, it wasn\u2019t like that. That\u2019s not the kind of people we are. You\u2019d be somewhere on the road in America, a bit knackered from partying and in one of the most awful places, and before going on stage Pete would gather us together and in very serious tones tell us: \u2018Right, we\u2019re about to take out Poughkeepsie.\u2019 It was absurd, but that was our general attitude.\u201d\n\nThere was also an awareness that it could all come tumbling down at any given moment.\n\n\u201cAs much as we were enjoying it to the max, nobody expected things to last,\u201d Mogg affirms. \u201cThere was a bit of friction with Michael, because Way and I were just juveniles. And of course, Parker was the sensible one.\u201d\n\nWere those times the best of his life?\n\n\u201cYeah, probably. It was pretty knockout.\u201d\n\nFollowing the departure of Michael Schenker at the end of the 70s, UFO invited former Lone Star guitarist Paul Chapman back for a second run with the band. The Welshman had played with UFO from 1974-75 as part of a twin-guitar line-up alongside Schenker. With Chapman, nicknamed \u2018Tonka\u2019 for his indestructible qualities, UFO thrived, although a softening of their sound caused Way to quit following 1982\u2019s Mechanix. The rest of the decade presented tough times and mixed results, and a number of line-up changes.\n\nIn 1991, Mogg and Way put the band back together without Schenker, although along with Raymond and Parker he rejoined for Walk On Water, an excellent album, again produced by Nevison, from a frustratingly short-lived reunion.\n\nSchenker rejoined again at the turn of the millennium. But following his shamefully inebriated performance at Manchester Apollo, UFO\u2019s fortunes plummeted to an all-time low. Still, Schenker\u2019s replacement, American guitar hero Vinnie Moore, remained a part of UFO until the very end, and from 2004\u2019s You Are Here onwards they made a string of very creditable records. Sixteen years ago, Way\u2019s own well-publicised issues with addiction gave the band no option but to \u2018let him go\u2019. He never returned to the line-up. To Mogg\u2019s great sadness, Way died in 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that, robbed of the bonhomie of his long-time partner in crime, life within UFO was never the same again for the singer. He enjoyed the 100 minutes or so performing on stage each night, but the travelling wore him down. As a man of advancing age, the more undignified elements of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll circus became magnified.\n\nWith bandmates past and present now passing on, Mogg became conscious of his own mortality. In 2018, during the build-up to UFO\u2019s 50th anniversary, he announced his retirement from the road upon completion of a tour that, inevitably, became significantly extended. \u201cThis is the right time for me to quit,\u201d he said back then.\n\nMoggs Motel group portrait\n\nMogg had ventured outside of UFO for two albums with Way under the handle Mogg/Way, and even undertook a short tour for an extremely fine 2002 project named $ign Of 4. With that in mind, the end of UFO wouldn\u2019t necessarily spell the end of his career as a musician. A fresh period of activity began when Mogg bumped into Tony Newton, the bassist with Voodoo Six, and now a member of KK\u2019s Priest.\n\n\u201cWe [UFO] had toured with Voodoo Six so we got chatting,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cI told him I was looking to do something, and he replied \u2013 this is great: \u2018Well I\u2019ve got a couple of riffs.\u2019 So we got together to see what transpired. And then Steve [Harris, Iron Maiden bassist] lent us his studio.\u201d\n\nOver the following year, and partly during lockdown, the project took shape. Just like the album, the band are called Moggs Motel (no apostrophe). \u201cMotels don\u2019t have apostrophes,\u201d he insists. \u201cNot the ones I stay in, anyway.\u201d\n\nBesides him and Newton, who also co-wrote and produced the album, the line-up includes Neil Carter, UFO\u2019s second guitarist, keyboard player and occasional saxophonist, who returned to the group unexpectedly following Paul Raymond\u2019s death in 2019, plus second guitarist Tommy Gentry (Gun, The Raven Age) and former Voodoo Six drummer Joe Lazarus.\n\nInserting Moggs Motel into a one-size-fits-all category isn\u2019t easy. On the day that we meet in Brighton, Mogg doesn\u2019t even try.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played the album to a couple of people I know,\u201d he confides, before listing several of them, including his daughter and \u201cmy mate who lives around the corner\u201d who considered it \u201clovely\u201d. Ultimately, he shrugs: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s rock music?\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of symphonic rock. No. Actually, I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\nHe whips out his mobile phone and plays a couple of tracks. Sunny Side Of Heaven features Alabama 3 singer Zoe Devlin Love, while the instrumental Harry\u2019s Place is a flute-driven nod to the Dirty Harry soundtrack. Mogg hopes to play a one-off showcase-style gig for the album in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being discussed, it\u2019s just a case of finding the right venue,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve even got a new hat.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is a great name for a band. Some guests check in and some leave. Other, less savoury, characters are barred.\n\n\u201cMy motel has speciality suites,\u201d he remarks proudly. \u201cThe Frank Sinatra Suite has been left reserved. I\u2019ve given Kate [UFO\u2019s long-suffering merchandise and web lady] the Sammy Davis Jr. Suite. There are also the Dean Martin and Lauren Bacall Suites. I\u2019m thinking about a Charles Bukowski Suite. You can have that one, because it\u2019s for writers.\u201d\n\nThanks. On that note, another half?\n\n\u201cYeah, why not.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2019, with no British dates on the cards for the line-up featuring Neil Carter, Mogg invited me to attend a couple of UFO shows on the continent. Travelling on the bus, he often sat up front in the dark, watching quietly as the miles were eaten up.\n\n\u201cI call it, white-line fever,\u201d he says. \u201cI love midnight driving, just the driver and you. I like to play Tangerine Dream, Love On A Real Train. Try it, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWill all of that be hard to relinquish?\n\n\u201cNot really. I said that when I stopped having fun I wouldn\u2019t do it any more. I hadn\u2019t reached that point, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain this\u2026 Well I do, but I\u2019m not going to. UFO was wound down at the right time. I\u2019d had a birthday, the band had had a good run, it was time to go: \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019 Plus I fancied doing something else anyway.\u201d\n\nAll the same, the other members of UFO, especially Andy Parker, felt that there was still mileage in the UFO name. Could the band still make records, without touring?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he fires back instantly. \u201cAnd there are deep rooted reasons. But\u2026 definitely not.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s career has been fascinating in so many ways. If Mogg could go back and change some of the many \u2018banana-skin\u2019 moments\u2019, would he do so, and what would they be?\n\n\u201cWhen all those glamour models were banging at my door, I should have opened it and let them all in,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cBut I was strong, I said no.\u201d\n\nIs there a serious answer for that question?\n\n\u201cNo. Some things get screwed up and others are great. That\u2019s life. But I do wish we\u2019d got a fair crack of the whip.\u201d\n\nBusiness-wise, you mean?\n\n\u201cIn our youth we were gung-ho, living in the moment. If only someone had looked after us. But those people are hard to find. As far as UFO goes, we got pretty screwed.\u201d\n\nUFO have been hailed an as influence by Metallica, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains, but Mogg states: \u201cI take all of that stuff with a pinch of salt. Steve [Harris], for instance, says nice things about us. [Pearl Jam guitarist] Mike McCready wrote a charming note after we covered [McCready\u2019s 90s project] Mad Season\u2019s River Of Deceit. You half-believe it, don\u2019t you? But I always mistrust someone that says: \u2018You\u2019re fucking great\u2019.\u201d\n\nFormer band members and associates, including ex-manager John Knowles and popular tour manager Tonio Neuhaus, are no longer with us, but they are never far from Mogg\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a question to ask Pete, and then I realise he\u2019s not there to answer any more,\u201d he sighs.\n\nDuring the later years, you and Pete remained extremely close.\n\n\u201cWe had some fucking great times. I mean ridiculous times,\u201d Mogg reminisces. \u201cThose two [Way and Chapman] always made me laugh.

So if we gave some people goosebumps, for me that would be sufficient.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is available now via SPV."

It has not responded.\n\nHas the Pentagon acknowledged any UAP programs?\n\nThe All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is a publicly-known Pentagon program that collects and investigates reports of UAPs.\n\nIn a report, AARO denied any evidence that UAPs are alien in nature. The report did acknowledge the existence of the Kona Blue program, which was intended to reverse-engineer any recovered UAP technology.\n\nThe report said the program never went into effect because no such technology was ever recovered.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for UAP disclosure?\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers has already pushed for more disclosures around UAPs.\n\nWhile nothing specific has been announced in relation to this report, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has announced plans for a UAP hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee following the election, and Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., announced plans for a UAP hearing in the House set for Nov. 13.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

        "article_content": "A recent revelation by a Pentagon whistleblower has disclosed the existence of a highly classified government program called \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nReported by journalist Michael Shellenberger on his Substack newsletter \u2018Public,\u2019 this secret Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP) allegedly deals with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), formerly referred to as UFOs, and has operated for decades without Congressional oversight, raising concerns about government transparency.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, elements within the military and intelligence community (IC) have withheld information about UAPs, violating constitutional obligations. Shellenberger notes, \u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about UAPs.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s report outlines seven categories of evidence, detailing various UAP sightings captured by U.S. military sensors and personnel. It claims that \u201cthe verifiable chain of custody for UAP IMINT [Imagery Intelligence] collected by U.S. military assets ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered.\u201d\n\nThe report also mentions \u201calien reproduction vehicles\u201d (ARVs) being secured within this program. The whistleblower further warned that publishing the name \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d could lead to government surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nThese revelations align with former President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing claims that the government is withholding information about UAPs. In a June 2024 interview, Trump said, \u201cI have access, and I speak to people about it. I've had actual meetings on it. And they will tell you there\u2019s something going on.\u201d He has frequently expressed frustration over the government\u2019s secrecy, stating that his administration sought to release more information to the public.\n\nLawmakers like Senators Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have pushed for greater transparency on UAPs, have voiced concerns about the lack of accountability. \u201cMost of [the UAP whistleblowers] have held very high clearances and high positions within our government,\u201d Rubio said last year.\n\nWhile the full extent of \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d remains unclear, the disclosure has reignited public interest in UAP investigations. The Pentagon has yet to respond to the new allegations, though it previously denied any reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. Whistleblowers, however, continue to claim that crucial information about UAPs is being hidden from Congress."

        "article_content": "The mysterious character from the Dandadan manga, Count St. Germain, might be linked to the historical figure alleged to be a vampire!\n\nSpoiler Alert !!! This article contains spoilers from the Dandadan manga.\n\nThe world of Dandadan is as wild and unpredictable as it gets, filled with paranormal entities, bizarre aliens, and quirky, unforgettable characters. In this supernatural mix, there is a mysterious character that is yet to be introduced to anime-only viewers, and that is Count St. Germain. Introduced in chapter 120, Count Saint-Germain\u2019s main goal is to acquire the elusive Dandadan. But who exactly is this character, and what\u2019s the deal with his name?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCount St. Germain from Dandadan manga | Credit: Viz Media\n\nInterestingly, the name \u201cCount St. Germain\u201d isn\u2019t just a random name. It has a fascinating link to a historical character who has long piqued the interest of historians and conspiracy theorists: a man who was believed to be immortal and was surrounded by rumors of vampirism.\n\nWho is Count Saint-Germain in Dandadan?\n\nCount St. Germain is portrayed in the Dandadan universe as a paranormal collector who has a particular interest in obtaining Dandadan for reasons that are currently unclear. Under the alias of \u201cSanjome\u201d, Count St. Germain is currently serving as the high school\u2019s deputy head teacher and advisor to the History and Culture Research Club, despite his connections with the Kur, a militaristic alien race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCount St. Germain | Credit: Viz Media\n\nAlthough his dual identity suggests that he is cunning and discrete, his name is what really grabs fans\u2019 attention. St. Germain is not your typical temporary antagonist. It\u2019s evident from his introduction that he will have a bigger part to play in Dandadan\u2018s overall story.\n\nHe might easily emerge as one of the primary antagonists, using supernatural methods to achieve his goals given his fascination with the paranormal. But his name, steeped in history and tradition, offers even more hints about his true nature. The parallels between Dandadan\u2018s Count St. Germain and his real-life counterpart are impossible to ignore. Both figures are shrouded in mystery, have questionable origins, and exhibit strange, otherworldly behavior.\n\nThe Historical Count Saint-Germain: An Immortal or a Vampire?\n\nThe name Count St. Germain holds weight in history, tied to a figure who lived in 18th-century Europe, claiming to be an alchemist, diplomat, and composer. Fast forward to the early 20th century, a man named Jacques St. Germain arrived in New Orleans, claiming to be a descendant of the legendary Count St. Germain. Jacques became notorious for his luxurious parties and mysterious habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandadan | Credit: Science SARU\n\nDespite impressing the aristocracy with his wit, knowledge, and wealth, there was something truly mysterious about him \u2014 he was claimed to be immortal. Known for his refusal to eat in public and his disappearing acts, Jacques St. Germain quickly became a subject of intrigue and suspicion, and rumors of his strange, vampiric behavior spread across New Orleans.\n\nThe most chilling story tied to Jacques is the story of a woman who allegedly jumped from the second floor of his home, claiming he had bitten her on the neck in an attempt to drain her blood. When authorities searched his home, they found bottles filled with what appeared to be blood, but Jacques St. Germain was nowhere to be found. This event fueled rumors that he was not just an eccentric nobleman but an actual vampire.\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nIs the Dandadan universe about to introduce its own version of a vampire through Count St. Germain? In Dandadan, Count Saint-Germain\u2019s role as a collector of paranormal artifacts positions him as a character deeply rooted in the supernatural. Moreover, in the manga Turbo Granny refers to him as \u201cHyper Geezer\u201d. It\u2019s no surprise that fans are speculating whether Dandadan\u2019s Count St. Germain is setting up to be a vampiric force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandadan has already introduced us to a host of strange and supernatural elements, but Count St. Germain\u2019s appearance raises the stakes in more ways than one. Whether he\u2019s an immortal, a vampire, or something even stranger, the journey to uncover his secrets is just beginning as the series unfolds.\n\nDandadan is currently available to watch and read on Netflix and Viz Media, respectively."

However, that announcement didn\u2019t make clear whether Rogers and WBD would move forwards as partners on the latter\u2019s lifestyle channel, though a rep indicated there would be no change.\n\nBell has been the Canadian home of WBD and predecessor Discovery\u2019s suite for three decades, operating many of its channels locally. However, in June, Rogers struck a deal to move WBD\u2019s lifestyle and factual channels into its sphere. Bell responded by filing for an injunction at the Ontario Superior Court to stop Rogers distributing the networks, claiming that WBD was blocked from moving its shows.\n\nRogers said today that Bell \u201cacknowledged all claims against Rogers were unfounded and abandoned its legal efforts.\u201d\n\nThe upshot is Rogers will launch Discovery ID and Discovery Channel as linear networks and distribute them to third-parties such as Bell. Content from Cooking, OWN, MotorTrend, Animal Planet and Discovery Science will be available on-demand and via Citytv+ on Amazon Prime Video Channels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already home to Canada\u2019s number one sports network, and this partnership helps solidify our leadership in entertainment with a diverse media portfolio of TV\u2019s most iconic brands,\u201d said Colette Watson, President, Rogers Sports & Media.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

        "article_content": "As artificial intelligence explodes in popularity, two of its pioneers have nabbed the 2024 Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nThe prize goes to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton \u201cfor foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks,\u201d the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm announced October 8. These computational tools, which seek to mimic the functioning of the human brain, underlie technologies like image recognition algorithms, large language models including ChatGPT, soccer-playing robots and more (SN: 2/1/24; SN: 5/24/24).\n\nThe prize surprised many, as these developments are typically associated with computer science rather than physics. But the Nobel committee noted that the techniques were based on physics methods.\n\nStill, no one was more shocked than Hinton himself: \u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted. I had no idea this would happen. I\u2019m very surprised,\u201d he said by phone during the announcement news conference.\n\nThe techniques have underpinned a variety of scientific advancements. Neural networks have helped physicists grapple with large amounts of complex data, allowing important advances that include making images of black holes and\u200b\u200b devising materials for new technologies such as advanced batteries (SN: 4/13/23; SN: 1/16/24). Machine learning has made strides in the biological and medical fields too, with the promise of improving medical imaging and understanding protein folding (SN: 6/17/24; SN: 9/23/23).\n\n\u201cThis award solidifies the fact that AI isn\u2019t just a niche technology \u2014 it\u2019s a scientific revolution with cross-disciplinary impact,\u201d says AI researcher Craig Ramlal of the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine in Trinidad. \u201cEven more importantly, this award legitimizes AI as a tool for understanding and simulating the natural world, which hopefully will drive more innovations.\u201d\n\nNeural networks are designed to identify patterns in data, rather than making explicitly programmed calculations. They\u2019re based on a web of individual elements called nodes that are inspired by the individual neurons in the brain. Training the neural network by feeding it data hones its ability to make accurate conclusions, by optimizing the strength of the couplings between the nodes.\n\nIn 1982, Hopfield, of Princeton University, created an earl\u200b\u200by type of neural network, called a Hopfield network, that could store and reconstruct patterns in data. The network was similar to magnetic materials in physics, in which atoms have small magnetic fields that can point either up or down, akin to the 0 or 1 values at each node of a Hopfield network. For any given configuration of atoms in a material, scientists can determine its energy. A Hopfield network, after being trained on a variety of patterns, minimizes an analogous energy to uncover which of those patterns is hidden in the input data.\n\n\u201cIn my view, physics is trying to understand how systems work. The systems are made of parts. These parts interact,\u201d Hopfield said in remarks given virtually during a news conference at Princeton.\n\nHinton, of the University of Toronto, built on that technique, devising a neural network called a Boltzmann machine, which is based on statistical physics including the work of 19th century Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. Boltzmann machines contain additional nodes that are hidden \u2014 they process the data but do not directly receive input. Different possible states of the model have a different probability of occurring. These probabilities are set by the Boltzmann distribution, which describes configurations of many particles such as molecules in a gas.\n\n\u201cThe work that Hopfield and Hinton did has just been transformative, not just for the scholarly communities developing AI and neural networks, but also for many aspects of society,\u201d says computer scientist Rebecca Willett of the University of Chicago.\n\nThe two winners will split the prize of 11 million Swedish kroner, or about $1 million.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI was delighted to hear this, actually. It was a massive surprise,\u201d says AI researcher Max Welling of the University of Amsterdam. \u201cThere is a very clear connection to physics.\u2026 The models themselves are deeply inspired by physics models.\u201d What\u2019s more, the discovery made many developments in physics possible, he says. \u201cTry to come up with a technology that has had a bigger impact on physics, especially on the methods side. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nSince the 1980s, researchers have vastly improved upon these models, and scaled them up dramatically. Deep machine learning models now have many layers of hidden nodes and can boast hundreds of billions of connections between nodes.\u200b\u200b Vast amounts of data are used to train the networks, scraping the internet for text or images to feed into them.\n\nWhile AI technologies based on neural networks are capable of feats unimaginable in the 1980s, the technologies still have a multitude of pitfalls. Many researchers focus now on understanding how the prevalence of machine learning could have negative impacts on society, such as reinforcing racial biases, facilitating the spread of misinformation and making plagiarism and cheating quick and easy (SN: 9/10/24; SN: 2/1/24; SN: 4/12/23).\n\nWhile some scientists, including Hinton, worry that AI could become superintelligent, the way that AI is trained differs from human learning patterns, and many researchers disagree that artificial intelligence is on a path to world domination (SN: 2/28/24). AI models are famous for making laughable mistakes that defy common sense. Scientists are still actively working to define how terms like \u201cunderstanding\u201d can be applied to machine learning systems, and how best to test their capabilities (SN: 7/10/24).\n\n\u201cThere are real concerns about how [AI is] going to affect labor and the job market, how it enables misinformation and manipulation of data,\u201d Willett says. \u201cI think those are very real concerns in the here and now. That\u2019s because humans can take these tools and use them for malicious purposes.\u201d"

        "article_content": "October 10, 2024 -- Keysom, a deeptech company developing an innovative and \u201cno code\u201d platform for designing tailor-made processor architectures for semiconductor and embedded systems players, announces the closing of a 4 million euro fundraising round. This operation carried out with the French Tech Seed funds, managed on behalf of the State by Bpifrance as part of France 2030, IRDI Investment Capital, Xplore By \u00c9pop\u00e9e Gestion and EuroBIM, will allow the company to accelerate the development of its offer, to strengthen its presence in France and internationally and to recruit new talents.\n\nA unique innovation in the world to meet the energy efficiency needs of electronic chips\n\nGeneral-purpose processors are omnipresent on the market. Offering great versatility, they equip all types of electronic devices, from IoT to the automotive world. Capable of handling a multitude of tasks, these \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products are the default solution for manufacturers in a hurry to position themselves on the market. However, this general approach presents significant limits in terms of cost, energy efficiency and performance: 50% of the functionalities will never be used during the life of the processor. Well aware of these obstacles, more and more players wish to turn to personalized chips, but are faced with excessively slow and costly development cycles.\n\nA true catalyst for innovation, Keysom responds to this challenge and allows manufacturers to design a tailor-made processor in the space of a few simple and rapid iterations, without any constraints linked to inherent technical development. To this end, with a highly qualified technical team, Keysom devoted 4 years of R&D to develop Keysom Studio, its intelligent and easy-to-use tool capable of exploring, testing, modifying and optimizing a very wide variety of complex architectures in order to arrive at a unique solution each time, entirely adapted to the customer\u2019s needs \u2013 without the need for advanced technical skills or a team of experts.\n\nKeysom thus opens a new era for manufacturers, putting within their reach the design of more efficient, more economical and more ecological tailor-made processors, on both a small and large scale. The launch of this solution marks a turning point for all companies seeking agility and competitiveness.\n\n\u201cWhere manufacturers pay for oversized generic processors, which generate costs and energy waste, a custom processor uses less raw material (in this case silicon), leading to lower production costs and simplified manufacturing processes. In a context where demand for semiconductors continues to increase, reducing the silicon area per chip is a major strategic advantage. Our software allows to explore up to 12 million processor combinations to achieve this.\u201d confides Luca Testa \u2013 Co-founder & Director of Operations of Keysom\n\nRaising \u20ac4M to accelerate sales on an international scale\n\nSupported by the French Tech Seed funds, managed on behalf of the State by Bpifrance as part of France 2030, IRDI Investment Capital, Xplore by \u00c9pop\u00e9e Gestion and EuroBIM, Keysom has just completed a \u20ac4M fundraising. This funding round marks a decisive step for Keysom, thus anchoring its position as a technological pioneer in the field of custom processor design.\n\n\u201cThis fundraising is an important milestone in our growth strategy. It gives us the means to further accelerate the development of our technology and lead our commercial expansion into new markets. We firmly believe that our no code tool will redefine the way manufacturers approach the design and optimization of their systems. \u00bb adds Cyril Sagonero \u2013 President of Keysom\n\nPart of the funds will be dedicated to the recruitment of new R&D technical experts, in order to continue to innovate and improve the performance of hardware and software solutions, as well as to the recruitment of qualified commercial profiles. With the support of its investors, Keysom aspires to continue offering solutions that transform the industry while keeping in mind the democratization of the access to high-tech tools for as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the State, Bpifrance actively participates in the reindustrialization of France and works for the sovereignty of the country by supporting companies in strategic sectors. We are happy to be alongside the deeptech company Keysom, whose talented teams and custom processor design technology promise a real revolution in industrial electronics. \u00bb adds Fran\u00e7ois Charbonnier, Investment Director at Bpifrance.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to support the Keysom team in this kick-off sales phase because we are convinced that Keysom makes it possible to provide an innovative, sovereign solution with a limited carbon impact to industrial players, many of whom need processors. \u00bb Camille Le Roux Larsabal, VC Associate at Epop\u00e9e Gestion.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the elements already cited by my colleagues \u2013 disruptive innovation, technical excellence and environmental impact \u2013 I would add that Keysom is a company with strong local roots, in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region. We are convinced that the managers have all the qualities to make this startup an important player both locally and internationally. \u00bb Vincent Brousse, Investment Director at IRDI Investment Capital.\n\nAbout Keysom\n\nIn 2019, Cyril Sagonero and Luca Testa are beginning to question the market approach of buying off-the-shelf processors in order to reduce time to market. The waste of area and energy consumption is huge. At the same time, version 2.2 of the RISC-V ISA is frozen, opening the door to this new ISA to the industry. The following year, discussions with PhD J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Crenne of the University of Bordeaux and software architecture expert Fabrice Bonnet laid the foundations for Keysom, a French startup which aims to enable semiconductor companies to automatically and simply obtain the RISC-V processor best suited to their needs. In 2022 Keysom is developing the world\u2019s first coding-free tool dedicated to the design of custom processors.\n\nAbout Bpifrance and the French Tech Seed fund:\n\nBpifrance finances companies \u2013 at each stage of their development \u2013 \u200b\u200bwith credit, guarantees and equity. Bpifrance supports them in their innovation projects and internationally. Bpifrance also ensures their export activity through a wide range of products. Consulting, university, networking and acceleration program for start-ups, SMEs and mid-sized companies are also part of the offer presented to entrepreneurs.\n\nThanks to Bpifrance and its 50 regional locations, entrepreneurs benefit from a close, unique and efficient contact to help them face their challenges.\n\nEndowed with 500 million euros, the French Tech Seed Fund aims to support fundraising by innovative start-ups and VSEs less than 3 years old carrying out technologically intensive innovation. Resulting from the Future Investment Program (PIA), now integrated into France 2030 and operated on behalf of the State by Bpifrance, the fund is based on certified business providers, responsible for identifying and qualifying these young companies and put them in touch with private investors. These business providers, ensuring the technological validity of the project, will allow public investment, in the form of Convertible Bonds of up to 400 million euros, in addition to the capital provided by private investors. 100 million euros are also dedicated to equity investments in addition to the conversion of Convertible Bonds.\n\nMore info on: www.Bpifrance.fr \u2013 https://presse.bpifrance.fr / \u2013 Follow-us on X (formerly Twitter): @Bpifrance \u2013 @BpifrancePresse\n\nAbout IRDI Investment Capital\n\nIRDI Investment Capital has been one of the leaders in regional investment capital for 40 years.
