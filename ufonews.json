        "article_content": "BELLEVILLE \u2014 Back in 1987, a strange set of lights shone in the skies over Belleville. Every year since, residents have carried out 5K runs, craft markets and parades under the title UFO Days, perhaps hoping to tempt extraterrestrial visitors to come back.\n\nSaturday\u2019s UFO Parade marked 38 years of the alien-centric festivities \u2014 and 100 years of lifelong Belleville resident Art Fahey, the parade\u2019s grand marshal who lives in the same farmhouse he was born in.\n\nHaving lived through the Great Depression, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and multiple wars, Fahey isn\u2019t much fazed what he sees on on a day-to-day basis \u2014 even when dozens of little green martians follow him down Main Street toting huge bags of candy. (Little known fact: If you throw a peanut butter cup hard enough, it briefly becomes an unidentified flying object.)\n\n\u201cThey asked me if I would be (grand marshal) because I\u2019m 100 years old and I live on the farm I was born in, so I said, \u2018Well, yeah I guess I could do it,\u2019\u201d Fahey said Saturday.\n\nHometown Olympian Lauren O\u2019Connor was originally named grand marshal. But the rower was out of town during the festivities, and Fahey graciously agreed to take her convertible seat and wave to the town he\u2019s loved his whole life.\n\nA colorful array of creatures waved back at Fahey, children breaking in their costumes in the days leading up to Halloween and little fairies dancing in the grass, their wiry wings struggling against the bulk of coats and sweatshirts. Dinosaurs and vampires chased each other, vying for those coveted sour gummies and string cheese sticks. Elvis even made an appearance. He isn\u2019t dead \u2014 he\u2019s just shorter now, wears Nike sneakers and carries a Halloween candy tote.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve led a good life\u2019\n\nIn the hours before he was due to lead the parade, Fahey recalled his own childhood, when his house had no electricity and an ice cream bar cost a nickel. He obliged the Wisconsin State Journal\u2019s many questions about life at 100, surrounded by family in the Lingonberry Llama, a Main Street coffee shop. He may not have been to the Olympics, but his is a story worth hearing nonetheless.\n\nHe\u2019s a lifelong farmer. He loves his beer. He\u2019s been to Hawaii twice. The highlight of his life, apart from his wedding day and the birth of his four children, of course, was getting electricity in his home in 1942.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain it, but I\u2019ve led a good life,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday nights, Fahey and his brother could go to free movies in a nearby park. Their father would send them out with a dime each, enough for a bag of popcorn or an ice cream bar, each of which, Fahey said, cost a nickel.\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019d bring home a nickel,\u201d he said. \u201cA nickel was a nickel.\u201d\n\nFun in those days looked like a battery-powered radio, a local party or a dance. Fahey dated on and off, but back then, he said, he wasn\u2019t in much of a hurry to get to the altar.\n\n\u201cSome of these farm girls, they want to get married,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to go out with the boys for a couple of years, that was kind of a fun time with the boys.\u201d\n\nFahey and friends learned that if they carried around a pencil and looked at the marks on the hands of people who\u2019d already paid, they could copy the marks and get in for free. Now that he\u2019s out of the woods of criminal liability for those petty crimes, Fahey said the trick worked about 90% of the time.\n\nA close family\n\nFahey met his late wife dancing and continued dancing with her until her death. They had four children, John, Art, Connie and Nancy, all of whom are exceptionally proud of their father.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen a lot in his life so he\u2019s very generous, ya know,\u201d Art said. \u201cI think it\u2019s faith, family and friends, and not necessarily in that order.\u201d\n\nFahey is equally as proud of his kids, though he contends that he isn\u2019t quite sure how he managed to do such a good job raising them.\n\n\u201cWe got a close family. I can think of a couple families right now where brothers and sisters don\u2019t even talk to each other, but we are close,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cI guess I did a pretty good job. I didn\u2019t really know I was doing it.\u201d\n\nThe reason Fahey has stayed in Belleville is simple \u2014 he sees no reason to move anyplace else.\n\n\u201cBelleville\u2019s got everything. They got church, they got the store, they got the bank, that\u2019s all I need,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s even allowed to drive still \u2014 though not farther than 10 miles. Given his affinity for his hometown, though, that isn\u2019t much of a problem for Fahey. If he needs to go farther, he gets a ride from family or friends.\n\nHe\u2019s kept up his health, although he doesn\u2019t see much use for his occasional doctor appointments.\n\n\u201cYou know, I get into the doctor, he\u2019ll tell me exactly what I already know. Why should I go at 100 years old?\u201d Fahey said. \u201cThe splendid thing is, I don\u2019t have to use a cane or a walker. My balance isn\u2019t that great, but I got to have something wrong with me at 100 years.\u201d\n\n50 best alien movies #50. The Vast of Night (2019) #49. Starman (1984) #48. Gandahar (1987) #47.

        "article_content": "Brits can see where UFOs have been spotted across the country during the past four years on a map - showing nearly 2,000 extra-terrestrial sightings.\n\nIt has been an intriguing time for UFO enthusiasts around the world with an American fighter jet shooting down an unexplained flying object that was later identified as a Chinese balloon last year. It was suspected of being on a spying mission along with three other objects in or near American airspace.\n\nAnd then whistle-blower Major David Grusch, a former Air Force intelligence officer, set the internet on fire when he claimed the US was concealing a long-standing programme that retrieves and reverse-engineers unidentified flying objects. The intrigue has continued into 2024, with Ukrainian troops recording a huge disc-shaped object over the battlefield of Donetsk, while closer to home a hiker came upon a mysterious monolith on a hilltop in Powys, Wales.\n\nHe initially assumed was \u201csome sort of UFO\u201d, and has since left some speculating it may have been planted by aliens. But despite increasing speculation about alien visitors online the skies above the UK have been relatively quiet in the past year and we are no closer to finding out if we are not alone in the universe.\n\nIn its annual report, the research group UFO Identified documented 395 sightings in the UK in 2023 - a 20% drop from 497 sightings in 2022 and lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484). That adds up to 1,789 sightings in four years. Information was taken from social media, newspaper reports, and over 50 Freedom of Information requests, as well as from reports made directly to UFO spotter groups around the UK.\n\nAccording to the report, people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39). That is broadly similar to the location of sightings in 2022 and 2021. Over the four years UFO Identified has documented the phenomenon, the highest number of sightings have been seen in the South East (233), followed by the North West (218) and then the South West (193). The lowest number of sightings have been reported in Northern Ireland (30), and the North East of England (63).\n\nWhile flying saucers and other unexplained phenomena were most likely to be spotted in the North West or the South East, the data shows that the best time to see a UFO last year was on a Monday evening between 9pm and 10pm. The most common sighting was a \u201cstar-like\u201d UFO, followed by an orb - with several different witnesses reporting clusters of orbs in the skies across different locations.\n\nThe vast majority of sightings were of far-off objects in the sky, but there were 27 \u201cClose Encounters of the First Kind\u201d, more than double the previous year. These are reports of UFOs seen up close, at a distance of no more than 500 feet away. There were also two \u201cClose Encounters of the Second Kind\u201d which is when a UFO sighting appears to cause a physical effect, such as a car malfunction, a ground impression, or a reaction in animals.\n\nSightings documented last year include:"

        "article_content": "As India aspires to become a global AI leader, it is crucial to establish a robust approach to regulate high-risk AI systems that prioritize consumer protection while fostering innovation.\n\nFocus on high-risk AI systems: These could significantly impact critical sectors such as healthcare, finance and law enforcement, and thus need regulation to mitigate potential harms. The EU\u2019s AI Act uses such a risk-based approach, imposing stricter regulations on high-risk applications.\n\nWe should build on the successes of other nations while considering local needs. To this end, India\u2019s convening of the recent Global India AI Summit 2024 was a step in the right direction.\n\nIts key highlights included recommendations on how AI technologies could be integrated into health systems worldwide while being attuned to local challenges. But integration alone is insufficient. It is crucial to ensure that it works against bias arising out of pre-existing societal discrimination issues.\n\nFor instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostic tools must undergo stringent testing to ensure patient safety and accuracy. In the financial sector, AI algorithms used for credit scoring and fraud detection should be audited regularly for bias and accuracy, ensuring fair treatment of all consumers.\n\nFinally, to combat the threat to democratic processes from the rise of deep-fakes during elections, legislation must be brought to criminalize the malicious use of AI to spread misinformation.\n\nEnhance consumer protection to build trust: This must be a cornerstone of AI regulation. Ensuring that these systems operate transparently and fairly is crucial to create public trust.\n\nCanada\u2019s Directive on AI mandates algorithmic impact assessments to identify and mitigate risks before AI systems are deployed, emphasizing transparency and accountability. India\u2019s redressal mechanism under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 (CPA) protects individuals adversely affected by unfair trade.\n\nWith the rising use of AI-driven algorithms by businesses in deploying products and services, the CPA shall automatically encompass protection of consumers against AI biases. Still, India too can mandate similar impact assessments for high-risk AI systems.\n\nThis would involve establishing a dedicated regulatory body to oversee AI-related consumer protection issues, enhance accountability and provide clear guidelines for ethical AI deployment.\n\nThe EU and Singapore have shown similar promise in creating balanced regulatory environments. A study by the European Parliamentary Research Service highlights the effectiveness of the risk-based framework in the EU\u2019s AI Act in regulating high-risk AI applications while promoting innovation in low-risk areas.\n\nSimilarly, Singapore\u2019s Infocomm Media Development Authority\u2019s public consultation on its draft Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI has been praised for its practical guidelines on ethical AI deployment and proactive approach to GenAI concerns while facilitating innovation.\n\nThese efforts are leading to increased industry compliance and public trust in AI systems. India can learn from these successes and adopt similar strategies to balance innovation and regulation.\n\nLeverage existing legal frameworks: Given AI\u2019s extensive data processing needs, it is crucial to learn from the interpretation and application of data protection laws. Australia provides a valuable case study.\n\nDespite not having specific AI regulations, it applies extant laws such as on consumer protection, privacy and online safety to AI systems. An example is an Australian consumer law being applied in a federal court case where Trivago was fined for misleading consumers through algorithmic decision-making.\n\nSimilarly, once India\u2019s Digital Personal Data Protection Act is enforced, it shall also apply to AI systems, ensuring that personal data is processed ethically, responsibly and in accordance with the law.\n\nBoth the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence and Responsible AI for All reports in India focus on ethical AI deployment and how AI could be leveraged for growth in sectors like healthcare, agriculture and smart cities.\n\nBut, since we do not have a cohesive and stringent framework aimed specifically at high-risk AI applications, risks still prevail. By regulating high-risk AI systems and defining \u2018no-go\u2019 zones for businesses and internet intermediaries using AI in consumer-facing applications, the draft Digital India Act 2023 should reduce these risks.\n\nUnquestionably, AI-driven growth would accelerate India\u2019s transition to a mature economy and support efforts in several critical sectors expected to drive the country\u2019s economic success. This will require a balanced and responsible regulatory environment, focusing on high-risk AI systems.\n\nWhile aligning our rules with international standards, it is equally important to address local challenges related to discrimination and bias in data. This would help India harness the full potential of AI in promoting sustainable growth while safeguarding societal interests."

        "article_content": "AI can assist everywhere from your email apps to fast food outlets. Now Amazon is keen to be involved in the AI revolution with an AI bot called Rufus, which can answer questions, research products, and help you make the right buying decisions across Amazon.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re stuck for a gift idea for someone special in your life, or you need to compare two products against each other. From asking about your active orders to checking up on the details of something you\u2019re thinking about buying, Rufus can help\u2014and here\u2019s how you can find it.\n\nHow Rufus works, and where to find it\n\nRufus might offer prompt suggestions based on your browsing history. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini, Rufus is very much along the same lines. It\u2019s trained on \u201cAmazon\u2019s extensive product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information from across the web\u201d, which it then sifts through, connects together, and summarizes to respond to your questions.\n\nThese bots, however, don\u2019t just copy and paste information\u2014they\u2019re designed to generate fresh and original responses, so (as always with these AI models) mistakes can be made. Amazon says Rufus \u201cmay not always get things right,\u201d so it\u2019s worth double-checking important details\u2014don\u2019t assume everything Rufus sells is 100 percent correct, and don\u2019t share private or personal information with it.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Amazon Shopping app for Android or iOS, you\u2019ll find Rufus on the right of the navigation bar at the bottom (the Rufus logo is two blobs with a star next to them): Tap the button to bring up a chat window and start asking questions. If you\u2019re shopping through the Amazon website, you\u2019ll see the Rufus button up on the left-hand side of the toolbar at the top.\n\nStraight away, Rufus will make suggestions about questions to ask\u2014some of these may be related to recent searches or recent purchases. Click or tap on any of the suggestions, or enter your own question or prompt, and Rufus springs into action.\n\nAfter each response, you get the opportunity to ask follow-up questions (Rufus will remember the conversation history), and rate the responses you\u2019ve been given (via the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons). You can clear your chat history in Rufus, but only in the app, and not on the web: Tap on the three dots (top right), then choose Manage chat and Clear chat history.\n\nQuestions and prompts to try with Rufus\n\nOne of the ways to use the bot is to ask questions about products. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nRufus knows what you\u2019re looking at on the Amazon platform, so you can ask it questions about a product you\u2019ve got up on screen. You can ask how much an item weighs, for example, or which materials it\u2019s made of, or what the battery life is like. In some cases, the bot will make direct reference to something in the listing.\n\nGoing beyond individual product pages, Rufus can answer shopping questions more generally. You might want to ask what the best tool is for a particular job, or how two specific items compare to each other, or what a certain item actually does (and how). You can ask about trends in product categories as well\u2014and see what\u2019s proving popular with other shoppers, for instance.\n\nYou can get quite creative with these questions. For example, you\u2019re able to ask about the tools and materials needed to make a garden shed, or about presents that would be suitable for a 5-year-old child\u2019s birthday, or about extras you might need for a dinner party. Any kind of advice you need, Rufus will attempt to give you some pointers.\n\nThis is where Rufus becomes more like other generative AI chatbots out there: If you\u2019re stuck for shopping inspiration, or you\u2019re not sure how two types of TV tech compare, then you can get answers. The questions you ask don\u2019t have to be specifically about what\u2019s being sold on Amazon, though you are quite likely to see links to see some related items on the site anyway.\n\nFinally, you can also chat with Rufus about the status of your current orders, or the last time you ordered (for example) packing tape. Sometimes you\u2019ll get a direct answer, and sometimes you\u2019ll be given a link for a relevant page on the Amazon site to follow. And if you\u2019re wondering how Amazon came up with the name, by the way, then it\u2019s to do with one of Amazon\u2019s earliest employees."

But then later, we found out that no one knew who that was, and no one ever saw him again\u2026\n\n\u2018It could have been someone just messing around, but, yeah, it was pretty scary,\u2019 he added.\n\nFilming is currently underway on Season Five of Stranger Things (Picture: AP)\n\nFinn is currently filming the eagerly-awaited fifth and final series of his hit Netflix television show, in which he plays young Mike Wheeler.\n\nEarlier this year, he and Noah Schnapp \u2013 who plays Will \u2013 were spotted looking all grown up as they filmed scenes for the new season.\n\nWill and Noah also star alongside Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Sadie Sink and Caleb McClaughlin, plus grown-ups-in-the-room David Harbour and Winona Ryder.\n\nTogether, the youths all came of age as the residents of Hawkins, Indiana.

        "article_content": "David Amesquita isn\u2019t afraid of ghosts. After all, he practically grew up in a cemetery.\n\nRaised by his grandparents in an old house that\u2019s since been demolished and replaced by a commercial strip across the street from Westfield Old Orchard mall, Amesquita and his pals would spend hours in Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie.\n\nThey explored gravestones and pulled fish from the ponds amid the plots that would become final resting spots for Brady Bunch dad Robert Reed, Bears great Sid Luckman, newspaperman Irv Kupcinet and landscape designer Jens Jensen.\n\n\u201cWe did stupid teenager stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deface anything. We rode our bikes around there and we\u2019d play baseball and football games in the field right next to the cemetery.\u201d\n\nBut he never encountered any signs of ghosts until years later. Now a retired postal worker, he attended a Plainfield Public Library program about a year ago hosted by Will County-based Other Side Investigations.\n\nThe group was founded by Christine Randall, Lesley Tuton and two other women, all veterans of area ghost hunting groups, who decided in 2022 to join forces and explore their shared interest in what lies beyond the grave. In the years since, they\u2019ve added a few like-minded members, including Amesquita, had some interesting adventures and became fast friends.\n\nThat friendship is important, especially when planning to spend a night in a place that\u2019s reportedly haunted and overtly creepy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better going to places with a group of people,\u201d Randall said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper for one thing, plus we love to eat together. \u2026 We\u2019re moms so we know how to bring the snacks.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve traveled to haunting hotspots such as Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Louisville, Kentucky, Thornhaven Manor in New Castle, Indiana, and Farrar Schoolhouse in Polk County Iowa, among other places, honing their investigative skills while engaging in supernatural tourism.\n\nDuring most of those trips, the settings were spookier than anything they picked up on electromagnetic meters or sound or video recordings.\n\n\u201cAt Farrar School, they had a boiler room that looked like what you\u2019d think a boiler room from an old horror movie would look like,\u201d Tuton said. \u201cSome places are creepy, but not like, \u2018I\u2019m going to run out of there\u2019 creepy.\u201d\n\nOne exception was a trip to Waverly Hills Sanitarium.\n\n\u201cThat was our first big ghost hunt,\u201d Randall said. \u201cI was doing fine until some people broke in. And then we thought they might be here to murder us, so, \u2018let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m more afraid of real people,\u201d Tuton added.\n\nThat experience didn\u2019t deter the group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hit up most of the places in a 2-300 mile radius,\u201d Tuton said.\n\nSome of those \u201cknown to be haunted\u201d locations have become revenue generators for their owners, who book time slots for enthusiasts looking to discover mysteries firsthand. Some, Randall said, are building bunkhouses nearby to accommodate a steady influx of ghost hunters.\n\nOSI now is shifting focus closer to home, conducting public investigations at places such as the Will County Historical Museum in Lockport and, this past Friday, at the Pleasant Home mansion at the behest of the Oak Park Park District.\n\nThe programs are not exhibitions. Members of the group are earnest in their beliefs and in the reality of the supernatural results of their investigations, even if they\u2019re more understated than what\u2019s typically portrayed on television.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the shows,\u201d Tuton said. \u201cWe\u2019re not constantly seeing dark shadows.\u201d\n\nRather, much of their supernatural evidence comes from scrutiny of recordings after visiting a site.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten some pretty cool audio,\u201d Tuton said. \u201cOn one, we have a girl saying \u2018gobble gobble do do,\u2019 and I was the only female in the place. That was pretty wild.\u201d\n\nBut some phenomena are experienced in the moment. At the Will County Historical Museum, the group was standing next to a workbench in the basement when they heard a loud bang.\n\n\u201cNobody was next to me,\u201d Tuton said. \u201cWe turned our flashlights on it and this huge wrench is swinging. We have it on video.\u201d\n\nOther tools hanging on the pegboard were still \u2014 only the heavy wrench had been jolted.\n\n\u201cEven our resident skeptic in the group couldn\u2019t explain it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had someone go upstairs and stomp around, but nothing moved.\u201d\n\nRandall said evidence collected during the investigations is examined from every angle.\n\n\u201cWe run it past the whole group, and if there\u2019s any doubt at all we don\u2019t show it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be that kind of group.\u201d\n\nStill, there are plenty of skeptics. Some live with them.\n\n\u201cMy husband doesn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Tuton said.\n\n\u201cMine wants to believe, but he wants proof,\u201d Randall added. \u201cAnd the kids think we\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nBut they\u2019ve also encountered a lot of people who think they might be on to something.\n\n\u201cMost kind of believe,\u201d Tuton said. \u201cPeople always have a story \u2014 like, \u2018This is going to sound nuts, but\u2026\u2019 and then they tell their story.\n\n\u201cA lot of people like having an avenue to talk about this kind of stuff, because it can be kind of taboo.\u201d\n\nRandall said they\u2019ve long gotten past that themselves.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t say things because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to be made fun of, but we just don\u2019t care anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nAmesquita, Other Side Investigations\u2019 newest member, said he \u201ccame in skeptical, and I\u2019m still on the side of skeptical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to rule out or debunk stuff that might be just a creaky old house,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone to places that were \u2018the most haunted\u2019 and featured on shows, but we get there and it\u2019s mostly just us joking around and having a good time. But it\u2019s great nonetheless.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case recently at an old house in Algonquin where strange things were happening, causing the homeowner to reach out to OSI.\n\n\u201cShe and her sister-in-law would have a few cocktails and a lot of stuff would go on,\u201d Amesquita said. \u201cObviously, we were skeptical going into there, but as soon as the word \u2018wine\u2019 came up, all of our equipment was going off like crazy \u2014 that was the first time I was part of something where I was like, there\u2019s something going on here!\n\n\u201cIt was really exciting for all of us.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, the women used to regularly enjoy drinks with a neighbor who\u2019d recently died.\n\n\u201cOur thinking is he\u2019s continuing to come back and jump in and still have fun with them and enjoy the music they\u2019re playing and the good times they have,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Algonquin ghost, like most the group have encountered, was benign.\n\n\u201cThere are residual hauntings based on energy,\u201d Randall said. \u201cIf you live in a place for 50 years and you go up and down the stairs every day, that energy is still there. When we do private investigations, a lot of times it\u2019s just grandma. Grandma is hanging out. That\u2019s a relief to a lot of people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a demon like in all the shows.\u201d\n\nResidual energy sometimes shows up in sounds, like mysterious footsteps the group heard in an empty room at the Will County Historical Museum, or the faint scent of tobacco in a room at Oak Park\u2019s Pleasant Home, a former \u201cparty house\u201d in the early 1900s where nobody has smoked in decades.\n\nThey\u2019ve encountered ghost cats and had a \u201cconversation\u201d in which an entity responded via irregular electromagnetic pulses happening only after questions were spoken.\n\nAt the Will County museum, they believe a late former employee communicated her favorite color, purple, via a device that rapidly scans radio waves. Investigators followed up with current employees who verified the deceased woman\u2019s penchant for lilac-colored dresses.\n\nAmesquita, a self-described rookie, is more attuned to the supernatural now than when he first joined. And the good vibes generated among this group of has him eager to participate in more adventures.\n\n\u201cI would tell people to come into this with an open mind, and hopefully we can show you something that will corroborate why we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nTheir enthusiasm for their craft is evident. And it\u2019s evidently contagious.\n\n\u201cMost people think what we\u2019re doing is cool,\u201d Tuton said.\n\nLandmarks is a column by Paul Eisenberg exploring the people, places and things that have left an indelible mark on the Southland.

        "article_content": "A Spanish documentary has used DNA to make history-changing claims, but the science behind its conclusions remains unclear.\n\nA documentary aired on Spain\u2019s national television this month has made headlines around the world for its revolutionary claim that Christopher Columbus was a Sephardic Jew from the Iberian Peninsula, contrary to the widely accepted theory that he hailed from Genoa in Italy.\n\nA team of forensic experts led by the University of Granada used DNA analysis to investigate the background of the 15th-century explorer in a bid to lay to rest a longstanding debate on the origins of the man whose expeditions opened the way for Europeans to colonise the Americas.\n\nWhile the scientific method behind the findings has yet to be made public, the history-changing claims contained in the documentary Columbus DNA: His True Origins have brought to the forefront how DNA may hold the key to the unsolved mysteries of the past.\n\nHow does \u2018archaeogenetics\u2019 work?\n\nArchaeogenetics is the study of ancient DNA, or DNA that is more than 70 years old.\n\nRodrigo Barquera, a researcher in archeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, explained that genetic material is collected from human archaeological samples and then purified and sequenced before being examined.\n\n\u201cThe more time has passed since the person\u2019s death, the harder it is to find genetic material,\u201d Barquera told Al Jazeera, adding that the conditions in which the remains are preserved also play a crucial role.\n\nThe analysis can reveal information about the sex and ancestry of the person as well as any diseases the person may have suffered from. It can also determine which populations are more closely related to the sample and therefore suggest a geographical area of provenance.\n\nWhat cannot be inferred are cultural elements such as nationality or religion, or precise ethnicity.\n\nWhat has been discovered about Christopher Columbus?\n\nThe documentary broadcast on Spain\u2019s National Day claimed the findings \u2013 which have not yet been peer-reviewed \u2013 show Columbus was of \u201cwestern Mediterranean\u201d origin, suggesting a genetic similarity with the people who inhabited the Iberian Peninsula, where modern-day Spain is located.\n\nThis conclusion contradicts the widely held view that Columbus was from the Republic of Genoa, a port city located in northern Italy.\n\nThe documentary also suggested Columbus was a Sephardic Jew, a specific Jewish diaspora population associated with the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nHowever, as Barquera put it, \u201cthere is no gene for Jewishness\u201d as cultural traits such as religion are not contained in a person\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe team at the University of Granada, which led the research on Columbus, has not detailed the scientific method used. This will be revealed when the findings are officially published in November.\n\nBarquera, who has no connection to the project, speculated, however, that researchers may have found a similarity to some traits shared by the Jewish population.\n\nWhile Jewishness is not a genetic but cultural trait, they may have had a \u201ccluster\u201d \u2013 or a group \u2013 of Jewish people with whom to compare the genetic information.\n\nEven then, he said: \u201cTests are usually done with several human groups and all of them would show some statistical attraction.\u201d Therefore it would be unscientific to pinpoint a single affiliation rather than multiple probable ones.\n\nWhy was the study of Columbus\u2019s remains undertaken and why does it matter?\n\nThe provenance of the man who made the European \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the Americas in 1492 has long been debated.\n\nFrancesc Albardaner, an architect and decades-long researcher of Columbus who features in the documentary, has been one of the proponents of a different version of history to the \u201cGenoa theory\u201d that textbooks have stated for centuries.\n\n\u201cColumbus was a Catalan and the son of a man from the Republic of Genoa and a Jewish woman from Valentia,\u201d Albardaner told Al Jazeera, adding that his conclusions match those presented by the documentary.\n\nAlbardaner claims Columbus preferred to present himself using his paternal affiliation due to the scorn and persecution faced by the Jews at the time.\n\nHe added that the proponents of the \u201cGenoa theory\u201d have come up against the fact that documents produced under the rule of Ferdinand of Aragon did not state Columbus\u2019s place of origin, as it was the case at the time.\n\n\u201cWhen talking about foreigners, the Kingdom of Castile explicitly said where they were from,\u201d Albardaner said, citing as a case in point documents that registered Italian explorer Giovanni Caboto as Venetian.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Columbus, they only state that he is a foreigner,\u201d Albardaner said, adding that this anomaly had never been fully explained.\n\nThe theory that sees Columbus born as a Jew under the reign of Ferdinand would also explain why he was able to become one of the highest civil servants within the kingdom, a position that would have been unlikely for a foreigner to hold.\n\nAlbardaner added that establishing the historical truth about Columbus\u2019s early life was consequential. \u201cOne little mistake can lead to a whole series of wrong assumptions,\u201d he said, leading historians adrift when researching his early years and activity.\n\nFor instance, in a research paper, Albardaner detailed how Columbus\u2019s claim that he had visited \u201call the East and the West\u201d before 1470 \u2013 contained in a letter written in 1501 \u2013 has been dismissed, especially by Italian scholars, as invention and vanity.\n\nAlbardaner argued that placing Columbus\u2019s life under Ferdinand\u2019s rule would give historical credibility to his naval service in the Mediterranean and establish that he had, in fact, begun sailing in 1461 or earlier.\n\nWhich other famous cases of genealogy discoveries have there been?\n\nResearchers are using DNA to uncover the many mysteries that still surround the history of humanity.\n\nSeveral studies have focused on remnants of the Neanderthals, distant ancestral relations to modern humans, to reconstruct how close their relationship to our species was and what their social organisation looked like.\n\nThe fossil of a six-year-old child retrieved at the Cova Negra archaeological site in the province of Valencia, Spain, excavated in 1989 and examined earlier this year, even hinted at signs of compassion among Neanderthals.\n\nNicknamed \u201cTina\u201d, the child is the earliest-known evidence of a person with Down syndrome and was also afflicted by several illnesses. Researchers at the University of Alcala in Spain concluded that for the child to have survived at least six years, the group must have continuously assisted the mother with her daily tasks, pointing to compassion.\n\nBarquera and his team in Leipzig also worked on the remnants of another historical figure, the German composer and pianist Ludwig van Beethoven. \u201cWe could reconstruct part of the genealogy and because the sample was really good, we could even do some testing for health-related issues and confirm that he had hepatitis B,\u201d Barquera said.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we could only rely on what was written, but now [thanks to these technologies] we can confirm or exclude some assumptions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, we might help draw a better picture of specific historical events.\u201d"

In short Scientists have discovered a group of neurons in the brainstem that could be the control center for REM sleep, a stage often disrupted in sleep disorders.\n\nBy manipulating these neurons, they were able to alter sleep patterns in mice, suggesting potential new treatments for conditions like sleep apnea and narcolepsy.\n\nThis breakthrough could pave the way for better understanding and treatment of sleep disorders. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe discovery was made through experiments on mice\n\nBreakthrough discovery could lead to new treatments for sleep disorders\n\nBy Akash Pandey 04:58 pm Oct 27, 202404:58 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a major breakthrough in sleep research, a team of scientists has identified the neural control center for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The discovery, made through experiments on mice, saw researchers inducing REM sleep by stimulating a specific circuit at the top of the brainstem. The findings could potentially deepen our understanding of human sleep biology and its disorders.\n\nTherapeutic implications\n\nPotential applications in treating sleep disorders\n\nThe team's findings could have major implications in treating sleep disorders like sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and REM disorders. These conditions often involve distressing nightmares or physical manifestations of dreams through movement or vocalizations. The newfound knowledge about the brain's control center for REM sleep, could potentially be used to manipulate this stage of sleep in patients suffering from these disorders.\n\nResearch challenges\n\nUnraveling the mysteries of REM sleep\n\nThe precise location and role of the brain's REM sleep control center have long been debated among scientists. Some researchers have proposed that neurons in the mammalian brainstem are key to triggering REM sleep. This theory stems from observations in cats, where removal or damage to the brainstem prevents proper REM sleep and leads to dream enactment behaviors.\n\nNeurological insights\n\nBrainstem's role in REM sleep and related disorders\n\nSimilar dream enactment behaviors have been seen in humans with known brainstem degeneration (like in Parkinson's disease). This further supports the theory of the brainstem's role in REM sleep. The pons, at the top of the brainstem, has been identified as a potential 'control center' for muscle relaxation during REM sleep through rodent studies. However, identifying specific pathways responsible for this crucial phase has proved challenging due to intermingling neurons promoting wakefulness and sleep.\n\nNeuronal discovery\n\nDiscovery of REM-related neurons in the brainstem\n\nNeuroscientist Mitsuaki Kashiwagi and his team have pinpointed a cluster of REM-related neurons in the dorsal region of the pons. These neurons, called Crhbp+ neurons due to their expression of a corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein, project from the pons to Nos1+ neurons in the medulla oblongata. This loop could potentially act as a core circuit for REM sleep, Kashiwagi and his colleagues said.\n\nExperimental results\n\nManipulation of pons neurons affects REM sleep\n\nThe team's experiments revealed that when pons neurons were taken out of the loop, mice had less sleep and impaired muscle relaxation during REM sleep. On the other hand, activating these neurons increased the number and duration of REM episodes at the cost of wakefulness. This indicates that manipulating these neurons could potentially be used as a therapeutic strategy for sleep disorders."

The city has unveiled its very first dinosaur fossils, which likely belonged to a large dinosaur. These fossils were located on a remote island, adding substantial value to the field of palaeoecological studies in the area.\n\nThe fossils, which experts have dated back to the Cretaceous period, are undergoing further examination to determine their exact species. This new find is poised to shed light on the region's prehistoric past, acting as a cornerstone for future research efforts.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

        "article_content": "Micro SaaS, or Software as a Service, is a rising trend in the business world, especially for entrepreneurs and small businesses. With a focused approach on solving niche problems, Micro SaaS products offer smaller-scale, targeted solutions that don\u2019t require huge teams or budgets. In this guide, we\u2019ll explore how to identify the best Micro SaaS products and how you can leverage them for your business growth.\n\nWhat is Micro SaaS?\n\nMicro SaaS refers to smaller software tools or platforms that cater to a specific market or solve a highly niche problem. Unlike traditional SaaS, which often targets larger markets with broad functionality, Micro SaaS is designed for a smaller, more focused customer base. These tools are usually developed by solo entrepreneurs or small teams, making them highly specialized and lightweight.\n\nBenefits of Micro SaaS\n\nLow Start-up Costs : Micro SaaS products usually require minimal resources to develop and maintain, making them ideal for bootstrapping.\n\nScalability : As these products cater to niche markets, scaling can be more straightforward with less competition.\n\nRecurring Revenue : Most Micro SaaS products follow a subscription model, ensuring consistent income streams.\n\nHow to Identify Top Micro SaaS Products\n\nFinding the right Micro SaaS product to use or invest in requires research and understanding of market needs. Here\u2019s how to go about it:\n\n1. Analyze Your Business Needs\n\nBefore diving into Micro SaaS options, take a step back and evaluate your business requirements. Are there repetitive tasks that could be automated? Is there a specific problem you\u2019re struggling to solve? Identifying pain points will help you find SaaS products tailored to your specific needs.\n\n2. Research Niche Markets\n\nMicro SaaS thrives on niche markets, so understanding the market is key. Explore forums, social media groups, and industry-specific blogs to see what tools businesses in your sector are using. For example, if you run a small e-commerce store, you may discover a Micro SaaS product that helps with cart recovery or inventory management.\n\n3. Look for User Reviews\n\nOne of the easiest ways to find top-performing Micro SaaS products is through user reviews and testimonials. Sites like G2, Capterra, or Trustpilot provide insights into user experiences. By reading reviews, you can get a sense of how the product performs, its customer support, and any drawbacks to be aware of.\n\n4. Evaluate Scalability and Flexibility\n\nA good Micro SaaS product should be scalable and flexible enough to grow with your business. Before choosing a tool, evaluate its potential for growth. Will it still serve your business as you scale? Can the product be customized or integrated with other tools?\n\nTop Micro SaaS Categories to Explore\n\nThere are several categories where Micro SaaS products excel. Below are some of the most popular sectors for these tools:\n\n1. Marketing Automation\n\nMicro SaaS products in the marketing space are becoming increasingly popular. These tools focus on automating tasks like social media scheduling, email marketing, or even SEO analysis. Platforms like Buffer for social media management or MailerLite for email automation are prime examples.\n\n2. Project Management\n\nSmaller teams often need lightweight, easy-to-use project management tools. Trello and Notion are Micro SaaS platforms that offer simple solutions for task tracking and team collaboration without overwhelming users with complex features.\n\n3. Customer Support\n\nHandling customer inquiries efficiently is crucial for businesses. Micro SaaS products like HelpScout and Crisp provide simple and effective tools for managing customer support tickets, live chat, and FAQs. These tools focus on delivering value for small businesses that don\u2019t need enterprise-level solutions.\n\n4. E-commerce Optimization\n\nFor e-commerce businesses, Micro SaaS products like Gleam and OptinMonster offer features to help improve conversion rates, such as pop-ups, giveaways, and lead generation forms. These tools are perfect for small e-commerce stores looking to boost sales without massive marketing budgets.\n\nHow to Utilize Micro SaaS Products Effectively\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the right Micro SaaS product for your business, the next step is maximizing its potential. Here are some strategies for making the most out of these tools:\n\n1. Start with a Free Trial\n\nMost Micro SaaS products offer a free trial or a freemium version. Use this time to test the tool in your workflow and assess its value. Pay attention to ease of use, integration capabilities, and the support provided during the trial phase.\n\n2. Integrate with Existing Tools\n\nOne of the best ways to utilize Micro SaaS products is by integrating them with your existing software stack. Many Micro SaaS tools offer API access or direct integrations with popular platforms like Slack, Zapier, or Shopify. By connecting these tools, you can create a more seamless workflow, saving time and effort.\n\n3. Use Data to Track Performance\n\nMicro SaaS tools often come with built-in analytics. Use these data-driven insights to measure how the product impacts your business. For example, if you\u2019re using a SaaS tool for lead generation, track how many leads convert into customers. Analyzing the ROI of the tool will help you decide whether to continue or explore other options.\n\n4. Focus on Customer Support\n\nMicro SaaS products usually offer limited customer support compared to large-scale SaaS platforms. Make sure to leverage whatever support channels are available, whether it\u2019s through a knowledge base, live chat, or email. Effective use of support resources can help you resolve issues quickly and get the most out of the product.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMicro SaaS products offer incredible opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to streamline operations, increase productivity, and solve niche problems. By carefully identifying your needs, researching the best products in your sector, and utilizing them effectively, you can stay ahead of the competition without overwhelming your budget.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for marketing automation tools, customer support platforms, or e-commerce optimizers, Micro SaaS solutions provide a practical and affordable way to grow your business efficiently. Take the time to explore this growing space and harness the power of niche, focused software that perfectly aligns with your business needs."

        "article_content": "Toast (NYSE: TOST) is a restaurant technology company with products for processing payments, taking orders, and more. And one year from now, Toast stock is likely to be trading higher than it is today.\n\nRevenue is growing at more than 20% annually, and management is demonstrating that it knows how to run a profitable business. Those two things are encouraging enough, but there's one more thing that makes me even more optimistic about the long-term prospects of this company.\n\nDon't overlook this adoption trend with Toast\n\nIn the second quarter, around 8,000 new restaurant locations started using Toast's technology. Admittedly, the second quarter is usually a strong one for the company, but this was a record amount of net new locations. And it answers a major question that shareholders had.\n\nIn 2023, Toast launched a new fee that outraged customers, leading management to quickly reverse the decision. But there are other restaurant technology companies out there, and shareholders were left wondering whether Toast had misstepped and alienated users from its platform.\n\nGiven the record number of net new locations in Q2, it appears Toast didn't suffer too much reputational damage. That being the case, there's good reason to believe its growth rate could accelerate.\n\nWhen Toast reaches 20% market share in a specific market, management calls this a flywheel market. It seems its existing customers become brand evangelists in those flywheel areas. Simply put, the company has noted stronger adoption rates, lower expenses, and consequently, higher profits, in flywheel markets.\n\nIn 2021, Toast had 20% or greater market share in only 5% of U.S. markets. In 2023, that jumped to 31% of U.S. markets. And it continues to climb in 2024, according to management.\n\nThe company only has 13% market share in the U.S. as a whole, but more and more markets are reaching a tipping point where taking more share gets easier.\n\nThinking about this from a big-picture perspective, Toast appears to be on a path to claiming a huge percentage of the overall restaurant space in the U.S., meaning the business could have many years of growth ahead of it.\n\nMore than just growth\n\nFor some time, I've been a believer in Toast's growth potential. I was a doubter when it came to its bottom line, but this company is proving me wrong in real time.\n\nToast provides hardware devices to customers at a gross loss, and payment processing is low margin. By contrast, its software subscription products are high margin. That's great, but it takes time for the software profits to get big enough to offset the losses elsewhere in the business. However, as this chart shows, Toast's gross profit margin is jumping higher recently as revenue soars.\n\nStory Continues"
