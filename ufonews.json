        "article_content": "(UFO) Long Term Investment Analysis\n\nLonger Term Trading Plans for UFO\n\nBuy UFO near 18.85 target n/a stop loss @ 18.8. Details\n\nThe technical summary data tells us to buy UFO near 18.85, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 18.8 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 18.85 is the first level of support below 19.1, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 18.85 is being tested, a buy signal would exist. NONE . Details NONE .\n\nThere are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.\n\nSwing Trading Plans for UFO\n\nBuy UFO slightly over 19.39, target n/a, Stop Loss @ 19.33 Details\n\nIf 19.39 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy UFO just slightly over 19.39, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 19.33 in case the stock turns against the trade. 19.39 is the first level of resistance above 19.1, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 19.39, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan. Short UFO slightly near 19.39, target 18.85, Stop Loss @ 19.45. Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of UFO if it tests 19.39 with a downside target of 18.85. We should have a stop loss in place at 19.45 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 19.39, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.\n\nDay Trading Plans for UFO\n\nBuy UFO slightly over 19.39, target n/a, Stop Loss @ 19.34 Details\n\nIf 19.39 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy UFO just slightly over 19.39, with an upside target of n/a.

In this case, 19.39, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan. Short UFO slightly near 19.39, target 19, Stop Loss @ 19.44. Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of UFO if it tests 19.39 with a downside target of 19.

        "article_content": "They may not come in peace, after all.\n\nOver the decades, dozens of UFOs have been witnessed around nuclear weapons sites.\n\nFormer Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo said earlier this year the encounters could be reconnaissance missions for a potential invasion.\n\nBut in his new book, researcher Robert L Hastings, who has devoted decades to interviewing dozens of U.S. military personnel who have seen UFOs near nuclear sites, believes the reality may be more complex.\n\nWere aliens present at the Castle Bravo nuclear test?\n\nHastings looks at dozens of cases that have occurred since the United States detonated its first atomic bomb at the Trinity test site in 1945.\n\nBut the connection between UFOs and nuclear sites has persisted in India, Russia and elsewhere across the globe.\n\nIn fact, UFO reports over America's nuclear arsenal appeared to shift from sites where the bombs were made to missile silos and US air bases as the Cold War arms race grew.\n\nUFO sightings over America's nuclear arsenal appeared to shift their interest from the making of the bombs to silos and bomber bases as the Cold War arms race grew (above)\n\nIn his book, UFOs and Nukes, based on interviews with more than 150 veterans, Hastings reveals that investigators are prevented from properly probing the cases because of dubious layers of classification.\n\nOne thing is for sure, however - it is 'obvious' that if there are extraterrestrial visitors, they are 'greatly interested in our nuclear weapons.'\n\nHastings writes: 'A public, grassroots effort must be made in the interim to understand\u2014as best as possible, using the data gathered thus far\u2014the nature and intentions of those who pilot the UFOs.'\n\nAs to why they choose to buzz around the world's most dangerous military sites, there are several theories.\n\nPerhaps the visitors have empathy for humankind and wish to warn us of the dangers of nuclear warfare, Hastings writes.\n\n'Or perhaps they have a use for our planet, let's say for scientific purposes, and know that global nuclear warfare will disrupt their data-gathering and/or experiments.'\n\nThe more mundane explanation is that the sightings are simply foreign nations' tech spying on high priority targets.\n\nLos Alamos\n\nEstablished in 1943 as the base for the 'Manhattan Project' led by Robert Oppenheimer, Los Alamos was the birthplace of nuclear weapons.\n\nBut Hastings says that even at this early stage, there were sightings of unusual craft.\n\nAn FBI memorandum, dated January 31, 1949 refers to observations of 'Flying Discs, Flying Saucers, and Balls of Fire'.\n\nThe sightings began as early as December 1948, Hastings reveals.\n\nThe memo said, 'This matter is considered top secret by Intelligence Officers of both the Army and the Air Forces.'\n\nHastings said that multiple UFO sightings were also seen at Sandia Base in Albuquerque, where further atomic weapons were tested, and at Oak Ridge Laborabory, a fissile materials production site.\n\nLos Alamos was the birthplace of America's nuclear deterrent\n\nHastings writes, ' For whatever reason, those piloting the UFOs\u2014whose origin and intentions were unknown\u2014appeared to be very interested in the facilities associated with America's atomic weapons program.\n\nOperation Castle, 1954\n\nThe Castle hydrogen bomb tests at Bikini Atoll tested high-yield weapons - and Castle Bravo was the largest nuclear device ever detonated by the United States.\n\nBut Hastings says that documents uncovered long after the tests reveal the presence of unknown craft.\n\nThe Castle Bravo detonation was preceded by mysterious radio blackouts, Hastings says.\n\nIn 1998, Patricia Broudy, the Legislative Director of the National Association of Atomic Veterans, found a reference to UFO sightings during the Castle tests, going through 500 pages of documents relating to logistics.\n\nThe document was later removed from official records, Hastings claims.\n\nAtomic Energy Commission's flagship the USS Curtis\n\nIn a transcribed ship's deck log from April 7, 1954, sailors and Marines aboard the Atomic Energy Commission's flagship the USS Curtis (which had transported the 'special devices', or hydrogen bombs to the test area), saw a luminous object fly over the ship at high speed.\n\nMarine corporal Joe Stallings said he had been approached by multiple sailors and marines, who had seen the UFO which was 'the talk of the ship'.\n\nThe missile 'set to launch'\n\nHastings says that of all the dozens of interviews he recorded with former Intercontinental Ballistic Missile launch officers ove rthe years, one stands out as 'perhaps the most disturbing'.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with David H Schuur, Schuur revealed that a UFO activated the launch sequence of his Minuteman missiles.\n\nA Minuteman launch site at Malmstrom in Montana\n\nSchuur, a Minuteman crew member from 1963 to 1967, said that a 'bright, hovering object' appeared to be sending messages to six or seven of the missiles at the site.\n\nSchuur said 'It was as if the object was scanning each missile, one by one.'\n\nSome of the missiles began to display a 'launch in progress', Schuur said.\n\n'That means the missile has received a launch signal. When that happens, we get an indication in the capsule that a launch command has been received by that missile, Schuur said.\n\n'If that happens, without proper authority, you flip what's called an 'Inhibit' switch, to delay the launch for a given period of time.\n\n'If an Inhibit command comes in from another launch capsule, that shuts down the launch totally.\n\n'But if that second command doesn't come in, the missile will wait for a specified period of time and then launch automatically.'\n\nAn operational test launch of an Air Force Global Strike Command unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile\n\nThe crew pressed the 'inhibit' switch and the missiles didn't launch - and commanders at the base told him not to mention the incident again.\n\nThe Soviet sightings\n\nIn 1984, a strange craft was spotted 'quite close' to the Soviet Katta-Kurgan tactical nuclear missile base, located in what is Uzbekistan today.\n\nThe site was believed to have multiple mobile tactical missiles.\n\nMissile technician Shamil Yuaihmetov reported seeing a metallic-appearing, cigar-shaped object slowly descending at a 45-degree angle.\n\nAs the object descended, it emitted a hissing sound.\n\nA Soviet SS-4 medium-range missile in Red Square\n\nHastings writes: 'The next day, in a nearby vineyard, three apparent landing-gear marks, in an equilateral triangle pattern, were found within an area of damaged vines measuring 30 by 80 meters.\n\n'Each depression was a half-meter deep and seemed to be created by a hemispheric or globe-shaped landing pad.'\n\nThe Soviet military investigated, but the findings are not available to researchers, Hastings says."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nCredit: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nYou can interact with ChatGPT through the OpenAI website on your computer, but what if you're on a mobile device? If you own an iPhone, iPad, or Android device, OpenAI offers an official app. But for any mobile device, including an Apple Watch, there are other ways to access ChatGPT.\n\nInstead of simply opening the ChatGPT site in your mobile web browser, you can also add it to your phone's home screen, turn it into a Siri Shortcut, and even use a third-party app. Here's how to set up the popular AI chatbot on your mobile device.\n\nUse OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Mobile App\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT app can be downloaded from Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store. The app works similarly to the website in that you enter queries and receive a response in return. It also uses voice recognition to let you speak requests out loud and provides a chat history so you can return to a previous conversation.\n\nAfter launching the app the first time, you\u2019ll be prompted to sign in with your OpenAI account. If you don\u2019t have one, tap the Sign up button to create a free account. At the chat screen, enter your query in the Message field by typing it. You can also tap the microphone icon and then speak a request. When finished, tap the button to stop the recording, and your spoken words appear in the Message field. Tap the up arrow to submit your prompt and see the response.\n\nThough the response appears on the screen, you can also listen to it read aloud. Press down on the response and select Read Aloud from the menu. As the text is spoken aloud, use the top toolbar to pause, restart, skip ahead, skip back, and stop the narration.\n\nDon't like how ChatGPT sounds? You can change the voice for the narration. Swipe the screen to the right and tap your name at the bottom. In the Voice Mode section of the Settings screen, tap Voice. You can tap each voice to hear how it sounds, then select Confirm when you find the voice you like best.\n\nTo manage the current conversation in the iOS app, tap ChatGPT at the top. From the menu, you can share, rename, archive, or delete your chat. Return to the main screen and tap the two-lined icon at the top. Here, you\u2019re able to access a history of your chats across all devices. Tap your name at the bottom to review app settings.\n\nTo manage the current conversation on an Android device, tap the three-dot icon in the upper right. Here, you\u2019re able to share, rename, archive, or delete the chat. To access a history of past chats, tap the icon in the upper left or swipe the screen to the right. Tap your name at the bottom of the left sidebar to adjust various settings.\n\nAdd the Website to Your Home Screen\n\nYou can also turn the ChatGPT website into an app that sits on the home screen. First, head to the ChatGPT website and log in or sign up for an account. iPhone and iPad users should tap the Share icon and select Add to Home Screen. Type a name for the icon and tap Add to make the icon appear on your home screen.\n\nOn an Android device, tap the three-dot icon in the upper right. Select Add to Home screen from the menu and tap Install. The ChatGPT site icon is then added as an app to the home screen.\n\nOn either type of device, tap the icon to access ChatGPT as you would from a web browser. You can then enter queries to the AI chatbot and get responses.\n\nFor Apple Devices: Set Up a ChatGPT Siri Shortcut\n\nAnother option for accessing ChatGPT on an iPhone or iPad is through the Shortcuts app or Siri. You can use the app to create a custom shortcut, but there are pre-built ones available online, including SiriGPT, ChatGPT Siri, and Siri Pro. We'll use SiriGPT as an example here.\n\nBefore adding one of these shortcuts, you'll need to download special API keys from OpenAI. Open the ChatGPT API key page and sign in with your ChatGPT account. Click Create new secret key, name the key, then tap Create secret key. Copy the code that appears (you can also save it to Notes for safe keeping).\n\nOpen the SiriGPT shortcut page on your device and tap Add Shortcut. In the Shortcuts app, find the SiriGPT shortcut and tap its three-dot icon. In the Text field, delete the words ADD API KEY HERE and paste the API key that you previously copied. Tap Done, then choose SiriGPT shortcut and allow access for Speech Recognition and api.openai.com to make the shortcut ready to use.\n\nYou can now use the shortcut by tapping the SiriGPT entry in the app. A window pops up allowing you to speak your query, which will then be answered by ChatGPT. The response will show up on the screen and be spoken by Siri. Tap Done to close the query. Tap Ask Again to ask another question or tap Done to exit the shortcut.\n\nTry ChatGPT Through These Mobile Apps\n\nBeyond the official ChatGPT apps from OpenAI, a number of developers have cooked up their own third-party apps powered by one of OpenAI\u2019s GPT models. Be wary of unscrupulous developers pumping out malware-laden ChatGPT apps to capitalize on its popularity, but there are several worth checking out.\n\nAI Chat: Designed for iOS/iPadOS and powered by GPT-4, AI Chat allows you to type or speak requests. The app comes in two flavors. A free version limits the number of chats and length of the responses. For $6.99 per week or $69.99 per year, a Plus version offers access to GPT-4o, image generation, and unlimited chats.\n\nChatster: Chatster is an iOS/iPadOS app that sells for $9.99 per week or $69.99 per year following a free three-day trial. Based on your requests, the app can generate images as well as text and can analyze words in an image that you upload. You can share the responses with other people and add the app as a Siri shortcut.\n\nGenie: Designed for iOS and Android, Genie is powered by GPT-4. You can use the app for free or subscribe for $6.99 per week or $69.99 a year to get an unlimited number of questions, a high word limit, and a more advanced ChatGPT model. Type your question in the text field, and Genie responds with an answer displayed on the screen and spoken aloud. You can then regenerate or copy the response and share it with another app or another person.\n\nAI Chatbot Nova: Available for iOS and Android, AI Chatbot Nova is adept at answering a variety of questions as well as generating different types of content. The basic version of Nova is free and quite capable, though it restricts you to only three chats per day. For $4.99 per week or $59.99 per year, the app kicks in unlimited chat messages, more detailed answers, instant responses, a chat history, image-to-text OCR, and access to GPT-4o.\n\nChatOn: Powered by GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude and Stable Diffusion API, the ChatOn app (iOS and Android) has a free version with limited chats and responses and a $40-per-year flavor that offers unlimited chats and the ability to generate images, summarize PDFs and URLs, analyze photos, and even conduct web searches. You can ask questions or choose one of the suggested topics. The premium version also lets you set up an AI-powered keyboard to help write and revise content.\n\nTry ChatGPT Through These Apple Watch Apps\n\nApple Watch owners also have the ability to use AI-powered apps on their smartwatch. Here are two apps worth checking out:\n\nAsk AI: With a price tag of $3.98, Ask AI invites you to pose requests by speaking to your watch or typing through an iPhone. The app displays its response on the watch screen. Swipe down to the bottom to tell it to speak the answer, share the response with someone else, or ask another question.\n\nPetey: With a basic version freely available and a premium flavor that costs $6.99, Petey prompts you to submit queries through your phone or by voice. The app then displays and speaks the answer. Swipe down to the bottom of the response and you\u2019re able to share it, listen to it spoken again, and send a reply."

        "date": "2h",
        "source": "Mint",
        "article_content": "Unlike many experts who are still awaiting a killer app in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), Naveen Rao, vice-president of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) at Databricks, says the world already has one -- it\u2019s coding.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of developers actually latch onto this, especially younger developers. LLMs (large language models) have also worked on code (besides text, images, audios, videos, etc.), and we're already seeing design automation happening through coding assistance. It (coding) is a sub-class of a much larger class of uses around true design automation,\" Rao told Mint in a recent video interview from his San Diego office.\n\nRao asserts that with many coding tasks getting automated, the ability to innovate in product design and create unique user experiences will become even more valuable.\n\n\"You can now create apps simply by describing them in English. As a result, the value of translating a design idea into an app has diminished because much of that process is now automated,\" he says.\n\nBeing a developer will mean using AI tools effectively, says Rao, adding that the focus will shift to understanding why certain apps succeed while others don\u2019t.\n\nRao underscores, though, that \u201cit will take 3-5 years to engineer these systems to be reliable and deterministic enough to be able to use them in core engineering.\" The reason is that GenAI still struggles with \u201challucinations\" (incorrect or misleading results) and lacks true reasoning capabilities despite claims to the contrary by some big tech companies.\n\nData is eating the world through AI\n\n\"Current LLMs primarily pattern-match based on probabilities, not reason. Unlike humans or even animals that learn through a cycle of action and feedback, LLMs don\u2019t engage in causal, real-world learning. While advancements, like the step-by-step reasoning introduced by OpenAI, are promising, there\u2019s a long way to go,\" elaborates Rao, who has a degree from Duke University in computer science and a PhD in computational neuroscience from Brown University.\n\nHe is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded AI companies Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for about $400 million, and MosaicML that was acquired by Databricks last July for $1.3 billion.\n\nWhat keeps Rao up at night is the gap between AI\u2019s potential and its current limitations, particularly in reasoning. According to him, AI models like DeepMind's AlphaZero, which hypothesize and learn through self-play in structured environments, provide a glimpse of what's possible, \u201cbut we\u2019re far from applying that in the real world.\"\n\n\u201cWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments,\" says Rao.\n\nThis push for reasoning, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily demand greater computing power, according to him. Instead, the shift is towards smaller, high-quality datasets and more targeted tuning, which may not require the massive compute resources associated with training larger models.\n\nRao says this transition from batch offline training to online learning could transform how we approach AI development going forward.\n\nWhy software won\u2019t eat the AI world\n\nRao also insists that software will not eat the AI world, referring to co-founder of US VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Andreessen's famous 2011 essay titled, \"Why software is eating the world\". In a 30 August thread on 'X' (formerly, Twitter), Rao argued that the \"...fundamental balance of compute and software is different with AI...In light of @nvidia's strong growth and recent earnings, clearly hardware is an essential ingredient to the current wave of AI\u2026\"\n\nRao says he's more \u201cexcited about the ongoing evolution of hardware, which continues to drive efficiency and lower costs.\" He cites the example of the human brain, which operates on just 20 watts of energy, \u201cshowcasing how far we still are from creating AI systems as efficient and advanced.\" He adds that there's significant progress being made in how AI systems interact with hardware, improving latency, cost, and accuracy.\n\nDatabricks, for instance, is exploring \u201cseveral exciting applications of AI and GenAI, particularly in task automation and creative processes,\" according to Rao. One area of focus is automating tasks like answering human resources (HR) queries or searching through company manuals, where \u201cyou can tolerate some error.\"\n\nYou can now create apps simply by describing them in English.\n\nAnother innovative use involves training LLMs to replicate a specific writing style, aiding news organisations by speeding up content creation. Databricks also supports the use of LLMs in scientific research, such as drug discovery, where AI assists in analysing protein interactions and advancing new drug development.\n\nDatabricks has been recognised as a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for data science and machine learning platforms, 'The Forrester Wave: Cloud Data Pipelines, Q4 2023,\" and the 2024 IDC MarketScape for worldwide analytic stream processing.\n\nKey customers using the Databricks' data intelligence platform to streamline data, AI, and analytics processes include Adobe, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation, Nasdaq, Air India, Parle, MakeMyTrip, Meesho, Tata Steel, and Shell.\n\nData is the AI oil\n\nDatabricks' DBRX model, for instance, can turn raw data into a fully trained, fine-tuned model. Databricks, says Rao, is now focusing on \"compound AI systems,\" which combine multiple AI models, including open-source and proprietary ones, to create advanced solutions. Using this approach, Databricks helped Factset, a financial software provider, improve its query accuracy and efficiency.\n\nData is an essential ingredient in making AI truly add economic value. So maybe now the mantra is: \u201cData is eating the world through AI\", says Rao.\n\nThat said, many companies struggle to bridge the gap between data readiness and effective AI implementation. A key challenge, says Rao, is to understand the economics of AI, which differs significantly from traditional software models like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), where many applications can run on a single piece of hardware.\n\nAI models, on the other hand, require dedicated physical infrastructure for each additional user. This, according to Rao, implies that scaling AI would involve costly hardware investments, resulting in lower gross margins (often below 20%) as compared to SaaS. On the development side, rising costs make profitability difficult, particularly as larger companies continue to raise capital and operate at a loss.\n\nIn this context, the key metric for CXOs when integrating AI is \u201cdefining clear success criteria.\" In AI, especially with custom LLMs, this involves creating an evaluation system, much like an exam, to measure the performance of the AI system, says Rao.\n\nHe adds that Databricks offers various tools for optimisation, such as re-ranking and fine-tuning models, which help improve performance. Establishing and refining these metrics is crucial for successful AI deployment.\n\nHe cites the example of Ola's Krutrim, which is one of Databricks\u2019 customers that built its own AI model using the platform, rather than relying on pre-existing models. Other customers like Freshworks and Air India are using custom LLMs and compound AI systems to automate tasks such as chatbots that assist with queries about baggage policies or refunds, according to Rao.\n\nOla\u2019s model is particularly notable, according to him, due to India's linguistic diversity, where multiple languages such as Hindi, English, and regional languages, are mixed in daily communication.\n\nNew skill sets\n\nThat said, Rao agrees that AI will have a deep impact on jobs, especially given the increasing use of copilots and fully autonomous AI agentic systems in enterprises. Autonomous AI agents, or the so-called 'Agentic AI' systems, refer to AI models that can achieve specific goals without any human intervention.\n\nIt's clear we must decide how humans remain integral to the process, says Rao. Databricks is working on this by developing tools that help customers build high-quality AI agents.\n\nThese agents go beyond simple tasks, automating complex processes using customer data to drive value. However, enterprise customers demand transparency, auditability, and security, making this a challenging area, according to Rao.\n\nWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments\n\nHe adds, \"AI will significantly change jobs, much like other technological advances have in the past. As AI advances, the key skills will include data engineering, system orchestration, product design and AI tool usage.\"\n\nBalancing innovation with responsible AI is also crucial, particularly regarding data privacy, bias, and transparency, Rao acknowledges. Databricks, he adds, excels in governance, with its Unity Catalog ensuring strict security across data and models.\n\nHe elaborates that while bias is application-specific and difficult to automate, Databricks offers filtering tools that allow companies to manage inputs and outputs, ensuring privacy, safety, and content moderation. However, these tools are designed to be flexible and customizable to suit various customer needs.\n\nDo we need a Chief AI Officer?\n\nGiven the complexity of the field, do enterprises need a Chief AI Officer? Especially, given that many large organisations already have senior executive roles like that of a chief information officer (CIO), chief technology officer (CTO), chief data officer, chief digital officer, and even a chief marketing officer (CMO), who oversee a lot of AI functions.\n\nAlso Read: TCS boss Krithivasan is unafraid of GenAI but unwilling to say the worst is past\n\nRao agrees, pointing out that companies reacted to the AI boom by rushing to integrate AI and hiring for this role without clear boundaries, leading to conflicts over budgets and responsibilities. According to him, a more practical solution may be combining data and AI into a Chief Data and AI Officer role, separating these duties from the broader productivity-focused role of a CIO.\n\nLast, but not the least, Rao says that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often misinterpreted. Some define it by how much human productivity it can replace, but true AGI would need to interact with the world, learn from its actions, and adapt\u2014something far beyond the current technology, he explains. He suggests that while AGI remains a distant goal, companies should focus on how AI can improve business processes and customer experiences today."

        "article_content": "A pair of paranormal investigators have shared five key signs your home might be haunted.\n\nOkay, yeah, not all of us believe in ghosts and spirits, or even just the paranormal in general - but there\u2019s a whole load of people who truly do and let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019ve all had that weird kind of feeling that we\u2019re being watched or that we\u2019re not really alone.\n\nYou know, the creepy chill there\u2019s something unexplained happening.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd LADbible spoke to Help! My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris about what we can look out for around the house that could mean we\u2019re the subject of a \u2018classic haunting\u2019.\n\nBarri Ghai and Jayne Harris on Help! My House is Haunted (Discovery+)\n\nTemperature Changes\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai explains this is a \u2018common\u2019 sign or symptom of a haunting.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cPeople have inexplicable cold spots around their home, regardless of how much heating is on or whether doors and windows are closed,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe Unexplained\n\nHistorian and psychologist Harris advises keeping an ear and an eye out for the little unexplained things in your home.\n\nTypically, we all know which floorboards or steps in our home creek when we step on them, so if you hear that squeak while you\u2019re not there, \u2018you know that is unexplained, you know there\u2019s something there\u2019.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cGo with your gut instinct,\u201d she says. \u201cLook out for the little things. Often people will find things go missing or things move, and they will find them in places where they know they\u2019ve looked.\u201d\n\nGhai says to watch out for temperature changes (Discovery+)\n\nThe Feeling of Being Watched\n\n\u201cSometimes people walk around their own homes,\u201d Ghai says. \u201cEven though it\u2019s their stuff, they feel like they\u2019re trespassing. And then they feel that they have eyes on them.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nIn this case, he says to trust yourself because \u2018the human body is the best paranormal detector\u2019.\n\nCorner of the Eye Spots\n\nSimilarly, Harris says while we are \u2018very perceptive\u2019, we\u2019ll often just \u2018try and explain things away\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re sat watching the TV one night, and you think you've just seen someone walk past the door, a lot of people would just be like \u2018it\u2019s nothing\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut if it happens again on a separate occasion, it could be something.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cTrust yourself, trust your instincts. You know your house, you know when things don't feel quite right.\u201d\n\nHarris advises to try and be logical (Discovery+)\n\nAnomalous Sounds\n\nGhai says this one crops \u2018up time and time again\u2019 in cases he sees where people hear everything from \u2018whispering and chatting to actual spoken words\u2019.\n\n\u201cOr in the more sinister cases, someone whose voice is familiar to you,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s that mimicking sound - so your mum calling your name, but your mum's not there.\n\n\u201cThat kind of thing that happens a lot.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s a haunting\n\nWhile all of these can be classed as key signs of a haunting by the pros, obviously, you do need to rationalise as Harris says you shouldn\u2019t just \u2018assume\u2019 that\u2019s what it means.\n\n\u201cCheck for the logical things,\u201d she advises, urging to double check that windows are closed and the radiator\u2019s working if you get those cold spots.\n\n\u201cBecause it's only when you rule out all of those logical explanations that you're left with potentially a paranormal case,\u201d Harris adds.\n\nBut she does warn that once you\u2019re properly suspicious there is something in your house you should get \u2018professional advice\u2019.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and communicate with whatever you think might be there if you're not experienced in doing it, because it can make things worse,\u201d she warns.\n\nSpooky.\n\nSeries six of Help! My House is Haunted airs on Really, Fridays at 9pm. It\u2019s also available to stream on Discovery+."

Instead of reporting the death, she put the body in the cupboard and illegally collected her \u00a32-a-week allowance after telling people Harvey had moved to a home in Llandudno.\n\nAdvert\n\nTracy Jones revealed some of the eerie things that happened there (YouTube/Paranormal Investigation UK)\n\nIt was later found by pathologists that she died from strangulation, due to a ligature mark caused by a stocking found as the cause of death.\n\nHarvey wasn't charged for murder, instead being sentenced to 15 months behind bars after being charged with obtaining money by deception between May 1940 and April 1960.\n\nShe moved to a home after being released and died shortly after.\n\nAdvert\n\nParanormal Investigations UK visited the address decades later, when a man who lived there fled after finding out the truth.\n\nThe man's sister, Tracy Jones, bought the home in 1990 and rented it to him before moving in herself, explaining: \"My older brother moved out - as far as I'm aware - because he found out about the mummy in the cupboard and he was scared.\n\n\"At the time, it made the house famous and they used to bring day trippers back and forth,\" she added.\n\nFormer police officer Raymond Vaughn said that he will never forget the discovery (Youtube/Paranormal Investigation UK)\n\nAdvert\n\nTracy's daughter, Cally, said that she thought the property was haunted by Knight, explaining: \"You sometimes hear her coming along the landing, she's quite heavy-footed. Things go missing around the house and she sometimes likes playing with your hairdryer and electrical goods.\"\n\nRetired police officer Raymond Vaughn, who led the case at the time, spoke to UK Horizons about what happened, saying: \"The case was the most unusual case anybody including pathologies, all the police had ever encountered.\n\n\"It was the first mummified body I had ever seen and I shall remember it for as long as I live,\" he hauntingly admitted."

        "article_content": "BATU GAJAH, Sept 23 \u2014 The aura of mystery surrounding the century-old Kellie\u2019s Castle is heightened by countless stories of paranormal entities supposedly \u2018inhabiting\u2019 the mansion.\n\nIt is said that one such \u2018resident ghost\u2019 is that of a certain \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019, a washerman from South India who was disappointed his employer did not send him back to his homeland as promised.\n\nAccording to Kellie\u2019s Castle Tourist Complex managing director Zamari Muhyi \u2013 who has personally not experienced any paranormal incident in the mansion \u2013 \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019, apparently, had worked in the laundry area of the mansion and was disheartened when his employer and Kellie\u2019s Castle owner William Kellie Smith broke his promise to send him back to India where his wife was awaiting his return.\n\nZamari said this information came to light during a programme to unravel the mystery of Kellie\u2019s Castle organised by its management in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was one of the participants (of the programme) suddenly found himself temporarily possessed by what seemed to be a spirit... I was also present when this particular participant suddenly spoke in English and introduced himself as \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 and told us \u2018his\u2019 story,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the truth of this story and the existence of \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 cannot be verified, the old uncompleted mansion\u2019s environment alone is enough to send shivers down the spine of faint-hearted visitors.\n\nThe construction of Kellie\u2019s Castle, also known as Kellas House, started in 1915, initiated by its owner (William Kellie Smith), a civil engineer from Scotland who came to Malaya to venture into the rubber planting and tin-mining industries.\n\nHowever, Smith died of pneumonia in 1926. At that time, the construction of the mansion had only reached 70 percent completion.\n\nFollowing his demise, the construction work was suspended and the property was eventually sold to a British company Harrisons and Crosfield. It was subsequently abandoned and years later, it became a historical site.\n\nKellie\u2019s Castle manager Hakim Muhaimin shows the laundry room where \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 once worked in. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nDark tourism material\n\nThe spooky atmosphere of Kellie\u2019s Castle \u2013 sprawled over a 2.8-hectare (seven-acre) site \u2013 combined with the eerie sightings and paranormal encounters reported by visitors, make it an ideal destination for dark tourism, a tourism subsector that is gaining increasing attention globally and is expected to continue growing over the next 10 years.\n\nAccording to projections by Future Market Insights, the global dark tourism market is expected to be valued at US$31.89 billion (RM148.68 billion) by the end of this year.\n\nIt also forecasts the market will swell to US$40.82 billion (RM190.32 billion) by 2034. Zamari, who is also Perak Bumiputera Tourism Operators Association president, recognises Kellie\u2019s Castle\u2019s potential for dark tourism-themed activities, stressing the subsector has the potential to invigorate the nation\u2019s tourism industry.\n\nHe said dark tourism is a unique attraction for tourists, adding that although it has already been introduced in this country, it has however not been widely developed by the tourism industry due to certain constraints involving society and the beliefs of local communities.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over the management of Kellie\u2019s Castle in 2013, we thought about what actions or steps could be taken to elevate this location as a tourist attraction because at first glance, there was nothing much there except an old building.\n\n\u201cI then considered what strengths Kellie\u2019s Castle had that could be marketed for tourism purposes. If I focused on its history, not many people would be interested. In terms of the building itself, it mostly appeals to photography and architecture enthusiasts. Ultimately, the idea of dark tourism emerged,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he added, promoting a certain building or place as a dark tourism site is not easy. He believed that in order to offer an authentic paranormal experience at a dark tourism site, supernatural entities must truly exist and originate from the location concerned, not summoned or artificially created.\n\nNight tours\n\nHence, to market Kellie\u2019s Castle as a dark tourism destination, the management had to confirm the \u201cexistence\u201d of paranormal elements.\n\nWith this in mind, Zamari collaborated with a local media outlet in 2015 and \u201cwe successfully detected and documented the presence of an entity (inside Kellie\u2019s Castle), supported by a video recording\u201d.\n\nFollowing this, the management introduced night-time tours of the property on Fridays and Saturdays in the month of October every year.\n\n\u201cWhat we do during the tour (from 8 pm to 11.30 pm) is bring visitors in groups of eight to 16 and guide them through the castle while providing some explanations.\n\n\u201cThen, we leave two people at each specific location such as the wine cellar, laundry room, bedrooms and other areas without flashlights for 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d he said, adding some of the participants reported being \u201cdisturbed\u2019 by mysterious touches, embraces, whispers in their ears and sudden gusts of wind.\n\nZamari stressed he is not in the business of \u201cselling ghosts\u201d but rather offering visitors a unique experience of visiting a site associated with paranormal activity.\n\nHe added that efforts to market Kellie\u2019s Castle as a dark tourism product are being made to further boost the number of visitors to the mansion.\n\nWith its easy accessibility, the Kellie\u2019s Castle ruins in Perak is a popular haunt for thrill seekers and those looking for charming Instagrammable background to their OOTD. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nTourist attraction\n\nZamari, meanwhile, said the tales of paranormal activities at Kellie\u2019s Castle have even impressed the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), which also acknowledged the building\u2019s easy accessibility and the thrilling yet safe ghost-hunting tours offered by its management.\n\nHe said in 2020, PATA \u2013 which has its headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand \u2013 invited them to share their dark tourism experience involving Kellie\u2019s Castle through a virtual meeting attended by 400 delegates.\n\n\u201cAll of them were very excited to hear our stories and experiences in managing dark tourism. They asked many questions and expressed a strong interest in participating in such dark tourism explorations themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nTourism Malaysia has listed Kellie\u2019s Castle as one of the country\u2019s top two horror tourism destinations, alongside the Penang War Museum.\n\nKellie\u2019s Castle manager Hakim Muhaimin said the property is categorised as one of the five most haunted locations in Malaysia by international paranormal researchers and United States-based tourism portals.\n\nHe also said the night tours of the mansion were discontinued during and following the COVID-19 pandemic and plans are afoot to reintroduce them soon.\n\n\u201cBut this time, we plan to offer two types of dark tourism activities \u2013 night tours and sleeping in the castle.\n\n\u201cFor the sleepover in the castle, we will provide the participants with sleeping bags and other equipment,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said dark tourism involving Kellie\u2019s Castle has the potential to succeed due to the high demand for it particularly the \u2018Sleeping in the Castle\u2019 activity for which \u201cwe have already received inquiries from Singaporeans\u201d.\n\nHe also hoped the authorities would increase the number of dark tourism locations in the country to support the growth of the tourism industry and suggested that this subsector be widely promoted during Visit Malaysia Year 2025.\n\nAccording to the 2023 Tourism Malaysia Report, the country earned over RM71.3 billion from the arrival of 20.14 million tourists last year, while Vietnam\u2019s media organisation Vnexpress International ranked Malaysia as the most-visited country in Southeast Asia in 2023. \u2014 Bernama"

        "article_content": "A new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters reveals that scientists have identified a greater number of black holes in the early universe than previously thought, shedding light on the formation of these cosmic giants shortly after the Big Bang.\n\nThe research, led by astronomers from Stockholm University, utilised NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to survey faint galaxies that existed when the universe was only a few percent of its current age.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlack holes are known to play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, yet their origins remain a mystery.\n\nThe study's co-author, Alice Young, a PhD student at Stockholm University, noted that many of these early black holes appear to be more massive than expected for such an early time in cosmic history.\n\nThis suggests they either formed with significant mass or grew rapidly through accretion of surrounding material.\n\nTo investigate black hole formation mechanisms, the research team re-photographed initial observations taken by Hubble several years earlier. They measured variations in galaxy brightness\u2014indicators of black hole presence\u2014resulting in the identification of more black holes than previous methods had revealed. This is a new image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nThe findings indicate that some black holes likely formed from the collapse of massive, pristine stars during the first billion years after the Big Bang. These early stars were unique, as later generations became enriched with elements from previous stellar explosions.\n\nOther potential formation scenarios include collapsing gas clouds and mergers of stars within massive clusters. Additionally, primordial black holes may have formed through speculative mechanisms in the universe's infancy.\n\nMatthew Hayes, lead author and astronomer at Stockholm University, emphasized that understanding how early black holes formed is essential for piecing together the puzzle of galaxy evolution.\n\nWith this new data, researchers can refine models of how galaxies and their central black holes evolve together.\n\nIn tandem with these findings, astronomers are using the James Webb Space Telescope to further explore galactic black holes formed soon after the Big Bang, aiming to uncover their masses and locations in the early universe.\n\nThis ongoing research is pivotal for unraveling the mysteries surrounding black hole formation and their influence on galaxy development.\n\nPublished By: Sibu Kumar Tripathi Published On: Sep 23, 2024"

In the first eight months of 2022, the US saw 15.47 billion visitors to piracy websites .\n\nIn the first eight months of 2022, the . In 2023, software piracy was a major contributor to revenue loss for 40% of software suppliers \u2013 up from just 17% the year before.\n\nIn 2023, software piracy was \u2013 up from just 17% the year before. In 2023, as many as 33% of IT companies reported losing 6\u201310% of their revenue to software piracy, and 8% even said that the loss exceeded 30%.\n\nIllegal Software Downloads Statistics\n\nTo kick things off, we\u2019ll take a look at the numbers and figures on illegally downloaded software over the last few years.\n\nHow Much Software is Pirated\n\nOverall, software was the second-most-pirated type of media in 2023, after TV shows, making up 26.2% of the pirated items on the web that year.\n\nAnd although in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic (2017 specifically), the level of software piracy dropped from 39% to 37%, the pandemic years saw it go up again by 20-30%.\n\nMuso reports that in 2023, there have been 15.2 billion visits to software piracy websites worldwide. That figure is a 14.1% YoY increase from 8.75 billion visitors registered in the first eight months of 2022.\n\nThese eight months showed a 10% increase in software piracy compared to 2021.\n\nFrom January 2017 until November 2023, there were approximately 84.77 billion visits to software piracy websites. That\u2019s like every person on Earth visiting software piracy sites 10 times on average over this period.\n\nBSA tells us that almost 37% of all software on users\u2019 PCs is pirated. The market value of this unlicensed software is $46.3 billion.\n\nWhat Software is Pirated & How\n\nAs the following chart shows, mobile software was the most commonly pirated software in 2023, accounting for 36% of all illegal software downloads.\n\nIt was closely followed by desktop software at 30%. Moreover, it\u2019s estimated that as much as 37% of software worldwide is unlicensed.\n\nIn terms of how the software has been pirated, the 2021 Muso report states that 73.5% of it was illegally downloaded from the web and the rest from torrenting sites.\n\nThe data tells us that 100% of all illegally downloaded software was pirated through web downloads in 2022 and 2023.\n\nMost of the traffic (61.5%) was direct in 2022, but in 2023, 42% of it was via search engines when people looked for software piracy.\n\nSoftware Piracy Statistics by Region\n\nSoftware piracy is prevalent in many regions around the world. However, certain regions suffer more from it than others.\n\nAs this chart shows, piracy is particularly prevalent in China, Russia, the US, and India. Ukraine and Italy were also among the top 10 countries for piracy.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the biggest regions in the world for more details on software piracy.\n\nEMEA\n\nEurope may have robust anti-piracy laws, such as the EU Copyright Directive and the CPDA in the UK. But it nonetheless is home to significant software piracy.\n\nFor instance, the UK is among the top 20 countries for using pirated software.\n\nIn 2021, there were approximately 2.7 million British infringers of software copyrights, as you\u2019ll see in the chart below. Moreover, as many as 38% of surveyed Brits had pirated software in 2022.\n\nThe post-pandemic spike in piracy is likely due to the increasingly high cost of living in the UK.\n\nOther countries in the region have similar problems. For example, Russia accounted for over 8.5% of all software piracy worldwide in 2023.\n\nThis isn\u2019t surprising, given the international sanctions and software companies pulling out of the region due to the geopolitical situation.\n\nUkraine and Italy take the seventh and ninth spots among the top 20 countries that use pirated software.\n\nIran is another country in the EMEA region that\u2019s subject to sanctions that restrict the use of certain software, so it\u2019s not surprising that Iran ranked eighth.\n\nThe Americas\n\nIn the Americas, the US, Brazil, and Mexico are leaders in illegal software downloads, ranking among the top 20 countries for software piracy.\n\nThe US ranked third in the world in 2023 for software piracy, and this is actually an improvement. One year prior, the US was top of the list for the highest rates of software piracy.\n\nIn the first eight months of 2022 alone, the US had seen 15.47 billion visitors to piracy websites.\n\nAs for the previous years, as you can see from the graph above, the US and Brazil had relatively small shares of visitors to software piracy sites.\n\nThe largest shares in that time period (2020\u20132021) were held by Russia (7.2% to 8.02%) and China (see below).\n\nAPAC\n\nAccording to BSA, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region has the highest rate of software piracy in the world \u2013 61%. Given the number of APAC countries in the top 20 countries for software piracy, this isn\u2019t surprising.\n\nTake China, for example. In 2021, China had the highest number of visitors to software piracy websites in the world. In Q3 of 2021 alone, China had 467 million people visiting software piracy websites.\n\nThe figure made up 14.6% of all software privacy site visitors in the world that quarter (3.2 billion).\n\nHowever, in 2022, India shortly overtook China, becoming the third country for piracy rates, after the USA and Russia.\n\nHowever, according to Revenera, as of 2023, the PRC (excluding Hong Kong) is once again the leader in software piracy worldwide.\n\nOther APAC countries in the top 20 are Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, and Australia. Regarding Australia in particular, BSA reports that 20% of Aussies use pirated software.\n\nImpact of Software Piracy on the Market\n\nIn 2023, software piracy was a major cause of revenue loss for 40% of software suppliers \u2013 up from just 17% the year before.\n\nThis significant increase is a testament to the huge adverse impact of software piracy on the market. In 2023, as many as 33% of IT companies reported losing 6\u201310% of their revenue to software piracy.\n\n8% even said that the loss exceeded 30% of revenue. Moreover, 15% of companies don\u2019t even know how much they\u2019re losing to piracy.\n\nIn addition to financial impacts, software piracy can adversely impact a brand\u2019s reputation. In many cases, pirated software isn\u2019t subject to quality control and can have a negative impact on user experience.\n\nMoreover, in 2022, as many as 50% of people who downloaded pirated content, including software, reported malware infecting their devices.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that software is a type of creative work, and pirating it is just as harmful to creators as pirating music or books.\n\nIn practice, this erosion of IP stifles programmers\u2019 creativity and harms their competitive advantage and revenue.\n\nAddressing Software Piracy\n\nThe issue of software privacy is complex, and combating it requires a multifaceted approach. The stakeholders involved are legislators, technical experts, and educators, to name a few.\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll go over the building blocks of combating software piracy, including legislative and technical measures.\n\nLaws & Regulations\n\nSeveral international laws, such as the Berne Convention and the TRIPS agreement, standardize protection against any sort of piracy, including software.\n\nMany countries have adopted their own laws on a local level, such as the Digital Economy Act in the UK.\n\nHowever, the enforcement of such laws, on both a local and global scale, depends on the police\u2019s capacity and international cooperation.\n\nIn addition to the legislation, there are a lot of case law and lawsuits illustrating the impact of software piracy. For instance:\n\nBITMANAGEMENT SOFTWARE GMBH vs. The United States (2016\u20132022), which saw the US Navy pay out almost $155,000 for the illegal use of 3D modeling software.\n\nBITMANAGEMENT SOFTWARE GMBH vs. The United States (2016\u20132022), which saw the US Navy pay out almost $155,000 for the illegal use of 3D modeling software. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot vs. J. Doe (2022\u2013 present), where developers sued Microsoft and OpenAI for allegedly pirating the developers\u2019 software to train AI systems. The case is still undecided.\n\nThese cases, as well as others, prove the adverse economic impact of software piracy. However, they also evidence the fact that the existing piracy protections aren\u2019t always sufficient.\n\nFor instance, the German software company that sued the US Navy in the 2016 case received much less than the original $155.4 million in damages it claimed.\n\nAnd a month ago, the judge in the Copilot case partially dismissed some piracy claims.\n\nTechnical Measures\n\nDigital Rights Management (DRM) tools represent an important technical measure against software piracy. Such solutions are already widely used by creators and companies to protect their IP, such as software.\n\nFor software products, DRMs can range from license activation keys and cloud verification to digital watermarking and geographical restrictions.\n\nPopular business software subscription models like SaaS are also a type of DRM in a way, as they allow users to subscribe to the software rather than own a copy of it.\n\nSuch DRM methods can be effective. But they can also be frustrating for consumers, as they\u2019re often seen as limiting fair use.\n\nWhat Does the Future of Software Piracy Look Like?\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear what will await the murky digital landscape of software piracy. Based on current trends and how rapidly piracy methods are evolving, we believe the issue will only persist.\n\nBefore new laws and anti-piracy protections catch up, we might see a few new privacy developments.\n\nNew Methods of Piracy\n\nWith the advancements and developments of DRMs like SaaS, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that software piracy methods will also advance beyond what we know today.\n\nAnd while AI can help combat these threats, we should also consider how it can assist malicious actors with new piracy approaches, such as reverse engineering.\n\nFor instance, given that SaaS is hosted on the cloud, pirates may target that infrastructure in the future to access the platforms.\n\nAchieving that would require employing social engineering and phishing to steal credentials \u2013 two tactics prevalent in cybercrime today.\n\nNew Types of Piracy\n\nIn addition to new methods of piracy, the prevalence of SaaS and other subscription models might also encourage the development of new types of piracy.\n\nIt\u2019s true that cloud-based SaaS deployment makes it challenging to download and distribute copies like traditional software pirates usually do.\n\nHowever, the shift to a subscription model can cause increased instances of unauthorized account sharing and the rise of illegal monetization of subscription credentials.\n\nTo address this potential issue, companies might have to invest in more sophisticated DRM systems. For example, they can be powered by blockchain technologies.\n\nSuch technologies would help track the usage of SaaS licenses and curb unauthorized use.\n\nEnforcement Challenges\n\nEarlier, we touched upon the challenges of international cooperation in software piracy law enforcement.\n\nThe global nature of the Internet and the cloud, economic disparities, and international sanctions worsen these challenges.\n\nFor instance, although many SaaS companies have left Russia, their software is still available thanks to the country\u2019s relaxed piracy laws.\n\nIt\u2019s, therefore, challenging for companies like Microsoft to enforce licensing restrictions in such sanctioned regions.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nSoftware piracy is a complex issue that remains prevalent today. In this guide, we reviewed the software piracy statistics around the world in recent years.\n\nWe saw that the APAC region takes the crown for software piracy, but Russia and the US aren\u2019t far behind. We also saw that software piracy adversely impacts the software market and the tech industry as a whole.\n\nAnd yet, addressing software piracy remains a significant challenge, not least due to tech advancements and ever-evolving piracy methods. Enforcement of piracy and copyright laws is also difficult in many jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, technological advancements can also help hinder malicious actors. The key is to employ them smartly and have robust enforcement frameworks in place.\n\nSources"
