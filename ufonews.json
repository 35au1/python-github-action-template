        "article_content": "Alien Corridors - The Falkirk Triangle - Tony McMahon - expert - from episode HANDOUT\n\nBonnybridge, a serene Scottish village, has catapulted to fame as one of the globe's leading UFO hotspots, boasting some 300 sightings each year\u2014notably outpacing well-known extraterrestrial haunts like Area 51 or Roswell. Nestled within what's been aptly named the Falkirk Triangle and often referred to as Scotland's own Roswell, this location is awash with eerie tales from alien abductions to bizarre spacecraft sightings, fuelling talk that it could be a portal to another dimension. UFO aficionados and even government entities have been drawn in by the growing conspiracy theories, with calls for action reaching the ears of four Prime Ministers. One particular chilling episode from 1992 saw buddies Garry Wood and Colin Wright alleging a harrowing captivity by aliens aboard a space vessel as they journeyed near Tarbrax in South Lanarkshire. Around 10pm, they witnessed an ominous \"black\" object suspended in the skies, uniquely unlit yet distinct with a round base and trio of segments measuring some 30ft across. \"I have been doing this job for 45 years. I honestly believe that somewhere in the skies of this planet we are dealing with non-human intelligence,\" claims Malcolm Robinson, a seasoned UFO investigator, who further contends that agencies such as NASA, the American government, and the Pentagon are all delving into these otherworldly encounters. These baffling events are given centre stage in a novel documentary series broadcast on Blaze, where specialists globally endeavour to fathom the extraordinary concentration of UFO activity within the so-called Falkirk Triangle, positioned over the Scottish cities of Falkirk, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, reports the Mirror. The friends reportedly blacked out for what they believe was 10-15 seconds, only to regain consciousness with their car facing the opposite direction and an hour of time inexplicably lost. The incident, which has since been dubbed the \"A70 incident\", is documented in a two-page report found within secret government \"X-files\" and was sent to the Ministry of Defence's UFO desk in 1996, four years after the encounter took place.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle\n\nThe report, titled \"Unexplained Aerial Sighting,\" is based on evidence provided by Mr Wood, who at the time was a 33-year-old ambulance technician from Edinburgh. Malcolm Robinson, a paranormal investigator, stated: \"Days after the incident, both men found scars on their bodies that weren't there before. Their wives refused to believe them, their colleagues at work refused to believe them.\" After researching paranormal experiences in the local library, they contacted Malcolm, who suggested they undergo hypnosis - the results were astonishing. Recalling the incident in 1996, Garry said: \"I saw three creatures coming towards my car. I felt intense pain, like an electric shock. Then I was in some room. I saw these things like wee men moving about, doing something to me. I could only see up. Then this 6ft creature approached.\" He described the creature as being \"white-grey in colour with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. There were either ribs or folds of skin on its body. The arms were like ours, but there were four very long fingers.\" During the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle, sparking a public frenzy. Enormous meetings were convened as locals and UFO witnesses packed out venues, clamouring for explanations. Local councillor Billy Buchanan and Malcolm Robinson tirelessly campaigned for a parliamentary probe, knocking on Downing Street's door four times to present their case to John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Rishi Sunak, all without success. \"We are demanding that the British government open up an inquiry into UFO sightings in Scotland,\" insists Malcolm.\n\nCrop circle's are believed to be imprints from aliens\n\n\"We are happy to turn over our files and photographs. But I doubt anything will happen, they are too stuck in their ways.\" \"They say that as these objects do not pose any threat to the security of the UK, the British Government will not open up any enquiries.\" In a chilling encounter from 1979, WWII veteran Bob Taylor, who participated in the liberation of Bergen Belsen, ventured into Dechmont Law woods in search of stray livestock. There, he stumbled upon a 'flying dome', a large sphere hovering just above the ground, dark and metallic with a sandpaper-like texture and equipped with small propellers. From this daunting object, smaller spheres dropped and rolled towards him, dragging him inexorably towards the enigmatic craft. Bob's last memory was of a peculiar burning smell and a swishing noise before everything turned pitch black. When he regained consciousness, he found himself unable to drive and decided to walk back to his home in Livingston. Upon reaching home, he broke down and told his wife about the attack he had suffered. Bob appeared dishevelled and beaten, with his trousers completely torn.\n\nTrending\n\nThe authorities who arrived at the scene noted indentations on the ground. The investigation concluded that Bob had been subjected to an unusually brutal attack, but it remained unclear by whom or what. The police eventually categorised it as an assault by an unidentified person or persons, putting the report on hold until more evidence could be gathered. Some experts speculated that Bob might have been struck by lightning or experienced a seizure. Throughout the investigations, Bob, described as an honest and reliable man of good character, stuck to his story until his death in 2007. Historian Tony McMahon, who has been researching the sightings, questions why witnesses would expose themselves to ridicule unless they genuinely believed they had encountered extraterrestrials. \"Those involved were seen as reputable figures, not as flakes,\" he says. \"These were completely normal people who had this absolutely bizarre experience.\" \"I think the fact that it has recurred in that area is fascinating.\" \"In the case of the Falkirk Triangle we are dealing with people who are seen as pillars of the community and what happened to them was quite traumatic.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nA small town with over 300 sightings and fearful locals\n\n\"You can't see an upside to making it up. I think these people genuinely believed that they saw what they reported.\" The mystifying Falkirk Triangle has been touted as one of Britain's UFO hotspots, with some claiming that the veil between worlds is especially thin there, offering a gateway to other dimensions. Others postulate the presence of an interstellar pathway threading through the area, positioning it as a prime cosmic rest stop. While archaeologist Natasha Billson views such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, she can't help but note the correlation between UFO sightings and areas rich in archaeological heritage. \"When it comes to UFO sightings a lot of them are near to archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge,\" she observes. Moreover, Scotland hosts the most extensive network of stone circles across the British Isles. In contrast, Tony McMahon draws our attention to the triangle's proximity to two military air bases, less than 50 miles away, and its nearness to major airports like Glasgow and Edinburgh. He suggestively points out: \"There are two ways of looking at that. One is that what is happening on those military sites is misconstrued as UFO activity, everything from weather balloons to flares - even to cutting edge technology that the Government would rather you didn't know about. There is a perfectly good case to be made for that.\"\n\nNatasha Billson is sceptical\n\n\"Equally, there is an argument that if we are being watched by aliens, by extraterrestrials, there is every reason to suspect that they would take a particular interest in military installations.\" \"Some people say maybe they are taking an interest in military installations because they want to knock us out, invade, colonise us. But there is another argument put forward that they are taking an interest because they are protecting us from ourselves.\" \"There's even an argument that alien technology has been shared with us, but the aliens won't share any more, because we keep misusing it against each other. Somebody wrote that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the aliens decided that was more than enough.\""

        "article_content": "Pixel Studio: Everything you need to know\n\nGoogle's newest phones, the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, come with new exclusive AI features. Some people think they're fun or useful, while others think we're entering the era of AI bloatware. An AI image generation app called Pixel Studio is one of those new features. It doesn't compete with popular AI image generators like Midjourney, but it's free and on your phone, so it's worth checking out.\n\nIf you own one of the best Pixel phones, Pixel Studio can be a fun tool to create AI-generated art. If you're beginning to learn how to prompt AI, you might feel frustrated when your prompt fails to produce what you intended. We cover how to use Pixel Studio and a basic primer on good prompting techniques. The app is currently available in limited countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India, Ireland, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\nPixel Studio uses both on-device and cloud-based AI models\n\nPixel Studio is a standalone text-to-image app that offers on-device AI image generation and editing. It uses a text-to-image AI model running on the Tensor G4 processor and Google's cloud-based Imagen 3 image generation model. It requires an internet connection.\n\nYou're prompted to download the Pixel Studio AI model when you first open the app. This download can take some time, depending on your internet speed.\n\nImagen 3 is Google's newest and highest-quality text-to-image model, an improvement over Imagen 2. The model generates images with better detail and lighting while reducing most of the noticeable AI artifacts in previous versions. It generates relatively good photorealistic images and handles in-image text effectively.\n\nPixel Studio is still working on the ability to create and edit human images, even though it uses Imagen 3. Like Adobe's Firefly, there are heavy filters and restrictions. It may block some of your images from being generated even if there's nothing remotely suggestive in your prompt that is against the prohibited use policy. In those cases, the best you can do is adjust your prompt.\n\nHow to start creating AI images in Pixel Studio\n\nIt's fast and easy to create AI images in Pixel Studio. The style gallery lets you generate your images in a specific visual style, such as 3D, Sketch, or Anime. The AI image editing tools are limited to moving or erasing objects in a generated image or images you import from your photo gallery. You can change the look of your image by adding text and stickers.\n\nPixel Studio\n\nGoogle LLC\n\nTOOLS\n\nPrice: Free\n\n3\n\nDownload\n\nTo generate your image in Pixel Studio\n\nOpen your app launcher and open the Pixel Studio app. Tap Download to download the Pixel AI image generation model. To generate an image, tap Create at the bottom of the screen. Describe what you want in your image, and then tap the checkmark. Tap the Create button to start generating AI images Enter a description of the image and tap the checkmark Close If you're unsatisfied with the image, tap the regenerate icon in the lower-left corner. Tap the regenerate button to create a new image based on the current prompt Close To change the art style, tap the style icon to the right of the Regenerate icon. This displays a list of styles such as 3D Cartoon, Sketch, and Anime. Tap a style for your image, and then tap Done. Tap the art style icon to change the artistic style of the image Choose an artistic style for your image Close To save your image, tap the Save icon in the upper-right corner. The image is stored in a new folder in your gallery called Pixel Studio. Your projects are also saved in the Pixel Studio app. Tap the folder icon in the upper-left corner to access your images. Tap save to store your image on your device A list of saved projects in Pixel Studio Close\n\nTo edit your image in Pixel Studio\n\nTap Stickers and tools at the bottom of the screen to edit parts of your image. Select a part of the image by tapping a subject or object in the image. The AI attempts to make a selection. Draw an outline around the part of the image you want to edit. You can also brush over the area with your finger. Tap the Erase button to remove that part of the image, or tap and drag to move it. Tap the Make sticker button to create a sticker out of your selection. Select the stickers and tools button to add elements to the image Select an area of the image to remove or move it Close You can add stickers and captions to AI-generated and existing images in your photo gallery. Tap the Add caption button or the Add sticker button at the bottom of the screen. Select a sticker to add to your image Add a caption to the generated image Close Tap the photo icon in the lower-left corner of the Pixel Studio home screen to edit existing photos in your gallery. Select the gallery icon to make changes to your images Close\n\nPrompting primer for AI image generation\n\nMainstream AI image generators like Pixel Studio are trained to understand natural language descriptions in their prompts. Although they have improved in a short time, an understanding of basic prompt components can be helpful.\n\nFoundational elements of a prompt\n\nFoundational aspects of a good prompt include descriptions of the Subject, the Action the subject is doing, the Environment the subject is in, and the Style of the image. This isn't a hard-and-fast rule. Instead, it's a good starting point when learning how to prompt.\n\nPart of the fun of prompting an image generator can be deliberately breaking this structure or leaving one of these foundational elements for the AI to decide. Familiarizing yourself with these elements helps you see how changes to those four components can affect the final image.\n\nSubject: The subject is the primary focus of the image you want to create. It can be a person, an animal, or an object. For example, let's use a cat as our subject.\n\nAction: The action refers to what the subject is doing in the image. Our cat could be sitting on a shelf, lying in the sun, playing with a ball of yarn, or performing another activity. Let's have our cat sitting on the table in this prompt.\n\nEnvironment: The environment is the setting where the subject performs the action. Our cat could be in the living room, a kitchen, or anywhere that you might find a surface a cat can lie down on. Let's keep things simple and place our cat sitting on a table in the kitchen.\n\nStyle: Visual styles like a cartoon, 3D render, anime, or flat art can be included in your prompt, even when you select a style from the style menu. You can combine styles, such as an oil painting, digital 3D art, or a paper cutout in an anime style. For this example, let's create the image in a cute cartoon style, or you can choose a preset style in the app.\n\nBasic image prompt example\n\nThis provides a foundational prompt: A cat sitting on the table in the kitchen in a cute cartoon style. While it may not sound interesting, these are the foundational elements. You can elaborate on them by describing the cat's appearance, adding environmental details like lighting or other objects, or describing the composition you want in the image.\n\nLet's elaborate on our foundational prompt: A black cat with fluffy fur sits on the table in a retro 50s-style kitchen, drawn in a cute cartoon style. The kitchen has natural light streaming in through the windows. The refrigerator, chairs, and cabinet are turquoise, while the stove and table are off-white. This gives each foundational element a unique description.\n\nWhen generating images with AI, the result may differ from what you describe, even with a good prompt. You can either generate more versions or adjust the wording to refine it.\n\nWe encourage you to start with a simple prompt like this and change one part of the description at a time to see how it affects the generated image. Swap out the black cat for an orange one, change the environment to a living room with a windowsill, or generate the image in a new visual style. Doing one thing at a time can teach you a lot. Have fun prompting.\n\nPixel Studio will improve over time\n\nThis is only the beginning for Pixel Studio. AI image generation has been improving so fast it's hard to keep up. Pixel Studio is fun, even though it isn't a powerhouse like Midjourney. For now, it seems to be marketed towards casual users. One thing for sure is that AI is going to be a big part of our future, so keep an eye out for our helpful prompting tips to make the most of it."

        "article_content": "The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.The U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.Huawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei\u2019s AI efforts would likely be denied.TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.Reuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.The latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.As a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.The Commerce Department declined comment.A spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a \u201dlaw-abiding company\u2026committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.\u201dThe Commerce Department communication \u2014 known as an \u201dis informed\u201d letter \u2014 allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.Ijiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.The action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department\u2019s enforcement of them.In 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.The restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.The U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department\u2019s restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.But despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued."

The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond, according to newspaper reports from that time.\n\nThe Lindenmuths traveled about two hours from Ambler with other family members, to participate in the festival, which drew hundreds of people to Main Street. Most were decked out in fluorescent green, some with extra eyes or antennae sprouting from their heads.\n\nSome of those attending were simply out for an afternoon of fun with family, while others are true believers in UFOs and other supernatural phenomena.\n\nAdrian and Maria Johnson, of Kingston, were among the latter. Both are familiar with the history of UFO sightings, including the Roswell incident in 1947, which many believe was the crashing of a UFO near the town in New Mexico.\n\nAdrian Johnson pointed out President Harry Truman addressed the possibility of UFOs with reporters in the early 1950s.\n\n\u201cWe believe,\u201d said Maria Johnson.\n\nSasha Podunajec, of Waymart, attended the event with her mother Diane Gallagher, Moscow; and son Rowan, age 3.\n\nGallagher said the event was a great opportunity for Carbondale to celebrate its history and host a robust community event.\n\nCandace and Thomas Deblasio moved to the area recently and heard about the event at a senior presentation last week.\n\nThe two went \u201call out,\u201d with Thomas decked in a green inflatable costume and Candace in shimmering silver and slanted glasses.\n\n\u201cThese weren\u2019t our Halloween costumes; we bought them especially for today,\u201d Candace Deblasio said, laughing.\n\nChana Manarchuck was part of the committee that organized the event and said it exceeded expectations of planners.\n\n\u201cI think we should have it every year,\u201d she said. \u201cMy motto is \u2018bloom where you\u2019re planted.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTodd Pousley, of NeighborWorks, said the event provided the chance to chat with residents and visitors about their vision for Carbondale.\n\nIt was also an opportunity to encourage people to complete a survey aimed at documenting their suggestions for Carbondale for future projects.\n\nBradford May, part of the event committee, said the event exceeded expectations.\n\nOriginally, when the event was scheduled for Nov. 9, there was a question about whether cold weather might interfere with attendees\u2019 enjoyment of the day.\n\nBut moderate temperatures and clear skies were the perfect setting for vendors who offered everything from good food to home goods and information.\n\nThe day included an immersive \u201cThe Russell Park Experience,\u201d with transportation to the park, which was sold out early in the day, as well as a citywide scavenger hunt and special speakers.\n\nIt concluded with an after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite featuring \u201cParanormal State\u201d star Heather Taddy."

        "article_content": "Alien Corridors - The Falkirk Triangle - Tony McMahon - expert - from episode HANDOUT\n\nBonnybridge, a serene Scottish village, has catapulted to fame as one of the globe's leading UFO hotspots, boasting some 300 sightings each year\u2014notably outpacing well-known extraterrestrial haunts like Area 51 or Roswell. Nestled within what's been aptly named the Falkirk Triangle and often referred to as Scotland's own Roswell, this location is awash with eerie tales from alien abductions to bizarre spacecraft sightings, fuelling talk that it could be a portal to another dimension. UFO aficionados and even government entities have been drawn in by the growing conspiracy theories, with calls for action reaching the ears of four Prime Ministers. One particular chilling episode from 1992 saw buddies Garry Wood and Colin Wright alleging a harrowing captivity by aliens aboard a space vessel as they journeyed near Tarbrax in South Lanarkshire. Around 10pm, they witnessed an ominous \"black\" object suspended in the skies, uniquely unlit yet distinct with a round base and trio of segments measuring some 30ft across. \"I have been doing this job for 45 years. I honestly believe that somewhere in the skies of this planet we are dealing with non-human intelligence,\" claims Malcolm Robinson, a seasoned UFO investigator, who further contends that agencies such as NASA, the American government, and the Pentagon are all delving into these otherworldly encounters. These baffling events are given centre stage in a novel documentary series broadcast on Blaze, where specialists globally endeavour to fathom the extraordinary concentration of UFO activity within the so-called Falkirk Triangle, positioned over the Scottish cities of Falkirk, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, reports the Mirror. The friends reportedly blacked out for what they believe was 10-15 seconds, only to regain consciousness with their car facing the opposite direction and an hour of time inexplicably lost. The incident, which has since been dubbed the \"A70 incident\", is documented in a two-page report found within secret government \"X-files\" and was sent to the Ministry of Defence's UFO desk in 1996, four years after the encounter took place.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle\n\nThe report, titled \"Unexplained Aerial Sighting,\" is based on evidence provided by Mr Wood, who at the time was a 33-year-old ambulance technician from Edinburgh. Malcolm Robinson, a paranormal investigator, stated: \"Days after the incident, both men found scars on their bodies that weren't there before. Their wives refused to believe them, their colleagues at work refused to believe them.\" After researching paranormal experiences in the local library, they contacted Malcolm, who suggested they undergo hypnosis - the results were astonishing. Recalling the incident in 1996, Garry said: \"I saw three creatures coming towards my car. I felt intense pain, like an electric shock. Then I was in some room. I saw these things like wee men moving about, doing something to me. I could only see up. Then this 6ft creature approached.\" He described the creature as being \"white-grey in colour with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. There were either ribs or folds of skin on its body. The arms were like ours, but there were four very long fingers.\" During the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle, sparking a public frenzy. Enormous meetings were convened as locals and UFO witnesses packed out venues, clamouring for explanations. Local councillor Billy Buchanan and Malcolm Robinson tirelessly campaigned for a parliamentary probe, knocking on Downing Street's door four times to present their case to John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Rishi Sunak, all without success. \"We are demanding that the British government open up an inquiry into UFO sightings in Scotland,\" insists Malcolm.\n\nCrop circle's are believed to be imprints from aliens\n\n\"We are happy to turn over our files and photographs. But I doubt anything will happen, they are too stuck in their ways.\" \"They say that as these objects do not pose any threat to the security of the UK, the British Government will not open up any enquiries.\" In a chilling encounter from 1979, WWII veteran Bob Taylor, who participated in the liberation of Bergen Belsen, ventured into Dechmont Law woods in search of stray livestock. There, he stumbled upon a 'flying dome', a large sphere hovering just above the ground, dark and metallic with a sandpaper-like texture and equipped with small propellers. From this daunting object, smaller spheres dropped and rolled towards him, dragging him inexorably towards the enigmatic craft. Bob's last memory was of a peculiar burning smell and a swishing noise before everything turned pitch black. When he regained consciousness, he found himself unable to drive and decided to walk back to his home in Livingston. Upon reaching home, he broke down and told his wife about the attack he had suffered. Bob appeared dishevelled and beaten, with his trousers completely torn.\n\nTrending\n\nThe authorities who arrived at the scene noted indentations on the ground. The investigation concluded that Bob had been subjected to an unusually brutal attack, but it remained unclear by whom or what. The police eventually categorised it as an assault by an unidentified person or persons, putting the report on hold until more evidence could be gathered. Some experts speculated that Bob might have been struck by lightning or experienced a seizure. Throughout the investigations, Bob, described as an honest and reliable man of good character, stuck to his story until his death in 2007. Historian Tony McMahon, who has been researching the sightings, questions why witnesses would expose themselves to ridicule unless they genuinely believed they had encountered extraterrestrials. \"Those involved were seen as reputable figures, not as flakes,\" he says. \"These were completely normal people who had this absolutely bizarre experience.\" \"I think the fact that it has recurred in that area is fascinating.\" \"In the case of the Falkirk Triangle we are dealing with people who are seen as pillars of the community and what happened to them was quite traumatic.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I think these people genuinely believed that they saw what they reported.\" The mystifying Falkirk Triangle has been touted as one of Britain's UFO hotspots, with some claiming that the veil between worlds is especially thin there, offering a gateway to other dimensions. Others postulate the presence of an interstellar pathway threading through the area, positioning it as a prime cosmic rest stop. While archaeologist Natasha Billson views such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, she can't help but note the correlation between UFO sightings and areas rich in archaeological heritage. \"When it comes to UFO sightings a lot of them are near to archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge,\" she observes. Moreover, Scotland hosts the most extensive network of stone circles across the British Isles. In contrast, Tony McMahon draws our attention to the triangle's proximity to two military air bases, less than 50 miles away, and its nearness to major airports like Glasgow and Edinburgh. He suggestively points out: \"There are two ways of looking at that. One is that what is happening on those military sites is misconstrued as UFO activity, everything from weather balloons to flares - even to cutting edge technology that the Government would rather you didn't know about. There is a perfectly good case to be made for that.\"\n\nNatasha Billson is sceptical\n\n\"Equally, there is an argument that if we are being watched by aliens, by extraterrestrials, there is every reason to suspect that they would take a particular interest in military installations.\" \"Some people say maybe they are taking an interest in military installations because they want to knock us out, invade, colonise us. But there is another argument put forward that they are taking an interest because they are protecting us from ourselves.\" \"There's even an argument that alien technology has been shared with us, but the aliens won't share any more, because we keep misusing it against each other. Somebody wrote that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the aliens decided that was more than enough.\""

AP\n\nDeFeo, then 23, was a heavy drug user known as \u201cButch.\u201d Over the years he blamed everything from voices in his head, to hired killers, to his own sister, for the massacre.\n\nHe was sentenced to six terms of 25 years to life for killing his parents, Ronald and Louise; his two sisters, Dawn, 18, and Alison 13; and his two brothers, Marc, 12, and John, 9.\n\nHe was never paroled. In 2021, at the age of 69, he died in Albany Medical Center, close to the Sullivan Correctional Facility in upstate Fallsburg, where he was imprisoned. His cause of death was never made public.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of DeFeo\u2019s macabre tour de force, the stain of the crime is something that little Amityville, pop. 9,500, just can\u2019t shake, try as it might.\n\nLaura DiDio was on an internship as a trainee reporter at the Long Island Press and got the exclusive story on a crime that stunned the village \u2014 and the world.\n\n\u201cNew York in the mid-1970s was no stranger to murder but Amityville certainly was,\u201d she told The Post.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this upscale, largely middle-class neighborhood and they hadn\u2019t had a murder in maybe 50 or 60 years. Local men had died fighting in the Korean War and Vietnam but there had never been anything like this.\u201d\n\nThe legend really took root about a year after the murders.\n\n5 Coroner office employees remove one of the bodies from the home. Bettmann Archive\n\nIn December 1975, during DeFeo\u2019s trial, the three-story home was purchased by newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz for $80,000. They moved from Brooklyn with Kathy\u2019s three children, Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and 5-year-old Melissa, known as \u201cMissy.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Lutzes claimed to have experienced a range of paranormal phenomena, including slime oozing from walls, sudden temperature drops and strange noises and odors.\n\nGeorge said he was waking at 3:15 a.m. each day \u2014 the same time DeFeo started his killing spree \u2013 while Kathy claimed to have levitated above her bed, according to a best-selling book based on the Lutzes\u2019 experience, 1977\u2019s \u201cThe Amityville Horror: A True Story.\u201d\n\n5 The family that moved in after the murders alleged that they experienced haunting and supernatural phenomena. AP\n\nThe kids all began sleeping on their stomachs, the same position DeFeo\u2019s victims were found in, while Missy claimed to have a new friend: a demonic pig called \u201cJodie.\u201d\n\nWhen a local Catholic priest, Father Ralph J. Pecoraro, arrived to bless the house, he fled, insisting he heard a voice telling him to \u201cGet out,\u201d George told reporters at the time.\n\nJust 28 days after they moved in, the Lutzes fled, their stay so short they didn\u2019t make a single payment on the $60,000 mortgage.\n\nStart your day with all you need to know Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

Check out more newsletters\n\nThe Lutzes\u2019 story was a gift for fans of the supernatural.\n\nTwo years after the publication of the book, the movie was released, the first of a long-running franchise now exceeding 20 films.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story that just won\u2019t go away,\u201d said DiDio, who co-produced a 2012 documentary called, \u201cMy Amityville Horror.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a brand. In fact, Amityville is more like a cottage industry.\u201d\n\nAlexandra Holzer is a paranormal investigator and the daughter of Dr. Hans Holzer, the parapsychologist who examined the house in the wake of the events in the 1970s. He concluded that the house itself was not haunted but the land on which it was built probably was.\n\n5 The crime sparked a franchise that began with the film \u201cThe Amityville Horror.\u201d Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\n\u201cMy father believed that DeFeo Jr. may have been possessed by an old American Indian chief and that unscrupulous property developers had built the house on a sacred Indian burial site,\u201d explains Holzer.\n\n\u201cHe thought that all the disturbances in that house stem from this little-known fact.\u201d\n\nIn the years since the murders, the book and the films, hordes of visitors, eager to see just what the fuss was all about, come to see what was dubbed, \u201cthe most haunted house in the world.\u201d\n\nThe crowds, whom DiDio said would sometimes sail up the creek to spy on the home from the rear, included another creepy visitor in 1984.\n\nRicky Kasso, a devil-worshipping, drug-taking teenager from Northport, Long Island, often visited the house. He butchered his 17-year-old friend Gary Lauwers, stabbing him over 30 times, in their hometown on June 19, 1984, only to hang himself before trial.\n\nSince the Amityville murders in 1974, the 3,600-square foot property on Ocean Avenue has changed hands many times, with one set of owners, Jim and Barbara Cromarty, even changing the address to throw off the curious.\n\nOther owners changed the house\u2019s distinct upper floor eye-windows \u2014 a signature of its spookiness \u2014 to square ones; fixed up the boathouse; added a sunroom; renovated the kitchen and finished the basement. None reported being haunted.\n\n5 Some neighbors put up Halloween decorations playfully referencing the \u201chorror.\u201d J.C. Rice\n\nIn 2000 The Amityville Record revisited the house, describing life on Ocean Avenue as \u201cfairly routine,\u201d apart from the \u201cregular visits by the curious and believers in the supernatural,\u201d adding that mostly \u201cit is just another house in Amityville with nothing more than a horrific history.\u201d\n\nLast week, when The Post visited the burg, some neighbors had even put up Halloween decorations playfully referencing the \u201chorror.\u201d\n\nThe property last sold for just $605,000 in 2017 but is now estimated to be worth $1,137,300, according to Zillow.\n\nThe current owners of the property declined to comment, as did the late Lutzes\u2019 surviving children, the mayor of Amityville, and the local church.\n\n\u201cTowns often like to bury these types of happenings \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 as it\u2019s not good for business,\u201d says Holzer.\n\nBut it never stays buried for long.\n\n\u201cYou will never be able to really quell that desire of interest because that is the very definition of our human nature,\u201d she added."

        "article_content": "In addition to innovation in the analytical methods and laboratory equipment used for HTS, significant advances have also occurred in the software arena, most notably the integration of AI and ML for data analysis and improvements in cloud-based platforms for collaborative research.\n\nIn addition to advances in automation, innovation in miniaturization technologies is helping to improve HTS performance. \u201cBy shrinking assay volumes, miniaturized platforms like microfluidics and nanodispensing have allowed for higher throughput while reducing reagent consumption,\u201d Mahale remarks. Access to smaller-volume assays, he says, is especially useful in fragment-based drug discovery and the screening of complex biological samples, as it allows for cost-effective experiments with even larger libraries.\n\nMore specifically, automation accelerates workflows by allowing researchers to complete multiple tasks at once. \u201cThis kind of parallelization is especially helpful for processes like catalyst screening, ligand screening, or solvent selection. Automation also allows chemists to conduct experiments in high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, which are difficult to complete manually. With these features, automation makes experimentation in the lab more targeted and efficient, saving valuable time, energy, and cost,\u201d Schmidt notes.\n\nBy automating process development tasks, researchers can significantly accelerate the identification of optimal synthetic pathways and fine-tune processes for maximum efficiency, according to Schmidt. \u201cThis translates to faster development times, reduced errors, and more consistent API production. For drug developers, this means reduced risk and uncertainty in API development, enabling a greater focus on clinical trials and regulatory approvals,\u201d he contends.\n\nAutomated liquid-handling robots, says Mahale, have become faster, more accurate, and capable of working with extremely low volumes of reagents, enabling more cost-effective screening. \u201cAdvances in pipetting precision, multi-plate handling, and integration with other systems (like incubators, centrifuges, and imagers) have significantly reduced human error and improved reproducibility. Automated workflows for complex cell assays and readouts based on imaging analysis, meanwhile, allow multiple assays to be performed with minimal consumable cost and keeping sustainability in mind. Use of multimode plate readers in the automation workflow also allows for multiplex assays to maximize data collection,\u201d he details.\n\nSome of the biggest advances improving and expanding HTS for drug discovery and development relate to automation and miniaturization of laboratory systems. \u201cAutomation is transforming the landscape of API development and manufacturing,\u201d Schmidt states.\n\nOverall, Alderwick summarizes, these various innovations have improved the scalability, specificity, and throughput of HTS, enabling researchers to screen more diverse compound libraries and discover novel molecular mechanisms of action.\n\nCRISPR-based functional screening, meanwhile, is employed to elucidate the biological pathways involved in disease processes, according to Alderwick. CRISPR editing of genes for knock-out and knock-in experiments have greatly advanced assay designs for cell-based phenotypic HTS approaches, he explains. In addition, by selectively tagging proteins of interest, CRISPR is advancing the understanding of target engagement and functional effects of drug treatments. \u201cBy screening small molecules alongside CRISPR-modified cells, researchers can better understand drug-target interactions at a genomic level, enabling the selection of candidates with higher precision,\u201d says Alderwick.\n\nASMS screening is increasingly used to discover small molecules that engage a specific target, says Alderwick. \u201cHighly advanced ASMS platforms that use rapid workflows to quickly generate high-quality data are getting traction as HTS methods. The platform is amenable to a broad spectrum of targets, including proteins, complexes, and oligonucleotides such as RNA, and can be a leading assay to initiate drug discovery programs,\u201d he comments. Unlike traditional label-free approaches, which are often slow, restrictive, and not optimal for large screening campaigns, Alderwick adds that new solutions such as Charles River\u2019s SAMDI ASMS platform allow efficient investigation of protein-protein interactions, TPD, molecular glues, RNA binders, etc. in a high-throughput format.\n\nOne of the key advances in HTS for drug discovery and development is the adoption of a wider array of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for this application. The most notable technologies introduced recently as high-throughput platforms include affinity selection mass spectrometry (ASMS)-based screening platforms such as self-assembled monolayer desorption ionization (SAMDI), target protein degradation (TPD), and molecular glue platforms; and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based functional screening platforms, notes Luke Alderwick, senior group leader, Discovery Sciences with Charles River.\n\nOverall, using HTS during process development can, contends Schmidt, \u201chelp in the optimization and simplification of established workflows, integration of emerging technologies such as photochemistry and electrochemistry, and leveraging of rapidly evolving computational tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\u201d\n\nDuring the early stages of candidate development, the synthetic pathway is still flexible, making HTS particularly valuable, according to Jens Schmidt, associate director of manufacturing, science, and technology at Lonza. \u201cHTS can help process development scientists rapidly evaluate the feasibility of different synthetic routes or optimal chemical combinations, such as solvents, catalysts, and bases,\u201d he explains. As the project advances through clinical phases, the flexibility in process steps decreases, but HTS remains useful for expanding the understanding of the process, such as its reaction kinetics.\n\n\u201cConsidering the vast number of technologies, each one of them serving a different purpose to address the scientific question, naturally different attributes, including binding affinities, reaction kinetics, enzymatic activity, functional activity, target engagement, selectivity, and specificity, are often analyzed. These attributes are critical because they provide early insights into the potential efficacy and selectivity of drug candidates, which is essential for optimizing pharmacological profiles,\u201d says Mahale. Given the wide range of technologies available, he also emphasizes the importance of selecting a fit-for-purpose technology to address each biological question.\n\nThe most widely used HTS technologies for identification of small-molecule API candidates include fluorescence-based, luminescence-based, and absorbance-based assays, according to Sachin Mahale, research leader, Discovery Sciences at Charles River. He adds that methods for detection of unlabeled biomolecules, such as those based on mass spectrometry, have also become more widely used at an HTS-scale in recent years, allowing the screening of compounds in both biochemical and cellular settings and thus expanding the breadth of targets to those that would otherwise be unscreenable. High-content imaging and automated electrophysiology are additional techniques providing multi-parametric cellular data that are becoming more widespread in high-throughput formats for discovery research, Mahale observes.\n\nHigh-throughput screening (HTS) enables the rapid testing of numerous compounds against biological targets. By automating and miniaturizing assays, HTS significantly accelerates the identification of potential drug candidates or optimal process conditions and can be applied throughout the entire development path of a potential drug, from discovery to process development. In the discovery phase, HTS is one of several hit-identification (Hit-ID) paradigms and involves the use of sensitive and miniaturized methods for screening large libraries of small molecules in a practical and efficient manner. During process development, HTS helps researchers rapidly establish an optimal synthetic route and conditions for each process step that reliably produce sufficient material quickly.\n\nNew AI algorithms can, observes Schmidt, analyze data from high-content screening systems, detecting complex patterns and trends that would otherwise be challenging for humans to identify. AI/ML algorithms can identify patterns and predict the activity of small-molecule candidates, even when the data are noisy or incomplete, Mahale adds. In addition to significantly speeding up the analysis of screening results and identifying promising leads faster and with higher accuracy, integration of AI into HTS processes can also improve assay optimization, he comments. Another key advantage of AI-driven HTS, according to Mahale, is its ability to adapt to new data in real time when compared to traditional HTS relying on pre-determined conditions.\n\n\u201cThese advances in AI and ML have been pivotal in accelerating drug discovery by improving both the quality of data and the efficiency of experimental processes. In the early stages of development, meanwhile, using these advanced solutions provides a holistic view that streamlines route scouting and accelerates the transition from research and development to robust manufacturing processes,\u201d Schmidt says. As an example, he points to Lonza\u2019s AI Route Scouting Service, which integrates proprietary commercial data with cutting-edge synthesis planning technology. \u201cThis innovation allows for more accurate and comprehensive analysis of cellular phenotypes, providing deeper insights into the efficacy and safety of drug candidates,\u201d he notes.\n\nCloud technology, meanwhile, has enhanced the ability to store, share, and analyze HTS data across multiple sites in real time, says Mahale. \u201cThe result is improved collaboration between research teams globally, reduced data redundancy, and increased application of machine learning models on large datasets,\u201d he explains.\n\nCombined, Mahale believes the various software innovations incorporated into HTS systems are enabling the handling of more complex datasets, improving prediction accuracy and streamlining the drug discovery pipeline.\n\nAddressing cost and complexity\n\nImplementing HTS for drug discovery and development is not a simple matter. The systems are both complex and costly. Fortunately, minimizing these issues has also been a focus of technology providers and end users.\n\nSchmidt points to significant advancements in standardization and simplification of workflows as helping to accelerate HTE experimentation timelines and reduce costs. Examples include the development of standardized protocols and data formats, which has simplified the implementation and operation of HTE assays, specifically improving their accessibility and accuracy. He also notes that software tools powered by AI have made it easier for researchers to design, execute, and analyze HTE experiments.\n\nAnother effective approach, according to Alderwick, is to leverage tailored compound libraries such as Charles River\u2019s Lead-Like Compound Library, which include compounds with lead-like properties and diversity and excludes problem chemotypes. The company\u2019s Fast-Track HTS offerings leverages this library to provide rapid hit discovery and lead identification while maintaining high-quality data outputs, he adds. \u201cWith a fixed-cost and streamlined program, this service is ideal for proof-of-concept studies and suits research groups or companies with limited funding because it allows for high-quality, early-stage screening without the need for extensive internal resources or infrastructure,\u201d Alderwick says.\n\nAlderwick also notes that modular systems in development offer the potential to customize HTS systems to the specific needs of a lab, which will further lower the initial capital investment required. \u201cAll of these advances are making HTS more cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly, reducing barriers to entry for smaller research organizations,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFurther advances needed\n\nDespite the many remarkable advances made in HTS technologies for drug discovery and process development, significant challenges impacting both the efficiency of identifying optimal small-molecule candidates and processes, and their downstream success in clinical trials, remain.\n\nOne important issue, according to Schmidt, is the need to analyze large HTE datasets that require significant computational resources. \u201cThis can be a bottleneck for many drug developers, which is why partnering with a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) like Lonza can be helpful. CDMOs have the tools and technology, such as AI algorithms, to help drug developers analyze data and progress through development stages quickly,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are also challenges to handling very small amounts of solids, Schmidt notes. \u201cAlthough this may seem like a minor technical detail, understanding and accepting these limitations is crucial,\u201d he says. One potential solution highlighted by Schmidt is the use of solid supports such as ChemBeads (MilliporeSigma), small, chemical-coated glass beads created specifically for use in HTS applications.\n\nA primary challenge in HTS for drug discovery is identifying assays that are physiologically relevant to the disease state despite the need for simplification to ensure scalability and robustness, according to Mahale. Model systems do not always translate well. In addition, biochemical assays, while simpler, often fail to capture the nuances of cellular contexts, such as the impact of membrane permeability, metabolite production, or protein-protein interactions, while cell-based assays are closer to physiological reality but are more complex, expensive, and challenging to miniaturize.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of human diseases, particularly multifactorial diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative disorders, makes it difficult to develop assays that can recapitulate the true pathophysiology of the disease,\u201d Alderwick observes. \u201cPoor assay choice,\u201d he continues, \u201cleads to the identification of hits that might show promise in early testing but later fail due to lack of efficacy or off-target effects in more complex disease models or clinical settings. The incorrect assay not only risks identifying false positives but also misses out on potential therapeutic candidates that could have better real-world efficacy. This limitation significantly contributes to the high attrition rates in drug development.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge is the development of a robust screening cascade (primary, secondary, and tertiary screenings) that helps to identify, confirm, validate, and refine viable candidates and reduce the attrition rate during later stages of drug development. Further assays are then employed during lead optimization to assess toxicity, selectivity, functional activity, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics for further hit validation. \u201cFailures in designing an appropriate HTS cascade occur when these different stages are not sufficiently de-risked,\u201d contends Alderwick.\n\nWhile incorporating more predictive absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity screens early in the process has helped de-risk candidate selection to some degree, the challenge still lies in balancing the need for throughput and speed with the inclusion of more complex, multi-parametric data, according to Alderwick. \u201cEarly prediction of in vivo efficacy and safety in HTS remains a weak point, contributing to high failure rates in the transition from hit-to-lead and lead-to-clinical candidate stages,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFinally, Mahale notes that the selection of chemically diverse and high-quality libraries for HTS is pivotal in the success of small-molecule candidate identification, because even with the best assays, if the chemical library lacks diversity or contains unsuitable and non-drug-like compounds, the likelihood of finding optimal candidates diminishes. \u201cMany historical compound libraries are biased toward certain chemical scaffolds that have been repeatedly screened over decades, thus reducing the chances of discovering novel small molecules with new mechanisms of action,\u201d he observes. Charles River, Mahale adds, has tackled this issue by developing an expertly curated small-molecule compound library that covers a wide range of structural and functional diversity, thereby maximizing the probability of finding useful hits.\n\nEmerging strategies offer potential\n\nSeveral emerging strategies aim to improve the efficiency, reliability, and outcomes of HTS by leveraging advancements in technology, biology, and chemistry, according to Alderwick. Advances in organoid and 3D-cell culture technologies are helping to bridge the gap between simple in vitro assays and complex human disease biology, and thus address the need for more physiologically relevant assays, he observes. \u201cThese models better mimic the physiological conditions of tissues and organs, providing a more relevant system for screening potential drug candidates,\u201d Alderwick explains. Organoids derived from patient tissues, for example, can offer insights into how drugs might work in specific disease contexts, improving the predictive power of assays.\n\nTo shrink the gap between biochemical, cell-free assays and phenotypic, cell-based screens and thus better understand the on-target activity of identified hit molecules, including binding assays such as for target engagement and protein-protein interaction analysis in the HTS screening cascade, would greatly advance the ability to select optimal compounds for further development, believes Alderwick. He also notes that the use of advanced cellular models, such as CRISPR/Cas (CRISPR-associated protein) knockouts and induced pluripotent stem cells, for early screening is likely to improve HTS outcomes.\n\nContinued advances in automation and the use of AI and ML will further enable HTS platforms to handle more complex assays with higher precision, reproducibility, and throughput, according to Mahale. \u201cFully automated HTS systems can reduce human error, improve the consistency of assay conditions, and allow for more sophisticated workflows that balance throughput with data quality, while incorporation of AI/ML algorithms can reduce the rates of false readouts, making HTS more reliable and reducing the time spent following up on false positives,\u201d he says.\n\nUltimately, concludes Mahale, these emerging solutions aim to reduce the high attrition rates in drug discovery by improving the relevance and quality of the screening process, optimizing candidate selection, and expanding the chemical diversity available for exploration. \u201cWhile challenges remain, these developments promise to significantly enhance the utility of HTS in the drug development pipeline,\u201d he contends.\n\nExcitement around multi-omics approaches\n\nLooking beyond these strategies, Alderwick is excited about the trend toward integration of multi-omics approaches into HTS, which he says represent a major leap forward in the ability to identify optimal small-molecule API candidates. \u201cMulti-omics approaches leverage data from various molecular levels, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and even epigenomics, providing a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of how small molecules interact with entire biological networks and pathways rather than isolated targets,\u201d he explains. \u201cComplex diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes often involve multiple, interconnected biological systems, and thus multi-omics approaches have a greater likelihood of identifying effective new drug candidates,\u201d he states.\n\nPeople remain the key to success\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced drug manufacturing environment, HTS has become an indispensable tool. However, Schmidt emphasizes that advances in technology are not sufficient by themselves to enhance the performance of these platforms. \u201cLooking ahead, we can expect continued improvements in both reliability and simplicity, but the key to success lies in having a motivated, dedicated, and technically skilled team that is ready to embrace challenges and open to adopting innovative techniques,\u201d he insists.\n\nAbout the author\n\nCynthia A.

        "article_content": "Ceroptres promethea is one of the newly identified and named gall wasps. (Credit: Penn State)\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 The most famous thieves, tricksters, and rogues were recently honored by having a brand new group of bugs named after them. Insect researchers named 22 new species of gall wasps after figures like Catwoman, Han Solo, and the man who betrayed Julius Caesar. These tiny wasps live in small structures known as galls, where they steal from other wasps. Researchers from Penn State named them after these famous figures in history, mythology, and pop culture to make them easier to identify. The discovery of these wasps, published in the journal Zootaxa, has doubled the genus of wasps. Some names were right on the nose. One fiery red-colored wasp was named after Prometheus, a titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods to give to humans. \u201cBy naming these species, we give other researchers an anchor they can carry forward to other studies because now they can identify wasps that were previously unknown,\u201d says Louis Nastasi, a doctoral student of entomology at Penn State and lead author of the study, in a media release. \u201cIt provides a base and a tool kit for future work that could help us understand these species and their ecosystems more broadly.\u201d\n\nThe recent work was possible because of a separate study from another team that looked at the evolution of gall wasps. Though the researchers collected DNA data from multiple wasps, they had trouble identifying the different wasp species. \u201cI ended up in conversation with Andrew Forbes, who\u2019s the leader of the University of Iowa team, and he told me about the difficulties they were having,\u201d explains Nastasi. \u201cAnd since my area of expertise is species identification, description and diagnosis of these tiny wasps, he asked if it would be possible for me to get involved and figure out what exactly is going on.\u201d\n\nLateral habitus of Ceroptres lokii Nastasi, Smith, & Davis sp. nov. Scale bars = 1.0 mm. A:\n\nHolotype female (PSUC_FEM_255534) reared from gall of Philonix nigra on Quercus alba. B: Paratype female\n\n(PSUC_FEM_255505) reared from gall of Acraspis macrocarpae on Quercus macrocarpa. C: Paratype male\n\n(PSUC_FEM_255504) reared from gall of Acraspis quercushirta on Quercus macrocarpa. D: Paratype male\n\n(PSUC_FEM_255506) reared from gall of Acraspis erinacei on Quercus alba (Credit: Zootaxa)\n\nWhen Natasi received the wasp samples, he quickly saw the issue. These species could not be easily identified because they had never been officially discovered and labeled until now. To start, Natasi studied the biological and molecular information of the wasps taken from the other study, along with his analysis of insect anatomy and physical characteristics. \u201cWe found that some of the insects thought to be one single species were actually two independent species, and that using only the molecular data did not sufficiently separate them into multiple species,\u201d Natasi says. \u201cWe had to combine that information with this new morphological analysis, and then by combining those types of data, it allowed us to get a clear vision of what each of these species are.\u201d\n\nSoon after the wasps were organized into species, the fun part began. Natasi gave the previously unknown wasps iconic names. For example, one wasp was named Ceroptres selinae \u2014 a tribute to Selina Kyle, known as Catwoman from the DC universe. Another wasp species is Ceroptres bruti, named after the Roman politician Marcus Junius Brutus, who stabbed Julius Caesar. There was also Ceroptres soloi inspired by the smuggler and thief Han Solo from Star Wars. \u201cWe tried to get a little more personal than just matching a list of names to a list of species,\u201d Nastasi says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely fun to hypothesize why a name is suited to a certain species. A lot of effort goes into identifying these species and there\u2019s a lot of art in choosing a good species name, so it was exciting to exemplify that and really carefully select names for these new species.\u201d"

(Dana Jensen/The Day) Buy Photo Reprints\n\nOld Lyme \u2015 For 10-year-old Joan Crawley, this Election Day was for the birds.\n\nThe Old Lyme resident spent the day off from school at the Connecticut Audubon Society regional center on Lyme Street named for the famed naturalist Roger Tory Peterson. While she has been a regular at the center\u2019s summer and after-school programs for years, it was her first time in the new Kelsey Family Children\u2019s Innovation and Discovery Center in the revamped caretaker\u2019s cottage of the former Bee & Thistle Inn.\n\nCrawley recounted looking at slides of bugs and leaves on digital microscopes in one of the new classrooms. She sat on the expansive deck overlooking the Lieutenant River as students worked with soil, gravel and rocks in an experiment on erosion. She helped close down two new raised garden beds for the winter. She fashioned a fairy house out of twigs and string.\n\nShe said the Roger Tory Peterson Estuary Center has given her an appreciation for the environment she might not have otherwise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shown me nature in different ways, and how much fun you can have using it,\u201d she said.\n\nDirector Alisha Milardo during a recent tour said the new children\u2019s center and improvements to the grounds represent ongoing efforts to bring the center\u2019s conservation and education mission to a wider swath of the population along the lower Connecticut River and Long Island Sound.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to protect and conserve southeastern Connecticut: the wildlife, the habitats and the environment,\u201d she said.\n\nIn late 2020, the center purchased the 5.25-acre inn site with a 1756 main house and a 1935 cottage steeped in history and river views. Milardo said the gardens, trees, wetlands and water provide dedicated access to an outdoor classroom where learning about ecology is \u201cfun, hands-on, and joyful.\u201d\n\nThe organization's mission, forged in 2015 and honed in an office in a Halls Road shopping plaza, quickly outgrew the available space at a time when facilitators were bringing nature instruction to 5,000 people in schools and outdoor locations across the region.\n\nNow, she said, the goal is to deliver programming to 10,000 people when the organization celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2025.\n\nThe group spent $1.25 million on the former inn, according to assessor\u2019s records. Not yet substantially upgraded, the first floor of the 7,257-square-foot building boasts office space, meeting rooms, and a classroom for older students where the inn\u2019s commercial kitchen used to be.\n\nClaudia Weicker, chairwoman of the center\u2019s Board of Directors, said the centerpiece of the first round of improvements to the property is the nearly $750,000 renovation of the 1935 caretaker\u2019s cottage into the Kelsey Family Children\u2019s Innovation and Discovery Center.\n\nThe cottage\u2019s interior this year was gutted to make room for two classrooms dedicated to children ages 3 to 10 and an upstairs apartment for visiting scientists and interns. The new deck serves as the foundation for an outdoor classroom that feeds into a backyard marked by the raised gardens and a planned gathering area overlooking the river.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a facility for younger children, a place where they would be welcomed and not overwhelmed by the larger building, which can be a little off-putting for young children,\u201d she said.\n\nOn a recent tour of the property, Milardo showed off the classrooms with brightly colored floors, child-sized tables and stools, and scientific equipment.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s at their level,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pointed to microscopes with digital screens that make science accessible for those raised on smartphones and watches. Slides available for viewing featured specimens ranging from plankton to cockroach legs.\n\nMilardo described the innovation and discovery center as a blend of technology and the outdoors.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fight technology. It\u2019s a part of our everyday life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a time to be outdoors and explore and just be in nature. And we try to balance that for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe renovation was funded primarily by a donation from the family of J. David Kelsey, a real estate investor and prominent local volunteer.\n\nKelsey in a phone interview said he felt it was important for the organization to have a dedicated space for kids to experience nature.\n\nHe described himself as a conservationist who grew up in the 1970s attending ecology camp. The experience instilled the kind of intellectual curiosity he wants to foster in the newest generation of students.\n\n\u201cObviously you\u2019re in a beautiful setting, with the wildlife available to you directly that you\u2019re hoping to get the kids interested in,\u201d he said.\n\nJack Schwartz, 10, of Lyme, has participated in the center\u2019s programs after school and during the summer. He detailed writing in a journal during the fall to record the color of leaves on different trees. He said he would learn about birds in the lab and then go outside to listen for birds and use binoculars to spot them. Like Crawley, he looked at various organisms with the smart microscope.\n\nHe said the counselors and facilitators play a big part in making it fun to learn about the environment.\n\n\u201cThey really know a lot about nature,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I feel it\u2019s really nice that they\u2019re there to basically have nature recognized.\u201d\n\nMagic in action\n\nRenovations in the main house to improve accessibility, upgrade electrical and mechanical systems, and create a laboratory for older students and visiting scientists are in the planning stages.\n\nOn the other side of the main house, Milardo said, a key component of the initial improvements focused on the sunken garden. That\u2019s where a partnership with master gardeners from the University of Connecticut Extension Program resulted in the creation of a fully native garden to lure pollinators, birds and people who want to relax.\n\nThe garden is bordered by a trail featuring the pages of a children\u2019s book spread out page-by-page on mounted signs to encourage reading and exercise.\n\nThe outdoor work was bolstered by an $800,000 federal community funding grant to enhance the site\u2019s marine and wildlife habitat, eradicate invasive species, mitigate coastal erosion, establish a living shoreline, and create an accessible trail.\n\nMilardo illustrated the link between education and conservation when she described the successful release this summer of 15 monarch butterflies as part of the Monarch Watch initiative to track the fall migration of a monarch population that\u2019s on the decline.\n\nShe said summer campers watched for eggs, placed protective netting over them, and recorded observations and measurements in journals as each chrysalis evolved into a butterfly. The insects were released from the net after 24 hours to ensure dry wings onto which a sticker tag was gently pressed for visual tracking by other volunteers on the way to Mexico and points south.\n\nMilardo, trained in marine science and oceanography at Hawaii Pacific University, likened the scientific study to something enchanting.\n\n\u201cIt is magic,\u201d she said. \u201cMagic happens here.\u201d\n\ne.regan@theday.com"

        "article_content": "Hyderabad: Come December, unlike in any other State in the country or in the world, Telangana will be the first state in India that officially treats Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims in general under the caste category.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that the State government has initiated a comprehensive door-to-door household survey covering the \u201csocio-economic, educational, employment, political, and caste\u2019 status of the people in the entire State. The State government said the survey is meant to plan and implement various socio-economic, educational, employment and political opportunities \u201cfor the amelioration of Backward Classes, SC and ST citizens of the state and other weaker sections of the state.\u201d\n\nThe instructional manual given to the enumerators gave them a tough time, not knowing that the Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists fall under only the religious category or both the religious and caste categories.\n\nSpeaking to The Hans India, an enumerator from Malkajgiri said, \u201cIt is not known if it is an unintended mistake that rolled while printing in the instructional manual or there is an unspelt reason for the government.\u201d\n\nThe page-6 of the instructional manual given to the enumerators of the survey prescribes them to enter the codes of the religions as Hindu (01), Islam (02), Christian (03), Sikh (04), Bauddha (05) and Jain (06). However, there is no code given to the Parisis or people belonging to Zoroastrians, who are the minuscule minority of the country grouped under the others category (00). This is in-gross negligence of not recognising their contribution to different fields, the country\u2019s economy, and charitable activities for centuries deserves no religious code other than the others category.\n\nA separate code number-085 is allocated for the BC-E category, falling under the Scheduled Castes converted to Christianity and their progeny.\n\nSimilarly, the BC-E category is given codes from 121 to 134. This is to cover various sub-castes of people of the religious denomination Muslims.\n\nHowever, page 46 springs a surprise with its Anexory-D of \u2018Other Castes\u201d.\n\nUnder the new category, besides the mentioned several castes considered as \u2018OCs\u2019 of the Hindu fold, there are separate codes given to different religions. This includes: the castes code for Buddhists-003, Christians (other than BC-C)- caste code-004,Jains caste code-005,\n\nMuslims (Other than BC-E) caste code-013, Sikhs caste code-016, and other religions caste code-000. However, Hindus have only been given a religious code and are not mentioned in the \u201cOther Castes\u201d category under the Anexory-D of the instructional manual of the survey."

        "article_content": "After enjoying a bye last week, the Pittsburgh Steelers will return to action in Week 10 to take on the Washington Commanders. This will be quarterback Russell Wilson's third start of the season, and his third game with wideout George Pickens.\n\nIn Pittsburgh's last game, Wilson played well yet again. He only found the end zone once but threw for 278 yards and completed 71.4% of his passes while not turning the ball over. The arrow is definitely pointing up for Pittsburgh's offense thanks to Wilson.\n\nPickens took a step back after having a big game the week prior, but we was at least serviceable, reeling in four catches for 74 scoreless yards. Lest we forget, Pickens barely missed out on not one, but two touchdowns. One was negated because of a penalty, and he didn't get his feet down for the other.\n\nSo, are we starting either Wilson or Pickens in fantasy football lineups this week? Let's discuss.\n\nFantasy football start or sit Week 10: George Pickens\n\nPickens came back down to earth in Wilson's second start after posting his best fantasy showing of the season the week prior, but he should have had much more after nearly scoring a pair of touchdowns.\n\nWith how well the Commanders' offense has played this season, this matchup offers a potential shootout scenario, which would be a positive game script for Pickens, who is clearly a top target in the red zone for Wilson.\n\nOn top of that, Washington is a middle-of-the-road unit when it comes to giving up fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Pickens can be deployed as a high-end flex with upside.\n\nVerdict: Start Pickens\n\nFantasy football start or sit Week 10: Russell Wilson\n\nOn paper, the Commanders have actually been stingy against the pass, giving up the fifth-fewest passing yards per game. However, context is needed here.\n\nWashington has also played six games against teams that sport a bottom-10 passing attack. Now, the Steelers are also bottom 10, but they've seen a huge improvement through the air with Wilson under center. Pittsburgh has eclipsed its season-long passing yards per game total (190) in both of Wilson's starts.\n\nIn a game that could see a lot of points, Wilson will have ample opportunity to make his mark. And even with the Commanders not giving up a lot of passing yards per contest, they are still just a middle-of-the-road unit when it comes to giving up fantasy points per game to signal-callers.\n\nWilson is on the QB2 radar and a starting option this week.\n\nVerdict: Start Wilson"

        "article_content": "When I bought the Razer Naga V2 Pro, I thought that I would instantly love it, and I thought that I knew what I was getting myself into. One month later, I can now say with full conviction that I was wrong on both accounts.\n\nDespite being two years old, many still rank the Razer Naga V2 Pro among the best gaming mice, and having tested it myself, I fully agree. But make no mistake: It\u2019s definitely a mouse with a learning curve, and I learned that the hard way.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMy first rodeo\n\nI realize that I\u2019m pretty late on the Razer Naga train. The concept of Razer\u2019s 12-button mouse is nothing new at this point, and various iterations of the mouse have been around since 2009. I\u2019ve never owned one until just over a month ago, though.\n\nThe Razer Naga is primarily an MMO mouse, and 2009 was a prime year for such players; I, myself, was deep into my World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King phase at that time. I sure could\u2019ve used a Naga, but there was always something that kept me away from giving it a try, such as it being expensive (I paid $160 for mine, but the recommended list price is $180) or the fact that all those buttons made it downright intimidating.\n\nThis makes the Razer Naga V2 Pro my first attempt at using Razer\u2019s MMO mouse. It\u2019s not my first Razer mouse, but it\u2019s the first gaming mouse where I truly felt like I was trying something new. As a result, a lot of my impressions of the mouse aren\u2019t strictly related to the V2 Pro as much as the Razer Naga overall, but I\u2019ll cover parts that are unique to this mouse, too.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack. Although the Razer Naga V2 Pro is plug-and-play, it\u2019s also anything but.\n\nNot a love at first sight\n\nI was excited to get the Razer Naga V2 Pro, but my initial excitement was short-lived. There were some things that I didn\u2019t love from the get-go. The good news is that adapting to the mouse helped me get past most of them.\n\nBefore I dive in, let\u2019s go over the basic specs.\n\nRazer Naga V2 Pro Sensitivity 30,000 DPI Polling rates 125/500/1,000Hz IPS 750 Max acceleration 70g Connectivity 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, USB-C Battery Up to 150 hours (2.4GHz)/Up to 300 hours (Bluetooth) Programmable buttons 10/14/20, depending on side plate Weight 134g Recommended price (at launch) $180\n\nThe Razer Naga V2 Pro is a high-end wireless mouse, and the specs show it. It comes with three hot-swappable side plates: one with the standard two thumb buttons, one with six, and one with 12. This amounts to up to 20 programmable buttons, and the V2 Pro adds the HyperScroll Pro scroll wheel, which comes with six presets and a custom mode. You can effectively double the number of programmable inputs because of Razer\u2019s Hypershift tech, which I\u2019ll go into a bit later.\n\nThe mouse comes with its own 2.4GHz wireless dongle, and once you plug it in, you\u2019re good to go. You need the Razer Synapse software to set it up, which I\u2019ve already had due to owning a Razer keyboard; I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d be prompted to download it otherwise.\n\nMy first thoughts as I held the mouse were that it was really heavy and that my hand was slightly too small. (I knew that it\u2019s not exactly perfect for small hands and bought it despite that.) Despite the weight and the size, the mouse felt comfortable for the most part, although the sheer number of buttons underneath my thumb took some effort getting used to. I use a palm grip and found the mouse to be perfectly suited to that grip type, although with bigger hands, I think a claw grip would work just as well.\n\nI have to give it to Razer \u2014 the hot-swappable side plates are extremely easy to swap back and forth. Truthfully, I\u2019ve had more problems unplugging the mouse from its charging cable than I\u2019ve had swapping out the 12-button plate for the two-button version. In fact, I found the charging cable a little difficult to unplug.\n\nDespite the ease of use, I had some buyer\u2019s remorse. I didn\u2019t love this mouse at first sight. It was heavier than I expected, it was bulky, and it quickly dawned on me that setting up the keybinds would be a project instead of a quick five-minute job.\n\nThe different stages of using a Naga\n\nI feel like one of the things that people don\u2019t mention much in reviews of this mouse (of which I\u2019ve read plenty) is that it doesn\u2019t just take a long time to set up but also to learn. I want to touch on that aspect, because that\u2019s probably what\u2019s taken me the longest time to adapt to. Again, this is more of a Naga thing than the Razer Naga V2 Pro, but if you\u2019re a first-time user, you might run into the same obstacles that I\u2019ve encountered.\n\nGetting started is easy, but only on paper. I dove right in with the 12-button version, naively thinking I\u2019d be a pro gamer within an hour. (Spoiler alert: I was decidedly not a pro gamer within an hour.)\n\nWithout a lot of tweaking in Synapse, those thumb buttons don\u2019t do anything, so I set out to bind them to certain keyboard keys, which, in turn, made them usable in games. Most games don\u2019t recognize these side panel keys, so this keyboard-to-mouse transition is necessary.\n\nI entertained the idea of using HyperShift, but honestly, I think I\u2019m too casual a gamer to bother.\n\nA process that I thought would take me five minutes ended up taking the better part of an hour as I changed certain binds back and forth. I can\u2019t complain about the actual software \u2014 it\u2019s easy enough to navigate. No one tells you how hard it\u2019s going to be to pick the right stuff to bind, though.\n\nThe side panel accounts for 12 separate keybinds, and you can double the number of programmable inputs on the Naga V2 Pro thanks to Razer\u2019s HyperShift tech. This lets you assign a secondary function to each button, and when holding down the HyperShift key, the keybind changes accordingly.\n\nI entertained the idea of using HyperShift, but honestly, I think I\u2019m too casual a gamer to bother. The games I primarily play don\u2019t require a whopping 24 different binds on top of the stuff I\u2019m already very used to using on my keyboard. Picking the right things to re-map was a process. I had a lot of binds that I was comfortable with using during gameplay, and a lot of those I simply didn\u2019t want to swap out.\n\nOnce I was done, the reality check fully set in.\n\nA never-ending process\n\nThis mouse has been out for nearly two years now, so I won\u2019t bore you with the details that are available in nearly every review of it. Instead, I want to look at the practical side of using such a mouse as your daily driver.\n\nMy main MMO is still World of Warcraft. (Yes, I know, time to find a new game.) Much like most MMOs, WoW gives you different spells and therefore different keybinds for each character. The binds themselves are uniform across every character, but as each comes with its own abilities, you need to figure out a way to streamline these binds and memorize them.\n\nUsing the 12-button side panel really shook things up for me. At first, I found myself reverting to what I already remembered, meaning using the keyboard instead of trying to use the mouse. This was especially hard to avoid during intense gameplay, where using the wrong ability can be deadly.\n\nEven when I forced myself to stick to the mouse, it took me a while to learn the button placement. Fortunately, Razer must have put a fair bit of thought into each, because once you\u2019ve used the mouse for a couple of days, the button shape becomes distinct enough that it gets a lot easier to tell them apart without looking.\n\nBut that first day or two? Not only did I not remember which button was assigned to which spell but I also had to stop and think which button I was even pressing.\n\nI eventually got used to the button layout, but honestly, I rarely make use of all 12 buttons. I could, but I hardly ever need to. I can\u2019t imagine doubling them with HyperShift \u2014 I think I\u2019d spend most of my time being confused as to what I\u2019m doing as opposed to actually playing.\n\nIt was an uphill climb, but one month later, I\u2019m feeling the real benefit of using this mouse. Gameplay becomes more intuitive; casting spells is so much quicker; you free up more of your keyboard for other things. I\u2019m not sure if it made me a better gamer, but it certainly made gameplay more enjoyable for me.\n\nThe only downside? Adjusting this mouse to your needs is a never-ending process. Sure, I\u2019ve mastered it for one character, but playing a different character or a different game means starting all over again and memorizing even more binds. This is true for any game, but with the sheer number of programmable buttons that the Razer Naga V2 Pro offers, it does feel like a chore if you play a lot of different titles.\n\nThe good part of it is that even if you don\u2019t end up using all 12 buttons and stick to the basic or the six-button side panel, the Naga V2 Pro is a superb mouse regardless, so you won\u2019t be missing out. I could see it being less great for first-person shooters, though, if only because of the weight.\n\nThe best (and most frustrating) mouse I\u2019ve ever owned\n\nThere\u2019s so much that I love about the Razer Naga V2 Pro: the sky-high DPI; the excellent sensor; the seamless wireless connectivity; the high-end build quality that tells me that it might last me a long time (which is quite a feat, as I break mice in record time).\n\nA month later, I also love the side panels. I\u2019ve gotten so used to the 12-button version that I hardly ever bother to scale down to two as it doesn\u2019t bug me when I work. The six-button panel is the one that\u2019s gotten the least love, simply because I\u2019ve gotten used to the maximum layout and I think that introducing any changes at this point would only end in frustration.\n\nAnother thing that put me off at first but is now a favorite is the customizable scroll wheel. Out of the box, using the scroll wheel feels like pulling teeth, but a quick adjustment in Synapse turns it into the smoothest scroll wheel I\u2019ve ever tried. There are so many modes that there\u2019s something in there for everyone, and if the presets don\u2019t work for you, you can always create your own profile. Personally, as I don\u2019t use the scroll wheel much during gameplay, I haven\u2019t had to make any tweaks after that initial adjustment.\n\nThe battery life is another thing I\u2019ve enjoyed and can applaud this mouse for. Prior to this mouse, I briefly used a battery-powered Logitech, and swapping those AA batteries every week or so was tedious \u2014 not to mention expensive. The battery on the Naga V2 Pro is excellent, lasting for days on end if you turn off the RGB lighting. Turning that on makes it deplete a lot faster, though.\n\nOutside of those more Naga-specific things, this is just a really solid mouse. It\u2019s quick, reliable, and super customizable.\n\nIt\u2019s also entirely overkill for my needs, and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to non-MMO gamers. If you don\u2019t regularly play games with lots of different binds, you don\u2019t need this mouse. Even if you do (like I do), it\u2019s still overkill for many people and it has a steep learning curve that never really ends.\n\nWith all that said, I\u2019d buy the Razer Naga V2 Pro again without any hesitation, and I\u2019d happily go through the tedious process of learning my binds all over again. I\u2019m officially a convert."
