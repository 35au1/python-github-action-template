            "source": "Windows Latest",
            "article_content": "In a previous post, we covered Microsoft\u2019s plans to rebrand the Microsoft 365 app to Microsoft 365 Copilot. It\u2019s obvious that Copilot will take center stage in the upcoming version, and a recent Microsoft 365 roadmap seen by Windows Latest gives a brief idea of what\u2019s coming.\n\nFirstly, the Copilot page will automatically launch when clicking the Copilot keyboard key in the Microsoft 365 app. The next big change is retiring the top header to give a more clean look to the UI. It is a big change because the right part of the bar contains profile and account-related options.\n\nAll these options will now migrate to the bottom of the left-side menu. So, you\u2019ll need to expand the Settings and more section to access profile, feedback, and app settings.\n\nMicrosoft is also retiring the organization name header, which appeared in the top header. A valid reason for removing this is that Copilot is a tool to get the job done but not a crucial app like Word or Excel, which the organization uses most of the time.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019ll move the AI features like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages to the left sidebar in hopes of drawing more eyeballs than usual. To make space for Copilot, it\u2019s removing the My Day and Help me Create buttons, which have no need since Copilot is a polished version for queries, summarization, and generation tasks.\n\nYou\u2019ll also not see the Back button because Microsoft believes the tabbed interface is enough to switch between multiple apps or app pages.\n\nAlso, what about the search bar? It\u2019s now set to appear on the homepage so you can look for content across different sections, but there are no other changes to the search bar. Only the position is changing.\n\nAll these app changes apply to both the web and desktop versions of the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. You can expect these changes to be reflected in the service from the third week of January 2025.\n\nBut are these changes helpful for the end user?\n\nCopilot is omnipresent\n\nRebranding an already confusing name like Microsoft 365 to Microsoft 365 Copilot makes little sense. With all the hype this AI assistant has received for the last year or so, rarely users or organizations don\u2019t know about it.\n\nEven worse is renaming the simple Copilot service to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat for enterprise users. That\u2019s a too-long name and based on the little help that it offers, it\u2019ll find very less adoption in the enterprise scenario. The URLs have also changed to reflect the name change, so users don\u2019t get confused.\n\nWe hope that Microsoft sticks to the Copilot name until the service is discontinued (less likely as AI is omnipresent now)."

            "article_content": "A mother has told the High Court that the council home she has been transferred to has made her fear for the safety of her five young children due to \"paranormal activity\" that has caused tables and chairs to move and objects to be flown around.\n\nThe High Court action was taken by Thomas and Louise Stokes, with an address listed at Mount Temple, Carrick on Shannon, Co Leitrim, claiming that the family could not stay at that address due to concerns for their children's health arising from a mould problem.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons on Friday that a new property the family has been moved into has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \"paranormal activity\".\n\nThe Stokes\u2019 original complaint to the High Court was that the local authority did not classify them as \u2018homeless\u2019, even though, it was alleged, the mould in the first property was so bad it involved hospital visits and forced the entire family to sleep downstairs rather than in their own bedrooms.\n\nThe claim against the council alleged that works were carried out to alleviate the situation by improving ventilation and removing the mould caused by dampness but the problem returned.\n\nThose works were insufficient, the family claimed in arguing that the property was not fit for human habitation and emergency accommodation was needed.\n\nThe family claim that in the five-year period they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard that the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Simons that since she has moved there, \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d.\n\nShe claims that while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter that the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d.\n\nMs Stokes claims she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids. I just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nThe judge said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court.\n\nHe said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and that \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes that he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but that a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "date": "2h",
            "source": "The Verge",
            "article_content": "Despite Max\u2019s pivot to purging films and TV shows from its programming library, the platform still has plenty of excellent new releases to check out during this year\u2019s holiday season. Whether you\u2019re into live-action dramas, sci-fi spectacles, or animated epics, the streamer has a little bit of everything to offer. Naturally, we\u2019ve put together a handy list of some of our favorites we think you might get a kick out of.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nIt sounded like Warner Bros. and DC were having a laugh when they started referring to The Penguin\u2019s central mobster as \u201cOz Cobb,\u201d as if that has ever been that character\u2019s name. It also seemed odd that the studios were bullish about airing a series spun off from Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman when all signs have suggested that those characters won\u2019t make it into James Gunn\u2019s new universe of DC films. Somehow, though, The Penguin proved to be a surprisingly compelling return to Gotham as it explored the inner workings of Oz Cobb\u2019s (Colin Farrell) mind and reframed him as a twisted underdog fighting to keep up with fellow crimelord Sofia Gigante (Cristin Milioti).\n\nBy largely removing Batman from the equation, The Penguin was able to present its murderous gangsters as people (rather than costumed weirdos) who were really just trying to get by in a city that was all too ready to throw them away. And by the show\u2019s season 1 finale, The Penguin establishes itself as one of the better Batman stories that DC has produced in recent years \u2014 one that definitely deserves a second chapter.\n\nInvincible Fight Girl\n\nThere\u2019s nothing fun about getting punched in the face, but in Invincible Fight Girl\u2019s world, where everyone is a superpowered professional wrestler, it\u2019s the kind of thing that lights a fire within young brawler Andy \u200b\u200b(Sydney Mikayla). Even though her parents would rather she live a quiet life of accounting, Andy knows in her heart that she\u2019s a born wrestler who just needs a trainer who can bring out her inner greatness. And while Quesa Poblana (Rolonda Watts) is none too pleased about the idea of taking on a newbie mentee, she, too, can see that Andy has what it takes to become a legend.\n\nThe way Invincible Fight Girl borrows elements of classic shonen shows like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Pok\u00e9mon, and Hajime no Ippo feels like it could almost be too much at first. But the show blends its influences together brilliantly to tell its own unique story and create fight sequences that are cool as hell.\n\nLike Water for Chocolate\n\nBy easing up on the magical realism of Laura Esquivel\u2019s novel, Francisco Javier Royo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s new adaptation of Like Water for Chocolate makes it somewhat easier to appreciate the depth of its central love story set during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nThere is still something otherworldly about Tita de la Garza\u2019s (Azul Guaita) ability to channel her emotions into the food she cooks. Tita\u2019s sisters Rosaura (Ana Valeria Becerril) and Gertrudis (Andrea Chaparro) and her forbidden love Pedro Muzquiz (Andr\u00e9s Baida) can attest to the way her culinary creations leave people overwhelmed as they experience whatever feelings were roiling inside of her. But that detail is really just one small ingredient the new Like Water for Chocolate adaptation uses to enhance its rumination on the ways that class conflict and war have shaped the arc of Tita\u2019s life.\n\nDune: Prophecy\n\nIn Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune films, the Bene Gesserit order is so shrouded in mystery that it\u2019s hard to tell whether their strange abilities are rooted in the supernatural. But Dune: Prophecy dives into the Sisterhood\u2019s ancient history to unpack the many ways in which secret science rather than sorcery is what turned them into one of the most influential forces in the entire spice-addicted Imperium.\n\nThe show\u2019s exploration of how Valya (Emily Watson / Jessica Barden) and Tula (Olivia Williams / Emma Canning) Harkonnen reestablished their family as one of the galaxy\u2019s Great Houses adds new depth to the Dune franchise\u2019s larger story about the rise of a long-awaited messiah. Through the Harkonnen sisters, Prophecy demystifies some of the legend of the Kwisatz Haderach and reveals how ruthless the fight to control spice has always been. And it makes for an excellent way to get your sandworm fix while we wait for the next Dune feature to premiere.\n\nCreature Commandos\n\nThough James Gunn and Peter Safran are mostly starting over fresh for Warner Bros.\u2019 new cinematic universe of DC films, a tiny portion of the old DCEU is being reborn through the animated Creature Commandos series. After the events of The Suicide Squad and season 1 of Peacemaker, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) can no longer force teams of superhumans to covertly do her bidding under threat of death. But there are no laws forbidding her from recruiting a squad of supernatural monsters like Nina Mazursky (Zo\u00eb Chao), Eric Frankenstein (David Harbour), the Bride (Indira Varma), and Circe (Anya Chalotra) to go on suicidal missions that Waller would rather the public not know about.\n\nPart of what\u2019s intriguing about the show is the way characters like Waller, Weasel (Sean Gunn, who will also voice G.I. Robot), and Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) will establish a narrative continuity between DC\u2019s old films and many of its upcoming live-action projects. And with Gunn going all in on actors reprising their roles across different mediums, Creature Commandos seems like it might be the start of an era worth tuning in to.\n\nCivil War\n\nThough there\u2019s a certain degree of absurdity to the political details of Alex Garland\u2019s Civil War, its depiction of the United States descending into chaos after a tyrannical president refuses to leave office feels like a haunting vision of a future that isn\u2019t as improbable as we\u2019d hope. As a respected war reporter, Lee Smith (Kirsten Dunst) feels she has a duty to document the reality of what has become of her country in the time since the president (Nick Offerman) came into power.\n\nLee\u2019s years of reporting from the front lines of conflicts all over the world have taught her how important it is for people to be able to see how war ruins lives and pushes societies to (if not over) the brink of collapse. But as Lee sets out to secure the interview of a lifetime, she quickly realizes that no amount of reporting has prepared her to see war unfolding in the place she calls home. And with rookie journalist Jessie (Cailee Spaeny) by her side, the only thing that keeps Lee grounded is her hope that she can pass her skills on to the next generation.\n\nI Saw the TV Glow\n\nOne doesn\u2019t need to be queer or a Buffy fan to appreciate the neon-drenched strangeness of Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s I Saw the TV Glow. But the movie\u2019s story about two lonely teens bonding over a cheesy sci-fi show might hit differently for anyone who grew up in the \u201990s feeling like they would be more at home in Sunnydale than living their own humdrum lives.\n\nEven though young outcasts Owen (Justice Smith / Ian Foreman) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) don\u2019t initially have the words to articulate what it is that makes them different from other kids, there\u2019s something about The Pink Opaque that speaks to them both. The teens don\u2019t understand why they feel such a powerful, instinctive kinship to the TV show\u2019s monster-fighting heroines or how the program is influencing the way they see the world. But by the time they\u2019ve both grown up a bit, they can\u2019t shake the feeling that The Pink Opaque has changed something within them \u2014 something that might mean everything they\u2019ve been raised to believe is a lie.\n\nTrap\n\nIn any other M. Night Shyamalan movie, you would expect the big twist to come closer toward the end in order to leave audiences reeling, but Trap does something much more intriguing with its story about the cops tracking down a famous serial killer. Family man Cooper (Josh Hartnett) prides himself on the way he\u2019s able to keep his double life secret from his loved ones. His daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) and wife Rachel (Alison Pill) have no idea that he has other houses than the one they live in. And they would never guess that he spends much of his free time watching a livestream feed of a man he has tied up in a secret basement.\n\nCooper seems like exactly the sort of Good Guy\u2122 who would surprise his daughter with a trip to see her favorite singer Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) in concert because that\u2019s what he wants people to see. But what Cooper doesn\u2019t realize is that the concert is an elaborate trap and the centerpiece of one of Shyamalan\u2019s most fun thrillers yet.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nThere are only a few choice scenes in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice that achieve the kind of horror-comedy brilliance that made Tim Burton\u2019s original 1988 film such a batshit revelation. Those fleeting moments and a pitch-perfect performance from Michael Keaton just manage to make the sequel feel like a film that has something to offer fans beyond nostalgia for the Deetz family and their favorite incorporeal dirtbag.\n\nYears after Lydia Deetz\u2019s (Winona Ryder) first encounter with Beetlejuice (Keaton), she has become the host of a paranormal television show and mother to a sullen teenager of her own. Though Astrid (Jenna Ortega) is certain her mom can\u2019t actually see ghosts, Lydia knows that her eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on her when she spots Beetlejuice during one of her tapings. And when Lydia\u2019s overbearing boyfriend Rory (Justin Theroux) tries to prove that she\u2019s just imagining things, his thrice-over utterance of Beetlejuice\u2019s name sends them all straight to the afterlife for an unhinged reunion of sorts that none of them are prepared for.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\n\nIn the grand scheme of Warner Bros.\u2019 decision to greenlight a gritty, Batman-free Joker film that had nothing to do with its core cinematic universe of DC films, there\u2019s a certain kind of poetry to the way things played out with Todd Phillips\u2019 Folie \u00e0 Deux. At first blush, the idea of a jukebox musical about the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) falling in love with Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) while they\u2019re both doing time in Arkham Asylum sounded inspired. And you could see how, with the right story, a song-filled take on the iconic criminals might make for an enjoyable change of pace from WB\u2019s previous forays into Gotham."

            "article_content": "High Court reporters\n\nA mother has told the High Court that the council home she has been transferred to has made her fear for the safety of her five young children due to \"paranormal activity\" that has caused tables and chairs to move and objects to be flown around.\n\nThe High Court action was taken by Thomas and Louise Stokes, with an address listed at Mount Temple, Carrick on Shannon, Co Leitrim, claiming that the family could not stay at that address due to concerns for their children's health arising from a mould problem.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons on Friday that a new property the family has been moved into has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \"paranormal activity\".\n\nThe Stokes\u2019 original complaint to the High Court was that the local authority did not classify them as \u2018homeless\u2019, even though, it was alleged, the mould in the first property was so bad it involved hospital visits and forced the entire family to sleep downstairs rather than in their own bedrooms.\n\nThe claim against the council alleged that works were carried out to alleviate the situation by improving ventilation and removing the mould caused by dampness but the problem returned.\n\nThose works were insufficient, the family claimed in arguing that the property was not fit for human habitation and emergency accommodation was needed.\n\nThe family claim that in the five-year period they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard that the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Simons that since she has moved there, \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d.\n\nShe claims that while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter that the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d.\n\nMs Stokes claims she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids. I just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the High Court on Friday, Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and that \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes that he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but that a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "Rust is starting to be appreciated for being a system programming language of great potential thanks to congruent memory safety and high-speed features. Compared to C and C++, Rust guarantees programmers can write fast and safe code. This makes it ideal for performance-critical applications such as embedded systems , operating systems, and web assembly. As key players in the industry start recommending Rust for security, it remains a growing language for both business and pleasure. Open-source projects. With more developers joining the Rust ecosystem and more focus on safety and quality, Rust has become a top choice for developers. The usage of Rust has great growth potential, and we will see that in the next few years."

Huzzah?

First, the company revealed the full-function version of its new o1 family of reasoning models and announced that they would be immediately available, albeit in limited amounts, to its $20/month Plus tier subscribers. In order to get full use of the new model (as well as every other model that OpenAI offers, plus unlimited access to Advanced Voice Mode), users will need to spring for OpenAI\u2019s newest, and highest, subscription package: the $200/month Pro tier.\n\nDay 2: OpenAI expands its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program\n\nOn the event\u2019s second day, the OpenAI development team announced that it is expanding its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program, which allows developers to train the company\u2019s models as subject matter experts that \u201cexcel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\u201d according to the program\u2019s website. Though it is geared more toward institutes, universities, and enterprises than individual users, the company plans to make the program\u2019s API available to the public early next year.\n\nDay 3: OpenAI\u2019s Sora video generator has finally arrived. Huzzah?\n\nOn the third day of OpenAI, Sam Altman gave to me: Sora video generation. Yeah, OK, so the cadence for that doesn\u2019t quite work but hey, neither does Sora. OpenAI\u2019s long-awaited and highly touted video generation model, which has been heavily hyped since February, made its official debut on December 9 to middling reviews. Turns out that two years into the AI boom, being the leading company in the space and only rolling out 20-second clips at 1080p doesn\u2019t really move the needle, especially when many of its competitors already offer similar performance without requiring a $20- or $200-per-month subscription.\n\nDay 4: OpenAI expands its Canvas\n\nOpenAI followed up its Sora revelations with a set of improvements to its recently released Canvas feature, the company\u2019s answer to Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts. During its Day 4 live stream, the OpenAI development team revealed that Canvas will now be integrated directly into the GPT-4o model, making it natively available to users at all price tiers, including free. You can now run Python code directly within the Canvas space, enabling the chatbot to analyze it directly and offer suggestions for improvement, as well as use the feature to construct custom GPTs.\n\nDay 5: ChatGPT teams up with Apple Intelligence\n\nOn day five, OpenAI announced that it is working with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence, specifically Siri, allowing users to invoke the chatbot directly through iOS. Apple had announced that this would be a thing back when it first unveiled Apple Intelligence but, with the release of iOS 18.2, that functionality is now a reality. If only Apple\u2019s users actually wanted to use Apple\u2019s AI.\n\nDay 6: Advanced Voice Mode now has the power of sight and can speak Santa\n\n2024 was the year that Advanced Voice Mode got its eyes. OpenAI announced on Day 6 of its live-stream event that its conversational chatbot model can now view the world around it through a mobile device\u2019s video camera or via screen sharing. This will enable users to ask the AI questions about their surroundings without having to describe the scene or upload a photo of what they\u2019re looking at. The company also released a seasonal voice for AVM which mimics Jolly Old St. Nick, just in case you don\u2019t have time to drive your kids to the mall and meet the real one in person.\n\nDay 7: OpenAI introduces Projects for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI closed out the first week of announcements with one that is sure to bring a smile to the face of every boy and girl: folders! Specifically, the company revealed its new smart folder system, dubbed \u201cProjects,\u201d which allows users to better organize their chat histories and uploaded documents by subject.\n\nDay 8: ChatGPT Search is now available to everybody\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search function, which debuted in October, is now available to all logged-in users, regardless of their subscription tier. The feature works by searching the internet for information about the user\u2019s query, scraping the info it finds from relevant websites, and then synthesize that data into a conversational answer. It essentially eliminates the need to click through a search results page and is functionally identical to what Perplexity AI offers, allowing ChatGPT to compete with the increasingly popular app. Be warned, however: a recent study has shown the feature to be \u201cconfidently wrong\u201d in many of its answers.\n\nDay 9: the full o1 model comes to OpenAI\u2019s API\n\nLike being gifted a sweater from not one but two aunts, OpenAI revealed on day nine that it is allowing select developers to access the full version of its o1 reasoning model through the API. The company is also rolling out real-time API updates, a new model customization technique called Preference Fine-Tuning, and new SDKs for Go and Java.\n\nDay 10: 1-800-ChatGPT\n\nIn an effort to capture that final market segment that it couldn\u2019t already reach \u2014 specifically, people without internet access \u2014 OpenAI has released the 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) chatline. Dial in from any land or mobile number within the U.S. to speak with the AI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for up to 15 minutes for free.\n\nDay 11: ChatGPT now works with even more coding apps\n\nLast month, OpenAI granted the Mac-based desktop version of ChatGPT the ability to interface directly with a number of popular coding applications, allowing its AI to pull snippets directly from them rather than require users to copy and paste the code into its chatbot\u2019s prompt window. On Thursday, the company announced that it is drastically expanding the number of apps and IDEs that ChatGPT can collaborate with. And it\u2019s not just coding apps; ChatGPT now also works with conventional text programs like Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. You can even launch Advanced Voice Mode in a separate window as you work, asking questions and getting suggestions from the AI about your current project.\n\nDay 12: OpenAI teases its upcoming o3 and o3-mini reasoning models\n\nFor the 12th day of OpenAI\u2019s live-stream event, CEO Sam Altman made a final appearance to discuss what the company has in store for the new year \u2014 specifically, its next-generation reasoning models, o3 and o3-mini. The naming scheme is a bit odd (and done to avoid copyright issues with U.K. telecom, O2) but the upcoming models reportedly offer superior performance on some of the industry\u2019s most challenging math, science, and coding benchmark tests \u2014 even compared to o1, the full version of which was formally released less than a fortnight ago. The company is currently offering o3-mini as a preview to researchers for safety testing and red teaming trials, though there\u2019s no word yet on when everyday users will be able to try the models for themselves."

This could reignite acquisition activity by strategic buyers, which would allow funds to distribute proceeds from those deals to their own investors, or limited partners, and raise new funds to invest in the next generation of startups, said Brian Garrett, managing director at Crosscut Ventures.\n\nIn recent years, startups weren't the only ones facing a cash crunch. Established funds raised the lion's share of funding dollars, while many newish and boutique funds struggled to raise. A torrent of dealmaking, combined with Trump's return to the White House and an end to the political uncertainty, could mobilize investors in these funds who had been sitting on the sidelines to whip out their checkbooks, said Ivan Nikkhoo, a managing partner at Navigate Ventures.\n\n\"Uncertainty breeds defense, optimism breeds offense,\" said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures and early Anthropic investor. \"We're going into a cycle where acquirers are feeling they need to play offense and startups feel like it's time to invest in leadership. And the IPO market is open for best-in-class assets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom IPOs to robotaxis, these are the tech trends to watch in 2025, according to venture capitalists."

Following the political excitement surrounding Donald Trump's election on November 5, DOGE experienced a whopping 164% price increase. It increased from $0.1595 on November 3 to $0.4416 at the end of the month, demonstrating its ability to capitalize on market euphoria.\n\nSeveral analysts have commented on Dogecoin's price trajectory. In October, prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez set a daring $10 price target for DOGE. Market analyst Trader Tardigrade made even more grandiose projections, predicting that DOGE may reach $20 and potentially peak at $30. These mouthwatering estimates reflect the increased attention and speculation about Dogecoin's potential utility and adoption. Despite these expectations, a sense of apprehension remains. Analysts at Changelly believe that Dogecoin will hit $1 in January 2030, signaling a fluctuating rise. Their schedule for DOGE to reach $10 stretches until January 2040, with $20 and $30 following in March and April of that year. Such estimates indicate uncertainty about the speed of DOGE adoption, but they highlight its long-term potential."

            "article_content": "A mere seven months after Oleksandr Usyk narrowly outpointed Tyson Fury to become the first undisputed heavyweight boxing champion in 24 years, the two fighters return to Saudi Arabia this Saturday for a much anticipated rematch.\n\nSince that first encounter Usyk has had to give up his IBF belt, meaning only three titles are being put on the line by the unbeaten Ukrainian fighter this time out.\n\nThat split decision loss back in May marked the first time Fury had tasted defeat after 16 years as a professional.

This could reignite acquisition activity by strategic buyers, which would allow funds to distribute proceeds from those deals to their own investors, or limited partners, and raise new funds to invest in the next generation of startups, said Brian Garrett, managing director at Crosscut Ventures.\n\nIn recent years, startups weren't the only ones facing a cash crunch. Established funds raised the lion's share of funding dollars, while many newish and boutique funds struggled to raise. A torrent of dealmaking, combined with Trump's return to the White House and an end to the political uncertainty, could mobilize investors in these funds who had been sitting on the sidelines to whip out their checkbooks, said Ivan Nikkhoo, a managing partner at Navigate Ventures.\n\n\"Uncertainty breeds defense, optimism breeds offense,\" said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures and early Anthropic investor. \"We're going into a cycle where acquirers are feeling they need to play offense and startups feel like it's time to invest in leadership. And the IPO market is open for best-in-class assets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom IPOs to robotaxis, these are the tech trends to watch in 2025, according to venture capitalists."

            "article_content": "As 2024 ends, the world faces significant challenges. Ongoing wars, shifting alliances, and Donald Trump's return as U.S. President mark this period. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, Middle East turmoil, and new power dynamics raise questions about the future. Is World War III inevitable, or can diplomacy prevent it?\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war continues with no end in sight. Now in its third year, the conflict shows no signs of slowing down. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia's goals in Ukraine are far from complete. This suggests no rush to end the war.\n\nThe human cost is high, with both sides fighting for territory. The United Nations reports 39,081 civilian casualties from February 2022 to October 2024. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismisses peace talks from Putin as fantasies.\n\nWestern support for Ukraine remains strong, while Russia stands firm. This suggests the conflict will continue into 2025 without a clear resolution. Meanwhile, the Middle East is also in turmoil. Israel has military victories against Hamas but faces tension with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe death of Hezbollah's leader has worsened the situation. Reports say 44,554 people died from violence involving Israeli forces last year. Despite Israel's dominance, a fragile peace might emerge. Iran's influence is weakening as its alliances crumble.\n\nThe collapse of Syria's regime has shifted power in the Middle East. Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis face setbacks. Iran's role as a regional power is diminishing. In Yemen, the Houthis have increased attacks on Israel with drones and missiles.\n\nThese cross-border assaults threaten regional stability and global shipping routes. Israel's retaliatory airstrikes have escalated tensions further. In the U.S., Donald Trump's election as president marks a major political shift.\n\nHis victory has affected global markets, causing stock indices to fall. Trump's return could change U.S. foreign policy significantly. His unpredictable nature raises concerns about relations with China and Russia.\n\nWhile his economic policies may appeal to his supporters, it's unclear if tensions with adversaries will rise or if a more isolated approach will be taken. Regardless, his victory is pivotal in global politics.\n\nWith conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and instability elsewhere, many wonder if World War III is near. While the situation is tense, a global war seems unlikely for now.\n\nGlobal powers are still engaged in diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation. However, regional conflicts could spill over into a global war if not contained.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia continue their proxy battle in Ukraine while the U.S. remains involved in the Middle East with military assets there.\n\nChina's growing presence in Asia adds complexity to the geopolitical landscape. The world stands on edge, and future choices by leaders will determine whether chaos ensues or peace prevails.\n\nAs 2024 ends and we look to a new year, one thing is clear: the political landscape is changing, and power balances are shifting.\n\nVideo Published On: Saturday, Dec 21, 2024, 08:24 [IST]"

            "article_content": "US stocks soared Friday after tame inflation data and dovish comments from the Fed's Austan Goolsbee.\n\nGoolsbee said he expects interest rates to continue to decline over the next 12-18 months.\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring a potential government shutdown and a big triple-witching day for the options market.\n\nUS stocks surged on Friday, recovering some of the week's losses sparked by a hawkish Federal Reserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 500 points, giving back some of its intraday gains after being up over 800 points. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up over 1%.\n\nThe market opened lower, though it reversed course later in the morning. The gains accelerated after Fed president Austan Goolsbee told CNBC that he expects interest rates to decline \"a fair bit\" over the next 12-18 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoolsbee, along with the broader market, was encouraged by recent inflation data, which came in below economist estimates.\n\nA slide in bond yields also helped stocks through the day, with the 10-year Treasury yield down four basis points to 4.528%.\n\nThe PCE index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.1% month-over-month in November, compared to economist estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, the gauge rose 2.4% versus expectations of 2.5%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're still on path to get to 2% and at least for this new month you don't want to make too much out of any one month, but I'm hopeful that this suggests that the couple of months of firming were more of a bump than a change in path,\" Goolsbee said of the recent inflation data.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4:oo p.m. closing bell on Friday:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns of an imminent government shutdown have also driven recent market volatility. Congress has until midnight on Friday to pass a deal to avert a shutdown.\n\nWhile Congress had a stopgap funding bill in place a few days ago, President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk torpedoed it, complaining about unnecessary spending measures within the bill.\n\nA second attempt to pass a government funding bill endorsed by Trump failed in the House of Representatives late Thursday evening, with a final vote of 174 for and 235 against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has since proposed a new plan that would temporarily keep the government open and fund disaster aid. The bill reportedly has support from Republicans, and is set for a vote later on Friday.\n\nFor his part, President Trump has said that he wants to see an elimination of the debt ceiling, or at least extend a pause of the debt ceiling to 2029 when his second term ends.\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson's new bill does not include the elimination of the debt ceiling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraders are also on watch at the close amid the quarterly \"triple-witching,\" with about $6.5 trillion worth of options tied to stocks and ETFs set to expire.\n\nHere's what else happened today:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn commodities, bonds, and crypto:"

            "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nGenerating income has consistently been a primary goal for investors. To achieve this, they often opt for investments that provide steady and reliable returns over time. Dividend stocks are particularly popular in this regard, as they are well-regarded for offering regular income. Although using cash payouts from a stock portfolio is a popular approach among individuals nearing retirement, building an equity income portfolio is an option available to anyone. Over the years, dividends have significantly enhanced investors\u2019 overall returns, making these stocks a compelling choice for income-focused portfolios. In certain periods, especially when equity returns fell below 10%, dividends have accounted for more than half of the total returns of major market indices, according to LSEG data.\n\nInvestors are increasingly emphasizing the quality of a company\u2019s earnings. Examining factors such as dividends per share, dividend growth, and the stability of dividend payments can provide valuable insights into a company\u2019s financial stability. Those who prioritize businesses with lower debt levels and higher profitability often target well-established, financially robust firms with greater flexibility. These high-quality companies typically demonstrate stronger resilience during market downturns and are more likely to sustain earnings growth across different market conditions.\n\nAlso read: 8 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts\n\nAccording to a report by BlackRock, historically, stocks that consistently grew or maintained their dividends have delivered better performance compared to those that either did not pay dividends or reduced their payouts. During market downturns, dividend-paying stocks often provide a buffer against the volatility of share prices. Companies that issue dividends typically strive to maintain these payments and are generally reluctant to reduce them unless absolutely unavoidable.\n\nWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors often evaluate the dividend yield. Experts recommend focusing on yields within the 3% to 6% range, as higher yields may indicate potential yield traps. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, has also emphasized this point. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI generally like to advocate for an approach of targeting great businesses that might pay closer to a 3% to 4% dividend yield.\u201d\n\nHe further mentioned that these companies tend to gradually increase their payouts, which can enhance annual income streams and help counter the impact of inflation. Regarding companies with lower yields, he noted that they are often associated with more secure businesses and more reliable dividend payments. For example, the Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, has an indicated yield of 2.28%. According to Bollinger, many of the firms in this index are well-established and financially stable. He suggested that creating a diversified portfolio of these companies can provide reassurance, as it builds a solid foundation for a growing stream of passive income, regardless of market fluctuations. He further said:\n\n\u201cWhen stock prices fall, it\u2019s so easy to panic, but dividend investing can overcome that because you\u2019re just trying to stay focused on your income stream. You don\u2019t care so much about the markets\u2019 short-term ups and downs anymore.\u201d\n\nAs a result, investors often include dividend stocks in their portfolios.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we first filtered dividend stocks that have shown at least 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this group, we selected those with dividend yields above 1.5% as of December 20. Lastly, we chose 10 companies that have achieved a share price return of over 30% over the past five years. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields as of December 20. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)\n\nDividend Yield as of December 20: 2.17%\n\n5-Year Share Price Return: 33.8%\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a New York-based manufacturing company that mainly specializes in a wide range of consumer products. The company is a well-known brand in the consumer goods sector, offering products in Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care, and Pet Nutrition. Recently, it has placed significant emphasis on sustainability and expanding its product range. Its goal to make all packaging recyclable by 2025 reflects the growing environmental awareness among consumers and regulators. Through initiatives like renewable energy partnerships, Colgate is aligning its operations with future market demands and regulatory requirements. In the past five years, the stock has surged by nearly 34%.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) posted revenue of $5.03 billion, which showed a 2.4% growth from the same period last year. The revenue also beat analysts\u2019 estimates by $27.2 million. The company has maintained its leadership in the toothpaste market, holding a global market share of 41.6% year to date. It has also remained a leader in the manual toothbrush segment, with a global market share of 32.3% for the same period.\n\nIn addition, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has achieved its sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, alongside growth in operating profit, net income, and earnings per share. Advertising spending rose by 16% during the quarter, driven by science-led innovations in both core and premium products across various price ranges. The company\u2019s strong performance this quarter and year to date has bolstered its confidence that the right strategies are being executed to meet the updated 2024 expectations for organic sales growth and Base Business earnings. These efforts are also aimed at driving cash flow and generating consistent, compounded earnings per share growth.\n\nIn the first nine months of the year, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) reported an operating cash flow of nearly $3 billion. The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on December 11, which remained unchanged from the previous dividend. Overall, it has raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years, which makes CL one of the best stocks with steady dividends. The stock\u2019s dividend yield on December 20 came in at 2.17%.\n\nAs of the close of Q3 2024, 54 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), up from 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $3.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, GQG Partners was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall CL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks with steady dividends. While we acknowledge the potential of CL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nExperimental physicist Daniela Angulo poses with an apparatus in the physics lab at the University of Toronto.\n\nScientists have long known that light can sometimes appear to exit a material before entering it\u2014an effect dismissed as an illusion caused by how waves are distorted by matter.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Toronto, through innovative quantum experiments, say they have demonstrated that \"negative time\" isn't just a theoretical idea\u2014it exists in a tangible, physical sense, deserving closer scrutiny.\n\nThe findings, posted on the preprint server arXiv but not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, have attracted both global attention and skepticism.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these perplexing results highlight a peculiar quirk of quantum mechanics rather than a radical shift in our understanding of time.\n\n\"This is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor specializing in experimental quantum physics.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp channel! Stay up-to-date on the latest science news from Science X.\n\nWhile the term \"negative time\" might sound like a concept lifted from science fiction, Steinberg defends its use, hoping it will spark deeper discussions about the mysteries of quantum physics.\n\nLaser experiments\n\nYears ago, the team began exploring interactions between light and matter.\n\nWhen light particles, or photons, pass through atoms, some are absorbed by the atoms and later re-emitted. This interaction changes the atoms, temporarily putting them in a higher-energy or \"excited\" state before they return to normal.\n\nIn research led by Daniela Angulo, the team set out to measure how long these atoms stayed in their excited state. \"That time turned out to be negative,\" Steinberg explained\u2014meaning a duration less than zero.\n\nTo visualize this concept, imagine cars entering a tunnel: before the experiment, physicists recognized that while the average entry time for a thousand cars might be, for example, noon, the first cars could exit a little sooner, say 11:59 am. This result was previously dismissed as meaningless.\n\nWhat Angulo and colleagues demonstrated was akin to measuring carbon monoxide levels in the tunnel after the first few cars emerged and finding that the readings had a minus sign in front of them.\n\nRelativity intact\n\nThe experiments, conducted in a cluttered basement laboratory bristling with wires and aluminum-wrapped devices, took over two years to optimize. The lasers used had to be carefully calibrated to avoid distorting the results.\n\nStill, Steinberg and Angulo are quick to clarify: no one is claiming time travel is a possibility. \"We don't want to say anything traveled backward in time,\" Steinberg said. \"That's a misinterpretation.\"\n\nThe explanation lies in quantum mechanics, where particles like photons behave in fuzzy, probabilistic ways rather than following strict rules.\n\nInstead of adhering to a fixed timeline for absorption and re-emission, these interactions occur across a spectrum of possible durations\u2014some of which defy everyday intuition.\n\nCritically, the researchers say, this doesn't violate Einstein's theory of special relativity, which dictates that nothing can travel faster than light. These photons carried no information, sidestepping any cosmic speed limits.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

It turns out spelling snafus could be solved by mathematics, thanks to geniuses like Shazeer.\n\nShazeer\u2019s brilliance thrived on boldness. He had invented much of the current revolution in large language models (LLMs).\n\nSome of his inventions include:\n\nSparsely-gated mixture of experts (2016): It utilises a number of \"experts\", each a simple feed-forward neural network, and a trainable gating network which selects a sparse combination of the experts to process each input (\n\nTransformer (2017): He personally designed the multi-head attention, the residual architecture, and coded up the first better-than-state-of-the-art working implementation.\n\nMesh-Tensorflow (2018): The first practical system for training giant Transformers on supercomputers.\n\nT5 (2019): Major contributor to Google\u2019s LaMDA dialog system (a project led by Daniel De Freitas, Shazeer\u2019s co-founder at Character AI).\n\nFast-forward\n\nFast forward two decades to 2021.\n\nShazeer walked away from Google, with Daniel De Freitas, a skilled AI researcher. This tandem with De Freitas was united by a shared vision \u2014 and frustration.\n\nShazeer was raised in a household with a strong academic background: His dad, a multilingual math-teacher-turned engineer, and his mother, a dedicated homemaker, who fostered an environment that valued education and curiosity.\n\nDe Freitas, for his part, spent his early years traveling with his mother. They lived in various countries including Venezuela and the UK and eventually settled in Florida with his adoptive father. His multicultural upbringing exposed De Freitas to diverse cultures and languages, giving him a strong background in natural language processing (NLP).\n\nNLP involves teaching computers to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nWhile working at Google, De Freitas and Shazeer developed \"Meena\", an advanced chatbot praised for its conversational capabilities.\n\nBloomberg reported in August that Character.AI co-founders Noam Shazeer (right) and Daniel De Freitas were \u201chired\u201d by Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent firm), along with some members of its research team, in a \u201clicensing deal\u201d. Image Credit: Character AI\n\nTogether, they had developed Meena, an advanced AI chatbot destined to reshape conversational AI. Yet, Google hesitated, shelving the project. The reason was unclear.\n\nDisillusioned, the pair left to chart their own course, founding Character.AI, a platform that would become synonymous with cutting-edge generative AI.\n\nWhy did he leave Google?\n\n\u201cI have always been excited about AI,\" Shazeer said in an interview on a16z.com. \"I just wanted to move, push technology forward.\u201d\n\nLarge Language Models Large Language Models (LLMs) are computer programs that can understand and generate text, much like a human.\n\n\n\nThey work by studying huge amounts of text from the internet, books, and other sources, learning patterns, meanings, and how words fit together.\n\n\n\nSo, when you ask them a question or give them a task (like writing an email), they use what they've learned to predict and create a response that makes sense.\n\n\n\nThink of them as super-smart text predictors that can chat, write, and answer questions!\n\nCharacter.AI\n\nAfter Character.ai was launched, it soared, raising over $150 million in funding. But the story didn\u2019t end there.\n\nCharacter.ai is new kind of conversational AI. Unlike typical chatbots, Character.ai enables users to interact with AI personas that simulate human conversation on a deep level. Users can engage with historical figures, fictional characters, or entirely customised personas.\n\nSome kids (including my 11-year-old son Toffee) describe it as the \"app for weirdos\".\n\nCharacter.AI has faced criticism.\n\nFor one, the app allows users to create and interact with AI personas, including fictional characters, celebrities, and historical figures. It's a deliberate choice on the part of its creators, with niche use-cases, unconventional user behaviour, and a unique way of engaging users with AI-generated personalities.\n\nMany users engage in role-playing or fantasy-based conversations, which can range from innocent fun to deeply personal or unconventional scenarios.\n\nCases against Character.ai The AI chatbot platform has faced serious allegations linking its services to user self-harm and suicide. Notably:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Florida Lawsuit (October 2024): Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character.AI and Google, alleging that the platform contributed to her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III's suicide. The lawsuit claims that Sewell developed an emotional relationship with a chatbot impersonating Daenerys Targaryen from \"Game of Thrones,\" which led to his tragic death.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Texas Lawsuit (December 2024): Two families in Texas sued Character.AI, alleging that the platform encouraged self-harm and provided inappropriate content to their children. One case involved a 17-year-old who began self-harming after a chatbot introduced the topic, while another involved exposure to inappropriate content, New York Post reported.\n\n\n\nIn response to these incidents, Character.AI has implemented new safety measures, including separate language models for adult and teenage users, stricter content restrictions, and parental controls to monitor usage.\n\nYet the high level of customisation that Character.AI brings to the realm of chatbots cannot be denied. Moreover, the imaginative interaction appeals to niche communities, though it may seem eccentric or \u201cweird\u201d to outsiders.\n\nThe platform's other key strength: natural-language understanding and adaptability, thus creating immersive and life-like interactions.\n\n$ 2.7 b amount reportedly paid by Google to take back Noam Shazeer\n\nNow, in a twist worthy of a Hollywood script, reports surfaced in August 2024 that Shazeer and DeFreitas were returning to their roots \u2014 Google.\n\nThe tech giant, perhaps eager to reclaim its prodigal sons, reportedly paid a staggering $2.7 million to bring Shazeer back into the fold.\n\nCHARACTER.AI FEATURES One of Character.ai\u2019s standout features is its customisation. Users can craft their own unique AI characters by setting their personalities, backstories, and responses.\n\n\n\nThis flexibility has attracted creators, educators, and enthusiasts who enjoy building characters tailored to specific needs, whether for entertainment, role-playing, or learning.\n\n\n\nDiverse Use Cases\n\nCharacter.ai is not just for casual conversation\u2014it caters to diverse applications. Students use it to \"talk\" with historical figures for educational purposes.\n\n\n\nWriters use it as a tool for brainstorming ideas with fictional characters, and fans use it to interact with avatars of their favorite icons. It\u2019s a fusion of learning, creativity, and entertainment.\n\n\n\nCharacter.ai is built with privacy in mind, as interactions on the platform are not stored for long-term use, prioritizing user trust. It\u2019s also designed to be intuitive, requiring no technical skills to create or interact with characters, making it accessible for both casual users and professionals.\n\n\u201cI am super excited to return to Google and work as part of the Google DeepMind team,\u201d Shazeer told TechCrunch. \u201cSo proud of everything we\u2019ve built at Character.AI over the last three years.\u201d\n\nDeepMind\n\nGoogle, too, made no attempt to hide its enthusiasm. In a statement dripping with admiration, the company said: \"We\u2019re particularly thrilled to welcome back Noam, a preeminent researcher in machine learning, who is joining Google\u2019s DeepMind research team, along with a small number of his colleagues.\"\n\nDeFreitas, equally integral to this saga, is also set to rejoin the search titan, solidifying their return as a monumental homecoming for Google.\n\nSpecific figures for Daniel De Freitas's return have not been publicly disclosed. Since both played key roles in the creation of Character.AI and are valuable AI researchers, it is likely that De Freitas's compensation was similarly significant, though details remain speculative.\n\nHigh-stake AI\n\nAs part of the agreement, Character.AI will reportedly benefit from increased funding, ensuring that the legacy of their groundbreaking work lives on.\n\nFrom maverick departures to celebrated returns, Shazeer\u2019s story (and, by extension, De Freitas's too) is a testament to the unrelenting push-and-pull of innovation in the high-stakes world of AI."
