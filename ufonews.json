            "source": "NJ.com",
            "article_content": "My cats are not usually picky about much, but they hate one thing: a traditional water bowl.\n\nThey\u2019d rather not drink water at all if it\u2019s not moving. So much so, that my one cat wound up developing crystals and had to have emergency surgery to remove a blockage. How dramatic!\n\nBut thankfully they both love water fountains. They liked the Petlibro fountain I originally got, but it pales in comparison to how much they like this BUETEKA water fountain from Chewy. I\u2019d like to think it is because it is shaped like a UFO and they are just two tiny aliens who live in my home.\n\nMy cats, Luna and Sirius, have expensive tastes. They\u2019re on a wet-food exclusive prescription diet, have two different Litter Robots to do their business, and they liked the $50 water fountain significantly more than the $30 one I originally bought.\n\nThey must get their expensive taste from me, their mother, because I liked this fountain more, as well.\n\nMy initial reason for liking the BUETEKA water fountain more was simply aesthetics. I bought this because it is a cute little UFO. It also has near-excellent reviews: 4.5 stars and nearly 500 ratings on Chewy. Over 80% of the people who own this love it so much, they gave it 5 stars, and I am also someone who\u2019d rate it 5 stars.\n\nBUETEKA Cat Water Fountain Features\n\nThis Chewy cat water fountain has a number of features that stand out, including:\n\nA unique catnip ball dispenser\n\nA 1.6L water tank\n\n2 water flow modes and an adjustable water outlet pipe\n\nA visible water-level indicator\n\nAn ultra-quiet smart pump\n\nMultiple filters that help to sterilize the water and remove hair, debris, and impurities\n\nA small footprint: 7.87 inches L x 7.87 inches W x 8.27 inches H\n\nWe don\u2019t use the catnip ball in the dispenser, because Luna and Sirius get rowdy enough in the middle of the night, the last thing I need is catnip hyping them up for 3 AM zoomies.\n\nThe water level indicator makes it very easy to spot how much water is in the fountain, so you know when it is low and needs to be refilled. Between my two cats, I typically only need to refill it twice a week.\n\nThis fountain is also whisper quiet. You can faintly hear the water if the room is dead quiet, but otherwise, it seamlessly blends into background noise. However, you will hear the fountain if the filter needs to be changed or the water level is too low.\n\nIt comes with two filters, and you can buy a replacement pack of six for $20 from Chewy. The reason you\u2019ll hear it more is that the fountain has to work harder to filter the water if the filter is old or the machine is too low on water, thus causing more sound. But, if you\u2019re up to date on switching out the filter and not letting the water levels get too low, you won\u2019t hear this fountain at all.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a cat water fountain?\n\nIf you own a cat, you\u2019ve probably spotted them trying to drink water from the faucet once or twice. Sirius used to love doing this. Cats like moving water, thanks to their ancestors preferring to drink from moving streams over puddles in the wild.\n\nThere are some health benefits to buying a cat water fountain though, outside of letting your cat feel like they\u2019re the lion of the house.\n\nFountains encourage more drinking\n\nDrinking from a water fountain can help prevent health issues, like cystitis, urinary crystals, kidney issues, and more\n\nFountain designs can lessen whisker fatigue\n\nThe first two go hand in hand. The more water your cat drinks, the less likely they are to develop urinary crystals or have kidney issues. Increasing water intake is often a key strategy your veterinarian will implement if your pet is experiencing any of these issues. I know it firsthand, as Sirius developed crystals in 2023 due to previously having a diet that consisted of mainly dry food and he used to only have an old-school water bowl. After his surgery, we switched him to a water fountain and a wet food diet, and then the crystals pretty much vanished. He\u2019s now gone 13 months without issue.\n\nHis sister Luna has also reaped the benefits, not needing the water fountain like her brother, but she is still drinking water more now and making far less of a mess at her food and water station.\n\nWhy this cat water fountain?\n\nI have my theories on why my cats prefer the BUETEKA fountain over the original fountain I initially bought. They still use the other one, but I find them drinking from the BUETEKA fountain significantly more.\n\nThere is a little more space between the water dish and the spout on the BUETEKA fountain. I\u2019d assume that this allows them more space to catch the moving water before it hits the bowl. This is also a circle design, instead of an oval, so again, there is a little more space for them to stick their head over the bowl to get to the fountain\u2019s spout.\n\nThe BUETEKA water fountain also has a light blue light that is easy for cats to see, even in the dark. But it is not so bright that it will keep a human awake at night. Whereas the other fountain they have does not have a light for them to find the fountain at night.\n\nThe #1 feature about this water fountain that makes it infinitely better than the other fountain we own is that I never have to unplug it from the wall to clean it. The power cord connects in the middle, not the end that plugs into the wall, which makes this very easy to unplug without having to crawl around to get to the wall plug. This makes cleaning the water fountain substantially easier. It comes apart in seconds and I can wash each part in under a minute. I can either let it air dry or I can wipe it down and replace the water all in under five minutes.\n\nIt is simple to use, easy to clean, and only $50, which really is not that expensive for a product that my cats love and use every single day.\n\nGet the Bueteka Spaceship Ultra-Quiet Dog & Cat Water Fountain from Chewy for $50."

            "article_content": "An upcoming documentary about the UFO/UAP phenomenon promises to be the most well-sourced and credible film every made about the buzzy topic and its first trailer has just been released (below).\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. As announced earlier Wednesday, The Age of the Disclosure has earned first-time director Farah a coveted premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival, where it will screen at the historic Paramount Theatre in March.\n\nSome of the officials interviewed include newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to this subject, \u201ceven presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis\u201d), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama).\n\nFrom the official description: \u201cThe film was granted unprecedented access and support from senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of UAP as a result of their work for the U.S. Government. The film exposes the profound impact the situation has on the future of humanity, while providing a look behind the scenes with those at the forefront of the bipartisan disclosure effort.\u201d\n\nJim Semivan, who spent 25 years as a senior official with the CIA, says in the trailer: \u201cUAPs are here, they are real and they are not human.\u201d Adds Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force: \u201cThe first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\u201d\n\nFormer Department of Defense official and longtime UAP disclosure advocate Christopher Mellon declares, \u201cThis is the biggest discovery in human history,\u201d while former Department of Defense official and member of the government\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program Luis Elizondo says, \u201cYou have information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species.\u201d\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure was made in secret over the past two years and filmmakers are currently in talks for commercial distribution plans; Cinetic is handling domestic sales.\n\nThe film follows a surge of public interest in the subject and two bipartisan congressional hearings over the past year where former officials and whistleblowers gave testimony claiming non-human intelligent life has visited Earth and that the U.S. has been engaged in a decades-long cover-up in an effort to reverse-engineer alien technology.\n\nFarah\u2019s producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018. The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films production, in association with Born Ready Films. Produced and directed by Farah, executive producers are Colin Frederick, Andrew Farah and Shara Senderoff."

            "article_content": "All sorts of ghosts from the altruistic to the diabolic haunt movies, but it takes a while to get a bead on the entity drifting, and at times racing, through Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cPresence.\u201d However benign or malicious \u2014 whatever its life or death, possible eternal salvation or never-ending damnation \u2014 this spirit seizes your attention from the get-go because everything in this twisty, technically virtuosic, surprisingly moving chiller is shot from its point of view. From the moment the movie opens, you see what it sees: the good, the banal, the private, the scary. The kicker? Soderbergh is holding the camera \u2014 he\u2019s the ghost in this machine.\n\nIt\u2019s a typically well-oiled, polished, frictionless Soderbergh whatsit. Like many ghost stories, it takes place in one of the most historically troubled of all movie locations: an outwardly normal family home. There, in an attractive two-story suburban house with plenty of natural light, a wraparound front porch and a spacious backyard, the spirit wanders the handsome, blandly tasteful rooms and looks out the many windows. Although apparently confined to the house\u2019s interior, it never feels trapped. Even so, given all the mileage that it racks up as it moves from the downstairs kitchen to the upstairs bedrooms, it is demonstratively restless.\n\nThe ghost seems pretty benign despite the unease it stirs up. It\u2019s attentive and obviously interested in the family of four that moves in soon after \u201cPresence\u201d opens. If anything, the ghost seems eager for company. It routinely follows the family around, particularly the daughter, Chloe (Callina Liang, lovely), like a faithful dog \u2014 that is if that pooch were invisible and human size. (The height of the ghost\u2019s point of view is a tell.) It\u2019s curious yet also seems reserved. It likes to hang out in Chloe\u2019s closet and when she takes a shower, it stays outside the bathroom and tidies up, which suggests that it\u2019s not \u2014 or, rather, wasn\u2019t \u2014 a creep.\n\nThe screenwriter David Koepp seeds the story with such clues, giving you just enough back story and present-day information to stir your curiosity and keep you guessing as he and Soderbergh ratchet up your anxiety. A genre savant with a raft of big credits (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d), Koepp has an affinity for stories set in confined locations, especially those outwardly safe spaces that become mousetraps: He wrote David Fincher\u2019s \u201cPanic Room,\u201d a thriller set almost entirely inside a brownstone, as well as Soderbergh\u2019s thriller, \u201cKIMI,\u201d about an agoraphobic woman swept up in an intrigue. \u201cPresence\u201d is another ideal trap to trip for a filmmaker who enjoys challenges and changing it up artistically as much as Soderbergh does."

He worries about his teen kids, a competitive swimmer named Tyler (Eddy Maday) and a despondent, socially cloistered student named Chloe (Callina Liang).\n\nTwo of Chloe\u2019s friends recently died, suspected victims of drug overdoses, or possibly suicide.\n\nA despondent, socially cloistered student named Chloe (Callina Liang) is spied upon by an invisible entity in the closet in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s scareless ghost movie \u201cPresence.\u201d Courtesy of Neon\n\nChris pushes Chloe to be more outgoing and get on with life. Rebekah dismisses him and says time will be the best medicine, setting up a cold war of not-so-passive resistance between the two.\n\nMeanwhile, Tyler refuses to cut Sis any slack, accusing her of acting weird and being embarrassing. He does, however, introduce her to his friend, Ryan (West Mulholland), a confident kid with a mop of hair and a seductive approach that seems perfect for the insecure Chloe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about you,\u201d he coos. \u201cYou are in control.\u201d\n\nRemember, we witness all of this domestic drama as the entity, constantly roaming through the house, ducking into closets and corners undetected. Except when Chloe senses its presence and believes it might be one of her deceased friends.\n\nShe nearly freaks when she discovers that something has moved her books around and tidied up her room while she took a shower.\n\nWhen we, the entity, trash a closet and knock things off the furniture, Chris and Rebekah reluctantly allow a woman with Second Sight, Lisa (Natalie Woolams-Torres), into the house to communicate with us, the entity.\n\nA strong-willed wife and mother (Lucy Liu) senses she is being watched (and she is!) in \u201cPresence.\u201d Courtesy of Neon\n\n\u201cIt is confused,\u201d Lisa says. She reports that the spirit feels a need to accomplish something but doesn\u2019t know what.\n\nSoderbergh \u2014 director/cinematographer/editor using two pseudonyms \u2014 takes a bold gamble to create an appealing supernatural tale that doesn\u2019t qualify as horror and barely squeezes its thriller credentials in under the wire.\n\nHe uses strong actors, with superlative performances by Sullivan, Liu and especially a transcendent Liang, in a story that, like \u201cHeretic,\u201d proves the existence of God and the afterlife in the final shot.\n\nStill, \u201cPresence\u201d does not fully work for me.\n\nSo many inconsistent details kept me from buying into the story\u2019s internal logic.\n\nWhy do we, the entity, spend so much time apparently walking backward? To keep characters coming toward the camera perfectly in frame?\n\nWhy do we, the entity, race up staircases to observe something on the second floor in some scenes (consistent with the point-of-view), but in other scenes, Soderbergh simply cuts to the second floor?\n\nWhen we, the entity, destroy a closet and wreck a bedroom, why do we, the audience, see it as if we\u2019re standing on the other side of the room?\n\nWhy does the movie demonstrate that we, the entity, possess the ability to violently move and destroy objects, but when a character\u2019s life becomes threatened, we, the entity, inexplicably become powerless to interfere?\n\nHey, it\u2019s a ghost movie.\n\nAnd one that might make Chekhov turn over in his grave.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nStarring: Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, Eddy Maday, West Mulholland\n\nDirected by: Steven Soderbergh\n\nOther: A Neon theatrical release. Rated R for teen drinking, language, sexual situations. 85 minutes."

The platform features an open application programming interface library and adapter modules and incorporates BioNeMo\u2019s AI and machine learning modeling capabilities into its workflows. BioNeMo is a collection of ready-made tools for designing and training biomolecular AI models for drug discovery, protein engineering, and virtual screening processes.\n\nThe proof-of-concept was designed to demonstrate the power of pairing AI with lab orchestration to automate molecular screening. Using both solutions, Artificial automated a workflow for screening candidate compounds for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease which is critical for viral replication and a target for COVID-19 therapies. The results \u201csuccessfully demonstrated how AI-driven methodologies can accelerate virtual screening and drug discovery processes,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile highlighting the benefits of the integration, Artificial\u2019s CEO David Fuller noted that \u201cto accelerate the development of gene therapies and life-saving drugs, or rapid pandemic response, the industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting the latest breakthroughs in AI and machine learning\u2014it is where the market is heading.\u201d\n\nThe company also announced that it has received ISO 27001 and SOC 2 accreditations, which \u201creflect our dedication to our customers\u2019 security and compliance needs and give them confidence in our solutions as they go on this journey,\u201d he added. ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management, validates Artificial\u2019s framework for protecting data and minimizing security risks. The SOC 2 accreditation recognizes the company\u2019s operational transparency and commitment to safeguarding sensitive information.\n\nArtificial will showcase its platform during the 2025 Society of Laboratory Automation and Screening Conference which is taking place in San Diego, CA.\n\nThe partnership with Artificial is just one of several involving the use of Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities. Recently, Nvidia announced a partnership with Mayo Clinic focused on applying AI to digital pathology. The company also has an agreement with Illumina to pair AI and genomics technologies for use in drug discovery, clinical research, and health applications."

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nThe Asian banking sector in 2025 is set to roar as it stands at the forefront of a global transformation in financial services.\n\nWith annual revenues from corporate and investment banking (CIB) exceeding USD $1.4 trillion, the region commands nearly half of the world\u2019s CIB revenues. Currently, it is also projected to sustain 7% annual growth through 2027. According to Fitch Ratings, Asia\u2019s banking landscape has been reaping the benefits from the stabilising interest rates and positive economic momentum, with pockets of opportunity emerging across diverse markets.\n\nTransaction banking, which includes cash management and trade finance, has also been pivotal in driving growth and deepening client relationships across Asia. Additionally, private credit\u2019s rise in Asia\u2019s financial markets offers an exciting avenue for innovation and competitive positioning.\n\nFollowing a recent webinar on Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond, we\u2019ve invited some notable players in the financial landscape to walk us through the latest up-and-coming trends within the banking sector in this region.\n\nThe Asian financial landscape is being revolutionised at lightning speed by innovation. However, amidst this whirlwind, distinguishing actionable trends from the noise is becoming more and more challenging.\n\nEmphasis on Profitability and Growth\n\nTo begin the 2025 list of top banking trends in Asia, we first must take a look at what drives banks the most\u2014profits and growth.\n\nThe journey towards profitability and sustained growth has always become a central theme for digital banks, not just in Asia but also across the globe. Jessica Lam, Group Chief Strategy Officer at WeLab, highlighted that, after years of financial discipline during challenging market conditions (especially during the COVID-19 era), banks are now positioned to focus on scaling their operations.\n\nShe noted that stabilised markets have created an environment ripe for expansion. This is where institutions can confidently invest in new technologies and enter untapped markets.\n\nJessica remarked, \u201cNow that many of us have proven the proof of concept works, the next step is scaling up responsibly.\u201d\n\nThis transition signifies a shift from merely surviving economic turbulence to thriving by leveraging improved financial frameworks and consumer trust. Furthermore, many banks are now exploring strategic partnerships and collaborations, particularly in Southeast Asia, to accelerate growth and streamline operations.\n\nHyper-Personalisation Through AI\n\nAs seen in the top 5 trends shaping the fintech scene in Singapore, AI has been the talk of the town for the banking sector since it first shared its limelight back in 2020. This came as no surprise, as Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to create highly personalised banking experiences\n\nAlbert Tinio, Co-CEO of GoTyme Bank Philippines, emphasised that AI\u2019s potential lies in its ability to understand individual customer behaviours and preferences at an unprecedented scale. This enables banks to offer bespoke financial solutions tailored to the specific needs of each customer. By doing so, they enhance satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAlbert elaborated, \u201cWe\u2019re now able to create hyper-connected ecosystems where data shared securely can benefit the end customer.\u201d\n\nSuch hyper-connectivity is not limited to financial services. It also extends across industries, enabling seamless integration of financial tools into everyday activities.\n\nMeanwhile, Taruni Ramamurthi, Head of FSI Malaysia and Philippines at Amazon Web Services, underscored the ethical considerations of AI deployment.\n\nShe stated that AI should be a tool to enhance human-centric banking, ensuring customer trust remains intact. With AI being widely adopted for fraud detection, compliance, and customer engagement, banks are focusing on ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\nThese efforts aim to build and maintain consumer confidence. Generative AI applications are also gaining traction, allowing banks to automate complex processes such as risk analysis and predictive modelling. This, in turn, improves efficiency significantly.\n\nOpen Banking and Collaboration\n\nOpen banking is also gradually becoming a reality across Asia, albeit at varying levels of adoption. Albert highlighted the slow but steady progress in the Philippines. Regulators are working to ensure that consumer consent and data security are prioritised.\n\n\u201cFor open banking to succeed, all institutions need to embrace collaboration and share data responsibly,\u201d Albert stated.\n\nThis collaborative model allows customers to access a consolidated view of their financial information, enabling them to make more informed decisions. Open banking also fosters innovation, as fintechs and third-party providers can develop new products and services through secure API integrations.\n\nJessica echoed these sentiments, adding that the true potential of open banking lies in its ability to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem. Open banking could drive significant advancements in financial inclusion across underserved markets. All of this can be made possible by lowering barriers to entry for new players and promoting interoperability.\n\nBranches Reinvented\n\nThe debate surrounding the relevance of physical branches in the digital era continues. However, their role is undoubtedly evolving. Taruni described branches as becoming \u201cexperience centres\u201d designed to address specific customer needs, such as financial education and community engagement.\n\nIn regions like Southeast Asia, where access to the internet remains uneven, branches serve as critical touchpoints for unbanked populations.\n\nJessica also weighed in on the transformation of branches, stating, \u201cThe purpose of branches should evolve to complement digital offerings, creating seamless customer experiences.\u201d\n\nShe suggested that future branches could blend digital tools with personalised human interactions to bridge the gap between traditional and digital banking. For instance, branches could host financial literacy workshops or offer specialised advisory services for small businesses. This approach fosters deeper customer relationships.\n\nAdding to this global shift, some Hong Kong digital banks are rethinking their strategies and considering physical branches following the HKMA\u2019s recent rule change, as reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP). This change, aimed at supporting growth, allows for limited physical branches and has prompted digital banks like WeLab Bank, ZA Bank, and Mox Bank to explore offline strategies.\n\nWhile Livi Bank remains fully digital, other players see this as an opportunity to enhance trust and customer experience through face-to-face interactions and advisory services. Traditional banks in Hong Kong are also adapting by focusing on prime locations to attract wealth-management clients or integrating hybrid models, blending sustainability and digital-forward designs.\n\nSuch evolution highlights how branches are increasingly becoming versatile touchpoints that cater to both digital natives and those who value in-person banking experiences.\n\nIn addition, Frankie Wai, Business Solution Director at Temenos, mentioned that technology can further enhance the utility of branches. Features like biometric authentication and AI-powered kiosks could make in-branch services more efficient and appealing to tech-savvy customers while still catering to those who prefer face-to-face interactions.\n\nRegulatory and Ethical Challenges\n\nAs the banking sector embraces technological advancements, the importance of ethical considerations and regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly apparent. Frankie stressed that transparency and accountability must underpin the adoption of AI and open banking.\n\n\u201cRegulators are increasingly focusing on ensuring that technological advancements are used responsibly to safeguard consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nOne key area of concern is data privacy. With the rise of open banking and AI-driven insights, banks are handling vast amounts of sensitive customer information. This requires robust security measures and clear guidelines to prevent misuse.\n\nFurthermore, regulators across Asia are introducing frameworks to govern the ethical use of AI. These frameworks aim to ensure that algorithms do not perpetuate bias or discrimination.\n\nPayment Innovation and Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nThe payments sector is undergoing significant transformation, with cross-border interoperability emerging as a major focus area. Frankie also highlighted Asia\u2019s adoption of global payment standards like ISO 20022. These standards enable seamless and transparent regional transactions.\n\nHe believes that collaboration across borders will redefine how SMEs and individuals engage in international commerce.\n\nProjects such as Nexus, which aim to link payment systems across countries, are poised to create a unified regional payment ecosystem. These advancements not only facilitate trade but also empower micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to expand their reach.\n\nTaruni added that such innovations could be instrumental in driving financial inclusion, particularly for women entrepreneurs and underserved communities.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of AI in payment systems is streamlining operations, enhancing fraud detection, and improving user experiences. From biometric authentication to real-time transaction monitoring, these advancements are setting new benchmarks for efficiency and security in the payments landscape.\n\nThe Asian Edge\n\nThe trends show that the banking sector in Asia in 2025 reflects a unique confluence of rapid growth, innovation, and challenges that set it apart from other regions. The region\u2019s CIB market is growing faster than any other globally, with SMEs and green infrastructure investments acting as pivotal drivers.\n\nHowever, these opportunities exist alongside persistent risks such as volatile real estate markets in China and regulatory uncertainties. Comparatively, while Western economies focus on streamlining mature banking systems, Asia\u2019s landscape requires a nuanced approach to cater to diverse markets and evolving customer expectations.\n\nThe ability to balance technological advancement with ethical practices will be critical. Asia\u2019s banking leaders are well-positioned to redefine the global narrative, focusing on financial inclusion, sustainability, and innovation.\n\nInstitutions that adopt agile strategies and invest in cutting-edge technologies are likely to outpace their competitors, shaping the region\u2019s banking landscape for decades to come. In this pivotal era, Asia is not merely adapting to global banking trends but rather defining them.\n\nThe top banking trends in Asia showcase how the region is leveraging innovation to transform its financial landscape. With advancements in AI, open banking, and cross-border payments, Asia is setting benchmarks for global banking practices.\n\nCatch up on the Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond webinar to dive deeper into the trends that are redefining the financial landscape in Asia.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from Freepik"

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily K-12 Dive newsletter.\n\nThe last year was crucial for K-12 leaders seeking national and state resources to guide their schools and districts in integrating artificial intelligence into the classroom.\n\nBut just as schools received more AI support and tips from both the federal government and national organizations, warning signals on the repercussions of misusing the technology also emerged. From burgeoning lawsuits to a proliferation of deepfakes in schools, these challenges may slow schools down in their efforts to roll out AI tools, according to some K-12 technology experts.\n\nMaking the future even hazier, experts say they are uncertain how federal support for AI in K-12 will fare during President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nAs schools navigate the complexities around using AI in classrooms, here are four trends to look out for in 2025.\n\nDistrict and state AI guidance will rise\n\nWhile it\u2019s still unclear what direction federal AI policies for education will take under the second Trump administration, it\u2019s likely that schools will have to rely more on national organizations and nonprofits for high-level guidance in 2025 \u2014 and for several years to follow, said Kris Hagel, chief information officer at Peninsula School District in Gig Harbor, Washington.\n\nOver the past two years, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Educational Technology developed useful AI resources and guidance, said Pat Yongpradit, chief academic officer of Code.org and lead for TeachAI. But Yongpradit said he doesn\u2019t expect similar federal assistance in the near future.\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s AI resources \u201creally set the tone for state education agencies,\u201d Yongpradit said, adding that \u201cregardless of what happens with the Ed Department, state education agencies are going to take it from there.\u201d\n\nWith more states expected to continue rolling out their own AI resources for schools, Yongpradit said he foresees more school districts following suit with their own policies.\n\nAs of November, 24 states had released guidance for AI in education, according to TeachAI, a national coalition that aims to guide schools on safe and ethical AI use. Code.org is a nonprofit that provides computer science curriculum and programs to schools.\n\nMore AI tools will be tailored to special education and English learners\n\nWith special education teachers increasingly expressing interest in AI tools, Yongpradit said he\u2019s hopeful \u201cmore tailored experiences\u201d will be on the horizon for this sector.\n\nStory Continues"

The clip, released to promote his memoir Source Code, delves into Gates' fourth-grade experience of bringing a cow lung to school for a show-and-tell activity.\n\nRecalling the incident, Gates shared how his teacher had asked the students to bring something \"interesting\" for show-and-tell. After discussing it with his father, Gates took up an unusual suggestion. \"My dad said, \u2018We could go to the slaughterhouse and get a cow lung,\u2019 and I thought that was a great idea,\" Gates revealed.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe young Gates accompanied his father to the slaughterhouse, picked up the organ, and wrapped it in a white sheet to take to school. Upon unveiling the cow lung in his classroom, his classmates reacted with a mix of fascination and revulsion. Gates performed experiments on the organ, using it to demonstrate how lungs work. \"When I unwrapped it, it was a mixture of awe and disgust. Yeah, I actually didn\u2019t use gloves,\" he admitted in the video.\n\nGates recreated the experiment in the video, this time donning gloves as he handled the organ. He humorously recounted how one of his classmates fainted during his original demonstration. Reflecting on his teacher\u2019s reaction, he recalled her saying, \u201cHey, that was great, but get that thing out of here.\u201d Gates described the experiment as a \u201cbig hit\u201d among his peers at the time.\n\nThe video served as a promotional piece for Source Code, Gates\u2019 first memoir, which he says shares stories from his childhood and the early days of Microsoft. In the memoir, Gates reflects on the experiences, lessons, and relationships that shaped his life and career.\n\n\n\nAccording to GatesNotes, his personal blog, Source Code details the foundation of his life, exploring key moments that defined his journey from a curious child to a global tech icon. The memoir also highlights his vision and the choices that steered his professional and personal development.\n\nGates, who co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975 after dropping out of Harvard, has become one of the most influential figures in technology and philanthropy. He stepped down from Microsoft\u2019s board in 2020 and has since focused on global challenges such as climate change, health crises, and technology-driven solutions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAt the time of stepping down, Gates owned around 1.3% of Microsoft\u2019s shares. By 2022, his philanthropic efforts had led him to donate billions in Microsoft shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing his ownership to less than 1%.\n\nOver the years, Gates has authored several books addressing critical global issues, including pandemics, climate change, and technological advancements. However, Source Code marks his first foray into a deeply personal account, providing a glimpse into the man behind the achievements.\n\n\"When my teacher said 'bring something interesting' for show-and-tell, I don\u2019t think she expected a cow lung,\" Gates wrote in the caption of the video. \"It\u2019s just one of many stories from my childhood that I share in my new memoir, Source Code.\""

            "article_content": "Technology trends almost always prioritize speed, but the latest fad in artificial intelligence involves deliberately slowing chatbots down. Machine-learning researchers and major tech companies, including OpenAI and Google, are shifting focus from ever larger model sizes and training datasets to instead emphasize something called \u201ctest-time compute.\u201d\n\nThis strategy is often described as giving AI more time to \u201cthink\u201d or \u201creason,\u201d though these models work more rigidly than human brains do. It\u2019s not as though an AI model is granted new freedoms to mull over a problem. Instead test-time compute introduces structured interventions in which computer systems are built to double-check their work through intermediate calculations or extra algorithms applied to their final responses. It\u2019s more akin to making an exam open-book than it is to simply extending a time limit.\n\nAnother name for the newly popular AI-improvement strategy (which has actually been around for few years) is \u201cinference scaling.\u201d Inference is the process by which a previously trained AI crunches through new data to perform a freshly prompted task, whether that\u2019s generating text or flagging spam e-mails. By allowing additional seconds or minutes to elapse between a user\u2019s prompt and the program\u2019s response, and by providing extra computational power at the program\u2019s critical moment of inference, some AI developers have seen a dramatic jump in the accuracy of chatbot answers.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nTest-time compute is especially helpful for quantitative questions. \u201cThe places we\u2019ve seen the most exciting improvements are things like code and math,\u201d says Amanda Bertsch, a fourth-year computer science Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, where she studies natural language processing. Bertsch explains that test-time compute offers the most benefit when there\u2019s an objectively correct response or a measurable way of determining \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s recently released o1, its latest publicly available model powering ChatGPT-style bots, is much better at writing computer code and correctly answering math and science queries than its predecessors, the company claims: a recent blog post describes o1 as up to eight times more accurate in responding to prompts used in programming competitions and nearly 40 percent more accurate at answering Ph.D.-level physics, biology and chemistry questions. OpenAI attributes these improvements to test-time compute and related strategies. And a follow-up model called o3\u2014still undergoing safety testing and planned for release later this month\u2014is nearly three times as accurate as o1 in responding to certain reasoning questions, says Lindsay McCallum R\u00e9my, a communications officer at OpenAI.\n\nOther academic analyses, most released as preprint studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed, have reported similarly impressive results. Test-time compute could improve AI accuracy and its capacity to tackle complex reasoning problems, says Aviral Kumar, an assistant professor of computer science and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University. He\u2019s excited about his field\u2019s shift toward this strategy because it grants machines the same grace we give people when they take an extra beat to tackle tough questions. He thinks this could bring us closer to models with humanlike intelligence.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they all make models a little bit better. And we really don't understand what the relationships are between them.\u201d \u2014Jacob Andreas, associate professor of computer science\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t, test-time compute offers a practical alternative to prevailing methods of improving large language models, or LLMs. The costly, brute-force approach of building ever larger models and training them on increasingly massive datasets is now offering diminishing returns. Bertsch says test-time compute has proven its worth in making \u201cconsistent performance gains\u201d\u2014without inflating already-unwieldy models or forcing developers to scrounge additional high-quality data from a dwindling supply. Yet increasing test time can\u2019t solve everything; it has its own trade-offs and limits.\n\nA Big Umbrella\n\nAI developers have multiple ways to adjust the test-time compute process and thus improve model outputs. \u201cIt\u2019s a really broad set of things,\u201d Bertsch says, \u201cpretty much anything where you\u2019re treating a model like part of a system and building scaffolding around it.\u201d\n\nThe most rudimentary method is something anyone with a computer can do at home: asking a chatbot to produce many responses to a single question. Generating more answers requires more time, which means the inference process takes longer. One way to think about it: the user becomes a layer of human scaffolding that guides the model to the most accurate, or best-suited, answer.\n\nAnother basic method involves prompting a chatbot to report the intermediate steps it takes to solve a problem. Called \u201cchain-of-thought\u201d prompting, this strategy was formally outlined in a 2022 preprint paper by Google researchers. Similarly, a user can also simply ask an LLM to double-check or improve an output after it has been generated.\n\nSome assessments indicate that chain-of-thought prompting and related self-correction methods improve model outputs, though other research demonstrates that these strategies are unreliable\u2014prone to producing the same sorts of hallucinations as other chatbot outputs. To reduce unreliability, many test-time strategies use an external \u201cverifier\u201d\u2014an algorithm trained to grade model outputs, based on preset criteria, and to select the output that offers the best step toward a specific goal.\n\nVerifiers can be applied after a model has generated a list of possible responses. When an LLM generates computer code, for example, a verifier could be as simple as a program that runs the code to make sure it works. Other verifiers might guide a model through each juncture of a multistep problem. Some versions of test-time compute combine the logic of these approaches by using verifiers that evaluate a model\u2019s output in both ways: as a stepwise process, with many possible branching paths, and as a final response. Other systems use verifiers to find errors in a chatbot\u2019s initial output or chain of thought\u2014and then give the LLM feedback to correct those problems.\n\nTest-time compute is so successful for quantitative problems because all verifiers hinge on the existence of a knowable, correct answer (or at least an objective basis for comparing two options), Bertsch says. The strategy is less effective for improving outputs such as poems or translations, in which ranking is subjective.\n\nIn a slight departure from all of the above, machine-learning developers can also use the same sorts of algorithms to hone a model during development and training and then apply them during test time.\n\n\u201cRight now we have all of these different techniques, all of which have in common that you just do extra computation at test time and which share basically no other technical features,\u201d says Jacob Andreas, an associate professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt seems like they all make models a little bit better. And we really don't understand what the relationships are between them.\u201d\n\nShared Limits\n\nAlthough the methods vary, they share the same inherent limitations: slower generation speeds and the potential need for more computational resources, water and energy. Environmental sustainability is already a growing issue for the field.\n\nIt might take about five seconds for an LLM to answer a single query without any added test-time compute, says Ekin Aky\u00fcrek, a computer science Ph.D. candidate at M.I.T., who is advised by Andreas. But a method developed by Aky\u00fcrek, Andreas and their colleagues raises that response time to five minutes. For certain applications and prompts, increasing how long inference takes simply doesn\u2019t make sense, says Dilek Hakkani-Tur, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Hakkani-Tur has worked extensively on developing AI conversational agents that \u201cspeak\u201d to users, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa. \u201cThere, speed is of utmost importance,\u201d she says. For complicated interactions, a user might not mind a few seconds\u2019 pause for a bot\u2019s response. But for a basic back-and-forth, a human might disengage if they must wait for what feels like an unnaturally long time.\n\nMore time also means more computational effort and money. Having o3 perform a single task could cost OpenAI $17 or more than $1,000, depending on the version of the software that is used, according to estimates from the creator of a popular AI benchmarking test, who was granted early access to the AI. And in cases where a model will be queried millions of times by a large user base, shifting the computational investment from training to inference would make all those prompts quickly add up to a major financial burden and a massive energy suck. Querying an LLM such as ChatGPT already uses an estimated 10 times the power of a Google search. Going from five seconds of computation to five minutes increases in-the-moment energy demand dozens of times over, Aky\u00fcrek says.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a definite downside in every case. If boosting test-time compute allows for smaller, models to perform better with less training, or if it eliminates the need to keep building and training more models from the ground up, then the strategy could potentially lessen generative AI\u2019s energy consumption in some instances, Hakkani-Tur says. The final balance depends on factors such as the intended use, the frequency with which a model is queried and the question of whether the model is small enough to be run on a local device instead of a distant server stack. The pros and cons \u201cneed to be carefully computed,\u201d she adds. \u201cI would look at the bigger picture of how I am going to use a model.\u201d That is to say, AI developers should think long and hard before encouraging their creations to do the same."

            "article_content": "Virta Health is now prescribing GLP-1s to treat obesity alongside its diabetes-reversal program.\n\nVirta says it's doing $100 million in annual recurring revenue and seeing its growth accelerate.\n\nIts CEO says the startup aims to hit profitability by the end of 2025 ahead of a potential IPO.\n\nVirta Health has prescribed GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for diabetes since the startup began caring for patients in 2016. Now, it wants to prescribe the buzzy drugs to treat obesity, too.\n\nVirta made a name for itself in virtual diabetes care with its rigorous nutrition plans. The program aims to help patients reverse type 2 diabetes largely through personalized low-carb diets. The startup began treating prediabetes and obesity in 2020.\n\nWhile GLP-1 medications were originally developed to treat diabetes, the drugs have exploded for their weight-loss potential. However, previous clinical research has shown that patients gain back most of the weight lost with a GLP-1 when they stop taking the medication. That's a big problem for employers, who don't want to pay for the expensive drugs indefinitely.\n\nVirta now is positioning itself as a \"responsible prescriber\" for employers who want to manage the costs of covering those medications for their employees by pairing the prescriptions with nutrition support. The company says it can help patients lose the weight and keep it off \u2014 Virta released a study in February 2024 showing its program can help diabetes patients maintain their weight loss after they stop taking GLP-1s.\n\nVirta's expanded weight-loss program could be the last push the startup needs to get to profitability \u2014 and maybe even an IPO.\n\nThe company is now bringing in more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue, a 60% year-over-year increase, CEO Sami Inkinen told Business Insider. Virta expects even faster growth in 2025 as its weight-loss business accelerates.\n\nInkinen said Virta will be profitable by the end of 2025.\n\n\"An IPO is the next milestone for us,\" he said. He declined to provide details on Virta's planned timeline for a public market debut but suggested that the company wants to be profitable before it tests the IPO waters.\n\nVirta's biggest competitor, Omada Health, is using a similar strategy as the diabetes startup approaches an IPO. BI reported in October that Omada Health had filed its S-1 this summer; CEO Sean Duffy told BI later that month that Omada's obesity care program had become the entry point for most of its new customers.\n\nSami Inkinen, cofounder and CEO of Virta Health. Virta Health\n\nDigital health's weight-loss frenzy\n\nVirta and Omada's expansion into obesity care is one of many channels of the surging market for weight loss solutions, as consumers rush to get their hands on GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nRelated stories\n\nTelehealth businesses like venture-backed Ro went big on new offerings to provide virtual weight-loss care alongside prescriptions. WW International, more commonly known as WeightWatchers, switched up its diet-centric approach in 2023 by acquiring digital health platform Sequence to offer GLP-1 medications to its customers. Ro's public competitor, Hims and Hers, bought a compounding pharmacy in September largely to prescribe knock-off versions of weight loss drugs like Ozempic while those medications are in shortage.\n\nInkinen emphasized that Virta has no financial reason to prescribe GLP-1s.\n\n\"We are not an online pill mill. We don't make money from the drugs, and we are not incentivized to prescribe drugs to make money,\" he said.\n\nAs the market has gotten more competitive, Inkinen said employers and health plans have increasingly honed their strategies for GLP-1 coverage. Previously, he said, employers either covered the drugs with few caveats or blocked payments for the medications altogether. Now, they're beginning to meet in the middle.\n\n\"You have to have a holistic approach, where you say, these drugs are a useful tool in the toolkit for some people, but you also have to have a nutrition-first approach, and prescribe any drugs in a responsible manner,\" he said.\n\nMost of Virta's patients aren't on GLP-1s today. Inkinen said about 30% of their incoming type 2 diabetes patients are taking GLP-1s when they begin Virta's program. He added that most of those patients can safely stop taking the drugs within the first year of Virta's diabetes-reversal program.\n\nThe startup said it plans to hire rapidly to meet increasing demand for its weight-loss offering, including by more than doubling the number of health coaches and medical providers on staff."

But the team behind the system, called DeepSeek-V3, described an even bigger step. In a research paper explaining how they built the technology, DeepSeek\u2019s engineers said they used only a fraction of the highly specialized computer chips that leading A.I. companies relied on to train their systems.\n\nThese chips are at the center of a tense technological competition between the United States and China. As the U.S. government works to maintain the country\u2019s lead in the global A.I. race, it is trying to limit the number of powerful chips, like those made by Silicon Valley firm Nvidia, that can be sold to China and other rivals.\n\nBut the performance of the DeepSeek model raises questions about the unintended consequences of the American government\u2019s trade restrictions. The controls have forced researchers in China to get creative with a wide range of tools that are freely available on the internet."

            "article_content": "The financial technology (fintech) sector has grown exponentially over the past decade, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are set to redefine its landscape further.\n\nBy 2025, AI and ML are projected to transform frontend development in fintech applications, enabling developers to deliver intuitive, secure, and user-centric platforms. This article explores how these technologies will shape the future of fintech frontend development, backed by statistics and key trends.\n\nThe Current State of Fintech Frontend Development\n\nFrontend development plays a crucial role in fintech, as it defines the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that directly impact customer engagement. Fintech platforms must handle complex functionalities\u2014such as real-time transaction data, investment dashboards, and compliance workflows\u2014while maintaining a seamless and visually appealing interface. With AI and ML entering the equation, the scope of frontend development is expanding rapidly.\n\nA report by Grand View Research estimates the global AI in fintech market size to reach $46.9 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5%. This indicates an increasing reliance on AI-driven innovations, including frontend solutions.\n\nKey Ways AI and ML Will Transform Fintech Frontend Development\n\nPersonalized User Interfaces\n\n\n\nAI and ML algorithms can analyze user behavior to deliver tailored interfaces.

Voice-activated commands will allow users to execute tasks such as transferring money, checking balances, or receiving financial advice hands-free. Statista predicts that the number of digital voice assistants will reach 8.4 billion units globally by 2024, signaling a strong trend toward voice-enabled fintech solutions.\n\nFaster Development Cycles\n\n\n\nAI-powered development tools will automate parts of the frontend development process. From generating boilerplate code to suggesting UI/UX improvements, these tools will accelerate project timelines while maintaining high-quality standards.\n\nCompanies looking to hire offshore frontend developers will find these tools particularly valuable, as they streamline collaboration and enhance productivity across distributed teams.\n\nCase Studies: AI and ML in Action\n\nRevolut: The global fintech giant uses AI to deliver personalized spending insights and fraud detection. Their frontend seamlessly integrates these features, providing users with a secure and engaging experience.\n\nBetterment: Betterment leverages AI and ML to offer automated investment advice. The app's frontend dynamically adjusts recommendations based on user goals and risk tolerance, showcasing the power of personalization.\n\nPayPal: PayPal utilizes ML algorithms to identify suspicious transactions. Their frontend interfaces notify users of potential fraud in real-time, enhancing both security and trust.\n\nChallenges to Address in AI-Driven Frontend Development\n\nWhile AI and ML hold immense potential, their integration into fintech frontend development comes with challenges:\n\nData Privacy Compliance:\n\nHandling sensitive financial data requires strict adherence to regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Developers must ensure that AI-driven personalization does not compromise user privacy.\n\nBias in Algorithms:\n\nAI models can inherit biases present in training data. Ensuring fair and unbiased outcomes in fintech applications will be a priority for developers.\n\nTechnical Expertise:\n\nImplementing advanced AI and ML features demands skilled professionals. Bridging the talent gap in frontend development will be crucial to fully realize these technologies' potential.\n\nThe Future of Frontend Development in Fintech\n\nBy 2025, AI and ML will become indispensable in shaping the frontend development of fintech applications. Here are some predictions:\n\nHyper-Personalization: Fintech platforms will offer highly personalized user experiences, leveraging AI to predict user needs before they arise.\n\nSeamless Integration: AI-driven chatbots, analytics tools, and security measures will integrate seamlessly into frontend interfaces, making fintech applications more intuitive and secure.\n\nGlobal Collaboration: Companies hiring offshore frontend developers will benefit from AI-powered tools that enable efficient remote collaboration and development.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI and ML are set to revolutionize fintech frontend development in 2025, bringing unparalleled personalization, security, and efficiency. From intelligent chatbots to advanced data visualization, these technologies will redefine how users interact with financial platforms. As the fintech sector continues to evolve, embracing AI and ML will not just be an advantage but a necessity for staying competitive in the market."

The Nifty 50 was up 0.6% at close on Wednesday. Macrotech Developers dropped 6.1%, whereas Oberoi Realty , Sobha, Prestige Estates Projects and Godrej Properties were down over 5% on Wednesday.\"After Covid, the real estate sector had seen supernormal growth, and due to this high base and a recent normalisation in growth, the stocks have fallen,\" said George Thomas, fund manager-equity, Quantum AMC. \"The market had extrapolated the growth due to which most stocks had reached high valuations which are now coming off.\"In 2024, all Nifty Realty index stocks, barring Mahindra Lifespaces, jumped 14-65%. All stocks in the sector gained 17-154% in 2023. The benchmark realty index soared 81% and 34% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.\"The real estate sector has seen some profit booking after it outperformed the markets last year,\" said Sunny Agrawal, head of fundamental research at SBICaps Securities. \"Valuations have been steep across the board and with this correction, especially in midcaps and smallcaps, there is now some valuation comfort in this segment.\"Agrawal said investors could buy afresh based on the third quarter results and looking at regionwise trends in real-estate. He said that Sunteck Realty , which has posted strong results, is likely to see a recovery soon. Lodha is also attractive after the recent fall, said Agrawal. DLF and Prestige are also among his favoured picks.The worst of the recent sell-off may not be over yet. \u201cWe believe that there is some more room for correction in this sector before valuations turn attractive for investors again,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cInvestors may also keep a note of the launches, which have been neutral recently, as any new projects may trigger some upside in these stocks.\u201dThe Nifty Realty index has dropped 18% so far in 2025 as against 2.1% decline in the Nifty.Analysts prefer companies that cater to the premium segment for now as the economic slowdown could slow demand in the lower-income groups.\u201cPremiumisation in this sector was seen in the last few months as it was a segment not impacted by Covid, but it is not a perpetual trend and we may see companies providing middle-range and affordable housing doing well in the future,\u201d said Thomas.Thomas said inventory levels across key markets continue to be reasonable at less than 18 months of sales. He estimates the shares to do well once valuations are in line with the growth."

            "article_content": "Shares of AMD have not experienced the same type of gains as those of rival Nvidia, but that could change over the next few years.\n\nStocks have been in a bull market since October 2022. Coincidentally, about a month later in November 2022, the world was introduced to ChatGPT, sparking a generational movement among investors who were chasing anything and everything related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmong opportunities in the AI realm, perhaps none have witnessed more gains than semiconductor stocks. Since October 2022, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has returned 194% -- absolutely dominating the Nasdaq Composite's return of 88% and the S&P 500's gain of 68%.\n\nChief among the chip stocks is Nvidia, which has soared by 1,100% since the beginning of the current bull market. By contrast, Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.48%), has returned 110% over the course of the bull market. This isn't anything to turn your back on, but it's not even in the same league as Nvidia. With that said, I think shares of AMD could be on the brink of their own Nvidia-esque run.\n\nLet's dig into why Nvidia has been all the rage among chip stocks over the last two years and analyze why AMD could be headed much higher over the course of the next few years.\n\nNvidia had a first mover advantage, but...\n\nThroughout the AI revolution, Nvidia's bellwether has been its computing and networking business. Specifically, the company's Hopper and Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs) have seen historical demand. GPUs are the engine that power generative AI applications. And for much of the last two years, Nvidia was the only major player in town.\n\nAs it stands today, Nvidia owns 90% of the GPU market. Although a lead like that might discourage you from even considering an alternative to investing in Nvidia, I would encourage you to keep an open mind.\n\n...AMD could be closing in on Nvidia's lead, and...\n\nIn December 2023, AMD released the MI300X data center GPU. While this was nearly a year after Nvidia had already been dominating the GPU market, AMD has witnessed some considerable success that I think is going overlooked.\n\nFirst off, hyperscalers including Meta Platforms, Oracle, and Microsoft are all augmenting their Nvidia architecture with AMD's MI300 accelerators. Acquiring customers of this caliber is impressive, but AMD's financial trends are what really have me excited.\n\nSince the release of the MI300 architecture, AMD has seen its data center GPU business grow from effectively nothing into a multibillion-dollar operation, and it has continued to accelerate quarter after quarter. Meanwhile, Nvidia's data center operation is actually beginning to show signs of slowing down.\n\nThis pace of growth has provided AMD with an estimated 10% share of the GPU market -- effectively making it an outright duel between AMD and Nvidia.\n\n... investors may want to buy AMD stock hand over fist now, before it's too late\n\nWhen the current bull market began in October 2022, Nvidia's market capitalization was just $280 billion. Today, the company is valued at over $3.3 trillion, more than tenfold what it was worth just two years ago.\n\nInterestingly, AMD's current market cap of $200 billion is not that far away from where Nvidia was valued before it went parabolic. In my eyes, investors are really discounting AMD's potential over the next few years as the company continues scaling up its data center business.\n\nWith successor GPUs already scheduled for release between this year and 2026, AMD is in a good position to continue disrupting Nvidia. As such, investors looking for more growth could eventually sour on Nvidia and turn to alternatives such as AMD.\n\nI still see Nvidia as a great opportunity, but I think the days of 1,000%-plus gains are in the rearview mirror. By contrast, I think AMD is in the early stages of its own epic run. I see AMD as a bargain opportunity right now, and I think it will be significantly higher three years from now as its chapter in the AI storyline continues to unfold."

Over 65% of the 32 analysts that have coverage on the company have a 'Buy' recommendation on the counter, while seven of them have a 'Hold' rating and four say 'Sell'.Consensus price targets on Polycab suggest a further upside of another 27.5% on the stock from Wednesday's closing levels. Among analysts, Jefferies currently has a price target of \u20b99,200 on Polycab, which is the highest on the Street, implying a potential upside of 50% from Wednesday's close.Brokerage firm Jefferies, which also has a 'Buy' rating on the stock, said that Polycab reported strong Q3 results with consolidated sales and EBITDA growing over 20% and 26% year-on-year, respectively.While cables demand was healthy in Q3, wires slackened due to softening of copper price and high channel inventory at start of Q3.Operating profit margins (OPM) rose to 13.8% (+70 basis points year-on-year, +230 basis points quarter-on-quarter), driven by margin normalisation in Cables & Wires (C&W) and reduced losses in the FMEG segment.Other non-operating income declined by 65% year-on-year, leading to lower profit growth of 11% year-on-year, broadly in line with Jefferies' estimates.The management has provided healthy guidance for next five years:- Capex to range between \u20b96,000 crore to \u20b98,000 crore- Wires and cables margin to be between 11% to 13%- FMEG EBITDA to be between 8% and 10%- Dividend payout to be over 30%- Exports to contribute more than 10% of the total businessUBS too has a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of9,000 per share. The brokerage said that the cable and wire topline growth of 12% drove miss on topline. This was led by slowing government capex and should recover with rebound in government capex.FMEG segment saw sequential reduction in loss (PBIT margins at 3% as against 6.4% in Q2).Citi has maintained a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of \u20b98,600, naming it their top pick.Revenue grew 20% on-year, slightly missing Citi's estimate by 2%, but EBITDA rose 26% on-year, surpassing estimates by 15%. The strong EBITDA performance was driven by better-than-expected margins in the Wires & Cables segment and reduced losses in the FMEG business.Wires & Cables margins improved 119bps QoQ (-56bps YoY) to 13.5%, supported by-- Margin normalisation in wires, and- Increased contributions from international business, which rose to 8.3% (compared to 6.2% in Q3FY24 and 6.1% in Q2FY25).- Management expects export momentum to continue into Q4FY25.Another brokerage house Macquarie has an 'Outperform' rating on Polycab, with a price target of7,928 per share.Their strategic outlook implies 15% revenue CAGR for FY25-30. Polycab reported Q3 revenue of \u20b95,200 crore (+20% YoY) and EBITDA of \u20b9720 crore (+26% YoY), both in line with estimates.Key positive surprise, as per the brokerage, was better than expected C&W segment margins, which expanded 120bps QoQ (down 50bps YoY) to 13.5%, driven by better margins in wires and higher share of export revenue QoQ. Profit grew 11% on-year.Shares of Polycab are currently trading 1.27% higher on Thursday at \u20b96,242.60. This stock has gained over 50% in the last one year."

As of October 15, 2024, defense contractors must be compliant with CMMC Level 1, 2, and/or 3 over a phased implementation period.\n\nAchieving these standards can be difficult, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. The new OCI Core Landing Zone automation template and CMMC-specific documentation can significantly ease this process, helping save months of manual work mapping controls and setting up compliance-ready cloud architecture.\n\n\"GE Aerospace uses Oracle US Government Cloud to deliver CMMC Level 2 readiness on a modernized supply chain,\" said Shravan Devulapalli, cybersecurity technologist, GE Aerospace. \"Our modernization project was delivered on time and on budget with performance that exceeded the on-premises solution it replaced.\"\n\nAchieving CMMC compliance\n\nThe CMMC Program enables the DoD to verify that defense prime contractors and subcontractors have implemented security safeguards for Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). To achieve CMMC certification, businesses must comply with controls that are aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171.\n\n\n\nThe OCI Core Landing Zone includes baseline configurations and rules delivered using a standardized Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) template designed to help meet CMMC requirements. Based on Terraform, OCI Core Landing Zones allow customers to perform one-click, best-practice deployments of a preconfigured set of cloud native services. Customers can answer a few simple questions about their needs, launch the OCI Core Landing Zone templates, and have an architecture set up that is designed to automatically meet many CMMC controls.\n\nOracle US Government Cloud has also achieved FedRAMP High JAB P-ATO status, and its services meet NIST SP 800-171 control requirements.\n\n\"CMMC is more than a secure implementation in the cloud. It is documentation that authoritatively matches that implementation to the CMMC controls,\" said Rand Waldron, vice president, Oracle. \"Oracle has gone further to help defense contractors by providing comprehensive guidance to explain how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure helps achieve compliance with CMMC requirements. Oracle provides both an informational guide and controls checklist for CMMC Levels 1 and 2 compliance.\"\n\nThe OCI Landing Zone and associated technical documentation are provided at no additional charge under a customer's contract. Cloud services used to stand up OCI Core Landing Zone in a customer's tenancy will be billed in accordance with the customer's contract. OCI Core Landing Zone templates are available within the OCI Console and through GitHub. For more information, check out the CMMC Level 1 and Level 2 informational guides.\n\nOracle US Government Cloud services are priced at the same, consistent global pricing as Oracle's commercial public cloud regions and meet DISA Impact Levels 2, 4, and FedRAMP High authorization standards. Oracle US Government Cloud is available in the US East (Ashburn, VA), and US West (Phoenix, AZ) regions.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

            "article_content": "Star Wars is ripe territory for fan theories, though they don\u2019t always last very long. The fandom has hosted some incredible armchair writers over the years, and has always pivoted with new information and revelations. Many of the most popular theories have been shot down in recent years with the release of the sequel trilogy and the Disney+ shows, but the new ones cropping up are exciting. Meanwhile, the theories with the largest scope are still on the table \u2014 and will remain so unless Lucasfilm tackles some uncharacteristically big questions about the origins of the galactic infrastructure.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nStar Wars works best by appealing to a wide audience, so it rarely gets as deep into the minutiae of worldbuilding as other sci-fi franchises. If anything, that just leaves more room for fans to explore and flesh out their own ideas. Here are ten of the best Star Wars fan theories that are still viable at the time of this writing.\n\nShmi\u2019s Death\n\nOne of the biggest turning points in Anakin\u2019s path to the Dark Side came at the end of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, when he witnessed his mother\u2019s death. Shmi Skywalker was freed from slavery but was then kidnapped by Tusken Raiders and tortured, for reasons we don\u2019t fully understand. Fans now suggest that Shmi\u2019s death was orchestrated by Palpatine as part of his plan to corrupt Anakin and turn him to the Dark Side.\n\nThis idea picked up a lot of traction after Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett premiered, allowing the audience to spend more time among the Tusken Raiders. They are known to attack moisture farms like the one Shmi lived on, but it\u2019s unclear why they held her and brutalized her for so long without demanding a ransom or taking further action against her farm. It\u2019s possible that Palpatine was exerting some mental influence on this tribe to make the treatment of Shmi worse. He may also have influenced the prophetic dreams that sent Anakin looking for her.\n\nThis all becomes extra tragic if you believe that Palpatine is the one who used the Force to conceive Anakin with Shmi. However, some fans dislike this idea because it removes Anakin\u2019s culpability for the murders he committed here. It doesn\u2019t need to be true, but it could be.\n\nClone Wars Propaganda\n\nThere are two animated series that cover wartime events between Star Wars: Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith \u2014 Star Wars: Clone Wars, which aired from 2003 to 2005, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars which aired from 2008 to 2013. Reddit user u/onex7805 suggests that the first series was a faithful depiction of the war, while the second was in-world propaganda created by the Galactic Republic. This is a really interesting idea, and it\u2019s consistent with what we see in other Star Wars media as well.\n\nStormtrooper Armor\n\nThere are two popular and interesting theories about the purpose and efficacy of stormtrooper armor. It doesn\u2019t seem to protect its wearers very well, but many fans have suggested that this wasn\u2019t its main point. Instead, they figure the armor was meant to project strength and intimidation while hiding any humanity that might be lurking within the helmet. It\u2019s a way for the cloners on Kamino and the Empire to make their armies look more terrifying.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t contradict an interesting theory by Reddit user u/stormtrooper1701 \u2014 that stormtrooper armor actually does perform very well considering what it\u2019s up against. They point out that a direct hit from a blaster is incredibly destructive to property and the environment, so the same must be true for living beings. If it weren\u2019t for the armor, stormtroopers might be blown to bits much more easily.\n\nFranchise Crossovers\n\nThere are several popular fan theories online that suggest Star Wars takes place in the same universe as other movies or media, and some of them make pretty compelling cases. One of the strongest is Men in Black \u2014 the movie tells us that George Lucas is secretly an alien refugee living on Earth. It would make sense that he wrote his movies about his real experiences a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. There are other connections, as well, such as some similar character designs for aliens and a fictional language that sounds suspiciously like Huttese.\n\nMovies about aliens visiting Earth are easy to connect to Star Wars, which is why some fans think E.T. may have come from the Galactic Empire, for example. Meanwhile, connections to Doctor Who are subtle but common. There are many canonical stories that connect Star Wars to Marvel Comics, and in fact, many fans expect Disney to start exploiting this connection soon in movies and TV shows. However, the genre-bending connections get more and more tenuous, such as this one suggesting that The Lord of the Rings\u2018 Middle-earth is an ancient version of Tattooine.\n\nGrogu\u2019s Origin\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot about the origin and backstory of the Mandalorian foundling Grogu \u2014 a.k.a. The Child, a.k.a. Baby Yoda \u2014 but there are still some built-in mysteries surrounding his species and its connection to the Force. One theory that took off when The Mandalorian first premiered suggests that Grogu was born through the will of the Force \u2014 and perhaps that\u2019s how all members of this species are born.\n\nAll the sources on the Star Wars timeline agree that Grogu was born 41 years before Star Wars: A New Hope, which is the same year that Anakin Skywalker was born. The movies tell us that Anakin was an immaculate conception and that either Darth Sidious or his master Darth Plagueis used the Dark Side of the Force to create him. This theory suggests that there was an equal and opposite reaction and that Grogu was created in the same way through the light side of the Force.\n\nWhat makes this theory really exciting is its potential to reveal more about Grogu and Yoda\u2019s species in general. It could be that these beings are always born through the Force, and only when they are needed. However, all Star Wars writers have always shied away from revealing anything about Yoda\u2019s species \u2014 even its name \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to imagine them revealing something this big in The Mandalorian & Grogu.\n\nPalpatine\u2019s Return\n\nWhile the details of Yoda\u2019s species are the kind of mysteries we want to see teased out slowly, there\u2019s a more ominous fan theory that it may be used to explain one of Star Wars\u2019 most hasty and disliked plot points in the modern era: Palpatine\u2019s return. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker shows us that Palpatine survived Star Wars: Return of the Jedi or was resurrected, and he lived in secret for a generation before making his play for power again. However, the particulars of this plan are left vague, and it feels extremely disconnected from the rest of the sequel trilogy\u2019s plot.\n\nThe theory is that Grogu has been built up to become the connective tissue between this storyline and the rest of the fandom. Fans suggest that Grogu\u2019s cells were used by Palpatine\u2019s remaining loyalists for cloning experiments that were intended to bring the Emperor back \u2014 and perhaps to imbue him with new powers. They would have been hunting The Child to continue this work, and their failure would explain why Palpatine returned in an imperfect form in the later movie.\n\nSkywalkers\n\nStar Wars has not moved its timeline forward since 2019, and fans are itching to know what the next era in galactic history will look like. One popular theory connects the titles of the two most recent movies to suggest a new trend \u2014 there will be no more \u201cJedi\u201d after the Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Instead, Force-users will now be referred to as Skywalkers, which is why the finale was titled The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nThis may seem like a small, semantic change, but it could actually signal a wide range of interesting developments. If Force-users were freed from the connotations of the title Jedi and all the traditions of that order, they could develop a whole range of new practices and philosophies, perhaps even splintering into groups that develop independently and eventually go on to learn from each other. The catch-all term \u201cSkywalker\u201d would be a neat nod to the past and would also make sense of Rey\u2019s self-appointed name in the end. Fans have compared this to the way that \u201cCaesar\u201d started as one man\u2019s name, but went on to become a title for Roman leaders.\n\nBalance\n\nThere\u2019s a small subgenre of fan theories that neatly explain plot holes and inconsistencies by suggesting that the Force itself seeks balance at all times. It bothers some fans that, during the prequel trilogy, the massive and powerful Jedi order was unable to sense Palpatine and stop him, while a single under-trained Jedi was able to do so just a few years later. This theory essentially suggests that the more Jedi there are, the less powerful each one will be, as the Force will seek to maintain balance between the Dark Side and the light. This means Luke was tapping into a much larger well of potential energy and Palpatine had much less influence over him.\n\nSimilarly, some fans think that Palpatine\u2019s rise was inevitable in a time when the Jedi were so numerous and so involved in worldly affairs like politics and trade. They argue that a Jedi Order which couldn\u2019t stop a single Sith was somehow imperfect, and it needed to be toppled to make room for something better. This could be an interesting idea to explore in the future, if it can be done without excusing any of the emperor\u2019s crimes.\n\nDroid Villains\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s an interesting theory out there suggesting that whenever the Star Wars timeline does move forward again, its next big arc will be a conflict between droids and organic life. This idea has been circulating for at least a few years now, but it has become even more appealing since the finale of Star Wars: Skeleton Crew revealed that the planet At Attin was under the control of one massive AI. There has also been a recent trend in Star Wars media commenting on the relatively low social and economic status of droids throughout the series, with Solo: A Star Wars Story essentially depicting them as an oppressed class.\n\nThe Force may be powerful, but it would have some trouble contending with a hive mind, or even a coordinated force of self-improving droids. Add to that the moral complexity of the droids\u2019 plight and you could have a very interesting story on your hands \u2014 likely one with a solution more nuanced than blowing up another planet-killing space station.\n\nAttachment\n\nFinally, fans may have stumbled upon a practical reason for one of the Jedi Order\u2019s more lofty, philosophical teachings \u2014 their quest to sever all worldly attachments. Of course, early on Lucas drew this from Buddhist teachings and other real-world philosophies, but it became a very central part of the story when attachment to Padme helped drive Anakin to the Dark Side in the prequel trilogy.\n\nReddit user u/Nofrillsoculus suggests that this was precisely why potential Jedi needed to be found and indoctrinated early. A Force user with loyalties and ties to their family, nation, or planet will almost certainly become corrupted, and the galaxy would gradually devolve into a nonstop struggle between Force-sensitive warlords, or Sith. The Jedi want to avoid this, but there\u2019s still something sinister about the idea of them tracking down every single Force-sensitive child and pulling them away from their lives as early as possible.\n\nThe Star Wars franchise is streaming now on Disney+. The next release will be Andor Season 2, hitting Disney+ on April 22nd."

            "article_content": "DONALD TRUMP ON HIS FIRST DAY BACK in office issued an executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship, the principle, grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment, that anyone born in the United States, regardless of parentage, is an American citizen. Back in 2023, when he announced his plans to do this on Day One, Trump claimed that \u201cmany scholars\u201d have shown that birthright citizenship is based on a \u201chistorical myth\u201d and a \u201cwillful misinterpretation\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment, and he declared that he could undo it simply through a \u201ccorrect interpretation\u201d of the amendment.\n\nAnd so the executive order he issued hours after being sworn instructs that \u201cno department or agency . . . shall issue documents recognizing United States citizenship\u201d for babies born in the United States without at least one parent who is a citizen.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order is going to be hotly contested in the courts. Twenty-two states (as of this writing) have sued to stop the order, and the ACLU is preparing a lawsuit as well. There is a strong argument that the president\u2019s action is unconstitutional.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside for a moment the questions of the legality and constitutionality of Trump\u2019s action and ask instead: Where did he get this idea? How did eliminating birthright citizenship become a right-wing desideratum?\n\nThere is no mystery as to where this is coming from. The idea that birthright citizenship is a false interpretation or recent innovation that warps the intended meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment has been pushed into mainstream Republican circles by the tireless work of John Eastman and the Claremont Institute. See, for instance, this 2011 debate between Eastman and Ediberto Roman in the Florida International University Law Review. Or this 2008 article by Eastman in the University of Richmond Law Review. The Claremont Institute, where Eastman has long been a leading figure, and which has continued to employ him even after the scandal arising from his authorship of the notorious \u201ccoup memos\u201d in 2020, has for years now been pushing the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment was never intended to provide citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.\n\nOther luminaries at the MAGA-adoring academic think tank have also sounded off about birthright citizenship, such as Michael Anton\u2014now an official in Trump\u2019s State Department\u2014in essays like this bizarre 2018 rewrite of American history.\n\nToday, Eastman published an article on a Claremont Institute website crowing about Trump\u2019s action: \u201cBirthright Citizenship: Game On!\u201d He lists several of the Claremont scholars who have written on birthright citizenship, and says he hopes the \u201cClaremont Institute\u2019s long-standing view\u201d of the issue will soon be vindicated by the Supreme Court.\n\nShare\n\nJUST ONE PROBLEM: All the claims from MAGA and the Trumpians that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to extend citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants falter when confronted with the obvious truth that the Fourteenth Amendment, upon its adoption, did extend citizenship to a very large number of children of illegal immigrants.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back. The Constitution as originally ratified put the authority to ban the slave trade under the authority to regulate immigration\u2014not the authority to regulate property. Here\u2019s Article I, Section 9: \u201cThe Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight.\u201d In other words, slaves who were brought in to the country contrary to federal law were to be considered illegal immigrants, not illegal property.\n\nCongress banned the slave trade in 1808\u2014but that ban was far from perfect. Thousands of slaves were smuggled into the United States between 1808 and 1860. It\u2019s impossible to know the exact number\u2014W.E.B. Du Bois pegged it at 250,000, although contemporary scholarship suggests it was lower\u2014but whatever the figure, we have interviews with quite a few of these individuals\u2019 children, like James Cape, Ben Simpson, and Josephine Howard, and they talk about where their families came from and how they became American.\n\nCape, Simpson, and Howard were among the thousands of children of illegal immigrants who were granted citizenship by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nShare The Bulwark\n\nEASTMAN AND HIS COMRADES at the Claremont Institute base their theory upon an interpretation of a particular phrase in the Fourteenth Amendment: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d The claim is that the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d really means \u201callegiance\u201d; children born to illegal aliens here in the United States owe their allegiance to whatever country their parents are from.\n\nBut America has never recognized the doctrine of enforced allegiance. We actually went to war with Great Britain over this. In the 1790s, British warships began boarding American vessels and impressing Americans into the Royal Navy. Britain did not recognize American naturalization. Once an Englishman, always an Englishman.\n\nAmerica rejected Britain\u2019s claim.\n\nPerhaps the clearest and most famous statement of American policy on this issue is to be found in the Burlingame-Seward Treaty, ratified by the Senate on July 28, 1868\u2014by coincidence the exact same day Secretary of State William Seward announced the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Here\u2019s the relevant passage from the treaty:\n\nThe United States of America and the Emperor of China cordially recognize the inherent and inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance, and also the mutual advantage of the free migration and emigration of their citizens and subjects, respectively, from the one country to the other, for the purposes of curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThere is no such thing in American jurisprudence as enforced allegiance. Allegiance must be voluntary.\n\nIf the Claremont Institute\u2019s theory were correct\u2014if it were true that children born in the United States owe their allegiance to their parents\u2019 country of origin\u2014then children born to Americans overseas would automatically owe their allegiance to the United States. They would never be asked to swear allegiance to something that was already required of them.\n\nBut there was a time when they were required to swear allegiance. Here\u2019s a passage from the 1907 Expatriation Act:\n\nSec 6. That all children born outside the limits of the United States who are citizens thereof in accordance with the provisions of section nineteen hundred and ninety-three of the Revised Statutes of the United States and who continue to reside outside the United States shall, in order to receive the protection of this Government, be required upon reaching 18 years to record at an American consulate their intention to become residents and remain citizens of the United States, and shall be further required to take the oath of allegiance to the United States upon attaining their majority.\n\nDonald Trump and the revisionists at Claremont are clearly wrong. The phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d does not mean children born on U.S. soil to illegal immigrants owe their allegiance to a foreign government. No one owes their allegiance to anyone.\n\nShare\n\nFINALLY, IT\u2019S WORTH NOTING that birthright citizenship is hardly an innovation of recent years; it has a provenance that goes back to the early days of the republic, in the sense that it was written into the Fourteenth Amendment to counter long-simmering proposals for the mass deportation of blacks. Jefferson, Madison, and many other Southerners wished to combine emancipation of slaves with mandatory deportation.\n\nHere is an anonymous letter of protest (under the pen name \u201cA Freeman\u201d) in the Maryland Gazette, dated December 30, 1790:\n\nWe have no just right to export [or] banish any man, unless he previously violates some law, which inflicts transportation as a just punishment for his crime.\u2014A different sentiment cannot correspond with the idea, that \u201call men are born equally free, and in point of human rights to liberty, stand on equal ground.\u201d But where would you export them to? They are as much Americans now as we, and we as much European as they are Africans\u2014Nothing but a mind influenced by prejudice or partiality can countenance or contemn this idea or argument. [Emphases in original.]\n\nBut of course the United States did have a mass deportation authorized by Congress\u2014the Indian Removal Act of 1830, with its infamous Trail of Tears. In August 1825, an essay in the Georgia Journal under the pen name \u201cSocrates\u201d lays out the Southern argument: \u201cIf they [the federal government] make a citizen of an Indian, what hinders them from making a citizen of a free negro, and if they can make a citizen of a free negro, what hinders them from naturalizing slave negroes?\u201d (emphases in original).\n\nThe deportation of non-citizens was the answer in Georgia\u2014especially since Native Americans (who then numbered around ten thousand) possessed one-quarter of the present-day state.\n\nMass deportation of nonwhites was still very much on the table after the Civil War. A week after surrendering to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 14, 1865, Robert E. Lee (who was to become the most visible symbol of Southern resistance) sat down with a reporter from the New York Herald:\n\nThe best men of the South have long been anxious to do away with this institution, and [are] quite willing to-day to see it abolished. They consider slavery forever dead. But with them, in relation to this subject, the question has ever been, \u2018What will you do with the freed people?\u2019 That is the serious question to-day, and one that cannot be winked at. It must be met practically and treated intelligently. The negroes must be disposed of.\n\nAlmost a year later, on February 17, 1866, Lee once again expressed his support for the deportation of blacks. During congressional hearings on Reconstruction, Rep. Henry Taylor Blow (R-Mo.) asked Lee: \u201cDo you not think that Virginia would be better off if the colored population were to go to Alabama, Louisiana, and the other southern States?\u201d Lee responded: \u201cI think it would be better for Virginia if she could get rid of them. That is no new opinion with me. I have always thought so, and have always been in favor of emancipation\u2014gradual emancipation.\u201d\n\nEmancipation plus deportation. This was the preferred Southern plan. And had been from the very beginning. This is why the Fourteenth Amendment was written the way it was written\u2014why birthright citizenship was the intention.\n\nNot that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment extinguished the racist impulse to deport. A version of the \u201cback to Africa\u201d plan was endorsed by the most die-hard America Firsters\u2014the ones who stuck to their racism and isolationism even after Pearl Harbor. Here is an excerpt from the America First party platform, August 1944:\n\nNoting that 20,000 part-Negroes become recognized as whites annually. And noting also that it will be harder to solve the problem of 40,000,000 Negroes in our midst in the future than of 13,000,000 today, and believing that it is unfair to both races to have to live together, we advocate a return to the solution long ago proposed by Thomas Jefferson and successively advocated by many other Presidents . . . namely, implementing the Negroes\u2019 right to return to the homeland and environment in which nature first nurtured them.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment establishes birthright citizenship. Its purpose is clear. It is meant to prevent Congress or the president from deporting people who are born on American soil\u2014including those accused of \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of this country.\n\nShare"

LAPRESSE\n\nIn a series of perplexing events, multiple UFO sightings have been reported and recorded over several days across California, particularly in the Fresno area. These sightings have sparked a wave of curiosity and concern, as both residents and authorities are left pondering the origins of these unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe string of sightings began with a mysterious light hovering over downtown Fresno in the early hours, just past 4 a.m. Local news station Fox 26 captured the first sighting on camera, showing a light that appeared to move swiftly before coming to a stationary hover. Earl Grey Anderson, a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), reviewed the footage and classified it as an unidentified flying object.\n\nTaylor Swift's Heartfelt Message to Swifties\n\nThe following day, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara documented another UFO sighting, this time in the daylight. The footage added to the mounting intrigue surrounding these mysterious occurrences. A few days later, a private pilot reported seeing a white object trailing his aircraft at an altitude of 3,500 feet over downtown Fresno. Despite radioing the local airport tower for assistance, the pilot lost sight of the object shortly after.\n\nStill concern over what happened\n\nSeveral Fresno residents have also come forward with similar reports, describing their encounters with the unidentified objects. The recent sightings have reignited public fascination with UFOs, particularly as the Pentagon continues to release declassified information about aerial phenomena.\n\nWhile some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, others consider the possibility of advanced human-made technology or natural phenomena. Authorities are urging residents to remain calm as investigations continue.\n\nDespite the ongoing mystery, the sightings have undoubtedly captured the imaginations of those who witness these unexplained objects in the California skies. As the story develops, residents and authorities alike remain vigilant, hoping to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic appearances."

            "article_content": "In 2025, humanoid robots aren\u2019t anything new \u2014 just check out some of the droids that came out of the Consumer Electronics Show last week. But most of those robots getting headlines are still limited in how they interact with people.\n\nFor BYU graduate student Curtis Johnson and his mentors in the BYU Robotics and Dynamics Lab, it\u2019s time to make robots more helpful.\n\n\u201cWhat if the robot could push with its shoulder or push things out of the way with its whole body? That really expands its capabilities,\u201d said Johnson, a doctoral student in mechanical engineering.\n\nTo that end, Johnson, under the tutelage of mechanical engineering professor and robotics expert Marc Killpack, has built Baloo, a revolutionary robot that can interact with the world with its whole body. Baloo can impressively lift large and unwieldy objects such as ladders, kayaks, car tires, chairs, and heavy boxes. And it does so safely because its whole structure is flexible.\n\nIf soft robots like Baloo can be taught to do helpful tasks, they could become safer working companions. Robots with exclusively hard components can \u201ceither break the robot or break you, whichever one is stronger,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIn addition to designing intelligent heavy lifters like Baloo, the Robotics and Dynamics lab is working on collaborative techniques as part of a National Robotics Initiative project, funded by the National Science Foundation. This project is a collaboration between Killpack and John Salmon, a fellow professor in the mechanical engineering department. They recently published a study providing insights on physical human-human co-manipulation of bulky or heavy objects. This study is foundational to their current human-robot studies.\n\nStudy coauthor Shaden Moss recently completed his master\u2019s thesis in which he helped to program a robot to follow an object that is co-manipulated by a person with a VR headset. Moss analyzed how the stiffness in the arm of the robot affected the way people completed cooperative tasks such as moving a table in various directions.\n\n\u201cWe used math to describe the tasks in virtual reality so the person can see it on the VR headset,\u201d Moss said. \u201cThey\u2019re the same every time, but the robot never knows that. All the robot knows is that it can feel the person start to pull on the table and so the robot will move in that direction.\u201d\n\nDallin Cordon also recently finished his master\u2019s thesis in robotics. Using the same platform as Moss, Cordon developed a control system that mapped the displacement of the flexible robotic arm to the motion of a mobile base, enabling human-robot manipulation of a rigid object.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever really done collaborative manipulation with a soft robot, so this is a novel approach,\u201d Cordon said. \u201cI think the first moment when it worked, even if it didn\u2019t work well, was exciting because it finally did what we wanted it to do. That was electrifying.\u201d"
