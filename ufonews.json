        "article_content": "Pentagon's UFO report finds over 700 new cases, with 21 the agency could not explain\n\nThe Pentagon and the Director of National Intelligence have released the annual report on UFO sightings and while they still haven't found any extraterrestrial origin for the more than 700 new reports that came in last year, there are about two dozen that have them really curious.\n\nUAP is the term the Pentagon and the intelligence community use to describe UFOs, which stands for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. The agency that reviews all of the new incidents being reported by military personnel and now additional federal agencies is the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\nFrom May 2023 to June 2024, AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 that occurred in that time period and another 272 reports from 2021 and 2022 that had not been previously sent to the agency. That's a sizable increase from previous reports, for example, last year's report cited 281 new reports during its review period, something Pentagon officials said Thursday was due to a greater awareness about reporting UAP incidents, not that they have been growing in frequency.\n\nThe Pentagon and the surrounding area is seen in this aerial view in Washington, D.C., Jan. 26, 2020. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP, FILE\n\nOverall the total number of cases that have been reviewed by AARO since its founding is now 1,652.\n\nAARO has \"discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology\" according to this year's report. A small number of this year's reports had terrestrial explanations and a significant number will be left for further review, but one thing they haven't found is that some of the reports are attributable to a \"breakthrough\" technology.\n\nHowever, during a press briefing Thursday, the head of AARO acknowledged that there are 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can't really explain.\n\n\"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the I.C. I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them,\" said Dr. Jon Kosloski, the new director of AARO. Kosloski said the 21 incidents occurred near national security sites and were recorded on video, had multiple eyewitnesses or were captured by other sensors.\n\nSo what do these unexplainable UAPs look like? \"Orbs, cylinders, triangles, in one of the cases, it has been happening over an extended period of time, and it is possible that there's multiple things happening\" Kosloski said, adding that the incidents might include drone activity that's being conflated with a UAP."

        "article_content": "iPhone users in some markets discovered a standalone Google Gemini app for iPhone a few days ago. The app wasn\u2019t available in most markets, as Google was apparently testing it ahead of a more widespread release. Fast-forward to Thursday, Google is ready to make the standalone Gemini app available to iPhone users around the world. The Gemini went up in the App Store quietly, and you can download it right now.\n\nThe Google Gemini app is now available as a separate app from the main Google app, where you might have accessed the Gemini AI on the iPhone in the past. The best part about the Gemini app is that it comes with support for Gemini Live, Google\u2019s version of ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nIt\u2019s a conversational AI that lets you talk to the chatbot just like you\u2019re speaking to a human. You can interrupt the AI and change prompts on the fly, similar to how a conversation between two people would flow.\n\nGemini Live isn\u2019t available in the main Google app on the iPhone, so Google\u2019s new standalone Gemini app is the only way to get it on your iPhone.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nGoogle Live will support personalization, as you can choose from various voices and languages.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone is available in the App Store. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nYou can use Gemini Live to talk about anything, just as you would with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode. Here\u2019s what the Gemini app description says Gemini can do for you on the iPhone:\n\nGo Live with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, simplify complex topics, and rehearse for important moments. Just click on the Gemini Live button in your Gemini app \u2013 Connect with your favorite Google apps like Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more \u2013 Study smarter and explore any topic with interactive visuals and real-world examples \u2013 Unlock a world of expertise and get tailored information about any topic \u2013 Plan trips better and faster \u2013 Create AI-generated images in seconds \u2013 Get summaries, deep dives, and source links, all in one place \u2013 Brainstorm new ideas, or improve existing ones\n\nFor example, Gemini Live can be a study companion, ready to assist you while you learn.\n\nThe Gemini app for iPhone also supports image generation, just like ChatGPT does.\n\nMore interesting to me is the Gemini\u2019s app integration with other Google apps and services you might be using on iPhone. The description says the Gemini app will connect with your favorite Google apps once you install it.\n\nGemini can connect to YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Calendar, and other apps straight from your chat. That\u2019s certainly a useful feature if you use Google apps on your iPhone and want to include Gemini in that. This sort of interaction goes beyond what ChatGPT can do, and it\u2019s all the more interesting as Google doesn\u2019t have any say in how iOS works.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone: Features and screenshots. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nAlso, Gemini isn\u2019t part of Apple Intelligence like ChatGPT will be. Even then, ChatGPT will not be able to connect to any other apps. Siri will handle such capabilities later down the road.\n\nGoogle Gemini is available as a free download from the App Store. If you want access to Google\u2019s latest Gemini models, you\u2019ll need a Gemini Advanced subscription priced at $19.99. You can test Gemini Advanced for free for a month before you decide to keep it."

(KPTV) \u2013 The House Oversight held a hearing Wednesday morning to hear new testimony called: \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\u201d\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill heard from and interviewed top government officials from the Navy, NASA, and the Department of Defense to learn more about videos and surveillance photos of objects that could not be identified by government agencies.\n\nThis session follows the first congressional meetings in 50 years on the topic, where officials alleged the federal government has knowingly kept the public in the dark regarding the presence of UAPs in U.S. airspace over the past several decades.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest ranks among the top states to report paranormal activity says James Szubski, Co-Owner of Margie\u2019s Outdoor Store which encourages residents and visitors to report any paranormal-related activity.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nBusinesses leasing space in a downtown Portland building were told suddenly and without explanation that they need to move out by the end of November.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, there are a lot of people, ordinary people, that are having extraordinary experiences, pretty frequently,\u201d said Szubski.\n\nThe Bingen, Washington staple has been busy, with 371 reports in less than four years. A U.S. Army veteran, the Washingtonian says 97% of accounts have come from everyday people, including politicians and law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning that the Gorge is literally the most active paranormal hot spot in all of North America,\u201d Szubski said.\n\nHowever, this conversation comes with a healthy amount of skepticism, which is why researchers believe testimonials and evidence are vital to proving whether we are alone in the universe.\n\n\u201cScience cannot advance when there is stigma to reporting real phenomena people are experiencing,\u201d Szubski said. \u201cGiving that place to talk about as we are doing here, this is how the knowledge of this world expands.\u201d\n\nIt was a similar theme in Washington, D.C. where members of this committee asked U.S. military and defense experts to share vital information on these incidents in question.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nOne of two St. Helens High School teachers facing sexual abuse charges appeared in court on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cUAPs remain a controversial topic,\u201d said Congresswoman and Committee Member, Nancy Mace. \u201cI\u2019m not going to name names, but there are certain individuals who didn\u2019t want this hearing to happen because they feared what might be disclosed. But we stood firm. No amount of outside pressure would ever keep me from pursuing a subject to ground come hell or high water.\u201d\n\nThe question-and-answer portion of the hearing lasted more than two hours but little could be disclosed based on national security and clearance concerns.\n\nMany were left wondering about who or what those potential crafts could be if they were anything other than a balloon, satellite, or non-piloted object.\n\nStill, the mere fact that these conversations are happening on the highest level proves in some way that these concerns are valid and worth deeper discussion.\n\n\u201cLife is so much more interesting when you give yourself the space to think this could be something anomalous,\u201d said Szubski. \" I\u2019d encourage people to keep their eyes on the skies and keep an open mind.\u201d\n\nTo report a potential encounter go here.\n\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX.

        "article_content": "Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Scientists said on Thursday they found what is believed to be the world's largest coral, which has been growing undisturbed in the Solomon Islands for possibly 300 years.\n\nA research vessel with the National Geographic Pristine Seas team found the coral in the Three Sisters Island group. The coral measured 112 feet wide, 105 feet long and 18 feet high with a circumference of more than 600 feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Just when you think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" Enric Sala, National Geographic Explorer in Residence and founder of Pristine Seas, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a significant scientific discovery, like finding the world's tallest tree. But there is cause for alarm. Despite its remote location, this coral is not safe from global warming and other human threats.\"\n\nCoral is a living organism made up of a complex network of coral polyps, tiny individual creatures. Coral reefs, however, are made up of many colonies of corals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists said the newly discovered coral is so large that it can be seen from space and looks more like a huge rock lurking just under the ocean. The discovery comes as concerns continue over dying coral reefs around the world because of climate change.\n\n\"The ocean provides for our livelihoods and has contributed so much to our national economy and communities,\" Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele, told National Geographic. \"Our survival depends on healthy coral reefs, so this exciting discovery underlines the importance of protecting and sustaining them for future generations.\""

        "article_content": "Every day, NASA\u2019s satellites orbit Earth, capturing a wealth of information that helps us understand our planet. From monitoring wildfires to tracking climate change, this vast trove of Earth Science data has the potential to drive scientific discoveries, inform policy decisions and support industries like agriculture, urban planning and disaster response.\n\nBut navigating the over 100 petabytes of collected data can be challenging, which is why NASA has collaborated with Microsoft to explore the use of a custom copilot using Azure OpenAI Service to develop NASA\u2019s Earth Copilot, which could transform how people interact with Earth\u2019s data.\n\nGeospatial data is complex, and often requires some level of technical expertise to navigate it. As a result, this data tends to be accessible only to a limited number of researchers and scientists. As NASA collects more data from new satellites, these complexities only grow and may further limit the potential pool of people able to draw insights and develop applications that could benefit society.\n\nRecognizing this challenge, NASA embarked on a mission to make its data more accessible and user-friendly. Through NASA\u2019s Office of the Chief Science Data Officer, the agency seeks to democratize data access, breaking down technical barriers to empower a diverse range of audiences, from scientists and educators to policymakers and the general public.\n\nYouTube Video Click here to load media\n\nThe challenge: Navigating the complexity of data\n\nNASA\u2019s Earth Science Data Systems Program is responsible for collecting an incredible variety of data from spaceborne sensors and instruments. This data spans everything from atmospheric conditions to land cover changes, ocean temperatures and more. However, the sheer scale and complexity of this information can be overwhelming. For many, finding and extracting insights requires navigating technical interfaces, understanding data formats and mastering the intricacies of geospatial analysis \u2014 specialized skills that very few non-technical users possess. AI could streamline this process, reducing time to gain insights from Earth\u2019s data to a matter of seconds.\n\nThis issue isn\u2019t just a matter of convenience; it has real-world implications. For example, scientists who need to analyze historical data on hurricanes to improve predictive models, or policymakers who want to study deforestation patterns to implement environmental regulations, may find themselves unable to easily access the data they need. This inaccessibility affects a broad array of sectors, including agriculture, urban planning and disaster response, where timely insights from spaceborne data could make a significant difference.\n\nMoreover, as new satellites with new instruments continue to launch and collect more data, NASA is constantly faced with the challenge of building new tools to manage and make sense of this growing repository. The agency explored emerging technologies that could not only streamline data discovery but also broaden accessibility, enabling more people to engage with the data and uncover new insights.\n\nThe solution: AI-powered data access through Microsoft Azure\n\nTo address these challenges, NASA IMPACT worked with Microsoft to develop an AI-driven customer copilot, called Earth Copilot, which could simplify data access and encourage a wider range of users to interact with its Earth Science data. Together, they built the proof of concept AI model that leverages Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform and advanced AI capabilities to transform how users can search, discover and analyze NASA\u2019s geospatial data.\n\nThe key to NASA\u2019s Earth Copilot lies in the integration of cloud-based technologies like Azure OpenAI Service, which provides access to powerful AI models and natural language processing capabilities that enable developers to integrate intelligent, conversational AI into their applications. This approach allows NASA to integrate AI into its existing data analysis platform \u2014 VEDA. These technologies together make it easier for users to search, discover and analyze Earth Science data\n\nBy combining these technologies, Earth Copilot enables users to interact with NASA\u2019s data repository through plain language queries. Instead, they can simply ask questions such as \u201cWhat was the impact of Hurricane Ian in Sanibel Island?\u201d or \u201cHow did the COVID-19 pandemic affect air quality in the US?\u201d AI will then retrieve relevant datasets, making the process seamless and intuitive.\n\n\u201cAzure\u2019s robust suite of services, including machine learning, data analytics and scalable cloud infrastructure, powers this AI prototype,\u201d said Juan Carlos L\u00f3pez, former NASA engineer and current Azure Specialist at Microsoft. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed the system to handle complex queries and large datasets efficiently, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need without getting bogged down by technical complexities. Our goal was to create a seamless, scalable solution that could evolve as NASA\u2019s data, tools and applications grow.\u201d\n\nDemocratizing data for open science\n\nThe collaboration between NASA IMPACT and Microsoft has resulted in a solution that democratizes access to spaceborne data, enabling a broader range of users to engage with NASA\u2019s science data. This has significant benefits for the scientific community, as researchers can now spend less time on data retrieval and more on analysis and discovery. For example, climate scientists can quickly access historical data to study trends, while agricultural experts can gain insights into soil moisture levels to improve crop management.\n\nEducators and teachers can use real-world examples to engage students in Earth Science, fostering curiosity and encouraging the next generation of scientists and engineers. Policymakers can leverage the data to make informed decisions on critical issues like climate change, urban development and disaster preparedness, ensuring they have the most accurate information at their fingertips.\n\n\u201cThe vision behind this collaboration was to leverage AI and cloud technologies to bring Earth\u2019s insights to communities that have been underserved, where access to data can lead to tangible improvements,\u201d said Minh Nguyen, Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. \u201cBy enabling users to interact with the data through simple, plain language queries, we\u2019re helping to democratize access to spaceborne information.\u201d\n\nThe development of this AI prototype aligns with NASA\u2019s Open Science initiative, which aims to make scientific research more transparent, inclusive and collaborative. By removing barriers to data discovery, NASA and Microsoft are setting the stage for a new era of discovery, where insights are not confined to a select few but can be explored and expanded by anyone curious about the world.\n\nLooking ahead: Bridging the gap between data and insights\n\nAt the moment, the NASA Earth Copilot is available to NASA scientists and researchers to explore and test its capabilities. Any responsible deployment of AI technologies requires rigorous assessments to ensure the data and outputs cannot be misused. After a period of internal evaluations and testing, the NASA IMPACT team will explore the integration of this capability into the VEDA platform.\n\nThis collaboration exemplifies how technology can empower people, drive innovation and create positive change. Solutions like this will be essential in ensuring the benefits of data are shared widely, enabling more people to engage with, analyze and act upon information that shapes our world.\n\nTags: AI, Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot, Microsoft Azure"

        "article_content": "Global travel continues to gain ground, with the World Travel and Tourism Council predicting the industry will cross $11 trillion in revenues this year. Consumers are evolving from the so-called \u201crevenge travel\u201d of the post-COVID-19 years, dedicating a growing share of their budget to a wider array of experiences away from home. Add AI to the mix, and we now have renewed investor interest in startups looking to disrupt the landscape with something new.\n\nRiding the travel train, Berlin-based Tourlane \u2014 an agent-esque platform that lets users plan and budget trips, bringing together flights, accommodations, activities, and tickets \u2014 has raised a fresh \u20ac25 million ($26 million) in funding in hopes of capitalizing on those trends.\n\nThe Series D, led by Sequoia Capital, is intended as a bridge to help the company reach profitability, Julian Weselek, Tourlane\u2019s CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. The startup will use the funds also to expand its tech, double down on AI, and potentially expand to more origination markets beyond its current bases in France and Germany.\n\nThe AI investment may be the detail that catches your eye. Weselek said the company is bringing in generative AI around the front end of the service to build more intuitive ways to help steer users toward options for what they want.\n\nHe said that won\u2019t spell a full replacement of humans, though. \u201cIs it possible to build the tech to give customers a fully automated offer? Yes, sure that can be done,\u201d Weselek said. \u201cI think the question is, if you know your marriage depends on this next holiday, do you want [that, or] to have a consultation with someone who has been in the country to make a sign off on the booking?\u201d\n\nTourlane is also making a significant bet on the back end, where AI will help evaluate the thousands of permutations of flights, accommodation, cars, activities, time of year, and other variables to maximize the chances of getting users what they want \u2014 and Tourlane more revenues, too, as a result.\n\nThe company, Weselek added, has around 500 employees, of which about 150 are customer agents. He said as a \u201crelative number\u201d that figure is \u201cgoing down,\u201d compared to how many customers each agent helps. \u201cThey are becoming more efficient.\u201d\n\nBeyond AI, perhaps equally significant for Tourlane is the question of scale. Founded in 2015, the startup is now nearly a decade old, and to date, it says it has booked trips for 100,000 individuals (each person in a booking counts as an individual).\n\nIt\u2019s also serving more customers: Weselek said last year was five times stronger than its last year before COVID-19 hit.\n\nStill, relatively speaking, 100,000 isn\u2019t a huge number. Figures from the UN estimate that the number of travelers globally totaled 790 million in the first seven months of 2024.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unclear what the payoff is for Tourlane. Like traditional travel agents, Tourlane makes a commission on the services it sells, but it does not disclose how much, instead saying the fee varies depending on different factors and partners.\n\nNonetheless, this is clearly a bet that Sequoia Capital feels is worth taking. The venture firm is now Tourlane\u2019s largest outside investor.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique moment in the history of travel. With AI, every traveler will have the opportunity to see the world through personalized custom travel experiences,\u201d Andrew Reed, the Sequoia partner who led this investment, said in a statement. \u201cTourlane is positioned to delight millions of travelers in the years to come.\u201d\n\nSequoia is an interesting name to have on the cap table, given the success the storied venture firm has had in travel so far. Its past investments have included Airbnb (one of its earliest investors, Sequoia became one of the biggest winners when it IPO\u2019d), Skyscanner (one of Sequoia\u2019s first investments in Europe, now part of Trip.com), Klook, and Kayak (now part of Booking), along with many other smaller startups in the space.\n\nOther investors participating in the Series D include Target Global (a new backer), Jared Smith (co-founder of Qualtrics), and HV Capital.\n\nTourlane isn\u2019t disclosing its current valuation, but for context, the last time it raised money \u2014 a $20 million Series C extension round \u2014 it had a $242 million valuation, the same as what it was valued in its original $47 million Series C. The first tranche of that Series C round closed just months before the pandemic hit, and the second closed in the middle of it, when Tourlane raised money to hang on until people traveled again.\n\nPerhaps because of the rollercoaster that Tourlane has lived through so far, or because the valuation is modest this time as well, Weselek said he does not treat that number as a focus or priority.\n\n\u201cCompany valuations in the private market are highly volatile and strongly influenced by several external factors that we can\u2019t control, such as the cost of capital, investment hype cycles, and perceived risk levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is important to us right now is the fact that we have successfully secured \u20ac25 million of funding from world-class investors, which enables us to bridge the path to profitability while further investing in our product, our service, and our growth. If we succeed in our ambitions, we will generate a lot of shareholder value in the years to come.\u201d"
