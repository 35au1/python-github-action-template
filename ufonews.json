        "article_content": "Experts have theorized that UFOs appear to defy the laws of physics potentially thanks to an anti-gravity machine, and that as a result, humans look like we're moving in slow-motion.\n\nLuis Elizondo, the former Pentagon insider who's been blowing the lid off the government's UFO secrets, has made shocking claims in his book, 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs.'\n\nIn his bombshell memoir, he outlines a theory that gained steam during his time as part of the AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) group: UFOs harness anti-gravity to circumvent the laws of physics.\n\nAn anti-gravity device, forming what Elizondo's team calls a 'bubble' around a craft, would potentially make the object immune to Earth's gravitational forces - which might explain its incredible acceleration abilities.\n\nAnd without any gravity affecting the craft, there would also be no time dilation taking place, meaning that while time for everyone on Earth would be slowed down by the Earth's gravity, time for anything operating a craft would be considerably faster.\n\nThis would mean anything looking outside a craft would see the entirety of humanity moving at a fraction of their speed.\n\nLuis Elizondo, the former Pentagon insider who's been blowing the lid off the government's UFO secrets, has made shocking claims in his book, 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs'\n\nResearch by Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, and Harvard's Avi Loeb has shocked the scientific community when they concluded that recent UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) observations defy laws of physics\n\nPhysicist Erik Lentz from the University of G\u00f6ttingen has similarly proposed a mind-boggling theory that could explain how these otherworldly visitors traverse the vast distances of space.\n\nHis research suggests a way to create the above mentioned 'warp bubble' that could allow spacecraft to travel faster than light without breaking Einstein's cosmic speed limit, as reported by Physics World.\n\nBut the catch is that it would require energy equivalent to 'hundreds of times the mass of the planet Jupiter'\n\n'A warp bubble traveling faster than light cannot be created from inside the bubble, as the leading edge of the bubble would be beyond the reach of a spaceship sitting at its center,' he said.\n\n'The problem is that you need energy to deform space all the way to the very edge of the bubble, and the ship simply can't put it there.'\n\nErik Lentz suggests a 'warp bubble' could allow spacecraft to travel faster than light without breaking Einstein's cosmic speed limit\n\nMeanwhile, a groundbreaking paper by Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, and Harvard's Avi Loeb also sheds light - or bends it - on how UFO seem to create optical illusions.\n\nThe paper states that these mysterious objects should create 'a bright optical fireball, ionization shell and tail' due to friction with air or water, as reported by Popular Mechanics.\n\n'The friction of UAP with the surrounding air or water is expected to generate a bright optical fireball, ionization shell and tail \u2014 implying radio signatures,' it wrote.\n\nOn top of that, many of the observed UAPs show no signs of these telltale signatures.\n\nThis could mean that UFOs could be nothing more than 'sensor-induced optical illusions.'\n\n'The lack of all these signatures could imply inaccurate distance measurements (and hence derived velocity) for single site sensors without a range gate capability,' the authors wrote.\n\n'Typical UAP sightings are too far away to get a highly resolved image of the object and determination of the object's motion is limited by the lack of range data.'\n\nA groundbreaking paper by Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, and Harvard's Avi Loeb also sheds light - or bends it - on how UFO seem to create optical illusions\n\nWithout any gravity affecting the craft, there would also be no time dilation taking place, meaning that while time for everyone on Earth would be slowed down by the Earth's gravity, time for anything operating a craft would be considerably faster\n\nHowever, Elizondo points out in his book that the optical illusion could be generated by the 'bubble'.\n\nCiting the Doppler effect, the former intelligence officer said that light moving in and out of the medium would skew based on if the object was moving away from you or toward you.\n\nElizondo, risking his life, has alleged in his book that the US military has been running a top-secret program to retrieve and reverse-engineer alien craft for years.\n\nHe even has claimed they've recovered non-human specimens.\n\n'We're not alone,' Elizondo told NewsNation. 'We are not alone in this universe, and it is a simple fact. The U.S. government has been aware of that fact for decades now. I think if the American public knew just how deep this lie went, that we would have a very significant constitutional crisis on our hands.'\n\nElizondo, risking his life, has alleged that the US military has been running a top-secret program to retrieve and reverse-engineer alien craft for years\n\nHe even has claimed they've recovered non-human specimens\n\nHis book contains, among its many incredible revelations, details on a 2016 plan hatched by Elizondo and his military colleagues to catch a UFO in the ocean.\n\n'The United States has been involved in the recovery of objects,' Elizondo told the outlet. 'Vehicles of unknown origin that are neither from our country or any other foreign country that we're aware of.'\n\nBut it's not just conspiracy theories anymore.\n\nIn August, Elizondo told reporters that he can confirm one of two 'vehicles of unknown origin' were recovered from the now legendary Roswell UFO crash of 1947.\n\nMore shocking still, Elizondo said, 'We, as a nation have, been interested in not only the vehicles themselves but the occupants,' which he called 'biological specimens.'\n\nElizondo helped release three of the most famous UFO videos in history after leaving his role in the US Department of Defense in late 2017.\n\nElizondo first rose to national prominence in late 2017 in the pages of the New York Times \u2014 where he blew the whistle on the US military and intelligence community's pervasive mismanagement and excessive secrecy on the topic of UFOs.\n\nHis public resignation and opaque role within the Pentagon's UFO-hunting portfolio, known to its Senate backers as the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), brought fame and a lead role in a History channel docu-series.\n\nIn April 2020, the Pentagon officially released three videos that Elizondo had helped leak in 2017, each taken by US Navy fighter pilots who had reportedly witnessed 'unexplained aerial phenomena' (UAP) as UFOs are now more technically known.\n\nElizondo first rose to national prominence in 2017 in the pages of the New York Times, after he helped release three US Navy infrared UFO videos - including the GOFAST video (above)\n\nThe videos depict, as Elizondo told CNN, 'things that don't have any obvious flight surfaces, any obvious forms of propulsion [...] maneuvering in ways that include extreme maneuverability beyond, I would submit, the healthy G-forces of a human or anything biological.'\n\nDespite corroboration from his peers and the late Senate Majority leader who helped create AATIP, Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, the Department of Defense has maintained that Elizondo's military role had no official UFO-hunting duties.\n\nPentagon officials denied the existence of any 'credible evidence of extraterrestrial activity,' in a statement responding to NewsNation's forthcoming interview.\n\n'As we have stated previously, Luis Elizondo had no assigned responsibilities for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) while assigned to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security,' DoD spokesperson Sue Gough told NewsNation.\n\nCritics of Gough have pointed to a 2003 research paper on psychological warfare that she wrote for the US Army War College, implying the Pentagon spokesperson might be part of a coordinated campaign to undermine Elizondo's credibility.\n\nAnd, in May 2021, Elizondo filed a 64-page complaint to the DoD's Office of the Inspector General accusing high-ranking military officials of attempting to silence him by threatening his security clearances and obfuscating of his work with AATIP.\n\nElizondo said he endured 'malicious activities, coordinated disinformation, professional misconduct, whistleblower reprisal and explicit threats perpetrated by certain senior-level Pentagon officials.'\n\nAbove, veteran Australian TV news broadcaster and investigative reporter Ross Coulthart - who conducted the first televised interview with government UFO whistleblower David Grusch last year - conducted the new interview with Elizondo, which airs in full on Friday\n\nThese actions, he and his attorneys said, suggested 'a coordinated effort to obfuscate the truth from the American people, while impugning my reputation as a former intelligence officer at the Pentagon.'\n\nHis new memoir, 'Imminent,' sees the former Pentagon official opening up about much more incredible personal accounts \u2014 including the story of his own family's disturbing experience with 'green orbs' floating through their house.\n\nIn the book, Elizondo also details he and another AATIP member's plan to catch UFOs on the high seas.\n\nHe told Dailymail.com in August that their investigations pointed to these craft having an apparent interest in military operations, nuclear power, and were often seen around bodies of water.\n\nSo they coordinated with the Navy and other branches to create 'Project Interloper': an attempt to lure the mysterious craft and record them with high-tech equipment."

Several redacted pages accompany the photo in question, though it is interesting to note how the photo was approved for release days after the incident but held back.\n\nThe incident was one of a few within days in February 2023. At least three objects were found and downed over Alaska, the Yukon, and Lake Huron. According to the New York Post, these three objects are \"small metallic [balloons] with a tethered payload,\" and were much smaller than the suspected Chinese spy balloon that traveled across the U.S. before being shot down over South Carolina on Feb. 4, 2023.\n\nCanada has unveiled the first-ever image of the UFO downed during a joint US-Canada mission in February 2023.

        "article_content": "\n\n\n\nAlthough questions remain whether locals really did see a UFO landing in Bentilee more than 50 years ago, a new dramatised version of the event put on by Claybody Theatre promises to be out of this world. Here StokeonTrentLive takes a look back at that day in 1967 as space fever gripped the nation...\n\nBack in 1967, when space exploration was capturing everyone's imagination, residents of Stoke-on-Trent were abuzz with talk of unidentified flying objects, especially as summer drew to a close and numerous sightings were reported.\n\nHowever, it was the events of September 2 that left even seasoned UFO enthusiasts scratching their heads. Numerous independent witnesses described seeing a red glowing object that night, causing quite a stir.\n\nREAD MORE:Moddershall Oaks 'overwhelmed' a week on from devastating flash floods\n\nREAD MORE:John Caudwell hits back at troll's 'untruths' after 'old, bald d***head' jibe\n\nStokeonTrentLive has obtained footage from an ATV Today broadcast, where presenter Gwyn Richards describes the 'extraordinary event' witnessed by many. Among those interviewed are neighbours Mrs Bowen and Mrs Stephenson, who both observed the UFOs descent near their estate.\n\nMrs Bowen, speaking calmly, recounted: \"It seemed like a saucer, you know. It changed in different colours - a red, a greenish and a blue. I did get frightened of it when it dropped.\"\n\nMrs Stephenson recalled: \"The object glowed bright red as if someone had lit a bonfire in the middle of a field. It spanned half a field. We could see the outline of it clearly like a dome but we couldn't see no door. There was no heat it was just a red glow.\n\n\"We couldn't even hear a bird, everything was dead. There was a man standing behind us. He said 'Did you two see it? '. We said 'yes'. He said 'I was in the bedroom and we thought the field was on fire because the bedroom was illuminated red. I came down because I thought I was seeing things'.\n\n-Credit:No credit\n\n\"While me and Mrs Bowen were at the bottom of the close we saw the object in the sky going the same way as it had come. The colours were glowing and it was going at a high speed.\"\n\nYoung Malcolm Bowen and three other lads also witnessed the strange occurrence that night, while an officer admitted his concern led him to advise the younger kids to go back indoors.\n\nMalcolm shared his experience: \"The rest of them ran off and I just stayed there. It was just like an ordinary saucer with a round sort of thing on the top. We thought it was an aeroplane at first but we all kept quiet.\n\n\"We saw it going round and then we said it couldn't be an aeroplane. We didn't hear any sound. We saw a very bright glow and it went straight up in the air and it went spinning round. Ten or 12 seconds later it went out of sight.\"\n\nA local policeman, taking a more cautious stance, also provided his take on the Bentilee UFO sighting, suggesting a potential explanation.\n\nHe recounted: \"We got there and we were met by a gang of children and one or two adults who informed us that they had seen this glow in the sky travelling from east to west or west to east, I can't remember exactly which. And that it had disappeared over the brow of the hill we were facing.\n\n\"We started climbing this banks. We were a little apprehensive and we did send quite a few children back who were quite small. These things could happen but I don't actually believe in them but I can't prove it one way or the other.\n\n\"The parents of the children were so adamant that this thing had happened we thought we'd be on the safe side. We carried on to the top of the hill and could see no signs. We could see nothing at all.\"\n\n\"In the distance there was a public house that had all yellow signs around it. I assumed that this lighting up for the first time could have been what they had seen.\"\n\nUFO experts Roger Stanway and Tony Pace also offered insights during an interview at Newchapel Observatory, reflecting on the Bentilee incident as 'quite incredible'.\n\nThey also mentioned that their investigation results were taken seriously by the Ministry of Defence, confirming an occurrence on the estate that particular evening.\n\nMr Pace added: \"The fact that quite a few witnesses were quite worried and disturbed at what had occurred convinced us that something really strange had happened on that Saturday night in September 1967.\"\n\nMr Stanway revealed: \"We couldn't find any explanation from the sources we contacted; air traffic control, the police, things of that nature. And as people on the estate wanted an explanation and we wanted something as well, we thought we'd go down to the MoD in London.\n\nNo caption\n\n\"We discussed the Bentilee episode as there was a terrific amount of evidence and independent witnesses. I then faced them with the bold question - 'Well gentleman, do you think in fact what is described in this report actually did take place? '. The reply was 'yes'.\"\n\n\"Well this somewhat surprised me as I expected them to have a number of explanations. My next question was 'What is the explanation, what were these objects, these phenomena? '. Much to my surprise they said 'we have no idea'. My immediate reaction was to say 'does this worry you? '. And they said 'yes'.\"\n\nWrapping up, Mr Richards made a call to Manchester Airport from a public telephone to report his unusual sighting of an unidentifiable craft over Derbyshire.\n\nMr Stanway and Mr Pace documented upwards of 70 distinct UFO encounters within a 20-mile expanse of Stoke-on-Trent, all detailed in their dossier 'UFOs: Unidentified, Undeniable'.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with the press, Mr Pace recounted the peculiar surge in UFO activity around Stoke-on-Trent's Bentilee area back in 1967: \"There were many reports of UFOs in the Potteries, and many seemed to be centred over the Bentilee area. At the time it was a country-wide phenomenon, there were sightings all over the country. You can't just dismiss things like that when so many people saw things.\"\n\nNorth Staffordshire historian Bill Cawley delved into these odd occurrences on the Bentilee estate and in neighbouring regions.\n\nHe explained: \"Reports of strange things in the sky stretched from Cannock to the hills above Leek. But the centre of much activity was the Bentilee estate, and the local media was full of sightings of UFOs in the skies of the city.\"\n\n\"On September 2, there were eight different sightings between 1am and dawn, with a lack of sound being a feature of all the sightings. An object like a spinning top was spotted by a resident of Beverley Drive.\n\n\"There was a very interesting account given by a Mrs Becanin. As an accomplished artist, she provided line drawings of what she had seen from her home in Hethersett Walk in the early hours.\n\n\"She couldn't sleep, and at 1am, after a drink of water, she looked through a window to see three orange lights lying on common ground some distance away. One of the lights seemed closer to her and larger, and was flashing with a brighter light.\n\n\"It began to ascend with a shower of green sparks, disappearing to the north east. The other two lights also vanished. The whole incident took two minutes. Another group saw a basin-shaped object fly overhead. It was glowing red and yellow, and appeared to land in fields off Beverley Drive.\"\n\n\"Children and adults ran in the direction of the landing site and one of the children said the area seemed on fire. Something had landed in the field and remained. A woman rang the police, who duly arrived. They saw nothing, but on leaving the area, a man in an upper room window called over that the saucer was taking off. It rose to about 300ft and then disappeared.\n\n\"When they were interviewed, the police remained sceptical and said the lights might have been reflections from street lighting or from the windows of a local pub. Then, on September 4, Terry Bagnall, aged 15, of Beverley Drive, saw a brightly coloured cigar-shaped object fly over the area with a bright light, which increased in intensity as it rose in the late morning sky.\"\n\n\"The report pointed out that jets using Manchester airport flew over the area, and that this would account for some of the sightings. It was also possible that many would have confused UFOs with satellites. A person mistaking the planet Venus was another possibility, as was freak weather conditions. However, Stanway and Pace concluded that 10 per cent of the sightings were unexplained.\"\n\nWhatever happened on that night in Bentilee, the truth is out there.\n\nBright Lights Over Bentilee has been written by playwright and former Coronation Street star Deborah McAndrew. It runs until October 12 at The Dipping House, Stoke.\n\nSign up to our main daily newsletter here and get all the latest news straight to your inbox for FREE"

        "article_content": "As more and more companies scramble to jam artificial intelligence into literally everything, I find myself becoming increasingly desensitized to the prospect of using AI for really anything. I loathe the anti-creative powers of generative AI for text and image creation, and I\u2019m so over products carrying AI branding for no reason (I\u2019m looking at you, Samsung Family Hub AI Vision fridge).\n\nAs a serial gym goer, however, there\u2019s one area of my life where AI has proven indispensable for more than a year, and that\u2019s in powering my workouts. Last year, I was introduced to PUSH, an AI-powered workout app and gym tracker designed to help you build muscle as quickly as possible by taking a scientific approach to workout creation.\n\nGive or take a couple of injuries and some holidays, I\u2019ve used PUSH six days a week, every week, for over a year. I\u2019ve done hundreds of workouts, and in that time I\u2019ve learned more about exercise than all my previous years of experience attending the gym. It\u2019s definitely one of the best fitness apps I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nPUSH is a delight to use, it\u2019s got a great interface that\u2019s very easy to use, rest counters, custom workout plans, and more. Yet more valuable than the joy I\u2019ve had using the app, PUSH has taught me some invaluable lessons about building muscle in the gym I can\u2019t wait to share with you. Here\u2019s everything I\u2019ve learned.\n\nProgressive overload really matters\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the gym or building muscle, you might have heard the term \u2018progressive overload\u2019 bandied around. Even as a long-time gym goer, I was familiar with the concept, but until I started using PUSH, I\u2019d never really taken it seriously.\n\nPUSH is hyper-tuned to help you gradually increase the amount of weight you\u2019re lifting over time, a tried and tested vehicle for building muscle. I\u2019d spent years bench pressing maybe 70 or 80kgs (175lbs-ish), occasionally pushing the boat out to 85kgs if I was feeling sprightly.\n\nPUSH has helped me elevate my bench press to a consistent 100kgs for multiple sets of five in less than 12 months. Across the board, all of my movements and lifts have increased in power and weight because PUSH doesn\u2019t let you take your foot off the gas. As soon as you can achieve the desired number of reps at a certain weight, PUSH uses its AI algorithm to calculate your next increment. If you fail a set or can\u2019t see a certain weight through to completion, it\u2019ll automatically calculate a plateau-breaker exercise, usually an increased weight for fewer reps, to help you smash through your next barrier.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWith PUSH in my pocket, I\u2019m no longer guessing weights for workouts, or retreading ground. I\u2019m just making clear consistent progress week-in, week-out.\n\nIt\u2019s time to ditch the Bro Split\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nMost people tend to split their gym program up into body parts. Chest on Monday, back on Tuesday, then legs, shoulders, arms, etc\u2026 in gym circles, this is known as the \u201cBro Split\u201d. If it works for you then that\u2019s fine, but PUSH\u2019s tailor-made program uses AI and peer-reviewed scientific research to calculate a plan that lets you train your entire body in an optimal cycle.\n\n\n\nFor instance, on some days, I train back, legs, arms, and shoulders, all at once. It took some getting used to \u2013 doing lateral pulldowns right after squats isn\u2019t fun \u2013 but by carefully training muscles in a more target way, rather than just blasting chest on a Monday once a week and so on, I\u2019ve noticed a much more consistent and manageable progression in my strength and improved recovery. You can opt for a push, pull, leg split in the PUSH app if you so desire, but I\u2019ve put my faith in the AI algorithm and its unconventional muscle groupings, and I\u2019ll never go back.\n\nRest is important\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWhile the aforementioned muscle groupings help with longer-term fatigue over the weeks and months, PUSH also comes with a built-in rest timer for use between sets. I probably spent six years in the gym just guessing at how long I was taking between sets, choosing when to start my next exercise based purely on vibes and whether or not I\u2019d finished cruising Instagram.\n\nPUSH\u2019s regimented rest timer, which varies depending on the type of exercise you\u2019re doing, has shown me the importance of training to a precise period of rest. Too little time between sets, and your muscles won\u2019t have recovered, leaving you unable to push as much as you need. Too long, and you won\u2019t be fatiguing your muscles enough to make any progress.\n\nAgain, PUSH uses AI to determine what constitutes an ideal rest time but gives you the final say in how long you take, letting you tweak rest periods slightly based on how you\u2019re feeling. With set rest times between exercises, I\u2019ve massively improved the progress I make in the gym, all while reducing how long I actually spend in the gym.\n\nGrowth takes time\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWe live in a world of instant gratification, but PUSH has helped me understand that growing and building muscle takes time and commitment. Having an app show me my progress week-by-week has been vital in keeping me motivated, even when the results aren\u2019t physically obvious or immediate.\n\nSeeing consistent strength gains each time I return to the gym is a terrific motivator, and has helped me to take my eyes off trying to make big jumps in performance or expecting huge changes in my physique. What\u2019s more, knowing you\u2019re on a steady upward trajectory takes ego lifting and overexerting yourself out of the equation, with measured increases drastically reducing the chances of injury, and of course embarrassment.\n\nInvesting in a program is worth it\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nI pay \u00a315.99 ($21 / AU$23.49) a month for the privilege of using PUSH. That\u2019s a lot of money for a monthly subscription app, but for me the investment is priceless. I\u2019m convinced that with PUSH I\u2019m getting good value out of the app. It\u2019s well-built, gets regular updates, and most importantly has proven effective for me. However, there\u2019s also an extra kick of motivation in knowing that if I\u2019m paying \u00a316 a month for a workout app, I should probably use it to the full, instead of wasting my money.\n\nIt\u2019s the same tortured logic that says buying a pair of the best running shoes will help you get out an exercise, or that paying for a gym membership is more likely to get you out of the house each January. It might not work for everyone, but the financial commitment I\u2019ve made to this app keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAnd a whole lot more besides\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nPUSH has more to offer. It\u2019s got a great library of exercises that help me plan around a busy gym or lack of equipment. Its plethora of peer-reviewed source material is well presented and makes for an interesting read, and its daily insights tell me which muscles I\u2019m growing and which might be stalling, another fabulous motivator. It\u2019s not a perfect app and it won\u2019t work for everyone, but after 12 months in my pocket, it\u2019s become an indispensable training partner."

The duo must tackle their sins of pride and prejudice to allow the heart to conquer all.\n\nWhat are enemies-to-lovers books?\n\nFor those still unsure, enemies-to-lovers books are novels about two individuals who start with disdain toward one another. However, as the storyline develops, they fall unexpectedly in love, with some comedic twists.\n\nWhat is dark romance?\n\nDark romance is a genre closely related to the 'enemies-to-lovers' trope. However, it may also contain elements of themes such as violence, trauma, abuse, and morally inept characters.\n\nWho invented the enemies-to-lovers trope?\n\nThe theme of growing love from hatred has existed for centuries. However, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of the most well-known examples of classic literature that contains this popular theme.\n\nIs enemies to lovers a bad trope?\n\nThe beloved trope can be unconvincing and somewhat unrealistic at times. However, most people enjoy following the unexpected plot twist of two otherwise incredibly different individuals growing fond of one another despite their reluctance surrounding the growing fondness within their relationship.\n\nEnemies-to-lovers books are among the most popular genres within novels. The surprising, all-encompassing romance that the two polar opposite fictional characters experience ignites the romantic in the reader, providing a sense of hope whilst being entertained by the other aspects of the developing storyline.\n\nREAD ALSO: JK Rowling: net worth, age, children, spouse, books, career, quotes, profiles\n\nWhile on the topic of riveting storylines, JK Rowling is a successful fantasy author best known for the hugely successful Harry Potter books.

These historic properties offer more than just comfortable beds and five-star room service\u2014they promise a chance to brush shoulders with long-departed guests who never quite managed to check out.\n\nMany of these hotels have embraced their paranormal reputations, offering ghost tours and special packages for thrill-seeking guests, especially during the Halloween season. But make no mistake\u2014the otherworldly occurrences at these hotels aren\u2019t limited to October.\n\nSo pack your bags (and maybe a night-vision camera or two), and prepare for a stay you\u2019ll never forget\u2014if you dare. Who knows? You might leave with more than just memories and minibar charges.\n\nThe Stanley Hotel | Estes Park, Colorado\n\nPerched at the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, the Stanley Hotel is the crown jewel of haunted hospitality. This grand Colonial Revival hotel, which opened in 1909, famously inspired Stephen King\u2019s The Shining\u2014though management assures guests that all work and no play is not on the agenda here.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s most active area, the concert hall, often echoes with phantom piano music, presumably from the spectral fingers of Flora Stanley, the original owner\u2019s wife. For those seeking a more personal encounter, the fourth floor is a hotbed of paranormal activity, garnering frequent reports of children\u2019s laughter and mysterious footsteps.\n\nAnd of course there is infamous room 217, where King himself experienced the nightmare that birthed his horror classic. Just remember, if you hear \u201credrum\u201d whispered in the night\u2026go back to sleep instead of investigating.\n\nRebecca Harding - Getty Images\n\nThomas House Hotel | Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee\n\nThe Thomas House Hotel, dating back to 1890, has earned a reputation as one of America\u2019s most haunted destinations. The hotel\u2019s history is as rich as it is dark: Situated on an ancient Native American trail and built atop an underground spring and limestone deposits, the Thomas House seems to have been destined for supernatural activity from its very foundation. Over its 130-plus years of existence, the hotel has witnessed a litany of tragedies, including deaths, murders, and accidents. It has even served as a home for a cult and survived three fires, each event purportedly leaving a spiritual mark on the property.\n\nVisitors and staff alike have reported everything from the classic cold spots and disembodied voices to more unsettling phenomena like moving beds and dark, shadowy figures. These encounters have made the hotel a mecca for ghost hunters and thrill seekers from around the world. For those brave enough, Thomas House Hotel offers regular ghost hunt weekends throughout the year.\n\nCourtesy of Google Maps\n\nThe Marshall House | Savannah, Georgia\n\nThe Marshall House, built in 1851, is the oldest hotel in Savannah. During its long history, the hotel served as a hospital three times: once during the Civil War for Union soldiers and twice during yellow-fever epidemics in the 19th century. During renovations in the late 1990s, workers discovered human remains under floorboards of what was once the hospital\u2019s surgery room, believed to be amputated limbs of Civil War soldiers.\n\nGuests might encounter the ghost of a Union soldier making his rounds, or perhaps catch a glimpse of the portly gentleman reading by the window. The ladies\u2019 restroom is reportedly haunted by a woman with a penchant for locking stall doors, so make it speedy. Other reported paranormal activities include faucets turning on and off by themselves and unexplained noises. One of the most famous spirits is said to be that of Joel Chandler Harris, author of the Uncle Remus stories, whose ghostly typewriter is sometimes heard in his former room.\n\nccahill - Getty Images\n\nThe Driskill Hotel | Austin, Texas\n\nThe Driskill Hotel, opened in 1886, was built by cattle baron Jesse Driskill. It cost $400,000 to make (an enormous sum at the time). But in 1888, Driskill lost his fortune and was forced to sell the hotel to his brother-in-law. The hotel has a rich history, serving as the unofficial \u201cTexas White House\u201d for President Lyndon B. Johnson, who watched election returns and held press conferences there. It\u2019s also where he took his future wife, Lady Bird, on their first date.\n\nThe Driskill is known for its ghostly inhabitants, including the spirit of Jesse Driskill himself, often detected by the smell of cigar smoke. Other famous ghosts include the \u201csuicide brides\u201d of room 525\u2014as the stories go, several brides have committed suicide in the bathroom on the same day, but in different years\u2014and the daughter of a Texas senator who reportedly died on the grand staircase in 1887.\n\nChris Rogers - Getty Images\n\nHotel Alex Johnson | Rapid City, South Dakota\n\nBuilt by railroad magnate Alex Carlston Johnson, Hotel Alex Johnson has been luxurious\u2014and a bit spooky\u2014since 1928, with its stunning views of the Black Hills. One of the hotel\u2019s most popular ghostly residents is the Lady in White, often seen wandering the eighth floor in her nightgown. Legend has it, she\u2019s the ghost of a young bride who leapt to her death from her honeymoon suite\u2014though whether it was suicide or murder remains a subject of speculation. Elsewhere, in room 812, guests report everything from mysterious knocks to ghostly apparitions\u2014some have even claimed to wake up to the sensation of being held down by an unseen force.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom at the Alex Johnson. The playful ghost of Alex Johnson himself is said to roam the halls, ensuring his hotel is run smoothly even from the afterlife. Guests have reported objects moving on their own and elevators operating without passengers\u2014but perhaps Mr. Johnson is just trying to give you a tour.\n\nCourtesy Hotel Alex Johnson\n\nHotel Chelsea | New York City\n\nIf you\u2019re staying at Hotel Chelsea, the city may not be the only thing that never sleeps. This New York City landmark has housed countless artists, musicians, and writers\u2014some of whom apparently decided to extend their stay indefinitely.\n\nOpened in 1884, Hotel Chelsea was originally conceived as a utopian experiment in cooperative living by architect Phillip Hubert. It was New York\u2019s first cooperative apartment complex, designed to house a mix of working-class residents and artists. After financial difficulties in 1905, it was converted into a hotel. Throughout the 20th century, it became a haven for artists, writers, and musicians. Notable residents included Mark Twain, Arthur Miller, Bob Dylan, and Andy Warhol.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s most infamous incident occurred in 1978 when Nancy Spungen, girlfriend of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious, was found stabbed to death in room 100. The ghost of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who died at the hotel after a night of heavy drinking, is also said to still haunt the halls. After a lengthy renovation, Chelsea's haunted legacy still remains intact. Future guests can look forward to rubbing elbows with both living celebrities and ghostly ones in this one-of-a-kind New York institution.\n\nUCG - Getty Images\n\nMiss Molly\u2019s Hotel | Fort Worth, Texas\n\nMiss Molly\u2019s Hotel in Fort Worth\u2019s Stockyards District has been offering rooms with a view of the past since 1910. Originally opened as a boarding house, it quickly transformed into one of the area\u2019s most popular bordellos, opening under the name Gayatte Hotel. During Prohibition, the establishment took on yet another identity as a speakeasy, serving up illicit libations to thirsty patrons. It wasn\u2019t until the 1940s that the building shed its risqu\u00e9 reputation and became a legitimate boarding house, finally evolving in the 1980s into the bed-and-breakfast we know today.\n\nGuests might encounter the spirits of former working girls, hear phantom footsteps, or feel unexplained cold spots. For the ultimate spooky experience, book the Cowboy Room, where the ghost of a former cowboy patron is said to still visit his favorite lady of the night. Or perhaps Miss Josie\u2019s room, named after the madam who once ran the brothel. Guests have reported feeling a presence sit on their bed in the middle of the night\u2014perhaps Miss Josie is still keeping an eye on her girls.\n\nDavid Wall - Getty Images\n\nLord Baltimore Hotel | Baltimore\n\nStanding tall in the heart of Charm City, the Lord Baltimore Hotel opened in 1928. The Renaissance-style building was once the largest hotel in Maryland and has played host to numerous dignitaries, celebrities, and apparently, a few guests who never checked out.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s most famous ghostly resident is a young girl in a cream-colored dress and black shoes, often seen playing with a red ball. Guests and staff have reported sightings of the child on the 19th floor and in the lobby. Also keep an eye out for the ghostly couple often spotted dancing in the Calvert Ballroom\u2014they\u2019re always dressed to the nines, even in the afterlife.\n\nSpencer Platt - Getty Images\n\nHotel Congress | Tucson, Arizona\n\nSince 1919, Hotel Congress has been a Tucson landmark, famous for its role in the capture of John Dillinger and infamous for its ghostly residents. The hotel\u2019s brush with infamy came in 1934 when a fire broke out on the third floor. Among the evacuated guests were Dillinger and his gang, who were subsequently recognized by firefighters and captured by the police. Today, the hotel celebrates this claim to fame with an annual Dillinger Days festival.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just outlaws who\u2019ve left their mark on Hotel Congress. Guests might spot the apparition of a woman in a long white dress roaming the halls or hear unexplained voices and footsteps in empty rooms. The ghost of a former handyman is said to tinker with the plumbing and electricity (maybe still trying to fix that faulty wiring that caused the 1934 fire). For those brave enough, room 242\u2014the alleged site of a suicide\u2014is said to be particularly active.\n\ncourtesy Hotel Congress\n\nThe Emily Morgan Hotel | San Antonio\n\nThe Emily Morgan Hotel, originally constructed in 1924 as a medical facility, is a 13-story building that has worn many hats\u2014from doctors\u2019 offices to the city\u2019s first high-rise apartments. Named after the Yellow Rose of Texas, Emily Morgan, who allegedly helped win Texas\u2019s independence by distracting Mexican General Santa Anna, the hotel embraces its folkloric roots. But it\u2019s the building\u2019s medical history that fuels its haunted reputation. Visitors report eerie encounters on the 7th, 9th, and 14th floors\u2014former surgery, psychiatric, and waiting room areas. Apparitions of nurses pushing gurneys, phantom patients wandering the halls, and unexplained noises are par for the course here, along with flickering lights and televisions with a mind of their own.\n\nAllan Baxter - Getty Images\n\nDauphine Orleans Hotel | New Orleans\n\nWhile the Dauphine Orleans Hotel as we know it opened its doors in 1969, the property\u2019s history stretches back to the early 19th century. The hotel\u2019s main building, constructed in the 1820s, was originally a prosperous bordello known as May Baily\u2019s Place. This notorious establishment operated during the heyday of New Orleans\u2019 red-light district, Storyville. Today, the hotel\u2019s bar, still called May Baily\u2019s Place, proudly displays an authentic brothel license.\n\nGuests and staff have reported encounters with the ghost of a Creole soldier, believed to be a Civil War general, who wanders the courtyard in full uniform. In May Baily's Place, patrons sometimes catch glimpses of a courtesan dressed in 19th-century attire, perhaps a lingering spirit from the building\u2019s bordello days.\n\nOne of the most frequently sighted apparitions is that of a young woman in a wedding dress, often seen dancing alone in the hotel\u2019s courtyard. Legend has it that she was a bride-to-be who was tragically killed on her wedding day and now haunts the grounds, forever waiting for her groom. Very Miss Havisham.\n\nCourtesy Dauphine Orleans Hotel\n\nConcord\u2019s Colonial Inn | Concord, Massachusetts\n\nConcord\u2019s Colonial Inn, one of the oldest operating hotels in the United States, was originally built in 1716. The inn played a significant role during the American Revolutionary War, with its location just half a mile from the North Bridge where the \u201cshot heard around the world\u201d occurred on April 19, 1775.\n\n\n\nThe inn\u2019s most sought-after accommodation, room 24, once served as an operating room for wounded soldiers during the Revolutionary War. Guests report flickering lights, mysterious sounds, and even the sensation of being tucked into bed by an unseen presence (talk about revolutionary hospitality). For the truly daring, room 27, formerly the morgue, promises a stay you\u2019ll never forget.\n\nWhether you encounter the ghosts of caretakers past or simply enjoy the historic ambiance, Concord\u2019s Colonial Inn offers a uniquely American haunted experience.\n\nCourtesy Concord's Colonial Inn\n\nYou Might Also Like"

        "article_content": "A grassroots organization is calling on the provincial government to reopen the Ontario Science Centre after it was abruptly closed in June following the discovery of structural issues in the building.\n\nSave Ontario\u2019s Science Centre held a rally in a Scarborough park on Sunday, just days after the 55th anniversary of the museum\u2019s opening. Organizer Floyd Ruskin spoke to those in attendance and said Premier Doug Ford has received as many as 90,000 letters from Ontarians who want the centre reopened.\n\n\u201cOut of those 90,000 letters that the premier has received, 42 per cent come from outside the city of Toronto. That makes it a province-wide initiative,\u201d he said, adding that the letters represented all 124 of the province\u2019s electoral districts.\n\nThe tourist attraction in North York was officially closed on June 21 after an engineering report found that there were \u201cserious structural issues,\u201d including the risk of a potential roof panel failure.\n\nAlthough the report suggested other alternatives beyond closure, including blocking off the part of the building where roof panels could give way, Ford has suggested that repairing the aging structure would be \u201cfoolish\u201d and cost more than $500 million.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the Science Centre has been a source of social, educational, and economic prosperity, not just to the community around it, not just to Toronto, not just Ontario, but to all of Canada and around the world,\u201d Adil Shamji, the MPP for Don Valley East, said at the Sunday rally. \u201cAnd in one fell swoop, this premier comes in, and he says, we're going to shut it down with no notice, because supposedly, the roof's about to collapse. Well, look, we met architects, we had engineers, we had the people that built this science centre come out and say that it is A-OK.\u201d\n\nPrior to the June closure, the province already had plans to move the tourist attraction to the redeveloped Ontario Place. However, that space won\u2019t open until 2028 at the earliest and will have a much smaller footprint.\n\nThe province has said that it is looking for an interim space for a science centre until the new one is built, but that won\u2019t be open until 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, the province said the fate of the current building will be subject to discussions with the City of Toronto, which owns the land where the former science museum was located.\n\nAll remaining staff at the Ontario Science Centre must vacate the building by Oct. 31.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press"

        "article_content": "Twenty years ago this October, two physicists at the University of Manchester, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, published a groundbreaking paper on the \u201celectric field effect in atomically thin carbon films\u201d. Their work described the extraordinary electronic properties of graphene, a crystalline form of carbon equivalent to a single layer of graphite, just one atom thick.\n\nAround that time, I started my doctorate at the University of Surrey. Our team specializes in the electronic properties of carbon. Carbon nanotubes were the latest craze, which I was happily following. One day, my professor encouraged a group of us to travel to London to attend a talk by a well-known science communicator from the University of Manchester. This was Andre Geim.\n\nWe were not disappointed. He was inspiring for us fresh-faced PhD students, incorporating talk of wacky Friday afternoon experiments with levitating frogs before getting on to atomically thin carbon. All the same, we were skeptical about this carbon concept. We couldn\u2019t quite believe that a material effectively obtained from pencil lead with sticky tape was really what it claimed to be. But we were wrong.\n\nThe work was quickly copied and reproduced by scientists across the globe. New methods for making this material were devised. Incredible claims about its properties made it sound like something out of a Stan Lee comic. Stronger than steel, highly flexible, super-slippery and impermeable to gases. It is a better electronic conductor than copper and a better thermal conductor than diamond. It is also practically invisible and displays a host of exotic quantum properties.\n\nGraphene was hailed as a revolutionary material, promising ultra-fast electronics, supercomputers and super-strong materials. More fantastical claims have included space elevators, solar sails, artificial retinas, and even invisibility cloaks.\n\nJust six years after their initial work, Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, further fueling the enthusiasm around this wonder stuff. Since then, hundreds of thousands of academic papers have been published on graphene and related materials.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. Skim through the comments section of any popular article on the material, and you\u2019ll quickly find the sceptics. We have endured decades of empty promises about the real-world impact of graphene, they complain. Where are the game-changing products to enrich our lives or save the world from climate change, they ask?\n\nSo, has graphene been a resounding success or a damp squib? As is so often the case, the reality is somewhere in between.\n\nGraphene\u2019s ups and downs\n\nIn terms of public perception, it\u2019s fair to say that graphene has been held to an impossible standard. The popular media can certainly exaggerate science stories for clicks, but academics \u2013 including myself \u2013 are not immune from over-egging or speculating about their pet projects either. I\u2019d argue this can even be useful, helping to drive new technologies forward. Equally, though, there can be a backlash when progress looks disappointing.\n\nHaving said that, disruptive technologies such as cars, television or plastic all required decades of development. Graphene is still a newcomer in the grand scheme of things, so it\u2019s far too early to reach any conclusions about its impact.\n\nWhat has quietly occurred is a steady integration of graphene into numerous practical applications. Much of this is thanks to the Graphene Flagship, a major European research initiative coordinated by Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. This aims to bring graphene and related materials from academic research to real-world commercial applications, and more than 90 products have been developed over the past decade as a result.\n\nThese include blended plastics for high-performance sports equipment, more durable racing tyres for bicycles, motorcycle helmets that better distribute impact forces, thermally conductive coatings for motorcycle components, and lubricants for reducing friction and wear between mechanical parts.\n\nGraphene is finding its way into batteries and supercapacitors, enabling faster charging times and longer life spans. Conductive graphene inks are now used to manufacture sensors, wireless tracking tags, heating elements, and electromagnetic shielding for protecting sensitive electronics. Graphene is even used in headphones to improve the sound quality and as a more efficient means of transmitting heat in air-conditioning units.\n\nGraphene oxide products are used for desalination, wastewater treatment , and purification of drinking water. Meanwhile, a range of graphene materials can be bought off the shelf for use in countless other products, and major corporations, including SpaceX, Tesla, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony and Apple, are all rumored or known to be using them to develop new products.\n\nFrom promise to practicality\n\nThe impact of graphene on materials science is undeniable. The impact on consumer products is tangible but not as visible. Once a material is embedded in a working product, there is little need to keep mentioning it, and proprietary concerns can make companies reluctant to get into details in any case. Consumers can, therefore, be blissfully unaware that their car, mobile phone, or golf club contains graphene and most probably don\u2019t care as long as it works.\n\nAs production methods improve and costs decrease, we can expect graphene to become ever more widely adopted. Economies of scale will make it more accessible, and the range of applications is likely to continue to expand.\n\nPersonally, after two decades, I still get excited when I try it out for something new in the lab. While I may be guilty of having contributed to the initial hype, I remain optimistic about graphene\u2019s potential. I\u2019m still waiting for my ride on a space elevator, but in the meantime, I\u2019ll take comfort in the fact that graphene is already helping to shape a better future \u2013 quietly and steadily.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation by Stephen Lyth at the University of Strathclyde.

        "article_content": "After two consecutive wins, the New York Jets stumbled in Week 4 with a 10-9 home loss to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Jets scored no touchdowns, settling for three Greg Zuerlein field goals. The weather was cold and rainy and quarterback Aaron Rodgers wasn't at his sharpest, completing 57% (24-of-42) of his passes for 225 yards. He was also sacked five times.\n\nSelf-inflicted mistakes were also a significant factor in the Jets' offensive ineptitude. They committed five false start penalties Sunday, two each by running back Breece Hall and left guard John Simpson. Tyron Smith jumped early for the fifth penalty.\n\nFollowing the game, Jets head coach Robert Saleh said the cadence on offense was an issue. Though he didn't name Rodgers specifically, the quarterback is the one yelling out the snap count.\n\nRobert Saleh talks about the cadence on offense and how that has been a problem in regards to penalties for the Jets pre-snap pic.twitter.com/WQJCLHGi3Z \u2014 Jets Videos (@snyjets) September 29, 2024\n\n\"We gotta figure it out, whether or not we\u2019re good enough or ready to handle all of the cadence,\u201d Saleh said. \"Cadence had not been an issue all camp. Felt like our operation had been operating pretty good. Obviously, today took a major step back.\"\n\nAs could be expected, Rodgers didn't exactly agree with his head coach when he was asked about Saleh's remarks and whether or not his cadence should be dialed back.\n\n\"That's one way to do it,\" Rodgers said. \"The other way is to hold them accountable. I mean, we haven't had an issue. We've had one false start. Morgan [Moses] had one false start, I believe, until this.\"\n\nAaron Rodgers seems to get annoyed when asked about Robert Saleh\u2019s comments about dialing back the cadence on offense. \u201cThat\u2019s one way to do it. The other way is to hold them accountable.\u201d \ud83d\ude33#Jets pic.twitter.com/PUbM2WvCsK \u2014 Optimistic Jets (@OptimisticJets) September 29, 2024\n\n\"It\u2019s been a weapon. We use it every day in practice,\" Rodgers added. \"We rarely have a false start. And to have five today \u2026 Yeah, it seems like an outlier. I don\u2019t know if we need to make mass changes based on kind of an outlier game.\u201d\n\nThe Jets had 13 total penalties on Sunday, costing them 90 yards. So false starts were not the only issue for the team in its defeat.\n\nAny hint of tension between Rodgers and Saleh will raise the antenna of the media covering the Jets. That came up during Week 3's 24-3 win over the New England Patriots, when Saleh attempted to hug Rodgers, but the QB pushed him back to keep a distance.\n\nRodgers and Saleh are pumped.#TNFonPrime pic.twitter.com/b3aSB0VgsM \u2014 NFL on Prime Video (@NFLonPrime) September 20, 2024\n\nRodgers makes a convincing argument in pointing out that false starts haven't been an issue in the Jets' previous three games. Yet five penalties raises questions that Saleh was attempting to answer during his postgame media conference and might attempt to address during the coming week.\n\nIf false starts don't arise as a problem in the Jets' next few games, then concerns over Rodgers' cadence will fade. However, if they continue and Rodgers expresses any frustration on the field because of it, then Saleh and the coaching staff can say they were right and tensions could increase. Either this is indeed an outlier or it's something worth keeping an eye on for media and fans."
