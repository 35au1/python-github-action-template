        "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 An annual report released Wednesday by the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence revealed hundreds of cases of unidentified anomalous phenomena. But even with the sightings, there is still no direct link to aliens.\n\nOf the 757 reports, 485 occurred between May 2023 and June 2024, while around 272 occurred between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAccording to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), 21 of the cases still remain under investigation and require further data and analysis.\n\n\"It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report stated. \"None of the reports AARO received during the reporting period indicated that observers suffered any adverse health effects.\"\n\nMost of the sightings turned out to be balloons, birds, aircraft and even satellites in outer space.\n\nHow Thunderstorms Hundreds Of Miles Away Can Wreak Havoc On Air Travel\n\n\"AARO increasingly receives cases that it is able to resolve to the Starlink satellite constellation,\" the report stated. \"For example, a commercial pilot reported white flashing lights in the night sky. The pilot did not report an altitude or speed, and no data or imagery was recorded. AARO assessed that this sighting of flashing lights correlated with a Starlink satellite launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the same evening about one hour prior to the sighting. This sighting occurred in the known orbital path of the satellites. AARO is investigating if other unresolved cases may be attributed to the expansion of the Starlink and other mega-constellations in low earth orbit.\"\n\nWhile the number of reported UAP incidents has risen in recent years, government officials contend it is because of the public\u2019s greater awareness and tendency to report such objects than actually a growing trend.\n\nThe AARO was established in 2022 to oversee the investigation and analysis of UAPs and help determine their threats to national security.\n\nOf the nearly 400 reports received from pilots during the period, only one incident appeared to pose a potential safety risk, in which the AARO continues to look into the case.\n\nAdditionally, 18 reported events occurred near U.S. nuclear infrastructure, weapons and launch sites, prompting the involvement of law enforcement.\n\nAviation Experts Concerned 5G Rollout Near Airports Could Compromise Safety\n\nGovernment agencies, including the Department of Defense and the National Intelligence Program, use the broader term of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) rather than Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) to identify cases.\n\nUAPs include any unexplained phenomenon that occurs on land, sea or space, while UFOs specifically refer to objects that fly through the sky.\n\nRecent spotting of an UFO reported to the Department of Defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Hundreds of UFO-like sightings revealed in US Department of Defense report"

The sightings are then investigated by multiple agencies.\n\nOnce the Pentagon puts together the report, it\u2019s sent to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office for review.\n\nThis year, the AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 from this past year and an additional 272 from 2021-2022 that were not sent. The Pentagon says after being reviewed, the majority of the sightings were found to be ordinary objects.\n\nAs of today, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has received over 1,600 UAP reports, 757 of which came to AARO during the period covered by this report. \u201cAARO has successfully resolved hundreds of cases in its holdings to commonplace objects such as balloons, birds, drones, satellites and aircraft,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, the Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary.\n\nDuring that press briefing, the head of the AARO acknowledged that there were 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can\u2019t explain. The agency added that all 21 happened near national security sites, were recorded on video, and had multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability recently held its second hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, as they call them."

        "article_content": "Newly released documents have revealed that Canadian police collected debris of a UFO that was shot down over Lake Huron last year.\n\nThe object was taken down on February 12, 2023 by a US F-16 fighter jet, marking the third such incident over North America that month.\n\nWitnesses described the object as 'octagonal' with strings hanging off it before the jet fired two missiles, striking the UFO that then slowly descended into Canadian waters.\n\nDocuments obtained by CTVNews.ca stated that 'wreckage' was found on 'the shoreline of Lake Huron' weeks after search efforts were suspended.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) partnered with the American and Canadian Coast Guard to conduct a brief search following the incident.\n\nBy February 16, it was called off due to 'deteriorating weather and the low probability of recovery, according to an RCMP statement.\n\nBut the partially redacted emails acquired by CTVNews.ca revealed that the RCMP collected 'both material and a module' from the site of the incident roughly three weeks after the object was shot down.\n\nNational security officials have criticized the effort for a 'lack of transparency.'\n\nNewly released documents have revealed that Canadian police collected debris after an unidentified object was shot down over Lake Huron on February 12 2023\n\n'The module is from a company who sells weather monitoring equipment,' a senior RCMP member told a Canadian military brigadier-general in an email sent on March 13, 2023, according to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'It will be analyzed to determine if there is anything unusual with it but I suspect not given the size. Whether or not it is from the shoot down is uncertain,' the email continued.\n\nAn RCMP spokesperson further confirmed the debris collection in a statement to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'The RCMP confirms that debris was recovered from the shores of Lake Huron, and we continue to work in close collaboration with our domestic and international partners in furthering the investigation,' the spokesperson said Friday.\n\n'As the investigation is ongoing, additional details cannot be provided at this time.'\n\nThe RCMP would not confirm whether the debris was ever definitively linked to the Lake Huron object, and Canada's Department of National Defense also declined to comment, CTVNews.ca reported.\n\nIain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that the lack of transparency could be because the US and Canadian governments were embarrassed of shooting down objects that did not pose national security threats.\n\nThe object was taken down by a US F-16 fighter jet, and was the third unidentified object to be shot out of the sky over North American that month\n\nThe incident occurred just days after the downing of a Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4, which garnered widespread media attention.\n\n'To have expended significant military time and resources to shoot down benign objects does not look good, even though there may have been many factors we are still unaware of,' he speculated to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'I am not surprised that the Canadian government did not share more information about the Lake Huron debris.'\n\nThe incident, and three others that month, occurred just days after the downing of a Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4, which garnered widespread media attention.\n\nThe other two were downed in Alaska and Yukon, Canada.\n\nAll three were reported to be smaller than the Chinese balloon, which measured 200 feet tall, according to US General Glen D. VanHerck.\n\nThe balloon carried an underslung payload described as a 'technology bay' that was roughly the size of two to three school buses.\n\nIt flew across North America from January 28 to February 4, 2023, passing over Alaska, western Canada and the contiguous US before it was shot down by the US Air Force off the coast of South Carolina.\n\nAnalysis of the debris determined that the balloon carried intelligence-gathering equipment, but it did not appear to have sent information back to China.\n\nThe three UFO incidents that followed did not appear to be related to the Chinese balloon, and there was no evidence to suggest that they were surveillance vehicles from any other country, President Joe Biden stated on February 16."

        "article_content": "KUWAIT CITY, Nov 16: During a hearing by the US House Oversight Committee, Kuwait emerged as a focal point in discussions -- not for political or economic reasons but due to its association with unidentified flying objects (UFOs), reports Al-Seyassah daily. A 13-minute high-definition video of a UFO, technically referred to as an \u201cunidentified space object,\u201d was presented at the hearing on Thursday.\n\nThe clip reportedly filmed 20 miles off the coast of Kuwait from a helicopter, depicted a white spherical object, later joined briefly by a second identical sphere. The footage was sourced from the US Department of Defense\u2019s Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), which handles classified information. Journalist Michael Shellenberger, who obtained the video from an undisclosed source, shared the details during the session. According to the American Sky News network, the video provides one of the clearest documentation of UFOs over the Middle East.\n\nA report by Raseef22, an electronic magazine, highlighted Kuwait\u2019s history of UFO sightings, noting that the country ranks prominently among Arab nations experiencing such phenomena. The report attributes Kuwait\u2019s geographical location, in a region that has witnessed significant wars (e.g., the Iraq-Iran War and the Second Gulf War), as a potential factor for the increased frequency of sightings.\n\nThe Raseef22 report recounted notable UFO incidents in Kuwait:\n\n1970: A cylindrical object, larger than an airplane, was sighted over the Umm Al-Aish area.\n\n1978: Eyewitnesses reported a UFO landing near the media complex in the capital, temporarily disrupting television broadcasts.\n\n1986: Radar systems detected a mysterious object near Ahmadi, approximately 15 kilometers from the border, exhibiting unusual movement.\n\nA study by the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) suggested that UFO sightings are more frequent in regions of military conflict, adding credibility to the correlation between war zones and such phenomena. The hearing and the accompanying revelations about Kuwait bring the UFO debate closer to the Middle East, emphasizing the need for global cooperation in studying unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Whether these sightings hold scientific, security, or extraterrestrial significance remains an open question."

This generative AI experience has been around for a few months and is currently available in more than 100 countries. Despite all the negative press revolving around the inaccurate and sometimes dangerous results generated by AI Overviews, they have since improved to a great extent. Now that things appear to have settled down, Google is looking to expand its functionality further, specifically by letting users select a portion of the AI-generated overview to get additional information, also with the help of AI.\n\nScreenshots shared with Android Authority contributor AssembleDebug by Telegram user Eli_Blau show how AI Overviews would let users get a follow-up AI response by selecting a portion of the text. To put it in simple terms, this is effectively an AI Overview of an AI Overview.\n\nA screenshot detailing the upcoming follow-up AI response feature in Google Search\u2019s AI Overviews\n\nThe follow-up result appears on the bottom half of the screen, and it's resizable, too, enabling users to go through both the original AI Overview and the newly generated result at the same time. This feature appears to be part of a limited experiment, with Eli_Blau reportedly spotting it in version 15.45.33 (beta) of the Google app.\n\nThere are some limitations in place\n\nBased on this revelation, AI Overviews will only let you generate one additional response in this fashion, which is understandable. However, we wouldn't be surprised if Google decided to let users go even further down the AI Overviews hole in a future update. Meanwhile, you can only trigger this follow-up response by selecting text from within the AI Overview window, so selecting any text or sentence from outside this box won't initiate the response.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe can anticipate a situation where this could be annoying, particularly if you just want to copy the selected text and not get another AI-generated result. From the video above, it looks like the follow-up response is automatically generated as soon as you select a portion of the text within the AI Overview window.\n\nGoogle appears to have put quite a bit of thought into this, suggesting that it may be one of those features that will eventually roll out more broadly. But we can't say when, given that it's still not available on devices running the latest beta of the Google app, including mine.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle LLC\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTOOLS\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.1\n\nDownload"

He died in prison in March 2021.\n\nThree years after DeFeo murdered his parents and siblings, a book was written about the family that moved into his former home and claimed they were haunted by spirits. Amazon\n\nDeFeo, also known as \"Butch,\" was 23 at the time of the killings. He initially tried to blame the murders on a mob hitman\u2014however, police later found serious holes in his story and turned their attention to him as their main suspect.\n\nHe was tried and ultimately convicted of six counts of second-degree murder. He was given six sentences of 25 years to life, and later died in jail on March 21, 2021, at the age of 69. In the years before his death, he claimed that he had heard voices telling him to kill his family.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nHowever, his crimes continue to haunt his former home and his neighborhood, with the name \"Amityville\" now synonymous with horror films and ghostly conspiracy theories.\n\nThe home where he shot and killed his family members still stands to this day\u2014a sinister reminder of the horrors that once took place inside its walls, despite efforts to wipe its slate clean.\n\nFirst, the property's address was officially changed from 112 Ocean Avenue to 108 Ocean Avenue, a common practice in cases where homes have been involved in gruesome crimes.\n\nMORE FROM REALTOR:\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nJust over a year after the DeFeo family was murdered, George and Kathy Lutz purchased the Amityville property for the reduced price of $80,000 and soon moved into the home with their three children.\n\nHowever, they moved out after just 28 days, alleging that they had experienced numerous paranormal phenomena while living there\u2014from strange odors and slime oozing from the walls to George waking to find Kathy levitating over their bed.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThey even claimed that a priest who had been to bless the home had heard a voice screaming at them to \"get out,\" per Biography.com.\n\nGeorge also alleged that he suddenly began waking at 3:15 a.m., which was the exact time that DeFeo is understood to have begun killing his family members, all of whom were found in their beds.\n\nThat book served as the basis for the hit 1979 movie \"The Amityville Horror.\" The film did not feature the DeFeo's former home and instead used a lookalike property. YouTube\n\nThe movie starred Hollywood A-listers Margot Kidder and James Brolin as George and Kathy Lutz, who moved into the DeFeo home with their children and claimed it was haunted. YouTube\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn the years since the home became the source of pop culture lore, it has passed hands multiple times\u2014most recently in 2017, when it was purchased for $605,000. Stan Wolfson/Newsday RM via Getty Images\n\nIt wasn't long before the Lutz family fled the property, leaving all of their belongings behind.\n\nThey faced a barrage of skepticism from the public, with critics accusing them of fabricating a series of spooky stories in a bid to gain national media attention; however, their experiences served as the basis for a book, \"The Amityville Horror: A True Story,\" which was later source material for the popular 1979 movie.\n\nNeither the original movie or any of its many sequels and prequels were filmed inside the DeFeo's former home. Lookalike properties were instead used as filming locations.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIt would take more than a year for the home to sell again\u2014this time to Jim and Barbara Cromarty, who paid just $55,000 for it in April 1977, not long before the book about the Lutz family's experiences was released.\n\nAlthough Jim and Barbara never reported witnessing any paranormal activity, they were plagued by the home's history\u2014revealing that their house was besieged by unwanted visitors at all hours of the night, a nightmare that led them to change the address in a bid to throw people off.\n\nAfter a year, they put the home on the market for $100,000; but by this point, interest in the Amityville case had reached fever pitch, and no legitimate buyer could be found. So, they chose to embrace the home's heritage, speaking out about it publicly and working with the local authorities to figure out a way to manage the influx of fascinated visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad"

And I remember the first time I saw it was like in the first second realized that I was looking to something unique because it's huge,'' he said.\n\nThe team\u2019s coral expert, Eric Brown, said that the discovery is a reminder of the importance of coral reefs and the increased need for action to save the world\u2019s oceans.\n\n\u201cNow the significance of finding coral like this, you know, goes beyond simply, you know, enjoying the moment and seeing this magnificent organism that's mega coral, because it doesn't just captivate the hearts and minds of people like seeing something magical, but it really shines a light (on) the significance of coral reefs worldwide, what their critical role is in the ecosystem,'' he said. \u2014 Reuters"

        "article_content": "While the US, with its line-up of powerful tech companies, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, seems to be spearheading the AI race, a force from the Far East is quietly establishing its dominance. China\u2019s multinational giant, Baidu, has been making strides in AI that others should probably worry about.\n\nA few days ago, at the Baidu World 2024 conference in Shanghai, the big-tech company unveiled a number of AI products that catered to enterprises and consumers alike. AI Agents, image generation, smartglasses, name anything and Baidu has it covered.\n\nTaking on Hallucinations\n\nWhen the West is flaunting its text-to-image models such as DALL\u00b7E 3, Gemini, and others that have landed themselves in trouble for spewing misinformation, Baidu has pretty much struck the right chord.\n\nAddressing the hallucinations that tend to mar the quality of AI-generated output, Robin Li, the founder and CEO of Baidu Inc, unveiled iRAG, an image-based retrieval augmented generation tool to tackle hallucinations in image generation.\n\nLi highlighted that by utilising Baidu Search\u2019s extensive database of hundreds of millions of images and the company\u2019s advanced foundation model capabilities, iRAG enables text-to-image models to produce hyper-realistic visuals while lowering image-production costs.\n\nBaidu\u2019s iRAG output. Source: Baidu World 2024\n\nOn the application part, Baidu looks to enhance the usability of text-to-image outputs across various visual mediums, such as comics, storyboards, and posters. According to Li, minimising hallucinations is setting the stage for rapid growth in AI applications.\n\nDeveloper-Focussed Too\n\nTo tackle hallucinations is one thing, but to enable developers is huge. Baidu\u2019s Miaoda, a no-code tool, enables users to build applications simply by describing them in natural language without needing to write a single line of code.\n\nNo-code platforms have been a constant offering by all major tech companies. Google\u2019s AppSheet, Microsoft\u2019s Power Apps, and Amazon\u2019s Honeycode are just some of the big names offering such capabilities. Enterprise biggies, including Oracle and Salesforce, are also offering the same with agentic capabilities.\n\nAt the recent Oracle CloudWorld and Dreamforce 2024 events, both companies unveiled 50-100 AI agents across their suite of enterprise products. But just when you think this has been an emerging trend with the West, Baidu proves you wrong.\n\nIts no-code tool, Miaoda, incorporates multi-agent collaboration, leveraging ERNIE\u2019s capabilities for task coordination and multi-tool invocation, which taps into Baidu\u2019s expansive suite of APIs, including web search, mapping, and image generation.\n\nThe tool\u2019s ability to call upon different agents from domains such as project management, content editing, programming, and quality assurance allows users to streamline workflows and execute complex processes without technical expertise.\n\nSo far, Baidu\u2019s ERNIE AgentBuilder has attracted the attention of 150,000 businesses and 800,000 developers. The top 100 agents include character-based agents such as the \u2018Farmer Academician\u2019, along with agents tailored for tools, industries, workplaces, emotions, and entertainment.\n\n\u201cToday, while all leading global tech firms are paying attention to agents, few have made them as central to their strategy as Baidu has,\u201d said Li. \u201cAgents are more human-like, more intelligent, and act like your sales and customer service representatives, or assistants. Agents will become a new vehicle for content, information and services.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s AI Glasses Too\n\nJust when you thought Meta\u2019s AI smartglasses could replace smartphones, Baidu comes up with its version of the AI wearable.\n\nYing Li, the CEO of Xiaodu Technology (a product line of Baidu), took the stage to introduce Xiaodu AI Glasses, a new device that combines visual, audio, and location-based capabilities to function as a versatile AI assistant.\n\nPowered by ERNIE and equipped with advanced language and image processing capabilities, Xiaodu AI Glasses can act as a virtual tour guide, offering real-time location-based information through Baidu Maps, provide instant translations, and even assist with intelligent note-taking and content summarisation.\n\nThese new AI glasses are likely to be made available in the first half of 2025.\n\nChina Catches Up\n\nA few months ago, Taiwanese computer scientist, entrepreneur, and author of \u2018AI Superpower\u2019, Kai-Fu Lee, said that China will catch up with the US in AI capabilities and is just 6-9 months behind the US.\n\nLet\u2019s take autonomous vehicles, for instance. Baidu has been going strong with Apollo, its autonomous project, covering major cities in China at L4 autonomy. It is going against some incumbent players like Waymo and Tesla Robotaxi. Furthermore, the company has been a key platform provider for a number of automotive companies.\n\nOn the computing side, Baidu recently introduced Baige 4.0, a new version of its AI Heterogeneous Computing Platform, which focuses on enhancing cluster stability and efficiency.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that while the US ponders over sanctions, with the recent development of TSMC being banned from sending AI chips to China and a potential trade war with the new Trump government, it is obvious that none of this will hamper China\u2019s AI developments. Reports even claim that GPU-giant NVIDIA is preparing a specialised AI chip for the Chinese market.\n\n(Total 4,314 views)"

The key to successful scaling lies in the ability to manage growth efficiently while maintaining product quality and meeting market demands. This is where IT outsourcing comes into play. By partnering with a reliable IT staffing agency, startups can leverage external expertise, optimize their resources, and focus on what they do best\u2014innovating and driving the business forward.\n\nThe journey of scaling a startup is full of potential pitfalls, from limited resources to the need for specialized talent that can adapt quickly to changing demands.

With the right approach, outsourcing can be the secret weapon that propels your startup to new heights and sets the stage for long-term success.\n\nWhy IT Outsourcing is a Game-Changer for Startups\n\nIT outsourcing allows startups to access a global pool of talent without the time-consuming and costly process of building an in-house team from scratch. This is particularly beneficial for tech startups that need specialized skills but may not have the budget or time to recruit and train full-time employees.\n\nOutsourcing helps startups:\n\nScale Quickly : With an outsourcing partner, businesses can ramp up their teams as needed without lengthy onboarding processes.\n\n: With an outsourcing partner, businesses can ramp up their teams as needed without lengthy onboarding processes. Access Niche Expertise : Outsourcing provides access to specialized knowledge in areas like cybersecurity, software development, and data analysis that may be hard to find locally.\n\n: Outsourcing provides access to specialized knowledge in areas like cybersecurity, software development, and data analysis that may be hard to find locally. Control Costs: Hiring in-house employees comes with fixed costs such as salaries, benefits, and office space. Outsourcing allows startups to pay for services as needed, providing more budget flexibility.\n\nThese benefits are why outsourcing has become a fundamental strategy for startups aiming to scale sustainably and competitively.\n\nKey Areas Where IT Outsourcing Can Support Growth\n\nOutsourcing can provide a significant boost across various operational areas. One of the primary areas is software development, where outsourced development teams can accelerate the software lifecycle and bring products to market faster. Startups benefit from having expert developers on hand who are already familiar with cutting-edge technologies and best practices, thus reducing the learning curve and speeding up development timelines.\n\nAnother area where IT outsourcing shines is in IT infrastructure management. By outsourcing the management of IT systems, startups can ensure their platforms are reliable, secure, and scalable without needing an in-house IT department. This allows founders and internal teams to concentrate on core business strategies and market expansion.\n\nArea of Support Benefits for Startups Software Development Faster development cycles and expert input IT Infrastructure Management Reliable, secure systems with minimal downtime Cybersecurity Enhanced protection and risk mitigation\n\nLeveraging Outsourcing to Stay Competitive\n\nOne overlooked advantage of outsourcing is the ability to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. By outsourcing certain functions, startups can respond faster to industry trends and integrate new technologies without needing to build that expertise from scratch. This agility can be the difference between a company that thrives and one that struggles to keep up with competitors.\n\nIn addition, outsourcing partners often bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.

This influx of new ideas is invaluable for startups that are looking to push the envelope and distinguish themselves in their field.\n\nBest Practices for Effective IT Outsourcing\n\nTo fully reap the benefits of IT outsourcing, startups need to approach it strategically. It\u2019s not just about delegating tasks but building a partnership that aligns with business goals. Choosing the right partner is crucial\u2014select an agency with a proven track record, strong client feedback, and expertise in your industry. Setting clear, measurable objectives ensures that your partner understands your expectations and can align their efforts accordingly.\n\nMaintaining open communication is also key. Utilize effective tools like Slack, Zoom, and project management software to foster transparency and regular updates. These practices help in nurturing a strong, productive relationship with your outsourcing partner.\n\nConclusion: Position Your Startup for Growth with IT Outsourcing\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced tech landscape, startups that leverage IT outsourcing can gain a competitive advantage by scaling efficiently, accessing specialized expertise, and controlling costs. Whether it\u2019s software development, IT infrastructure, or cybersecurity, outsourcing offers a scalable solution that supports rapid growth and sustainability.\n\nReady to scale your startup to the next level?

        "article_content": "You may or may not know this, but certain online retailers and various small brands will actually increase prices before a huge sale, like early Black Friday sales, actual Black Friday, or even Cyber Monday and Cyber Week. Let\u2019s say, for example, they discount the product by $20. Weeks before, they might raise the price by $30 to make the discount look bigger. So, the reality is you\u2019re not actually getting a great deal \u2014 they trick you. There is a way to combat this and find the best early Black Friday deals and beyond. There\u2019s a tool I use called CamelCamelCamel, which works wonders to help you find the real deals and steals. Well, anyway, I used the tool to find the best deal prices for Black Friday, and the holiday discounts. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of those deals. Spoiler: They\u2019re so, so good.\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max \u2014 now $33, was $60 45% off\n\nIt makes a lot of sense that Amazon\u2019s devices would be discounted heavily for Black Friday and the holiday sales, so no surprise here. But if you\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade your streaming game you can\u2019t go wrong with the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max.\n\nDewalt 20V Max Cordless Drill and Impact Driver \u2014 now $129, was $239 46%off\n\nWe\u2019ve covered this drill set a lot in the past because, well, I have it. I also love it. It\u2019s great for just about anything drill-related. I use it to hang pictures, and TVs, and build various things around the home \u2013 my most recent project was building a wooden box around a TV on my outdoor patio. It worked wonderfully. Anyway, it comes with a regular electric drill and a hammer drill, the latter of which makes it so much easier to punch through hard materials like stone or concrete. This deal is one of the best in a while.\n\n27-inch Sceptre IPS 2K Gaming Monitor \u2014 now $169, was $200 16% off\n\nNeed a new gaming monitor or just want an extra one? You can\u2019t go wrong here. It\u2019s 27 inches, supports 2K QHD resolutions \u2014 2560 by 1440 \u2014 with HDR400, and at 165Hz with a 1ms response time. If you don\u2019t know any of those numbers, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a decent monitor, even more so at the current deal price.\n\nSony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones \u2014 now $198, was $348 43% off\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones earned a full five stars from our audio reviewer back when they launched. They\u2019re still that good. This deal price makes them super enticing, especially if you don\u2019t have a comparable pair handy. They\u2019re comfortable, offer excellent sound quality, offer great noise cancelation features, and include a bunch of extras. At least check them out.\n\nGarmin Vivoactive 5 Smartwatch \u2014 now $200, was $300 33% off\n\nWe gave the Garmin Vivoactive 5 four stars in our review and for good reason. It offers exceptional fitness and health tracking, long-lasting and reliable battery life, doesn\u2019t require any needless subscriptions, and has a beautiful AMOLED display. Garmin\u2019s software can be a little trick for new users, but once you get the hang of it, you\u2019re all set. Don\u2019t let that scare you away from his incredible fitness and health-oriented smartwatch. Garmin makes some of the best out there on the market today and this one is no exception. Plus, you know, that\u2019s a great deal price.\n\nNintendo Switch OLED with White Joy-Cons \u2014 now $349, was $350 1% off\n\nThis is actually less than a 1% discount which will probably lead many of you to ask why I even included it. The answer is that it\u2019s still the best price out there right now, even by a small margin. If you have Amazon gift cards or some money saved up, you can save quite a bit on it. Maybe you earned some money doing Amazon tasks or surveys? Bam, then the best place to buy is Amazon already and now you\u2019ll save even more.\n\nMSI Claw Ultra 7-155H PC gaming handheld \u2014 now $471, was $749 37% off\n\nLook, the MSI Claw isn\u2019t the best gaming handheld on the market right now \u2014 that\u2019s fairly evident. But this deal price does put it on our radar. Instead of the usual AMD chipset like the Steam Deck and its competitors, the MSI Claw opts for an Intel Ultra 7-155H, with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 512TB solid-state drive, a microSD card reader, and a 7-inch FHD 120Hz display. Then there\u2019s that snazzy RGB around the joysticks. I don\u2019t know, think about it.\n\n65-inch LG C3 Series Class OLED evo 4K smart TV \u2014 now $1,297, was $1,500 14% off\n\nYou know as well as I do that during these huge sales there are TV deals and discounts flying all over the damn place. It\u2019s difficult to keep up at times, that\u2019s for sure. But this LG smart TV deal is one of the best out there right now according to sources. It\u2019s a 4K OLED with a sweet spot size \u2014 65-inches \u2014 making it suitable to place in bedrooms, game rooms, garages, living rooms, you name it. The deal price doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n2024 Apple MacBook Air 15-inch with M3 \u2014 now $1,299, was $1,499 13% off\n\nAt one of its lowest prices in a long while, this Apple MacBook Air features 16GB of unified memory, a 512GB solid-state drive for storage, and the Apple M3 chip. It\u2019s lean, mean, and one of the most powerful MacBooks released. The portable design lends itself well to creatives, with 18 hours of battery life on a single charge despite having a beautiful 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display. This is a great deal, folks."
