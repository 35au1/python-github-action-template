            "article_content": "There is perhaps no more quintessentially American phenomenon than widespread panic over strange lights in the sky and the unknown implications thereof. From Orson Welles' panic-inducing broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds\" to popular culture's obsession with flying saucers outside of Roswell, New Mexico, ours is a country that seemingly cannot help but look up and wonder: \"What the heck is that?\"\n\nFor the past several days, that has been the question on the minds of New Jersey residents baffled and unnerved by a sudden proliferation of supposed drones hovering over the Garden State without warning or explanation. The mysterious lights have prompted demands for federal investigation as speculation about the unmanned aerial vehicles runs rampant throughout the state and across the eastern seaboard. As theories abound and lawmakers urge calm, here's what people know about the unexplained drone swarms, and why some officials are ringing the alarms about what they might mean.\n\nThe Biden administration has worked to preempt panic over the drone swarms. There is \"no evidence at this time\" that they \"pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus,\" White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said last week. Nevertheless, \"something's going on,\" Washington Township Mayor Matthew Murello said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"I'm not trying to stir anything up, but we all know \u2014 if you just turn on the television \u2014 that drones can be used in an aggressive fashion.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nWith recent unexplained drone sightings in \"at least eight states,\" there remains \"significant confusion about the exact nature of the sightings,\" CNN said. \"There's a lot of us that are pretty frustrated right now,\" Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" For officials to say \"'We don't know' is not a good enough answer,\" Himes said, demanding the government \"put more information out there\" to ease public concern. \"More federal resources are needed to understand what is behind this activity,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) said in a letter to the Biden administration requesting aid in investigating the drones. \"Existing laws limit the ability of state and local law enforcement\" to conduct their own inquiries and counter-operations effectively.\n\nThose limitations haven't stopped some New Jersey officials from engaging in their own examinations. Over the weekend, Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) documented his own excursion with local police across Hunterdon County to get \"different vantage points\" on suspected drone activity.\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDnDecember 13, 2024\n\nUltimately, \"most of the possible drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes,\" Kim said. Even so, Kim said, it's \"hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren't able to track these devices to determine origin\" \u2014 a challenge that made the senator \"much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\"\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) has been even more aggressive, accusing defense officials of \"hiding the truth\" about the drones' origins from an Iranian \u201cmothership,\" Politico said. Drew's allegation, at which officials \"balked,\" only serves to highlight \"how drones, once the play toy of amateur photographers, are fast becoming a national security concern.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nBiden administration officials have begun acting on requests from local lawmakers, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D), whose \"calls for additional resources\" prompted \"our federal partners\" to send a \"drone detection system to New York,\" Hochul said on X. Still, \"Congress must pass a law that will give us the power to deal directly with the drones,\" Hochul said. Accordingly, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is \"working to pass a bill in the Senate to give local law enforcement more tools for drone detection,\" he said on X.\n\nThe incidents have also become partisan fodder in the waning days of the Biden administration. The White House's lack of transparency on the sightings is a \"reminder that the general attitude of this White House towards the American people has been, 'you don't need to know that,'\" said Fox News' David Marcus. And while President-elect Donald Trump \"can't imagine it's the enemy,\" the Biden administration would be \"better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows,\" Trump said on Monday."

            "article_content": "For the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents, politicians and even President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nConcerned witnesses have described clusters of lights, saying they look like drones hovering over populated areas around the state. Now, even as sightings have expanded to New York and Maryland, government officials haven\u2019t been able to put people\u2019s minds at ease.\n\nSo who (or what) is behind the mysterious drone sightings? And can you shoot them down in California?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This has gone too far': Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says\n\nBecause the sightings aren't confirmed to be connected, it's possible different sightings have different explanations.\n\nFederal authorities have tried to reassure residents that the objects don\u2019t appear to be operating nefariously. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey lawmakers say they believe there is more to the story than federal officials have shared publicly.\n\nCan you shoot down drones in California? What to know after mystery NJ sightings\n\nAnd President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to demand government give answers, writing: \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" On Nov. 22, the FAA issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones over Trump's National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., criticized the Biden administration for being \"dismissive\" about the reported sightings arguing the White House team has failed his \"obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of clear answers has fueled rampant speculation and sometimes bizarre or joking theories.\n\n\u201cThe drones in New Jersey can easily be explained. Teams are clearly spying on the Jets and Giants practices which is why they have struggled this season,\u201d former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cFirst, a Chinese spy balloon drifted across U.S. airspace for a week. Now, unidentified drones are flying over New Jersey, avoiding radar detection. Gaps in our airspace are being exploited, and because of it, the safety of Americans is at risk,\u201d New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew posted.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some possible explanations for the sightings \u2013 and the evidence for or against the theories.\n\nFor the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents. These photos were taken on Dec. 8 in Toms River, N.J.\n\nIs it really drones?\n\nGovernment officials have said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s aren\u2019t actually drones in many of the sightings. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said many of the sightings are actually of piloted aircraft flying legally.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Direen, an electronic and software engineering expert at DireenTech, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people were seeing drones at first, but that once the notion of drones took hold, people assumed any aircraft they couldn\u2019t identify was a drone.\n\n\u201cAfter what were likely valid sightings of possibly hobbyist drones, every aircraft can then become suspicious,\u201d he said.\n\nHoaxes, UFOs, witches, drones: NJ is no stranger to strange happenings\n\nKirby said during a news conference that authorities haven\u2019t been able to corroborate \u201cany of the reported visual sightings\u201d \u2014 despite using \u201cvery sophisticated electronic detection technologies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FBI, DHS and our federal partners, in close coordination with the New Jersey State Police, continue to deploy personnel and technology to investigate this situation and confirm whether the reported drone flights are actually drones or are instead manned aircraft or otherwise inaccurate sightings,\u201d the agencies said in the statement.\n\nForeign government surveillance?\n\nU.S. government officials this week assured the public that the spotted aircraft do not appear to be sent by a foreign government, quashing a theory posed by Van Drew, who said the drones could be controlled by Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence the drones pose a national security threat, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The sightings may actually be piloted aircraft operating legally, the agencies said. Also worth noting: the craft haven\u2019t flown in restricted airspace, they said.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, they have uncovered no such malicious activity or intent at this stage,\u201d a joint statement from the agencies said. \u201cWhile there is no known malicious activity occurring in New Jersey, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight the insufficiency of current authorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said they were briefed by State Police and told authorities don\u2019t know where the drones are coming from, and are unable to detect them.\n\n\u201cListen, I hope it\u2019s no big deal, but the federal government needs to be more truthful.\u201d New Jersey Assemblyman Greg Myhre said.\n\nUS government drones?\n\nGovernment officials including the Pentagon said the drones spotted by residents for the last few weeks are not operated by the U.S. government or military.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that a government organization would be flying the drones over public locations, Direen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cClearly they are not being very stealthy if they are,\u201d he said.\n\nKids playing a prank, or hobbyists?\n\nCould the drones people keep seeing be someone playing a prank, or drone hobbyists just out having a good time? It\u2019s not illegal to fly drones in New Jersey, but you have to meet certain requirements depending on the size of the drone and the reason you\u2019re flying it, according to federal and state laws.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it should be pretty easy for officials to figure out, Direen said.\n\n\u201cIf the drones are being flown legally, the ADS-B transponder on the drone should make it easy for authorities to identify the drone and the operator,\u201d he said.\n\nUFOs?\n\nCould the drones be the work of aliens? At this point, officials have given no evidence to suggest that, but also no evidence to debunk it. (And many UFO sightings are believed to have natural explanations.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI suppose some alien kids could be flying their toy drones while their parents are busy out abducting humans and performing experiments on them,\u201d Direen said.\n\nIs it legal to shoot down a drone in California?\n\nNo. It is illegal to try to shoot down or destroy a drone that trespasses on private property or above public spaces because it may cause safety risks.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones are registered in the U.S., according to the Federal Aviation Administration, including 396,746 commercial drones and 387,746 recreational drones.\n\nRegardless of the drone's classification, however, the FAA considers them aircraft \u2014 meaning that you could be charged with shooting at an aircraft, a federal crime if you take a shot at one.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you believe a drone is violating the law, your best bet is to contact law enforcement.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information, correct a misspelling/typo and to change or add a photo or video.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Mass drone sightings prompt worries, but there may be an explanation"

He said he was trying to track a mystery drone but his drone was shut down while the mystery thing remained airborne.\"There was a drone just hanging out,\" he told FOX 5 New York. \"I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.\"He said he saw a warning flash across the screen of his controller and the battery died with the drone coming down. He understood that his drone was probably shot down because it was a restricted flight area but the thing that he was trying to approach continued to fly. The paranormal investigator lives near the Picatinny Arsenal, an Army facility near where dozens of sightings have been reported in recent weeks. Since it was an Army area, it was possible that his drone was shut down but the other one continuing to fly seems to establish speculation theories that these mystery drones are probably sanctioned by the government and the Feds are well aware of them.As Michael B shared his horrifying experience with MSNBC, he said the issue, to him, seems more serious than just misidentified aircraft. \"At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,\" he said adding that he could not figure out what it was.Michael B added that it's clear to him that these mystery drones are capable of flying in restricted zones. He said he can usually detect what other objects are on the sky by using his radar, none of these mystery things are on flight radar."

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Scientists have announced the discovery of a species of lipstick vine that is completely new to science, found in the depths of the Philippine rainforest.\n\nThis species, which has never been documented in botanical records, has sparked a wave of excitement among scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn expedition into the heart of Luzon\n\nA daring expedition by a team of botanists in 2022 led them into Barangay Balbalasang rainforest, a remote and virtually inaccessible part of Luzon island.\n\nThe journey began with days of rugged travel to reach the rainforest, which was filled with unforgiving thickets that demanded to be sliced with machetes. In these wild conditions, the researchers discovered their prize.\n\nThe team included Jayson Mansibang, Adriane Tobias, and Pastor L. Malabrigo from the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, along with Dr. Chris Thorogood, Deputy Director and Head of Science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum.\n\nThe researchers stayed with the Banao Tribe, an indigenous community that protects the local forest.\n\nA lipstick vine unlike any other\n\nAmong the species found in the forest, one stood out \u2013 a specimen of the lipstick vine, a genus known as Aeschynanthus.\n\nThis plant had a distinct pattern of delicate purple mottling which painted its flowers in a pattern similar to that of a European foxglove.\n\n\u201cWe were trekking through dense vegetation when suddenly we spotted a luminous white, purple-spotted flower dangling above our heads,\u201d said Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cWe suspected immediately that it was new to science. It\u2019s so exciting that beautiful species like this are still there waiting to be described.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of a new lipstick vine\n\nThe team named the plant Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus from the Latin \u2018penta,\u2019 meaning five, and \u2018trichomatus\u2019 referring to the trichomes \u2013 hair-like outgrowths deep in the throats of the flowers.\n\nLipstick vines, encompassing nearly 180 tropical and subtropical species, are known for their tubular, bud-like appearance.\n\nThese vines, often adorning other plants and trees, boast vibrantly colored flowers that attract birds for pollination.\n\nConservation concerns amid climate change\n\nSadly, this newfound beauty already faces a critical risk of extinction. Rapid climate change, driving increasingly intense typhoons, relentlessly threatens the plant\u2019s natural habitat.\n\nThe Barangay Balbalasang rainforest remains remarkably intact, housing numerous species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The researchers hope that the new discovery can help support conservation efforts to protect the region.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this discovery not only to the unique beauty of the Banao forest but also to the Banao People themselves, who, through their care and stewardship, have ensured the conservation of rare species within these precious forests,\u201d said Tobias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find Aeschynanthus in such an environment, and as young botanists, we were thrilled to discover something so distinct.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s plant data darkspots\n\n\u201cMany new species remain undocumented in the world\u2019s \u2018plant data darkspots\u2019 \u2013 up to 15% of the world\u2019s flora in fact,\u201d noted Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cFinding these \u2018known unknowns\u2019 is essential for understanding and protecting biodiversity. That\u2019s what makes discoveries such as this one so important for conservation science.\u201d\n\nEcological importance of lipstick vines\n\nThe discovery of Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus sheds light on the ecological importance of lipstick vines in tropical ecosystems.\n\nAs epiphytes, these plants grow on trees without harming them, creating microhabitats that support diverse wildlife.\n\nTheir vividly colored flowers play a vital role in attracting pollinators, particularly birds, which are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of tropical rainforests.\n\nBeyond their ecological contributions, lipstick vines are indicators of environmental health. Their presence often signifies a well-preserved ecosystem, as these plants thrive only in stable and intact habitats.\n\nProtecting a unique rainforest\n\nThe discovery of this new species in Barangay Balbalasang emphasizes the rainforest\u2019s unique biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard it.\n\nWith nearly 180 known species of Aeschynanthus, each adapted to its specific environment, the newly discovered species offers valuable insights into the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships and the resilience of tropical flora in the face of climate change.\n\nProtecting Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus is not just about preserving a single species; it is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that it supports.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nordic Journal of Botany.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Thorogood\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

The 21-month trip presents unique challenges, particularly keeping people healthy during such a long space voyage. But what once seemed like an impossible solution is now gathering momentum: Hibernation.\n\nIn winter, many mammals enter a state of torpor, dropping their body temperature and slowing down their metabolism and brain activity to save energy. However, people can\u2019t hibernate for a few reasons: Our bodies can\u2019t store enough fat without harming ourselves, function at such low energy and brain activity levels, or survive a massive drop in body temperature. (Read about surprising hibernators in nature.)\n\nGerald Kerth, a zoologist at the University of Greifswald in Germany, studies hibernation in bats, which are smaller and easier to research than, say, brown bears."

            "article_content": "Each year, scientists break new ground in their quest to understand life and the mysteries of the cosmos. Here are eight milestones in 2024 that caught our attention\n\nReading a fruit fly\u2019s mind\n\nThe first complete map of a fruit fly\u2019s brain details all 139,255 nerve cells and the 54.5 million connections between them. It\u2019s the largest brain map made of any animal, even though the fruit fly\u2019s brain is poppy seed\u2013sized (SN: 11/2/24, p. 32). The map could lead to a deeper understanding of how information flows in the brain.\n\nNuclear timekeeping\n\nScientific clockmakers debuted the world\u2019s first prototype nuclear clock. Nuclear clocks would base time on fluctuating energy levels in atomic nuclei. While the prototype isn\u2019t a fully oper\u00adational timepiece, its development showed scientists the precise frequency of light required to set off fluctuations in the energy levels of atomic nuclei (SN: 10/5/24, p. 7). Nuclear clocks could help scientists explore fundamental physics \u2014 an area of science teeming with potential discovery.\n\nPhysicists used a laser (shown) to probe a jump between two energy levels in thorium-229, which could serve as a nuclear clock. Chuankun Zhang/JILA\n\nPanda protection\n\nGiant panda biology took a huge leap forward this year: For the first time, researchers transformed the bear\u2019s skin cells into stem cells that can be coaxed into any other type of cell in the body (SN: 10/19/24, p. 10). Being able to take skin cells and end up with, say, the precursors of sperm and egg cells gives conservationists a leg up in defending giant pandas from extinction by boosting breeding and expanding the bear\u2019s small gene pool.\n\nThis year, scientists took skin cells from this giant panda and transformed them into a kind of stem cell that can potentially become any kind of cell in the body. Imaginechina Limited / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nNew nitrogen factory\n\nA eukaryote has joined some bacteria and archaea in the nitrogen fixation club. A type of marine alga has an internal factory that transforms nitrogen into ammonia, a biologically usable form (SN: 4/11/24). The factory probably started as a separate life-form that entered a symbiotic relationship with the eukaryote. Over millennia, the two may have become so intertwined that they became one organism.\n\nThe unicellular algae Braarudospharea bigelowii (shown here in a 1000x magnification) is the first eukaryote known to fix nitrogen, thanks to its nitroplast organelle (arrow). Tyler Coale\n\nUltrarare decay\n\nBy smashing protons into a fixed target, physicists witnessed a predicted but never-before-confirmed form of particle decay (SN: 10/19/24, p. 16). The collision produced subatomic particles called kaons. Those kaons decayed into an uncommon combination of three other types of particles at a rate of about 13 in 100 billion times. Continued investigation into the decay might help unveil new physics.\n\nAn experiment at CERN (shown) detected an extremely rare decay of subatomic particles called kaons. M. Brice/CERN\n\nRecycling dead weight\n\nThe Cyathea rojasiana tree fern is the first plant known to turn its dead leaves into roots (SN: 2/24/24, p. 5). The leaves sprout rootlets, which the fern may use to search out nutrients in the soil of Panamanian forests. Researchers now want to figure out how the rootlets absorb nutrients.\n\nCyathea rojasiana tree ferns in Panama\u2019s Quebrada Chorro forest revive their dead leaves by turning them into tiny roots. J. Dalling\n\nBlack hole awakening\n\nIn a sleepy galaxy not too far away, a supermassive black hole appears to be gradually waking up, providing astrophysicists with their first peek of a black hole transitioning from dim and quiet to bright and active (SN: 7/13/24 & 7/27/24, p. 7). When supermassive black holes consume material such as stars, they usually glow for only a few days to weeks. But lucky for scientists, this black hole has remained luminous for years. While researchers are not completely certain why the black hole continues to glow, they\u2019re following the situation closely and hoping to glean some insights into how black holes grow.\n\nA supermassive black hole in galaxy SDSS1335+0728 has lit up, possibly giving astronomers a look at how such beasts are awakened. M. Kornmesser/ESO\n\nQuantum physics versus the speed of Earth\n\nThe rate of Earth\u2019s rotation is well established, but scientists measured it in a new way, using entangled quantum particles (SN: 7/14/24 & 7/28/24, p. 5). The theories of quantum physics and gravity are largely incompatible, so it was noteworthy that the experiment\u2019s measurements aligned with Earth\u2019s known rotation rate. Physicists hope the experiment will open doors for further research into demystifying how gravity and quantum physics interact."

            "article_content": "Don't get me wrong -- I love the S&P 500. It's a curated stock market index comprised of around 500 of the biggest, most profitable U.S.-based businesses. With that in mind, there are always great long-term investment opportunities to be found in this pool.\n\nThat said, 500 companies is just a drop in the ocean when it comes to the stock market. There are quite literally thousands and thousands of stocks to choose from. And many outside of the S&P 500 provide life-changing gains.\n\nSo, in this article, why not broaden our focus? The Russell 2000 is another stock market index, made up of around 2,000 smaller stocks -- stocks that are valued at $10 billion or less (although there are a few outliers that are worth more).\n\nJust as there are winners to be found in the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 also produced some stocks that enriched shareholders in 2024. The quartet I've selected here -- Sezzle (SEZL 6.79%), Rigetti Computing (RGTI 30.38%), SoundHound AI (SOUN 17.39%), and The RealReal (REAL 6.20%) -- aren't necessarily the top four performers for the year. But they're all right near the top.\n\n1. Sezzle: up 1,460%\n\nSezzle is a digital financial company designed to help younger, tech-savvy consumers who don't have traditional credit cards. The stock is up by a sensational amount in 2024, thanks to impressive growth and mind-blowing improvements to profitability.\n\nConsider that in 2022, Sezzle had revenue of $126 million but had a net loss of $38 million. Revenue grew by 7% in 2023, allowing it to achieve a net income of $7 million. But this year, it expects to grow revenue by 55%, allowing it to have a net income of nearly $72 million.\n\nSezzle generates most of its revenue from charging merchants transaction processing fees. So, increasing the number of merchants that accept Sezzle payments would seem to be important, and indeed, the company regularly announces new merchants that are on board. That said, its growth is currently coming from selling subscription products.\n\nWith a Sezzle subscription product, consumers have more shopping options, among other things. The company ended 2023 with just 307,000 active subscribers, but that's jumped up to 529,000 as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. Consequently, investors should watch subscriber numbers in 2025 because they could lead to more big improvements in its financials.\n\n2. Rigetti: up 649%\n\nSince the invention of the computer, everything has operated with binary code -- a system of zeros and ones. Quantum computing intends to provide unimaginably powerful computers by progressing beyond binary code. Rigetti Computing hopes to lead the revolution.\n\nRigetti stock is up by a sensational amount in 2024, but most of the gains have happened in just the past month. Consider that quantum computing is still largely in the research-and-development phase, with a lot of money currently coming from government contracts. However, in its November report for the third quarter of 2024, Rigetti announced a big update with its product roadmap that sent the stock soaring.\n\nFor binary systems, the difference between, say, 1 bit and 2 bits is 100%. For quantum systems, however, the difference between qubits is much larger because there are more states represented. For Rigetti, it intends to release a new 36-qubit system by mid-2025 and a new 100-qubit system by the end of 2025. Those might sound small, but these represent large leaps in computational power.\n\nThere's still a lot of ground to cover before quantum computers are used regularly for commercial purposes -- Rigetti shareholders need to understand that. But for now, investors should watch to see whether the company hits its release date targets and attracts more users. Progress in these areas in 2025 is important to the long-term health of the business.\n\n3. SoundHound AI: up 539%\n\nSoundHound uses artificial intelligence (AI) to build conversational voice assistants. The technology is promising, and it's gaining traction in fast-food drive-thrus and in cars. However, few investors took notice of it before February. Then, market darling Nvidia revealed that it was a shareholder. This served as the initial catalyst that sent SoundHound stock soaring this year.\n\nAfter generating just $46 million in revenue in 2023, SoundHound's management expects to generate $150 million in revenue next year. Incredible revenue growth such as this is the central tenet of an investment thesis here. SoundHound estimates its market opportunity at $140 billion.\n\nIn other words, if its technology is truly special, then SoundHound should be able to sustain high revenue growth for years to come. It will need to do this if it's going to be a good investment. That's why shareholders should watch for key customer wins in 2025. Investors should also keep in mind that a lot of recent growth has come from acquisitions. So, it will be important to see these new businesses get integrated into the company.\n\n4. The RealReal: up 364%\n\nThe RealReal is an e-commerce platform for authenticated, pre-owned luxury goods. Much like Rigetti stock, The RealReal stock only recently skyrocketed. The company reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024 on Nov. 4. That report had investors and professional analysts rethinking their assumptions about the company.\n\nThe RealReal sells items on behalf of consignors or, in some cases, it acquires products to resell for itself. The company also generates revenue with other services, such as giving subscription buyers an early glimpse of new merchandise. The problem is that adoption has been declining and profits were nowhere close to expectations. This caused investors to lose confidence completely.\n\nNow The RealReal is returning to growth, with Q3 revenue up 11% year over year. Moreover, active buyers also modestly increased. However, the big thing was that the company generated Q3 free cash flow of $2 million. This represents only the second time it's ever reported positive quarterly free cash flow.\n\nIn short, growth and free cash flow have suddenly caused investors to feel much better about The RealReal's long-term prospects. In 2025, investors should watch to see if adoption trends keep going in the right direction.\n\nIs there a stock for investors today?\n\nAmong these four stocks, I think that Rigetti and SoundHound are the most speculative. Both are promising, but both need substantial long-term growth from here. For its part, The RealReal is still pretty cheap from a valuation perspective, which could limit some future downside. I'm unsure how big and consistent its core business can be.\n\nIf I had to buy one of these four today, I'd choose Sezzle. The adoption trends for its subscription business are impressive, and it's relatively new, giving me optimism that it can keep growing. Moreover, it's a small company with a market cap of less than $2 billion. However, with profits surging as they are, it could still be a rewarding opportunity for investors in the long term."

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Scientists have announced the discovery of a species of lipstick vine that is completely new to science, found in the depths of the Philippine rainforest.\n\nThis species, which has never been documented in botanical records, has sparked a wave of excitement among scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn expedition into the heart of Luzon\n\nA daring expedition by a team of botanists in 2022 led them into Barangay Balbalasang rainforest, a remote and virtually inaccessible part of Luzon island.\n\nThe journey began with days of rugged travel to reach the rainforest, which was filled with unforgiving thickets that demanded to be sliced with machetes. In these wild conditions, the researchers discovered their prize.\n\nThe team included Jayson Mansibang, Adriane Tobias, and Pastor L. Malabrigo from the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, along with Dr. Chris Thorogood, Deputy Director and Head of Science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum.\n\nThe researchers stayed with the Banao Tribe, an indigenous community that protects the local forest.\n\nA lipstick vine unlike any other\n\nAmong the species found in the forest, one stood out \u2013 a specimen of the lipstick vine, a genus known as Aeschynanthus.\n\nThis plant had a distinct pattern of delicate purple mottling which painted its flowers in a pattern similar to that of a European foxglove.\n\n\u201cWe were trekking through dense vegetation when suddenly we spotted a luminous white, purple-spotted flower dangling above our heads,\u201d said Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cWe suspected immediately that it was new to science. It\u2019s so exciting that beautiful species like this are still there waiting to be described.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of a new lipstick vine\n\nThe team named the plant Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus from the Latin \u2018penta,\u2019 meaning five, and \u2018trichomatus\u2019 referring to the trichomes \u2013 hair-like outgrowths deep in the throats of the flowers.\n\nLipstick vines, encompassing nearly 180 tropical and subtropical species, are known for their tubular, bud-like appearance.\n\nThese vines, often adorning other plants and trees, boast vibrantly colored flowers that attract birds for pollination.\n\nConservation concerns amid climate change\n\nSadly, this newfound beauty already faces a critical risk of extinction. Rapid climate change, driving increasingly intense typhoons, relentlessly threatens the plant\u2019s natural habitat.\n\nThe Barangay Balbalasang rainforest remains remarkably intact, housing numerous species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The researchers hope that the new discovery can help support conservation efforts to protect the region.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this discovery not only to the unique beauty of the Banao forest but also to the Banao People themselves, who, through their care and stewardship, have ensured the conservation of rare species within these precious forests,\u201d said Tobias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find Aeschynanthus in such an environment, and as young botanists, we were thrilled to discover something so distinct.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s plant data darkspots\n\n\u201cMany new species remain undocumented in the world\u2019s \u2018plant data darkspots\u2019 \u2013 up to 15% of the world\u2019s flora in fact,\u201d noted Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cFinding these \u2018known unknowns\u2019 is essential for understanding and protecting biodiversity. That\u2019s what makes discoveries such as this one so important for conservation science.\u201d\n\nEcological importance of lipstick vines\n\nThe discovery of Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus sheds light on the ecological importance of lipstick vines in tropical ecosystems.\n\nAs epiphytes, these plants grow on trees without harming them, creating microhabitats that support diverse wildlife.\n\nTheir vividly colored flowers play a vital role in attracting pollinators, particularly birds, which are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of tropical rainforests.\n\nBeyond their ecological contributions, lipstick vines are indicators of environmental health. Their presence often signifies a well-preserved ecosystem, as these plants thrive only in stable and intact habitats.\n\nProtecting a unique rainforest\n\nThe discovery of this new species in Barangay Balbalasang emphasizes the rainforest\u2019s unique biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard it.\n\nWith nearly 180 known species of Aeschynanthus, each adapted to its specific environment, the newly discovered species offers valuable insights into the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships and the resilience of tropical flora in the face of climate change.\n\nProtecting Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus is not just about preserving a single species; it is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that it supports.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nordic Journal of Botany.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Thorogood\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once collaborators in the creation of OpenAI, now find themselves at the forefront of a growing rivalry that is transforming the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. Their public disagreements highlight critical issues, including the balance between transparency and competition, the ethical challenges of AI development, and the tension between profit-driven goals and altruistic intentions. This rivalry, marked by accusations, strategic moves, and legal disputes, underscores the broader challenges the AI industry faces as it navigates rapid advancements and societal expectations.\n\nWhat began as a shared vision for advancing AI has evolved into a public and deeply personal competition between Musk and Altman. Their conflict encapsulates a larger conversation about transparency, ethics, and the delicate balance between innovation and responsibility in a fast-moving industry. This story sheds light on how ideals often clash with the profit-driven realities of the modern tech world.\n\nElon Musk vs Sam Altman\n\nMore than just a tale of competing personalities, this rivalry reflects the growing pains of an industry shaping the future of humanity. As Musk and Altman take bold steps to outpace one another, they force critical questions into the spotlight: Can AI development remain true to its original altruistic principles? And what happens when the drive for dominance in AI overshadows collaboration? While the answers remain complex, the implications of this competition could not be more significant.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once collaborators at OpenAI, are now rivals, highlighting critical issues in AI development such as transparency, ethics, and the balance between profit and altruism.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s shift from a nonprofit to a for-profit model, along with its partnership with Microsoft, has sparked controversy and accusations of betraying its founding mission.\n\nThe Musk-Altman feud underscores tensions in AI leadership, with Musk criticizing Altman for deviating from OpenAI\u2019s original goals, while Altman defends the shift as necessary for competitiveness.\n\nMusk has launched legal challenges against OpenAI and started his own AI venture, xAI, intensifying competition and driving rapid innovation in the AI sector.\n\nThe rivalry raises broader questions about the ethical and regulatory frameworks needed to guide AI development, with implications for the future of technology and society.\n\nTheir conflict is not merely personal but emblematic of the larger debates surrounding AI\u2019s future. As two of the most influential figures in technology, Musk and Altman\u2019s actions and decisions are shaping the trajectory of AI innovation, raising questions about how to ensure that these powerful technologies benefit humanity as a whole.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Controversial Shift\n\nOpenAI was founded with a bold mission: to ensure that artificial intelligence serves the greater good of humanity. Initially structured as a nonprofit organization, it embraced open source principles to counterbalance the dominance of major tech corporations like Google. However, OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model has sparked significant controversy, with critics arguing that this shift undermines its founding ideals.\n\nElon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has been one of the most vocal critics of this transformation. He has accused the organization of abandoning its commitment to transparency and prioritizing financial gain over ethical considerations. OpenAI\u2019s close partnership with Microsoft, which has invested billions into the organization, has further fueled these concerns. Critics argue that this relationship compromises OpenAI\u2019s independence and raises questions about whether its decisions are driven by profit motives rather than its original mission.\n\nThe shift has become a focal point in the broader debate over the role of ethics in AI development. It highlights the challenges organizations face in balancing the need for resources with the imperative to maintain public trust and uphold their stated values.\n\nClash of Leadership: Musk vs Altman\n\nThe personal and professional rift between Elon Musk and Sam Altman has become a defining narrative in the AI industry. Musk has publicly criticized Altman, accusing him of steering OpenAI away from its original mission and prioritizing personal and organizational gain. Altman, in response, has defended his leadership, asserting that OpenAI\u2019s transition was necessary to secure the resources required to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n\nThis feud has played out in public forums, with Musk making pointed remarks about Altman\u2019s leadership style and even comparing him to a manipulative character from *Game of Thrones*. Altman, for his part, has emphasized the challenges of leading an organization in an industry where innovation moves at breakneck speed and decisions have far-reaching implications.\n\nThe conflict between Musk and Altman underscores a broader tension in the AI sector: how to balance the drive for rapid technological progress with the need for ethical responsibility. It also highlights the complexities of leadership in an industry where the stakes are extraordinarily high, both in terms of societal impact and competitive pressures.\n\nElon Musks NEW Plans To Crush Sam Altman And OpenAI\n\nBrowse through more resources below from our in-depth content covering more areas on OpenAI :\n\nLegal Battles and Competitive Moves\n\nElon Musk has not limited his opposition to public criticism. He has taken legal action to challenge OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model, alleging that the organization has engaged in anti-competitive practices. Musk has also accused OpenAI of granting Microsoft unfair access to sensitive information, which he claims gives the company a significant competitive advantage.\n\nAt the same time, Musk has launched his own AI initiative, xAI, which directly competes with OpenAI. By securing substantial resources, including a large supply of Nvidia GPUs, Musk aims to develop advanced AI technologies that could rival or surpass OpenAI\u2019s capabilities. This move has intensified competition within the AI sector, pushing both organizations to innovate at an accelerated pace.\n\nThe rivalry between Musk and Altman has significant implications for the industry. It is driving advancements in AI technology but also raising concerns about the potential consequences of unchecked competition. As both leaders pursue their visions, the industry must grapple with questions about fairness, transparency, and the broader societal impact of their innovations.\n\nAltman\u2019s Defense and Ongoing Challenges\n\nSam Altman has remained steadfast in defending OpenAI\u2019s evolution, arguing that the shift to a for-profit model was essential to secure the funding and resources needed to achieve its ambitious goals. He has emphasized that the organization remains committed to its mission of making sure that AI benefits humanity, even as it navigates the complexities of a competitive market.\n\nHowever, Altman faces significant challenges. OpenAI has struggled with resource limitations, particularly in acquiring Nvidia chips, which are critical for training advanced AI models. In contrast, Musk\u2019s xAI has reportedly secured a larger supply of these chips, giving it a potential edge in the race to develop innovative AI technologies.\n\nAltman\u2019s leadership is under intense scrutiny as he works to address these challenges while maintaining transparency and trust. The demands of leading an organization at the forefront of AI innovation are immense, and Altman\u2019s ability to navigate these pressures will play a crucial role in shaping OpenAI\u2019s future.\n\nImplications for the Future of AI\n\nThe rivalry between Elon Musk and Sam Altman extends beyond their personal disagreements, shedding light on critical issues that will shape the future of artificial intelligence. As competition intensifies, questions arise about the role of profit motives in driving innovation and whether organizations can balance financial interests with the altruistic goal of creating AI that benefits humanity.\n\nThis conflict highlights the complexities of leadership, trust, and innovation in an industry with fantastic potential. It raises important questions about how to ensure that AI development aligns with ethical principles and societal needs, rather than being driven solely by competitive pressures or financial incentives.\n\nThe outcome of this rivalry will likely have far-reaching implications, influencing not only the pace of technological advancements but also the ethical frameworks that guide the development and deployment of AI. As Musk and Altman continue to shape the industry, their decisions will play a pivotal role in determining the trajectory of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.\n\nMedia Credit: TheAIGRID\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "On December 4, 2024, FDA finalized its guidance entitled \u201cMarketing Submission Recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan for Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Device Software Functions\u201d (the \u201c2024 Final Guidance\u201d). The Final Guidance replaces the Draft Guidance issued in April 2023 (the \u201c2023 Draft Guidance\u201d).\n\nThe 2024 Final Guidance is largely consistent with the 2023 Draft Guidance but has some notable changes, as discussed below. Please see our Client Alert on the 2023 Draft Guidance for a detailed overview of FDA\u2019s current thinking on Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCPs) for artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled device software functions outside of the changes discussed here. We also note that that some of the process-related changes appear to bring the 2024 Final Guidance into alignment with FDA\u2019s Predetermined Change Control Plans for Medical Devices Draft Guidance published August 22, 2024, which applies the concept of PCCPs to non-AI-enabled medical devices.\n\nNOTABLE SCOPE, DEFINITIONAL, AND HIGH-LEVEL CHANGES\n\nMachine Learning Device Software Functions (ML-DSFs) have been renamed AI-Enabled Device Software Functions (AI-DSFs), although FDA acknowledges in the Scope section of the 2024 Final Guidance that most PCCPs FDA has reviewed are in the subset of AI known as Machine Learning (ML).\n\nFDA has included a definition of AI to align with its \u201cDigital Health and Artificial Intelligence Glossary\u201d published in September 2024. FDA defines the term \u201cAI\u201d as follows:\n\nA machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.\n\nA machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.\n\nIn its definition of \u201cTest Data\u201d in the 2024 Final Guidance, FDA goes beyond simply defining the term and provides expectations regarding the purpose, timing, outcome, characteristics, and independence of test data, with respect to training and tuning data. FDA defines the term \u201cTest Data\u201d in a single sentence then establishes expectations as follows:\n\nThese data are used to characterize the performance of an AI-DSF. These data are never shown to the algorithm during training and are used to estimate the AI model\u2019s performance after training. Testing is conducted to generate evidence to establish the performance of an AI-DSF before it is deployed or marketed. The testing phase is also expected to provide evidence to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of an AI-DSF before it is deployed or marketed. These data typically should be representative of the proposed intended use populations (e.g., with respect to race, ethnicity, disease severity, gender, age, or others, as appropriate) and intended environments. Test data should be independent of data used for training and tuning and should generally be from multiple sites different from those that were used to generate training and tuning data.\n\nSection V.B (Establishing a PCCP) now details the specific submission types FDA considers appropriate for establishing a PCCP (i.e., five submission types for AI-DSFs subject to PMA requirements, two submission types for AI-DSFs subject to 510(k) requirements, and original De Novo requests). This section also elaborates on the importance of following the Quality System Regulation requirements for each modification described in the PCCP and how such compliance might impact its approval or clearance of the product. [Note: FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation will be replaced by the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR) effective February 2, 2026. The QMSR aligns the medical device regulatory framework by incorporating by reference ISO 13485:2016 (Medical devices \u2013 Quality management systems \u2013 Requirements for regulatory purposes) and Clause 3 (Terms and definitions) of ISO 9000:2015 (Quality management systems \u2013 Fundamentals and vocabulary).]\n\nSection V.C (Identifying a PCCP in a Marketing Submission) has been modified to add specific labeling recommendations, including (1) a statement that the device has an authorized PCCP and (2) a revision of King & Spalding Client Alert 3 labeling after modifications are made to the AI-DSF to include a description of implemented modifications, how the modifications were implemented, and how users will be informed of the implemented modifications. FDA also provides more specific recommendations compared to the 2023 Draft Guidance regarding the description of the PCCP in public-facing documents (i.e., 510(k) summaries, PMA summary of safety and effectiveness documents (SSEDs), and De Novo decision summaries), including summaries of planned modifications, test methods, acceptance criteria (i.e., validation and performance requirements), and how users will be informed of modifications.\n\nSection V.D (Utilizing an Authorized PCCP to Implement Device Modifications) adds more specific guidance regarding actions a manufacturer should take if a modification is not included in the PCCP (i.e., follow existing statutory and regulatory requirements and FDA guidance documents on device modifications) or if it is included but not implemented in accordance with the PCCP\u2019s Modification Protocol (i.e., consider that a new submission may be necessary).\n\nWhen modifying a previously authorized PCCP, FDA has added to Section V.E of the 2024 Guidance a recommendation for a summary of the changes to the PCCP and a version of the revised PCCP with tracked changes as part of the submission. This section is identical to Section V.E in FDA\u2019s August 2024 Draft Guidance on PCCPs for medical devices other than AI-enabled devices.\n\nThe 2024 Final Guidance adds Section V.F (Version Control and Maintenance of a PCCP for a Device), which borrows language directly from Section V.F of the August 2024 Draft Guidance. The first part of this section states that FDA will provide feedback on PCCPs during the submission review process through deficiency letters. This section states that manufacturers should clearly indicate the title and current version of the PCCP when revising the document in response to deficiencies. The second part of the section addresses modifications made to devices with an authorized PCCP that are not within the scope of the PCCP and require a new marketing submission. In such cases, FDA will not re-review the PCCP or modifications made within the scope of the authorized PCCP but will focus on the modifications that are specific to the submission.\n\nFDA modifies its reference to AI-DSF data categories throughout the 2024 Final Guidance from \u201ctraining and testing\u201d to \u201ctraining, tuning, and testing.\u201d\n\nNOTABLE CHANGES TO THE DESCRIPTION OF MODIFICATIONS\n\nThe 2023 Draft Guidance proposed that FDA would consider PCCPs for ML-DSFs using automatic implementation of modifications, and Section VI.B (Content of the Description of Modifications Section) of the 2024 Final Guidance confirms this will be the case for AI-DSFs. The Final Guidance also recommends that manufacturers using automatic implementation of modifications discuss this approach with FDA using the Q-Submission Program. As we describe in this client alert (see below) and in our prior Client Alert on the 2023 Draft Guidance, such language does not, in and of itself, support algorithms employing continuous learning.\n\nSection VI.B (Content of the Description of Modifications Section) outlines additional recommendations to include expected frequency of updates in the Description of Modifications section of the PCCP.\n\nSection VI.C (Types of Modifications) backs away from a clear prohibition against incorporating changes to indications for use in a PCCP and states that some such changes may be considered, and to engage with FDA using the Q-Submission process to discuss further.\n\nNOTABLE CHANGES TO THE MODIFICATION PROTOCOL\n\nThe 2024 Final Guidance adds in Section VII.A (Goals of the Modification Protocol Section) an additional goal for Modification Protocols regarding identification of the update process and the manufacturer\u2019s plan for communication and/or training for users for implemented modifications.\n\nSection VII.B(1) (Data Management Practices) now states that manufacturers should include information in their modification protocol regarding \u201cthe process that will be followed to determine the reference standard (representing the ground truth), [and a] protocol describing how the reference standard is determined.\u201d\n\nSection VII.B(3) (Performance Evaluation) now states that for a failure identified during performance evaluation to prevent implementation of a modification, the failure should be \u201cunresolvable.\u201d According to FDA, a failure would not be \u201cunresolvable\u201d if there is a root cause analysis of the failure revealing it is not related to \u201cspecific aspects of the PCCP.\u201d\n\nSection VII.B(4) (Update procedures) now clarifies that devices required to have a Unique Device Identifier (UDI) must generate new UDIs \u201cwhen there is a new version and/or model, and for new device packages.\u201d\n\nAppendix A provides example elements of a Modification Protocol, and in Section (1)(d) of the appendix (Data Management / Sequestration of test data sets), the 2024 Final Guidance adds a recommendation to include \u201cdescriptive statistics (e.g., covariate range, mean, median) for each data set and how similar they are for the intended use population.\u201d\n\nIn Appendix A Section (4)(d) (Update Procedures / Device monitoring plan), the 2024 Final Guidance adds recommendations to describe how information about monitoring real-world device performance will be provided to users, how and at what frequency changes in safety and effectiveness will be monitored, and a roll-back plan to bring devices back to a previous version, if applicable.\n\nNOTABLE CHANGE TO THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\nSection VIII (Impact Assessment) adds a recommendation for manufacturers of combination products to \u201cdiscuss how the individual modifications included in the PCCP for the device constituent part impact the biologic and/or drug constituent part, and the combination product as a whole.\u201d\n\nEXAMPLES (APPENDIX B)\n\nThe 2024 Final Guidance made only minor changes to the example scenarios for AI-DSFs employing PCCPs provided in the 2023 Draft Guidance. One additional example was provided in the 2024 Final Guidance for a combination product (optical imaging system co-packaged with an imaging drug).\n\nCONTINUING CONCERNS ABOUT CONTINUOUS LEARNING\n\nWe remain concerned that the 2024 Final Guidance does not fully support adaptive algorithms using continuous learning models (i.e., those that continually update themselves in their operating environment based on real-world data and performance).\n\nIn the Scope section of the 2024 Final Guidance, FDA adds to its previous language regarding automatically implemented modifications by referring to these modifications as \u201ccontinuous learning.\u201d We note that although FDA makes this correlation in an attempt to accommodate continuous learning models into the 2024 Final Guidance, FDA\u2019s definition of \u201cContinual Machine Learning\u201d adds burden to the concept that is not clearly incorporated into other definitions. The \u201cDigital Health and Artificial Intelligence Glossary\u201d maintained on FDA\u2019s website defines \u201cContinual Machine Learning\u201d as:\n\nThe ability of a model to adapt its performance by incorporating new data or experiences over time while retaining prior knowledge/information. The model changes are implemented such that for a given set of inputs, the output may be different before and after the changes are implemented. These changes are typically implemented and validated through a well-defined process that aims at improving performance based on analysis of new data. In contrast to a locked model, a continual machine learning model has a defined learning process to change its behavior.\n\nThe glossary citation above states that this is an adaptation from ISO 22989:2022. The definition of \u201ccontinuous learning\u201d in the ISO standard, however, simply states it is \u201cincremental training of an AI system that takes place on an ongoing basis during the operation phase of the AI system life cycle.\u201d The International Medical Device Regulator\u2019s Forum (IMDRF), of which FDA is a member, only slightly modifies this definition in its own \u201cMachine Learning-enabled Medical Devices\u2014A subset of Artificial Intelligence-enabled Medical Devices: Key Terms and Definitions.\u201d FDA\u2019s implication in its AI glossary that continuous learning changes are \u201cimplemented and validated through a well-defined process\u201d is in conflict with other definitions that allow for unattended updates to adaptive algorithms in their operating environments and may put burdens on changes to a continuous learning model similar to that of a locked model (i.e., one that is initially trained and does not change with use but must be retrained and retested to incorporate \u201clearning\u201d from new data).\n\nThe 2024 Final Guidance also maintains the requirement for implementation of full design controls (including verification and validation of the \u201centire device\u201d (Section VII.B(3) of the 2024 Final Guidance)) for each modification implemented in the context of an authorized PCCP. This requirement is a significant barrier to any manufacturer seeking to implement adaptive algorithms using continuous learning unless a way can be found to meet the quality system requirements for design changes, likely in an automated way and possibly as an add-on software item to the medical device within its operating environment.\n\nFor manufacturers seeking to deploy adaptive algorithms, the FDA has expressed its desire to engage with such firms in its continuing search for ways to support this technology without compromising the safety and effectiveness of marketed medical devices. Firms going down this road, however, must recognize that the costs associated with the development of adaptive technologies may not be recouped if engagement with FDA during a Q-Submission or other interactive process does not result in alignment on issues of safety, effectiveness, and regulatory compliance.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWe continue to view the FDA\u2019s implementation of PCCPs within the regulatory framework as a positive step in integrating the capabilities of AI into the healthcare ecosystem. We encourage firms to carefully review the 2024 Final Guidance in light of our comments on the 2023 Draft Guidance and our thoughts expressed above."

            "article_content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations.\n\nBut the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

            "article_content": "While members of the 118th Congress will be finished with their lame-duck session this week, lawmakers have yet to release or vote on a year-end legislation package.\n\nAlthough recent negotiations have included funding for the federal government, a Farm Bill extension, economic assistance for agriculture producers and natural disaster recovery aid, Congressional leadership has signaled that the package does not currently include economic assistance.\n\nIn response to this development, the following national ag leaders have issued the following statements over the weekend:\n\nTed McKinney, CEO of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA):\n\n\u201cFarmers and ranchers are encountering tremendous pressures under high input costs, elevated interest costs, deeply depressed commodity futures markets and poor local cash markets. Additionally, they have experienced powerful headwinds, ranging from extreme weather to uncertain global demand to supply chain disruptions. NASDA calls on Congress to put politics aside and find a resolution that provides the necessary economic aid and disaster assistance for the farmers and ranchers who work every day to provide food security to our country while also feeding the world.\u201d\n\nZippy Duvall, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF):\n\n\u201cAt a time when farm income is in a downward spiral and costs are rising, it\u2019s unacceptable for Congress to turn its back on farmers. Farmers don\u2019t get to set the prices for their goods and right now those prices don\u2019t even come close to covering their costs. We lost 141,000 farms in five years and if Congress fails to include economic aid for farmers, the sad reality is that we\u2019ll lose more.\n\n\u201cOur whole country will suffer the consequences if Congress takes farmers and our food supply for granted. For this reason, I call on members of Congress who represent agriculture to stand with farmers by insisting the supplemental spending bill include economic aid for farmers and voting it down if it doesn\u2019t. In truth, every elected leader who enjoys our affordable and abundant food supply represents agriculture, so I urge them to band together and ensure farmers are supported.\n\n\u201cNearly 80% of Americans believe lawmakers should prioritize legislation that supports farmers and ranchers so it\u2019s just plain unacceptable that our elected leaders are considering putting politics first. I hope reasonable members of Congress take a stand for the good folks who stock their pantries.\u201d\n\nKenneth Hartman Jr, President of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA):\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that congressional leadership appears to be at an impasse over crucial economic assistance for farmers in an end-of-the-year legislative package. Corn growers are faced with low prices and high input costs and economic aid would provide them with critical relief during challenging economic times.\n\n\u201cWhile these developments are disheartening, we call on Congress to resume negotiations and pass legislation that includes economic assistance while there is still time.\u201d\n\nCaleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA):\n\n\u201cWe urge congressional leadership to return to the negotiating table and find a path forward. A package that does not include both economic and disaster assistance for our farmers who have suffered significantly from unforgiving market conditions, disastrous weather phenomena and for many, a combination of both, simply does not meet the mark for what agriculture and specifically, our soy growers, need. We will oppose any supplemental spending package that does not provide meaningful assistance to farmers who need help now to stay afloat in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nChandler Goule, CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG):\n\n\u201cNAWG opposes any continued resolution that does not include economic assistance for farmers. We are disappointed that leaders in Congress couldn\u2019t find common ground to provide relief to farmers experiencing a financial crisis and urge them to continue working on a package that meets the needs of rural America. Wheat growers have seen their prices drop by over 36 percent since the 2022/23 marketing year and need the certainty an economic assistance package can provide before the end of the year. Period. Congress has already failed to pass a robust farm bill, and the lack of leadership in reaching an agreement will continue to hurt farmers who feed America and the world.\u201d"

Chinese manufacturers have leaked images of the Nintendo Switch 2, revealing significant details about the new handheld console.\n\nNintendo's next-generation console has been the subject of rumors for many years now, but it seems things are picking up to a new speed as we approach the end of the timeframe for when Nintendo will make an announcement about the successor to the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe only official information we have about the Nintendo Switch successor from Nintendo is that an announcement for the console will be made during this financial year, which runs until April 2025. Additionally, Nintendo has confirmed that it will continue with the current Nintendo Switch until the end of the current financial year, which means we won't be seeing any surprise launches any time soon. However, that doesn't mean we won't get a surprise unveiling.\n\nUntil that undoubtedly incredible moment, fans will have to make do with leaks and speculation, and to satisfy that hunger, a Chinese accessory manufacturer has seemingly released a slew of images depicting what appears to be Nintendo's unreleased console. The new images emerged online and were quickly posted to the Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit, and they showcase the design of the upcoming console, such as button placement, Joy-Cons, and more.\n\nRead more: Nintendo Switch 2 release window confirmed by at least six developers\n\nAdding more credence to this story, and perhaps the legitimacy of the images, is that this isn't the first Chinese accessory manufacturer to seemingly leak images of Nintendo's unreleased console, as it was only last week that Satisfye posted and removed a trailer showing off a mysterious Nintendo console.\n\n4\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 4 IMAGES\n\n4"

            "article_content": "Contributed Article\n\nThe need for speed \u2013 high-speed internet \u2013 along with greater bandwidth capacity will continue to be critical for communities everywhere in 2025 and beyond.\n\nBy: Tony Thakur, Chief Technology Officer of Great Plains Communications\n\nNetwork operators should anticipate demand for more and more bandwidth, as network traffic growth shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving all the bandwidth consumption? We rely on the internet for products, services, and applications we use continuously more and more. Smartphones, smart watches, other wearables, smart TVs, streaming services, real-time events (e.g. concert, sports), online gaming, along with virtual and augmented reality are some of the products and applications growing network traffic and consuming bandwidth.\n\nAs a fiber optic network provider, Great Plains Communications sees a continued rise in network traffic as an ongoing trend. Knowing there is a critical need for increasing bandwidth, network operators must implement best network practices in key areas to meet demand, improve productivity, and minimize disruption of customers\u2019 everyday lives.\n\nHere are key factors to support the demand.\n\nAI plus good data = best customer experience\n\nAI means different things to different groups. Transferring information between data centers for AI applications consumes high bandwidth. Yet, AI is now part of the pit crew that keeps the network running. For network operators, AI means automation to drive greater efficiency across organizations and supply bandwidth on demand.\n\nWe view AI evolving as an enabler to enhancing the customer experience. In the past, operators were reactive: a customer alerted the operator when something broke and they fixed it. Currently, most are more proactive, deploying technologies in a ring topology with redundant equipment to mitigate downtime. With AI, events can be more predictive: for example, a problem is detected and fixed before the issue can be customer affecting.\n\nThanks to AI\u2019s prediction ability, potential network disruptions can be averted. It stands to reason that a network will need more bandwidth during a live Thursday night football game. AI can calculate if the network has the necessary capacity and redundancy to ensure the audience never misses a play through buffering or other hiccups.\n\nNetwork operators must leverage AI to create a better experience for their customers. However, along with the right tools and systems, AI must leverage reliable data to make the right decisions.\n\nTimely network services\n\nWe\u2019ve come to expect real-time services like Amazon Web Services model, which is available 24/7/365. We shop online, press a button, and our purchase arrives the next day. That has become consumers\u2019 standard. So, they expect other products and services to be simpler and faster to obtain as well.\n\nPeople rely on cell phones to do almost everything, and when we pull up all the applications we\u2019re using, we\u2019re consuming more bandwidth than we realize. Hyperscalers that want more and higher bandwidth to connect their data centers are another driver of increased network traffic. At Great Plains Communications (GPC), we see more demand for 400 Gig services, especially between key markets.\n\nAs a result, network providers must become more agile, monitor services more effectively, and add more products and services that work in tandem to meet current and future customer needs. One of the biggest challenges network operators face is predicting demand and growth trends and then planning and updating networks accordingly to be ready. To accomplish this, it is vital to have flexible architecture to scale the network capacity to meet changing bandwidth requirements in metro and rural areas.\n\nData to the cloud\n\nOver the past decade, most businesses have either already done so or are planning to migrate most of their data from their own private onsite servers to cloud storage, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others. It\u2019s a big shift from how data used to be stored in private clouds to public clouds and a multi-cloud environment.\n\nIt is critical for businesses (and all of us) to have real-time access to data. We don\u2019t want to wait or have the data lag. The cloud data warehouses offer virtually unlimited space with the ability to compute capacity and storage to scale up and down at greater cost savings. This is a tremendous advantage, which does require more bandwidth.\n\nAs consumers, we also rely on cloud storage. After all, we can\u2019t store all our videos in our phone. We want to view a video and interact immediately. This requires reliable connectivity to the cloud, so we have immediate access to our data, wherever it\u2019s stored. Reliable connectivity \u2014 to the internet and to cloud providers \u2014 is essential.\n\nFuture runs on higher bandwidth\n\nFrom my point of view, both as a telecom network operator and as a consumer, having bandwidth infrastructure optimized to support current and future rising network traffic is a must-have. There are many considerations, but here are factors I consider essential.\n\nFirst, the network infrastructure has to deliver adequate speeds. Speed alone is not enough. We also need reliable connectivity we can trust day in and day out. This calls for careful planning and best-in-class architecture when designing the network. And, most important, we need to provide the best possible customer experience in our digital age. We should take advantage of AI and other technologies to anticipate network demands, automate processes to drive efficiencies, and provide the best possible solutions for our customers.\n\nJoin the conversation about connectivity in North America.

A unique discovery that not only teaches us more about our past, but also shows how unique the story of Roman Heerlen is for the Netherlands,\" Clemens wrote.\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter analysing the gravesite, researchers deduced that Heerlen's first settlement would have been around the Augustan era from around 0 to 20 AD.\n\nThis gravesite was discovered in the midst of excavations at Raadhuisplein, the town square in Heerlen, near a couple of historical roads in Via Belgica and Via Traiana.\n\nIt was found to be an important location in the middle of a Roman settlement named Coriovallum, according to archaeologists.\n\nCariovallum was known for its Roman bathhouse, which is also the oldest stone building in the whole country, built in approximately 40AD.\n\nAdvert\n\nNot only that, but the building also had a restaurant and library, which points towards the area being a multi-purpose building and a place of meeting in Roman times. They really were ahead of their time, weren't they?\n\nA bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl were found in the grave with Flaccus (Municipality of Heerlen)\n\nArchaeologists further explained that their findings would give us some new insights into the history of the city, adding: \u201cNever before have we found a Roman grave from this period with a name.\u201d\n\nAs well as Flaccus, they found a bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl in the grave, managing to trace the pottery back to ancient Italy, confirming their suspicions that he was a Roman soldier.\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the past, digs in the area have uncovered nothing more than pottery shreds, not proving the presence of a settlement as these items could have been left behind during travel.\n\nFlaccus' grave gave researchers eye-opening evidence that there was a Roman presence in the region, as they further explained: \u201cIt is a unique find because it is not only the oldest Roman grave in Heerlen but also because no name was known there before.\u201d"

I said, 'No, the name kind of sounds familiar, but I don't know him'.\"\n\nTed Jorgensen passed away in 2015 (YouTube/Inside Edition)\n\nJorgensen - who was battling emphysema at the time - spoke of his desire to apologise to his son for what he regarded as the biggest mistake of his life, although getting in touch with a bloke as high-profile as Bezos proved difficult.\n\n\"I would just like to tell him I used to change his diapers and just shake his hand and tell him he's really done a good job with his life,\" he said.\n\nThe bike shop owner, who was based in Phoenix, passed away in March 2015, aged 70.\n\nAccording to Page Six, he never reconnected with Bezos before he died.\n\nWhen asked about Jorgensen in 1999, the billionaire told Wired: \"The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my dad [Miguel Bezos] is my natural father.\n\n\"The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form.\"\n\nHe previously praised his adoptive dad for moving to the US from Cuba as a teenager, saying: \"His grit, determination, and optimism are inspiring.\"\n\nBezos - who created Amazon out of his garage in Seattle in 1994 - stepped down as CEO of the company in July 2021.\n\nAccording to Forbes, his current net worth is a whopping $241.2billion."

            "article_content": "For the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents, politicians and even President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nConcerned witnesses have described clusters of lights, saying they look like drones hovering over populated areas around the state. Now, even as sightings have expanded to New York and Maryland, government officials haven\u2019t been able to put people\u2019s minds at ease.\n\nSo who (or what) is behind the mysterious drone sightings? And can you shoot them down in California?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This has gone too far': Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says\n\nBecause the sightings aren't confirmed to be connected, it's possible different sightings have different explanations.\n\nFederal authorities have tried to reassure residents that the objects don\u2019t appear to be operating nefariously. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey lawmakers say they believe there is more to the story than federal officials have shared publicly.\n\nCan you shoot down drones in California? What to know after mystery NJ sightings\n\nAnd President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to demand government give answers, writing: \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" On Nov. 22, the FAA issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones over Trump's National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., criticized the Biden administration for being \"dismissive\" about the reported sightings arguing the White House team has failed his \"obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of clear answers has fueled rampant speculation and sometimes bizarre or joking theories.\n\n\u201cThe drones in New Jersey can easily be explained. Teams are clearly spying on the Jets and Giants practices which is why they have struggled this season,\u201d former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cFirst, a Chinese spy balloon drifted across U.S. airspace for a week. Now, unidentified drones are flying over New Jersey, avoiding radar detection. Gaps in our airspace are being exploited, and because of it, the safety of Americans is at risk,\u201d New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew posted.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some possible explanations for the sightings \u2013 and the evidence for or against the theories.\n\nFor the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents. These photos were taken on Dec. 8 in Toms River, N.J.\n\nIs it really drones?\n\nGovernment officials have said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s aren\u2019t actually drones in many of the sightings. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said many of the sightings are actually of piloted aircraft flying legally.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Direen, an electronic and software engineering expert at DireenTech, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people were seeing drones at first, but that once the notion of drones took hold, people assumed any aircraft they couldn\u2019t identify was a drone.\n\n\u201cAfter what were likely valid sightings of possibly hobbyist drones, every aircraft can then become suspicious,\u201d he said.\n\nHoaxes, UFOs, witches, drones: NJ is no stranger to strange happenings\n\nKirby said during a news conference that authorities haven\u2019t been able to corroborate \u201cany of the reported visual sightings\u201d \u2014 despite using \u201cvery sophisticated electronic detection technologies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FBI, DHS and our federal partners, in close coordination with the New Jersey State Police, continue to deploy personnel and technology to investigate this situation and confirm whether the reported drone flights are actually drones or are instead manned aircraft or otherwise inaccurate sightings,\u201d the agencies said in the statement.\n\nForeign government surveillance?\n\nU.S. government officials this week assured the public that the spotted aircraft do not appear to be sent by a foreign government, quashing a theory posed by Van Drew, who said the drones could be controlled by Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence the drones pose a national security threat, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The sightings may actually be piloted aircraft operating legally, the agencies said. Also worth noting: the craft haven\u2019t flown in restricted airspace, they said.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, they have uncovered no such malicious activity or intent at this stage,\u201d a joint statement from the agencies said. \u201cWhile there is no known malicious activity occurring in New Jersey, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight the insufficiency of current authorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said they were briefed by State Police and told authorities don\u2019t know where the drones are coming from, and are unable to detect them.\n\n\u201cListen, I hope it\u2019s no big deal, but the federal government needs to be more truthful.\u201d New Jersey Assemblyman Greg Myhre said.\n\nUS government drones?\n\nGovernment officials including the Pentagon said the drones spotted by residents for the last few weeks are not operated by the U.S. government or military.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that a government organization would be flying the drones over public locations, Direen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cClearly they are not being very stealthy if they are,\u201d he said.\n\nKids playing a prank, or hobbyists?\n\nCould the drones people keep seeing be someone playing a prank, or drone hobbyists just out having a good time? It\u2019s not illegal to fly drones in New Jersey, but you have to meet certain requirements depending on the size of the drone and the reason you\u2019re flying it, according to federal and state laws.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it should be pretty easy for officials to figure out, Direen said.\n\n\u201cIf the drones are being flown legally, the ADS-B transponder on the drone should make it easy for authorities to identify the drone and the operator,\u201d he said.\n\nUFOs?\n\nCould the drones be the work of aliens? At this point, officials have given no evidence to suggest that, but also no evidence to debunk it. (And many UFO sightings are believed to have natural explanations.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI suppose some alien kids could be flying their toy drones while their parents are busy out abducting humans and performing experiments on them,\u201d Direen said.\n\nIs it legal to shoot down a drone in California?\n\nNo. It is illegal to try to shoot down or destroy a drone that trespasses on private property or above public spaces because it may cause safety risks.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones are registered in the U.S., according to the Federal Aviation Administration, including 396,746 commercial drones and 387,746 recreational drones.\n\nRegardless of the drone's classification, however, the FAA considers them aircraft \u2014 meaning that you could be charged with shooting at an aircraft, a federal crime if you take a shot at one.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you believe a drone is violating the law, your best bet is to contact law enforcement.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information, correct a misspelling/typo and to change or add a photo or video.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Mass drone sightings prompt worries, but there may be an explanation"

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "8. RIKEN and NTT launch world first general-purpose optical quantum computer\n\nRIKEN and NTT launched the world\u2019s first general-purpose optical quantum computer in November. The system operates at nearly room temperature and processes at speeds up to several hundred terahertz.\n\nThe computer uses continuous-variable analog design with time-division multiplexing, where computations occur through quantum teleportation. It can handle approximately 100 continuous quantity inputs. The system is accessible through a cloud service and is designed for materials science, chemistry, and AI applications.\n\nOne major benefit of this approach to quantum computing is that it operates at room temperature. By comparison, superconducting qubits and trapped ion cubits operate at temperatures close to absolute zero. According to Riken, the optical quantum computer is also faster than other quantum computing platforms.\n\n9. D-Wave speeds up processing 25,000 times\n\nAnd in yet another kind of quantum computing \u2014 the analog kind \u2014 D-Wave released the benchmark results for its latest 4,400-plus qubit Advantage2 processor in November, with big performance gains. The system solves materials science problems 25,000 times faster than its previous version, the company claims.\n\nThe new processor doubles qubit coherence time and has improved qubit connectivity, enabling solutions to larger problems.\n\nThe system delivered five times better solutions for high-precision applications and outperformed the previous version in 99% of satisfiability problem tests, the company said. It\u2019s available now through D-Wave\u2019s quantum cloud service.\n\nD-Wave\u2019s qubits can\u2019t be directly compared to those of other companies, however, because it\u2019s not a general-purpose computer but a narrow-purpose analog one.\n\n10. Google uses AI to improve error correction\n\nWe can expect to see even more progress on error correction next year. One reason? Artificial intelligence.\n\nIn late November, Google announced an AI system that spots errors in quantum computers. This uses the same transformer technology that\u2019s behind large language models and other types of generative AI, but trained specifically on quantum processes.\n\nThe system is too slow to be actually used in real-time to spot errors, Google says, but, as AI technology improves, it could point to an additional way to reduce error rates.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSo, when will we have working quantum computers?\n\nAnalysts at the Boston Consulting Group say they\u2019ve been disappointed in the lack of recent progress of actual enterprise use cases.\n\n\u201cQuantum computing today provides no tangible advantage over classical computing in either commercial or scientific applications,\u201d Boston Consulting Group researchers wrote in a July report. \u201cThough experts agree that there are clear scientific and commercial problems for which quantum solutions will one day far surpass the classical alternative, the newer technology has yet to demonstrate this advantage at scale.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm, our current era, that of \u201cnoisy intermediate-scale quantum\u201d will last until 2030.\n\nAt this stage, quantum computers have too few qubits and too many errors to be practically useful, but they can be used to test algorithms and do other preliminary research.\n\nBroad quantum advantage \u2014 where quantum computers can be used to solve problems that traditional computers can\u2019t handle \u2014 will last from approximately 2030 to 2040, according to the Boston Computing Group. At that time, the research firm predicts that end users will see between $80 and $170 billion in total annual value creations.\n\nIn 2040, according to the research firm, we\u2019ll enter the era of full-scale fault tolerance, and end users will see between $450 and $850 billion of value creation per year. This is when errors are reduced to the point that quantum computers can be scaled up to handle pretty much anything thrown at them.\n\nSome quantum computing companies expect to get there even faster. For example, IBM\u2019s quantum roadmap has the company delivering a fully error-corrected system in 2029. It expects to have a quantum computer with over 2,000 error-corrected qubits \u2014 or logical qubits \u2014 after 2033.\n\nIt takes many physical qubits to create one error-corrected logical qubit, so IBM expects to have a 100,000-qubit computer by then, capable of running 1 billion gates.\n\nIBM is the company to watch, says Gartner\u2019s Dekate. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that IBM is leading,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re innovating at every layer of the stack. But it is early days.\u201d Achieving workable quantum computers is a marathon, he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the first five minutes.\u201d\n\nWhoever is ahead today might not necessarily win the race, he says. \u201cEnterprises should not fall into the trap of trying to figure out who\u2019s ahead and who\u2019s behind \u2014 that will lead enterprises to make bad decisions, because the leaderboard will change quite dramatically.\u201d\n\nHe suggests that companies looking to take the lead in finding ways to take advantage of quantum computing should partner with multiple vendors and explore different pathways. And, instead of focusing on finding short-term investment returns, they should instead think about skills development, building capabilities, investigating use cases, and preparing for disruptions."
