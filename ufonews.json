        "article_content": "During my first two months at Yale, I\u2019ve learned how to be an indulgent skeptic.\n\nThe Thursday before Family Weekend, I received an email advertising an 11-hour-long teach-in about UFOs, to which I responded with immediate incredulity. I wasn\u2019t quite sure that \u201cfree exchange of ideas surrounding a challenging subject\u201d could apply to government cover-ups of UFOs, a conspiracy theory seemingly on par with the flat Earth.\n\nI decided to reach out to Sydney Morrison \u201925, the leader of the Yale Student UFO Society, or YSUS, to find out what could lead a Yale student to believe that little green men in flying saucers were anything but pure science fiction. After a few back-and-forth emails, she explained her reasoning over lunch last Monday.\n\nSydney\u2019s story with ufology, the study of UFOs, began during her time away from Yale after her sophomore year. Throughout her childhood and teenage years, her idea of UFOs was much like mine: \u201cpotentially some weird spiritual thing, like a semi-religious phenomenon.\u201d But one night, while hanging out with a friend in a Washington park, they turned around simultaneously to see a large object with blinking lights in the sky. Unbothered at first, they then encountered an 8-foot-tall bulky humanoid object with two deer-like eyes, casually strolling around and absorbing all visible light entering its body. Sydney said that they got within two feet of the alien, which continued to stomp around and followed them back to their car.\n\nNaturally, this experience was \u201cpretty shaking,\u201d and Sydney started YSUS her next semester back at Yale to create a space for UFO believers \u2014 the only such space in the Ivy League. The club\u2019s main goal is to consolidate and present knowledge on UFO sightings.\n\nConvincing those in the Yale community is more of a secondary objective. Sydney explained that when talking about her experience to people outside the ufology community, she always begins with \u201cI know this sounds crazy\u201d or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have believed it myself,\u201d but it\u2019s often unsuccessful; she\u2019s mostly given up on convincing people to believe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such pervasive stigma that associates UFOs with mental illness,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s scary when you do try to take [beliefs about UFOs] further into the media and the public.\u201d\n\nI felt sympathetic to her cause. If UFOs were to exist, I \u2014 and most of the world \u2014 would be virtually clueless, having been deaf to all those who claimed to have seen evidence. Sydney often wishes she hadn\u2019t had her sighting \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s kind of like the Matrix, where you can\u2019t go back after you\u2019ve seen something like that,\u201d she said. Personally, I\u2019d rather live my life unaware of any alien existence \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine being so utterly sure of a truth that my family and friends would never accept.\n\nCurious about what led other students to join the club \u2014 to voluntarily take the red pill \u2014 I talked to Lorenzo Chamberlin \u201928, YSUS\u2019s newest officer. He told me that he saw a poster advertising YSUS on the way to class one day and was immediately drawn to it. He\u2019s never had an experience with UFOs, though he would like to, and was enthusiastic about the club\u2019s efforts to find \u201cways to have those experiences.\u201d He quoted Sherlock Holmes to summarize his reason for joining: \u201conce you\u2019ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Lorenzo wrote the original teach-in email that piqued my curiosity. Rereading it after our chat, I realized that his description of the event\u2019s purpose \u2014 raising awareness for \u201cwider epistemological challenges to accepted boundaries of scholarship and civic activism\u201d \u2014 was not a half-baked attempt at intellectualizing a joke but a genuine reflection on how deep our assumptions lie.\n\nOver the course of our lunch, Sydney presented a logical, well-thought-out argument. By the time she brought up postcolonialism and ontology, it was clear that she\u2019d spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours researching ufology.\n\nWe talked for around an hour, but most people don\u2019t devote that much time to understanding a claim viewed as fundamentally absurd. It\u2019s so easy to just dismiss someone as crazy when that\u2019s what the rest of the world thinks.\n\nIn my philosophy and astronomy courses, I\u2019ve learned about dozens of breakthroughs that were met with universal skepticism when they were first made. Ideas like philosophical questioning, the heliocentric theory and special relativity were incredibly controversial when proposed because they disrupted beliefs that felt safe and secure. Socrates, Galileo and Einstein \u2014 some of the most important contributors to human knowledge \u2014 were all shunned for their \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cpreposterous\u201d findings.\n\nSo maybe \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 UFOs are real and Sydney is the next Einstein. I\u2019m not quite convinced, but I\u2019ve learned to at least give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Nothing is for certain, and so to make a leap into the unknown, to challenge centuries of knowledge and billions of people, should be seen not as ignorance but bravery."

        "article_content": "This week in San Francisco, AMD hosted its Advancing AI 2024 event for press, vendors, and industry analysts. Announcements were made, especially around data center products like the new AMD EPYC and AMD Instinct, along with the new AMD Ryzen AI Pro 300-series processors for enterprise users.\n\nBut I was especially interested in the software on display. AI has been big on promises, but so far it's come up short when it comes to delivering software to users that would justify them buying a new laptop with a dedicated NPU (neural processing unit), the so-called AI PCs so many people have been talking about in 2024.\n\nMuch of what I saw is pretty much what we've all seen over the past year: a lot of image generation, some chatbots, and video-conferencing tools like background replacement or blurring, and these aren't exactly the killer apps for the AI PC that might prove to be game changers.\n\nBut I also saw some interesting AI tools and demos that show that we're starting to move beyond those basic use cases and into more creative territory when it comes to AI, and it makes me think that there might be something to all this AI talk after all, even if it's sill going to take some time for the technology to truly bear fruit.\n\nSomething different for a change\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nThere were a few standout AI tools at the AMD Advancing AI 2024 event that caught my attention as I walked the demo floor after Dr. Lisa Su's morning keynote.\n\nThe first was a series of demos of intelligent agents in a 3D game environment, the kind of barebones 3D space that will be familiar to anyone who's ever used Unity, Unreal Engine, or similar game-development platforms.\n\nIn one instance, the demo video showed AI playing multiple instances of 3D Pong, which wouldn't be all that impressive on its own, except that the simple paddles controlled by AI were only given a simple rule for the game, namely that the ball couldn't hit the wall behind it.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThat might not seem like a big deal, but you have to remember that traditional computer programs have to define all sorts of rules that you might take for granted in an instance like this. For example, does an AI agent know that it's supposed to move the paddle to block the ball? Does it know that it's supposed to knock the ball into an opponent's wall to score points? Does it know how the physics of the ball ought to work? These are all things that normally need to be coded into a game so that its AI can play according to a set of rules; the AI agent controlling the paddles in the demo didn't know any of that, but it still learned the rules and played the game as it was meant to be played.\n\nAnother demo in the same environment involved a game of tag between four humanoid agents in a room with obstacles, with three agents having to hunt down and 'tag' the fourth agent. None of the agents are given the rules at the beginning, nor do they have any programmed markers for how to navigate around the various obstacles. Let loose into the environment, the three red agents quickly identified the blue agent and began chasing it down. The blue agent, meanwhile, did the best it could to evade its pursuers.\n\nThere were similar demos that showed agents exposed to an environment and learning the rules of the space as they went. Of course, these demos only showed the ultimate success of these agents doing what they were supposed to, so I didn't get to see how the agents were trained, what their training data was, or how long it took for the agents to get things right. Still, as far as AI use cases go, having more intelligent AI agents in games would be quite a development.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler) (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler) (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nOther use cases I saw included Autodesk 3DS Max 2025 with a tyDiffusion plug-in that was able to generate a rudimentary 3D scene based on a text prompt. The 3D-rendered output wasn't going to win any design awards, but for engineers and designers I can absolutely see something like this being a rough draft that they could further develop to produce something that actually looked detailed and professional.\n\nThe demo that was most interesting to me, however, was one that featured local video playback that could be controlled (i.e., paused) using only facial movements. For those with disabilities, this kind of application of AI could be revolutionary. Again, it was a simple test of a concept, but it's much more compelling than using yet another image generator to make bizarre memes or videos for social media.\n\nGenerating media is still the fallback for consumer AI\n\nImage 1 of 6 (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler) (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler) (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler) (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler) (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler) (Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nThere were a few other interesting demos I saw featuring AI-powered tools, but the most developed tools on display were image generators, data aggregators, and the like. One mature app I saw did a better job of presenting a sports news summary than Google Gemini, but creating a multimedia flipboard of content produced somewhere else will only be useful if there's original content to aggregate, and these kinds of AI search summarizers are not a viable long-term application.\n\nSummaries of the work of human writers, journalists, photographers, and the like cut off critical revenue to those very creators who cannot continue to produce the content AI tools like Gemini need to function, and the fear with those kinds of AI applications is that they'll put a lot of creators out of work, reducing the quantity \u2013 and quality \u2013 of the source material the applications use to produce their responses to queries, ultimately reducing the quality of the results they produce to the point where people won't trust them or continue to use them.\n\nThis kind of AI product is ultimately a dead end, but right now it presents the most visually compelling example of how AI can and does operate, so companies will continue to rush to develop this kind of product to ride the AI wave. Fortunately, I also saw enough examples of how AI can do something different, something better, that will in time make AI and the AI PCs that power it something worth investing in.\n\nSoon, but not just yet."

After the society conducted an investigation, the LPRS said Emma appeared to blink and close its left eye after sitting in an isolated room for more than 40 hours.\n\nCuellar said he has presented Emma in public, with the LPRS later being asked to no longer bring her due to reports of flickering lights and strange sounds when she was present.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nRaggedy Andy, the possessed doll who doesn't enjoy being separate from its counterpart, Raggedy Ann.

It\u2019s after midnight. You\u2019ve scattered video cameras around the cabin. You ask questions about the lives of those who labored here, and you hope that you\u2019ve captured their answers on your audio recorders. You glance down a short passageway and watch, saucer eyed, as a video camera launches itself off a wicker chair for no discernible reason.\n\nOnce you recover from your shock, you try to recreate and debunk it. You can\u2019t. Could it possibly be something paranormal?\n\nExperiences like this often lead me to reflect on the unexpected turns life can take. Sometimes you land someplace completely weird, and you find a sense of belonging you never expected. After 15 years of training as a historian, I assumed a traditional teaching job would be waiting for me after graduation. Instead, I\u2019m investigating reportedly haunted houses and writing about them. Looking back, the leap from scholar to paranormal investigator might not be as strange as it seems because I investigate to better understand history.\n\nMore:Connell Sanders: Mama loves to rock, and baby's along for the big noise\n\nMore:Last Call: Historian looks for clues to life, death and justice in medieval Ireland\n\nEven when we can\u2019t verify something we learn from an investigation as historical truth, the story becomes an important part of the haunted location\u2019s lore. And when the historical record matches up with our paranormal experiences, we\u2019ve struck gold.\n\nI\u2019ve found my favorite people in the paranormal community. We share more than a love for all things spooky; we\u2019re connected by curiosity and a desire to tell the stories of those who have passed. We bond over experiences that nobody else would understand.\n\nWe also support each other\u2019s creative pursuits; we are writers, photographers, filmmakers and musicians. And the best paranormal conventions (or paracons) feel more like family reunions than your ordinary geeky gatherings. There\u2019s the darker side of the paranormal community, too \u2014 the big egos, fame-seekers and petty drama. But it\u2019s easy enough to look past them and find the people you want on your team. I\u2019ve joined countless paranormal investigations in the U.S. and the U.K., and I\u2019ve met kindred spirits who are now lifelong friends.\n\nWhen we investigate haunted places, we protect each other. We learn our teammates\u2019 body language, and we recognize when they\u2019re uncomfortable and need to leave the scene. Our camaraderie often dispels tension in places where traumatic events happened.\n\nSometimes we catch the best electric voice phenomena (also known as EVPs; unexplained voices imprinted on audio recordings) when we\u2019re relaxed and trading lighthearted banter \u2014 the kind that comes from people who genuinely like each other. There\u2019s no judgment. We understand each other, and we know that our experiences are real. We don\u2019t really care if other people might think we\u2019re bonkers.\n\n\u201cCommunity\u201d means something different for everyone. Since I found mine, I\u2019ve learned what it feels like to let my guard down and embrace the weird, because we\u2019re all weirdos at heart. If hanging out in haunted places after dark and hoping for an experience you can\u2019t explain is your idea of a good time, come celebrate the weird with us. You\u2019re always going to be welcome in the paranormal community.\n\nJoanna MacGugan is a social historian, copy editor, and paranormal investigator.

        "article_content": "Since the Nobel Prizes were created in 1901, just 24 women have received awards in the sciences. This year, that number stayed the same: All seven laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine were men.\n\nSome scientists have expressed frustration about the lack of women among this year\u2019s awardees, particularly the omission of two women who contributed to the work honored for the prize in physiology or medicine. Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Sign Up Your data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."

        "article_content": "MONDAY, Oct. 7, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- A pair of American scientists has been honored with the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their role in the groundbreaking discovery of microRNA\u2014tiny genetic molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation and how genes influence bodily functions.\n\nThe research conducted by Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun has \"revealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\" including humans, according the Nobel Committee in a Monday news release. This significant achievement underscores the importance of microRNA in understanding genetic processes and could lead to advancements in medical science.\n\nGene regulation by microRNA has been at work for hundreds of millions of years, enabling the evolution of increasingly complex organisms, the Nobel committee said.\n\nBut until Ambros and Ruvkun\u2019s discovery, microRNA remained a hidden influence.\n\nA better understanding of microRNA\u2019s role in genetics could lead to better treatments for diseases like cancer, diabetes and autoimmune disorders, the Nobel committee said.\n\n\u201cWe know from genetic research that cells and tissues do not develop normally without microRNAs,\u201d the committee wrote. \u201cAbnormal regulation by microRNA can contribute to cancer, and mutations in genes coding for microRNAs have been found in humans, causing conditions such as congenital hearing loss, eye and skeletal disorders.\u201d\n\nAmbros is a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and Ruvkun is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.\n\nEvery cell in a person\u2019s or animal\u2019s body contains their entire genetic code, meaning that each cell carries an instruction manual for how to create any cell in a body.\n\nHowever, the body contains very different cell types like muscle, skin and nerve cells. How do these specialized cells choose what part of the genetic code to follow in their development?\n\nThe answer lies in gene regulation, the process by which each cell selects only the instructions relevant to it. \u201cThis ensures that only the correct set of genes is active in each cell type,\u201d the Nobel committee explained.\n\nAt the time of Ambrose and Ruvkun\u2019s discovery, scientists had thought they fully understood the process of gene regulation because it had been shown that specialized proteins called transcription factors could control the flow of genetic information.\n\n\u201cSince then, thousands of transcription factors have been identified, and for a long time it was believed that the main principles of gene regulation had been solved,\u201d the committee wrote. \u201cHowever, in 1993, this year\u2019s Nobel laureates published unexpected findings describing a new level of gene regulation, which turned out to be highly significant and conserved throughout evolution.\u201d\n\nTheir initial discovery centered around a \u201crelatively unassuming 1-millimeter-long roundworm\u201d called C. elegans, the committee wrote. Even though it\u2019s tiny, the roundworm possesses many specialized cell types like nerve and muscle cells also found in larger and more complex animals.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Ambros and Ruvkun started researching C. elegans as postdoctoral fellows in the MIT lab of previous Nobel laureate Robert Horvitz. They continued their focus on the roundworm after going their separate academic ways.\n\nFocusing on a mutation in the roundworm, Ambros discovered a tiny RNA molecule that appeared to block a specific gene called lin-14 but didn\u2019t seem to serve any other purpose.\n\nIn his own research, Ruvkun cloned the lin-14 gene from the roundworm and found that it was being inhibited by something outside the process of gene regulation as it was understood at the time.\n\nComparing results, the researchers found that the microRNA molecule was turning off the lin-14 gene by binding to its messenger RNA, a substance produced by a gene to guide cell production.\n\n\u201cA new principle of gene regulation, mediated by a previously unknown type of RNA, microRNA, had been discovered,\u201d the Nobel committee wrote.\n\nThe pair published their results in 1993, and \u201cwere initially met with almost deafening silence from the scientific community,\u201d the committee said.\n\nCritics said the unusual mechanism of gene regulation could be a quirk of C. elegans, and if so would be likely irrelevant to more complex animals like humans.\n\nBut in 2000, Ruvkun\u2019s research group discovered another microRNA encoded by a gene that is present throughout the animal kingdom, showing that the process does play an ongoing role in gene regulation.\n\n\u201cOver the following years, hundreds of different microRNAs were identified,\u201d the Nobel committee wrote. \u201cToday, we know that there are more than a thousand genes for different microRNAs in humans, and that gene regulation by microRNA is universal among multicellular organisms.\u201d\n\nSubsequent research also has found that a single microRNA can regulate many different genes, and a single gene can be regulated by multiple microRNAs, the committee said.\n\nMore information\n\nOhio State University has more on microRNA.\n\nSOURCE: The Nobel Foundation, news release, Oct. 7, 2024"

This plays a vital role in how complex life forms grow and function.\n\nGary Ruvkun is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. He spoke with Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald about his life-changing discovery, and how he hopes to use RNA to find life on other planets. Here is part of that conversation.\n\nWhat was it like to get that call from Stockholm?\n\nIt's been sort of in play for about 20 years. And so at four in the morning when the phone rings, it sort of took a minute to register, and my wife answered it and she said, \"He has a Swedish accent!\" Then it was like, \"Oh!\"\n\nTell me the story of how we started to understand how genes get turned on and off, [which] led to your work on microRNA.\n\nSo this emerged from doing genetic analysis in this little [worm called a] nematode. So the nematode is a big part of the ecosystem in soils, and it's so simple, it has 959 cells and every cell has a name. So I started to work in 1982, as did Victor Ambros, and we worked together on the pedigree of cells that generates the animal.\n\nHow did that lead to the discovery of the role of microRNA?\n\nWhen we figured out what these genes were, it turned out one of them encoded a product that was about five times smaller than any gene had ever been seen to be. It was only 25 nucleotides (the building blocks of RNA and DNA) long. And that was a new phenomenon, and it was considered kind of a quirk, and it wasn't clear what it really meant.\n\nNobel Committee Secretary General Thomas Perlmann speaks to the media in front of a picture of this year's laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun during the announcement of the winners of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (Jonathan Nackstrand/Getty Images)\n\nWhen did you realize that this was a brand new genetic molecule?\n\nThis is early days. We didn't have any genomes at this point but within five years, genomes were emerging. The way we figured out that [microRNA was present in the human genome] was we got a second one of these microRNAs, these very small genes, and that one had a human [equivalent], and got an answer by comparing the worm genome with its 25 letters, and there were those same 25 letters in the human genome.\n\nWhat do these microRNAs actually do?\n\nThey regulate other target genes, and they do all kinds of different processes, and they are used in essentially every animal and every plant. So they're as ancient as the divergence of plants and animals, which is, you know, a billion years ago. And have been implicated in, for example, the domestication of corn 5000 years ago.\n\nThese mutations are what the Indigenous peoples selected for. They didn't know they were doing that, but they got what are called heterochronic mutants, mutants that do things differently when they're developing. And that's what makes bigger corn cobs.\n\nI understand that more recently, you've been applying your knowledge for the search for microbial life outside of our solar system. Tell me about that.\n\nYeah, that's been a passion. So we sort of dove into the richness of RNA biology, and there's a long tradition of people trying to figure out how the ribosome works, for example.\n\nAnd the ribosome is the tiny machine in all of our cells that takes messenger RNA and translates them into proteins, and it turns out that the key element of the ribosome is an RNA that probably existed before proteins even evolved.\n\nThat RNA is the most conserved thing on Earth, and it's how biologists all over the world go to bizarre ecosystems like snow and ice, or ponds, or deep in the ocean, or human feces, you name it. You can look for who's in there by looking for the DNA segments that are present in the ribosome.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun speak onstage during the Breakthrough Prize Awards Ceremony in 2014. Their discovery of microRNA in 1993 has completely transformed what we know about how cells work. (Steve Jennings/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize)\n\nAnd so I've been trying to convince NASA that that's how they should look for life on Mars, and their response is always, \"Well, yes, but that's a very Earth centred view of looking for life. Are you stupid?\" And my response is, it'd be stupid to not first look for that.\n\nIf you think that Mars is going to have independently evolved life, that's stupid, because of course it's going to spread between Earth and Mars. They're right near each other, and there's meteoritic exchange between the two. We have Martian meteorites on Earth, not a lot of them, but you don't need a lot to have bacteria move between planetary systems.\n\nAre there any future applications of microRNA research that you're hoping to see?\n\nYeah. I mean, we're going to continue to work on sort of, what are the pathways right now. One of the big things we do is we now know a lot about what are the proteins that are involved in presenting these tiny RNAs to their targets.\n\nAnd we know that some of those proteins, they're not present in humans or most of the animal kingdom, but the worm has them, ticks and spiders have them, coral has them, and these are the organisms that do antiviral defence way better than we do.\n\nSo we're trying to figure out why so many of the animals like most insects, all of the vertebrates, essentially dumped their very ancient antiviral pathway to develop what's called the interferon pathway, which is how we fight viruses. And my view is that we don't do such a good job in comparison."

No-code platforms, equipped with codeless app design capabilities, empower your team to create and deploy apps without writing a single line of code.\n\nThis means that even team members who aren't traditionally tech-savvy can contribute to the app development process, significantly speeding up project timelines.\n\nImagine you're tasked with improving customer engagement through a new interactive app. With a codeless app design tool, you can drag and drop elements to assemble a prototype within hours, not weeks. This rapid prototyping accelerates development and allows for iterative testing and feedback, ensuring the final product meets user needs while aligning with your strategic goals.\n\nOptimal Flexibility with WYSIWYG App Builders\n\nA crucial element of digital transformation is flexibility\u2014the ability to pivot and tailor solutions in real-time as your business needs evolve. What You See Is What You Get, or WYSIWYG app builders, exemplify this flexibility. They allow you to build and edit your applications visually, seeing exactly how they'll appear to the end-users as you construct them.\n\nThis hands-on approach reduces misunderstandings and miscommunications between business departments and IT teams. For example, your marketing team can directly create landing pages and promotional apps, ensuring that the end design matches their vision without back-and-forth with developers.\n\nThis saves time and empowers your non-technical staff to execute their ideas independently.\n\nReducing Costs and Resource Allocation\n\nOne significant impact of no-code in your digital transformation strategy is cost reduction. Traditional app development involves significant investment in technical staff, extended development timelines, and often expensive fixes and iterations.\n\nNo-code platforms change this dynamic by minimizing the need for a large development team and reducing the dependency on external IT consultants or software development companies.\n\nIntegrating no-code tools into your strategy allows you to allocate your financial and human resources more efficiently. Savings on technical development can be redirected towards other critical areas, such as market research, customer experience improvements, or expansion strategies.\n\nMoreover, the ease of updating applications built with no-code tools means that maintaining and improving your digital assets becomes less costly and more manageable over time.\n\nDriving Business Agility and Competitive Advantage\n\nNo-code platforms give your business the agility to stay ahead of the curve. Because no-code development significantly shortens the time from concept to deployment, your business can respond more swiftly to market changes and emerging opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, no-code tools give you the competitive advantage of experimenting with and implementing new ideas quickly without substantial upfront investment.\n\nWhether it's testing a new customer service bot, a unique booking system, or a custom data analysis tool, no-code platforms let you innovate faster, learn quickly from real-world feedback, and iterate effectively.\n\nIntegrating no-code technology into your strategy offers a pathway to more than just technological advancement. It transforms your organizational culture. It democratizes technology creation, empowers your teams, and sprinkles both agility and innovation into your business.\n\nUsing no-code platforms is a no-brainer. They can dismantle traditional barriers to technology development, open up new avenues for growth, and position your business as a leader in the digital economy."
