            "article_content": "As waves of loud, car-sized mystery drones continue to buzz over New Jersey, one family reported that the craft changed time on their car's clock.\n\nThe family of Morris County locals said they were following one of these seemingly terrestrial UFOs in their vehicle, only to experience the odd effect on their car's electronics as the unexplained craft 'hovered above them.'\n\n'The clock in their car changed time,' according to one Fox News reporter who spoke to the unnamed family. 'They say the clock went back to normal after they drove off.'\n\nWhile local law enforcement in Morris County has issued a statement asserting that 'there is no known threat to public safety' at this time \u2014 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a ban on drone flights over sensitive areas in state.\n\nLast Tuesday, the FBI described the sightings as only 'possible drones' and 'a possible fixed wing aircraft' in its efforts to get to the bottom of the night flights.\n\nBut residents within the eight-and-counting New Jersey counties where the strange craft have been sighted are also taking matters into their own hands with over 17,000 trading notes on the sightings in a dedicated Facebook group.\n\nOne local software engineer, who specializes in radio communications, believes the temporary alteration of the car's clock is a clue to the origin of these mystery drones.\n\n'Many newer cars get their clock time from GPS satellites since that's one of the most accurate time signals you're going to get in a vehicle,' the engineer, Rich Dunajewski, posted to the Facebook group.\n\n'If these are using GPS jamming or spoofing,' Dunajewski explained, 'then it's plausible the car would follow the signal and change the clock to match whatever signal is coming from the drone/plane.'\n\nThe flying objects are larger than drones used by hobbyists, raising questions about their proximity to specific locations - including to President-elect Donald Trump 's Bedminster golf course, US military research facility Picatinny Arsenal and critical infrastructure, police said\n\nResidents within the eight-and-counting New Jersey counties where the strange craft have been sighted are also taking matters into their own hands with over 17,000 trading notes on the sightings in a dedicated Facebook group\n\n'So don't think aliens,' the engineer continued, 'think foreign actors using electronic warfare methods.'\n\nDunajewski noted that GPS spoofing onboard these mysterious aircraft would also explain the car clock's return to normal time.\n\n'Once you're out of range of the spoofed GPS signal, the clock will reacquire the real GPS signal with the correct time,' he said in his Facebook post.\n\nWhile some locals are not buying it, with one saying, 'We need to accept that these are not just \"drones,\" these are UFO/UAP,' other experts did agree with Dunajewski.\n\nA contractor with the FAA's Office of Communications, David Lombardo, cosigned the 'radar jamming or GPS spoofing' theory, writing: 'It's very likely that these drones have some sort of electronic interference capabilities.'\n\nWhile Lombardo said he did not believe that 'the FBI wouldn't get involved if a bunch of drones were just pissing people off,' the FAA contractor also confessed that he currently saw no evidence actual law-breaking yet.\n\n'Nothing that these drones have done appears to be criminal or really against any rules, so far as I know. I mean, they're being weird... there's no crime in being weird.'\n\nBut retired police lieutenant Tim McMillan argued that the drones fit a pattern of Russian psychological warfare operations internationally.\n\nLt McMillan reported that both the mysterious drone flights over New Jersey mirror a 2022 incident in which drones flew over sensitive sites in Sweden just as the European nation was considering joining NATO.\n\n'This recent drone wave is likely in response to the West green lighting Ukraine to use ATACMS inside Russia,' the retired police investigator posted to X.\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' NJ native and TikTok creator @_bucky13 commented under his phone footage of the eerie drones (still image above), captioned 'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.' At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nLast month, the Biden White House granted the Ukrainian military permission to unleash American-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) across the Russian border \u2014 allowing them to strike military targets up to a range of 186 miles.\n\nNeither Moscow, nor local amateur drone pilots, nor any other actors terrestrial or extraterrestrial, has claimed credit for the unusual flights over New Jersey, however.\n\nIf proven to be a covert invasion of sorts, it would the first in this part of the Garden State since British troops sparred with American colonists over 240 years ago.\n\n'I grew up in Morris County,' one local resident posted on X, 'and this is the most exciting event since the Revolutionary War.'\n\n'Anyone wonder why New Jersey?' another resident asked. 'That in itself is a mystery. Why not another State?'\n\nThe anonymous family who reported their car clock's reaction to this eerie and unexplained aircraft were just some of the new witnesses to speak to Fox News about this ongoing wave of UFO sightings.\n\nOne eyewitness told the network that they saw a 'parade' of the drones, some as big as compact cars, roaring over the sky in procession.\n\n'The drones just keep coming,' another witness said, 'one after another.'\n\nWhile the FAA has taken the most direct action suggesting malicious intent, prohibiting drone flights over Trump's golf club until last Friday and above Picatinny Arsenal until December 26, other officials have been more cautious in their language.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nOne UFO or drone in a recent Tik Tok video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Morris and Somerset counties issued a joint statement describing the extent of their collaboration on this ongoing investigation.\n\n'The subject County Prosecutor's, Sheriff's and Emergency Management Offices, our respective municipal police departments, working in close cooperation with the FBI-Newark, the New Jersey State Police and The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, seek to reassure the public that we will continue to monitor and investigate the drone activity,' the two county's Sheriff's Offices said.\n\nPost to social media site X, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy echoed similar words to calm the public.\n\n'I convened a briefing with [Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas] @SecMayorkas, senior officials from [the Department of Homeland Security] @DHSgov ... and members of our congressional delegation to discuss reported drone activity over parts of North and Central New Jersey,' he wrote.\n\n'There is no known threat to the public at this time,' the governor said.\n\nNevertheless, New Jersey residents have been encouraged to report any sightings, videos or photos they may have of the UFO drone flights to the FBI, via phone at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or online via tips@fbi.gov."

            "article_content": "There\u2019s endless hype around generative AI this year, and app developers have clearly been paying attention. AI-focused tools are blowing up Apple\u2019s App Store charts in almost every category, occupying top 10 rankings across education, productivity, and photo editing. Opportunities are particularly rife for free graphics and design apps, a category that\u2019s positively saturated with AI content creation tools.\n\nBut quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality \u2014 and a great many of these apps are bewilderingly bad. I\u2019ve been using some of the most popular offerings to understand the state of AI tools as we head into 2025. And for every serious attempt to make AI useful, there seem to be several more designed to cash in on the hype: quietly paywalling features they advertise behind pricey subscriptions and greatly misrepresenting the results that users can achieve, if the app even works at all.\n\nAround half of the App Store\u2019s top 10 graphics and design apps have \u201cAI\u201d in the name, and three of them are all made by the same company \u2014 HUBX, an app developer founded in 2022 that\u2019s based in Turkey. One of its apps, DaVinci AI, is advertised as an AI image generator with some photo editing features. Almost every tool is locked behind a $30 annual (or $5 weekly) subscription fee, and the free trial only unlocks a subpar text-to-image feature that gives you a choice between using unspecified versions of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E AI models.\n\nMy prompt was simple \u2014 \u201ca photorealistic dragon flying over a volcano\u201d \u2014 but the results were full of errors like missing wings and weird perspectives. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe images it produces are low-quality and resized or cropped incorrectly. In-app ads appear when you click pretty much any link. The UI is unpleasant to navigate. If you do pay for the full version, you can\u2019t download any edited images without slapping an ugly watermark on it. And yet, it sits far above the rankings for more recognizable creative platforms like Microsoft Designer, which has its own built-in text-to-image AI generator. Adobe Express is the only design-focused app in the same category that currently ranks above DaVinci AI.\n\nDaVinci AI did a decent job of removing a zebra from the right side of the image. There\u2019s no way to download AI-edited images without this watermark, though, and every result is forcibly cropped and warped. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe other two high-ranking HUBX products I tested were just as lackluster: the Home AI \u201cinterior design\u201d app spits out hallucination-riddled images of rooms that are barely usable even as concept plans, and the Tattoo AI app refused to work entirely. Both apps have the same feature paywalls and review pop-up reminders as DaVinci AI. The copy and pasted App Store version history notes across all HUBX products are also devoid of any details.\n\nWhile all three apps feature a surprisingly large number of five-star reviews, the user feedback across social media and the App Store comments is overwhelmingly negative. A recurring complaint is that customer service is impossible to get ahold of. HUBX never responded to my requests for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the reference image I plugged into Home AI... Image: Home AI / The Verge ...and the \u201cTropical\u201d themed results. Why is the bed now made of melting wood? Why does the desk merge into the chair? How is this remotely helpful? Image: Home AI / The Verge\n\nApps that clearly advertise having AI features are highly attractive. According to Sensor Tower, four out of the top 10 most downloaded iOS graphics and design apps in the US so far this year have had \u201cAI\u201d somewhere in their title. That\u2019s actually two fewer than last year, but the most popular apps are booming. Photoroom saw downloads increase by more than 160 percent since last year. Comparatively, Photoshop Express downloads on iOS \u2014 which also includes generative AI features \u2014 fell by 21 percent during the same period.\n\nAI-focused creative apps aren\u2019t all bad, but the app market saturation makes it harder to find the good ones that use the technology in more focused ways. Apps like Google\u2019s Magic Editor and Adobe Photoshop have specific tools for removing unwanted objects from photos or inserting new ones in specific places. Smaller developers that provide similar features and perform those tasks well are also climbing the App Store rankings.\n\nFor example, Photoroom and Picsart AI \u2014 all-in-one graphic design apps akin to platforms like Canva and Adobe Express \u2014 are actually pretty good! They rank highly in the free \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d App Store category and provide a similar variety of features to quickly create online content using premade digital assets and templates, alongside some AI-powered editing tools like automatic background and object removal.\n\nThe Picsart remove tool is easy to use and does a decent-enough job \u2014 nothing feels underwhelming or misleading. Image: Picsart / The Verge and Image: Picsart / The Verge\n\nNeither app blew me away, but they did exactly what they advertised: the background removal features aren\u2019t as good as Canva\u2019s, but they did the job, and object removal erased undesirable aspects of photos even if it wasn\u2019t as convincing as Google\u2019s Magic Editor. Both apps lock some of their more premium editing features and digital assets behind a $13 monthly subscription, which is pretty standard if you\u2019re being upfront about it \u2014 individual Canva and Adobe Express subscriptions start at $15 and $10 per month, respectively, by comparison.\n\nThere\u2019s also a noticeable divide between the iPhone and iPad charts \u2014 very few AI-focused names appear in the top 100 free or paid list for the iPad, which instead feature a more diverse range of graphic design apps like Adobe Fresco, Clip Studio Paint, and Canva. And interestingly, the list of top paid iPhone apps looks very similar. There\u2019s an abundance of sketching and 3D modeling platforms, premium reference materials for artists, and tools that streamline specific creative tasks like removing backgrounds and resizing images.\n\nThe divide suggests the spammy AI app phenomenon is a mass-market one that hasn\u2019t quite caught on with traditional photographers and illustrators who still want to use their tried-and-true apps. It also suggests that AI itself holds less appeal if users are expected to pay for it, which tracks with the kind of creative AI apps that appear most frequently \u2014 custom tattoos, logo makers, and interior design \u2014 which are skilled services that usually require payment. People don\u2019t necessarily want to remove the skill barrier; they want to remove the financial one."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud technology are set to be the driving forces behind business growth and innovation in 2025. Together, they offer transformative potential to boost efficiency, drive innovation, and create scalable solutions. However, unlocking these benefits requires careful planning, governance, and security measures. As the new year draws nearer, now is the time for business leaders to get started.\n\nBy adopting a strategic approach, business leaders can begin with manageable steps, scale swiftly, and confidently navigate the dynamic, AI-powered future ahead.\n\nAI and cloud: A seamless partnership AI requires immense computational power, making cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud ideal for scaling AI projects. These platforms provide on-demand access to advanced resources without the need for costly hardware, enabling businesses to experiment and scale solutions as needed. But the relationship between AI and the cloud extends beyond just infrastructure. Cloud technology enables your business to experiment with AI applications, test new ideas, and expand them as needed. This flexibility allows AI to move from concept to scalable solution, growing alongside your business and its evolving needs.\n\nCloud-driven AI across industries The combination of AI and the cloud is reshaping industries across the board. From retail to healthcare, organisations are already seeing the benefits of AI-powered cloud solutions. For example, Spotify uses AI in the cloud to personalize music recommendations for millions of users, processing vast amounts of data to create tailored experiences that enhance engagement. Meanwhile, the NHS leverages AI-powered cloud tools to predict hospital admissions and optimize resources, ultimately reducing wait times and improving patient outcomes. By integrating AI with the cloud, businesses can tackle more complex challenges, automate processes, and improve customer engagement. However, to realize this potential, businesses need to ensure they have the right foundations in place.\n\nKey tips for AI and cloud success To fully leverage AI and the cloud, it\u2019s essential to set your business up for success with the right governance, security, and strategic approach. Let\u2019s break this down further. Get governance right AI thrives on data, but without proper governance, you risk data breaches, non-compliance, or even misuse of AI outputs. Implementing clear policies and leveraging cloud tools for access control and encryption ensures that your AI remains safe and compliant. For example, Microsoft\u2019s Copilot integrates with cloud-based services like Office 365 to enhance productivity. However, without adequate data governance, there\u2019s a risk of exposing sensitive company information. Establish clear policies on data access, usage, and security controls to ensure your AI operates safely and in compliance with regulations like GDPR. Aligning governance strategies to cloud platforms is key, as cloud environments offer tools for managing permissions, access control, and encryption seamlessly. Prioritise security As AI processes increasingly sensitive data, robust security measures in the cloud are essential. Cloud platforms are built to support evolving security needs, offering continuous monitoring and dynamic threat protection to ensure that your AI systems stay secure as they scale. Stay agile Both AI and cloud technologies are evolving rapidly, so businesses must remain adaptable to keep up with new trends and tools. Cloud platforms enable your business to experiment with AI solutions, test applications, and adjust strategies quickly\u2014without the high costs and long lead times of traditional infrastructure upgrades. This flexibility allows companies to refine their AI systems in real-time, staying responsive to shifting market conditions and consumer demands. The agility provided by cloud platforms ensures that your business can innovate at pace, maintaining your competitive edge in a fast-moving digital landscape. Take smart, measured steps The scalability of cloud platforms also makes it easier for you to adopt AI gradually, scaling up at your own pace. AI isn\u2019t just for Christmas. So, instead of diving into large-scale AI projects from the start, you can begin with small, manageable initiatives and expand when you\u2019re confident in the value they\u2019re creating. Cloud technology allows you to experiment without significant upfront investment, minimising risk while building a strong foundation for growth.

(WVVA) - Appalachian Ghost Tours, a paranormal investigation group, spent the night in the Powerhouse ATV Lodge and Mansion, also known as the Maybeury Mansion, with the hopes of discovering and communicating with spirits said to inhabit the location.\n\nThe group hopes that their endeavors will strengthen the paranormal tourism market in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an opportunity to give it some growth, some exposure to tell those stories. Honestly, I feel like the paranormal tourism is growing by leaps and bounds,\u201d says Pamela Huff, member of Appalachian Ghost Tours. \u201cThey just came up with the paranormal trail where people are checking in at the different sites. I think it has potential to be absolutely huge.\u201d\n\nPotentially finding paranormal activity, members have seen a market for tourism and want to introduce tourists to their interests. Huff goes on to add:\n\nWe have realized that there is a market for tourism in West Virginia. We have targeted the smaller towns such as Maybeury. We\u2019re working with the town of Hinton. We\u2019re working with the town of Pocahontas. We have an event in Mount Hope. So we\u2019re looking at these towns that maybe could use the economic development and trying to bring in those tourism dollars to them while doing something that we love and introducing others to our hobby.\n\nThe Executive Director of the group, Mark Covey, says that when it comes to paranormal activity, it can take experiencing it to believe in it.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, if you are curious about it, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try, and then sometimes you\u2019ll get something, sometimes you\u2019ll get nothing. But to me, seeing is believing,\u201d said Covey. \u201cI was a skeptic forever, and then I was somewhere, and a door opened up just randomly. So that just made me believe, and to me it\u2019s just seeing is believing.\u201d\n\nMembers of the group say they did pick up on unexplained activity in the house during their investigation, which may have been paranormal.\n\nFor more information you can find Appalachian Ghost Tours on Facebook. If you\u2019re interested in checking out the house, it\u2019s available for rent on their website.\n\nCopyright 2024 WVVA. All rights reserved."

The Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP) explains this in their case study on Orb Zone Theory.\n\nIn the case of digital and film photography where colored orbs appear, this is often associated with the subtle coloring of the camera's lens.\n\nOther items can cause orbs to appear, including reflective surfaces, dust, rain, water spots, and bugs.\n\nIn video, infrared lights can reflect off of these same objects and give them a lighted orb-like appearance. People often mistake bugs and dust as flying orbs. These appear even as flying orbs in houses that are well cleaned and not dusty as infrared light easily picks up even the smallest amounts of dust.\n\nFor these reasons, many paranormal investigators do not consider orbs as paranormal evidence because there are too many natural world explanations for them. However, it is a possibility that some orbs could be paranormal in nature. This may be particularly true of orbs seen with the naked eye, especially those that appear to have their own light source and unusual patterns of travel."

Lynch said Monday.\n\n\"Commercial activity at The Conjuring House has ceased,\" Lynch told The Providence Journal.\n\nThe police went to the Round Top Road house Friday evening after a Maryland couple flagged down an officer and asked for directions to the business, which had offered tours, overnight \"investigations\" and other \"experiences\" before its business license expired on December 1. The Town Council declined to renew the license last month after allegations of \"erratic behavior\" by owner Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNu\u00f1ez was not present Friday, so the police cited general manager Paige Thibodeau, 25, of Burrillville, for operating a business without a license, Lynch said. She is due in municipal court on December 16 to answer the violation, which carries a fine of $500 for every day the business operates without a license.\n\nThe police returned Saturday and found Conjuring House staff members turning away people who had paid to reserve a visit at the house. On a return check Sunday, officers found no sign of activity, Lynch said.\n\n\"We will continue to spot-check and monitor for any activity there,\" the chief said.\n\nMurders, vampire, mass grave: Here's the history and lore behind 5 of RI's haunted spots\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe house was made famous by the 2013 movie \"The Conjuring,\" inspired by interactions with a malevolent spirit that the Perron family said they experienced while living there in the 1970s. Since the movie came out, the house has been a popular draw for ghost hunters and paranormal enthusiasts.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: The Conjuring House closed after visit by Burrillville police"

She was the queen of Egypt and the last and most famous of the Ptolemaic dynasty\n\nThis is another 'significant finding,' according to Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has said that discoveries at Taposiris Magna are crucial for improving experts' understanding of the architectural, cultural and ceremonial practices of the time.\n\nIn addition to the potential statue of Cleopatra, Martinez and her team also unearthed a limestone bust of a king adorned with the Nemes, the ceremonial headdress of the pharaohs.\n\nMartinez led a team of Egyptian and Dominican archaeologists for this dig, conducted in collaboration with the National University Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a,\n\nThe researchers discovered foundation deposits beneath the southern wall of the temple's outer enclosure, according to a statement.\n\nThe female statue was the most significant finding, some experts have questioned whether it actually depicts Cleopatra, as Martinez believes.\n\nOthers have pointed out differences in facial features between the statue and the ancient Queen, suggesting that it may depict a princess instead.\n\nBut this artifact isn't the only discovery that bears Cleopatra's resemblance.\n\nMartinez and her team also found more than 300 coins, many of which are decorated with her image.\n\nOther notable findings include a scarab-shaped amulet inscribed with the phrase 'The justice of Ra has shone,' a bronze ring dedicated to the goddess Hathor and ancient burial sites.\n\nThe statue and other artifacts - including coins engraved with Cleopatra's face as well as an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and more - were found at the Taposiris Magna temple complex 25 miles west of Alexandria\n\nMartinez and her team also found more than 300 coins, many of which are decorated with Cleopatra's image\n\nThe researchers discovered a large cemetery containing 20 burial chambers, and a tomb with three chambers beneath the Taposiris Magna lighthouse.\n\nMartinez discovered the tunnel in 2022, which was said to resemble the Tunnel of Eupalinos on the Greek island of Samos \u2013 revered as one of the most important engineering achievements of the Classical world.\n\nMartinez told Heritage Key in 2022: 'If there's a oneper cent chance that the last queen of Egypt could be buried there, it is my duty to search for her.\n\n'This is the first time that any archeologist has found tunnels, passages underground [and] inside the enclosure walls of the temple, so we have changed forever what they know about the architecture.'\n\nThe archaeologist believes that, after Mark Antony killed himself following his defeat to Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, Cleopatra put detailed plans in place for them both to be buried there, in echoes of the myth.\n\nIn addition, the mission found the remains of a Greek temple dating back to the fourth century BC. It was destroyed between the second century BC and the beginning of the AD era.\n\nMartinez and her team also found 337 coins bearing the image of Cleopatra, along with an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and o ther artifacts at the Temple of Taposiris Magna\n\nMartinez discovered the tunnel in 2022, which was said to resemble the Tunnel of Eupalinos on the Greek island of Samos \u2013 revered as one of the most important engineering achievements of the Classical world\n\nThat temple is connected to a complex underground tunnel system that stretches from Lake Mariout to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAnalysis of ceramic fragments uncovered by the dig also confirmed that the construction of the Taposiris Magna temple dates to the 1st century BC.\n\nThe temple's name means 'great tomb of Osiris,' suggesting it was dedicated to the god Osiris and his queen - the goddess Isis - who Cleopatra was believed to be a reincarnation of.\n\nToday, Taposiris Magna is in ruins because the Egyptian coastline was battered by earthquakes over the centuries, causing parts of the temple to collapse and sink into the sea.\n\nThe site has been excavated multiple times, with the first dig dispatched by Napoleon in the early 19th century.\n\nMartinez first began investigating the site in 2005, as she believes that Cleopatra may have been laid to rest there after her suicide in 30 BC.\n\nShe thinks that Cleopatra\u2019s death was a ceremonial act - part of a ritual apotheosis, or the shedding of her mortal body to ascend to the states of a goddess.\n\nIf that were true, she would have been buried in a temple, most likely a temple erected in the name of Iris.\n\nOver the last 20 years, Martinez has made numerous discoveries that strengthen experts' understanding of the Ptolemaic period, including skeletal remains, but she still has not found the ancient queen's tomb."

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

The lab's accreditation will significantly boost student learning, research, and the university's mission to produce highly skilled graduates.\n\nBhagalpur: As makhana (fox nut) gains popularity as a healthy snack, scientists at Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, have achieved a major breakthrough. They have identified a unique compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, in makhana, which has vital medicinal property.\u201cThis is the first time the bioactive compound has been identified as a naturally occurring component in makhana,\u201d said vice-chancellor (VC) D R Singh. He added that the compound, a sulfonamide derivative of iodobenzene, is known for its pharmacological potential. \u201cThis finding proves the therapeutic potential of makhana and promises to boost its global recognition and market value. It could revolutionise both the makhana industry and global snacking habits,\u201d he said.Singh added the research reflects BAU\u2019s commitment to innovation, uplifting farmers\u2019 economic conditions and positioning Bihar as a hub for cutting-edge agricultural advancements. \u201cThis finding will inspire farmers to combine traditional farming with modern science.\u201dDr Anil Kumar Singh, director of research at BAU, filed a patent for the discovery. He said makhana, traditionally valued as a nutritious food, is now recognised as a bioactive resource with medicinal value. \u201cThis positions makhana as more than just a snack \u2014 it becomes a key player in the nutraceutical industry, attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and boosting its economic potential,\u201d he said.The research team revealed that makhana is not only rich in nutrients but also has antioxidant and therapeutic properties.Conducted in the university\u2019s NABL-accredited laboratory, the study was led by a team of scientists and faculty members, including V Shajeeda Banu (plant biotechnology), Pritam Ganguly (soil science and agricultural chemistry), Anil Kumar (horticulture) and Dr Anil Kumar Singh (director of research)."

The tool can also complete a scene and extend existing videos by filling in missing frames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said a product team of about five or six engineers built the product in months.\n\n\"Sora is a tool,\" Sora product designer Joey Flynn said. \"It allows you to be multiple places at once, try multiple ideas at once, try things that are entirely impossible before.\"\n\nOpenAI showed off the new product and its various features during a Monday livestream with CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA screenshot of Sora's Explore page for browsing AI videos from the community. OpenAI\n\nSora includes an Explore page, a browsable feed of videos shared by the community. OpenAI also showed the various style presets available like pastel symmetry, film noir, and balloon world.\n\nRelated stories\n\nTo customize videos further, there's also Storyboard, which lets users organize and edit sequences on a timeline. The feature helps pull together text prompts that Sora then builds into scenes.\n\nThe company showed off Sora's features, including Storyboard. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nOpenAI previously made Sora available in February to a limited group of creators, including designers and filmmakers, to get feedback on the model.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company said in its blog post when it launched that the product \"may struggle to simulate the physics of a complex scene,\" and may not understand cause and effect. It may also mix up left from right and struggle to depict events that happen over time, the company said in its blog post.\n\nThe tool has already made a strong impression on some Hollywood members. Tyler Perry previously put his plans for an $800 million studio expansion on hold after seeing Sora. The billionaire entertainer referred to Sora demonstrations as \"shocking\" and said AI would likely reduce the need for large sets and traveling to locations for shoots.\n\nHowever, the tool's product designer clarified in the demonstration that Sora isn't going to create feature films at the click of a button. Flynn said the tool is more \"an extension of the creator who's behind it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you come into Sora with the expectation that you'll just be able to click a button and generate a feature film, I think you're coming in with the wrong expectation,\" Sora product designer Flynn said.\n\nThe team also briefly touched on safety issues. Sahai said during the presentation that OpenAI had a \"big target\" on its back, and the team wanted to prevent illegal activity while balancing creative expression with the new product.\n\n\"We're starting a little conservative and so if our moderation doesn't quite get it right, just give us that feedback,\" Sahai said. \"We'll be iterating.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI said Sora is rolling out to the public in the US and many other countries on Monday. However, Altman said it will be \"a while\" before the tool rolls out in the UK and most of Europe.\n\nChatGPT Plus subscribers who pay $20 monthly can get up to 50 generations per month of AI videos that are 5 seconds long with a resolution of 720p. ChatGPT Pro users who pay $200 a month get unlimited generations in the slow queue mode and 500 faster generations, Altman said in the demo. Pro users can generate up to 20-second long videos that are 1080p resolution, without watermarks.\n\nWhile non-paying users can't create Sora videos, they browse Sora's Explore feed, Altman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent YouTuber Marques Brownlee published what he described as the first-ever Sora review on Monday, telling his nearly 20 million subscribers that the results were both \"horrifying and inspiring.\"\n\nAfter a brief overview of Sora's strengths and weaknesses \u2014 the YouTuber said it can make provocative videos of cosmic events in deep space and other abstractions, but it struggles with realistic depictions of physics in day-to-day life, like a man running with a football \u2014 Brownlee was frank about his concerns.\n\nMillions of people can now use Sora for basically whatever they want. And while the program has decent guardrails, one can be circumvented, he said. The little watermark that Sora adds to the bottom-right corner of its videos can be cropped out, Brownlee said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And it's still an extremely powerful tool that directly moves us further into the era of not being able to believe anything you see online,\" he said, adding: \"This is a lot for humanity to digest right now.\""

            "article_content": "OpenAI launched its video-generating tool, Sora, on Monday. But the company\u2019s opting not to release a key feature for most users pending further testing.\n\nThe feature in question generates a video using an uploaded photo or footage of a real person as a reference. OpenAI says that it\u2019ll give a \u201csubset\u201d of Sora users access to it, but that it won\u2019t roll out the capability broadly until it has a chance to fine-tune its \u201capproach to safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability to generate a video using an uploaded photo or video of a real person as the \u2018seed\u2019 is a vector of potential misuse that we are taking a particularly incremental approach toward to learn from early patterns of use,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cEarly feedback from artists indicate that this is a powerful creative tool they value, but given the potential for abuse, we are not initially making it available to all users.\u201d\n\nOpenAI also won\u2019t let users share generated videos containing clips or images of real people to Sora\u2019s homepage discovery feed.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI, so we want to prevent illegal activity with Sora, but we also want to balance that with creative expression,\u201d Will Peebles, a member of OpenAI\u2019s technical staff and a research lead on Sora, said during a livestream presentation earlier today. \u201cWe know that [this will be] an ongoing challenge \u2014 we might not get it perfect on day one. We\u2019re starting a little conservative, and so if our moderation doesn\u2019t quite get it right, just give us that feedback.\u201d\n\nGenerative video is a powerful tool \u2014 and a controversial one, with deepfakes and misinformation being significant concerns. According to data from ID verification service Sumsub, deepfake fraud worldwide increased by more than 10 times from 2022 to 2023.\n\nAmong other steps OpenAI says it\u2019s taking to prevent misuse, Sora has a filter to detect whether a generated video depicts someone under the age of 18. If it does, OpenAI applies a \u201cstricter threshold\u201d for moderation related to sexual, violent, or self-harm content, the company claims.\n\nAll Sora-generated videos contain metadata to show their provenance \u2014 specifically metadata that abides by the C2PA technical standard. The metadata can be removed, granted. But OpenAI\u2019s pitching it as a way for platforms that support C2PA to quickly detect whether a video originated from Sora.\n\nIn a bid to fend off copyright complaints, OpenAI also says that it\u2019s using \u201cprompt re-writing\u201d to prevent Sora from generating videos in the style of a living creator.\n\n\u201cWe have added prompt re-writes that are designed to trigger when a user attempts to generate a video in the style of a living artist,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe opted to take a conservative approach with this version of Sora as we learn more about how Sora is used by the creative community \u2026 There is a very long tradition in creativity of building off of other artists\u2019 styles, but we appreciate that some creators may have concerns.\u201d\n\nA number of artists have sued AI companies, including OpenAI, over allegedly training on their works without permission to create AI tools that regurgitate content in their unique styles. The companies, for their parts, have claimed that fair use doctrine protects them from copyright infringement claims, and that AI models don\u2019t, in fact, regurgitate.\n\nAccording to video blogger Marcus Brownlee, who got an early preview of Sora, the system can create multiple variations of video clips from a text prompt or image and edit existing videos via a Re-mix tool. A Storyboard interface lets users create sequences of videos; a Blend tool takes two videos and creates a new one that preserves elements of both; and Loop and Re-cut options allow creators to further tweak and edit their videos and scenes.\n\nSubscribers to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Pro and Plus plans get access to Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, today \u2014 but only if they live in certain countries.\n\n"

Here are his thoughts on the AI video generator.\n\nMarques Brownlee got to use OpenAI's Sora before anyone else. Here are his thoughts on the AI video generator. Credit: Sora / OpenAI\n\nOne of the most highly-anticipated AI-related products has just arrived: OpenAI's AI video generator Sora launched on Monday as part of the company's 12 Days of OpenAI event.\n\nOpenAI has provided sneak peeks at Sora's output in the past. But, how different is it at launch? OpenAI has certainly been hard at work to update and improve its AI video generator in preparation for its public launch.\n\nYouTuber Marques Brownlee had a first look at Sora , releasing his video review of the latest OpenAI product hours before OpenAI even officially announced the launch. What did Brownlee think?\n\nWhat Sora is good at\n\nAccording to Brownlee, his Sora testing found that the AI video generator excels at creating landscapes. AI generated overhead, drone-like shots of nature or famous landscapes look just like real-life stock footage. Of course, as Brownlee points out, if you are specifically well-versed in how the surroundings of a landmark look, one might be able to spot the differences. However, there's not too much that looks distinctly AI-generated in these types of Sora-created clips.\n\nPerhaps the type of video Sora is best able to create, according to Brownlee, are abstract videos. Background or screensaver type abstract art can be made quite well by Sora even with specific instructions.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Words often show up as garbled text in other AI image and video generation models. With Sora, Brownlee found that as long as the text was specific, say a few words on title card, Sora was able to generate the visual with correct spelling.\n\nWhere Sora goes wrong\n\nSora, however, still presents many of the same problems that all AI video generators that came before it have struggled with.\n\nThe first thing Brownlee mentions is object permanence. Sora has issues with displaying, say, a specific object in an individual's hand throughout the runtime of the video. Sometimes the object will move or just suddenly disappear. Just like with AI text, Sora's AI video suffers from hallucinations.\n\nWhich brings Brownlee to Sora's biggest problem: Physics in general. Photorealistic video seems to be quite challenging for Sora because it can't just seem to get movement down right. A person simply walking will start slowing down or speeding up in unnatural ways. Body parts or objects will suddenly warp into something completely different at times as well.\n\nAnd, while Brownlee did mention those improvements with text, unless you are getting very specific, Sora still garbles the spelling of any sort of background text like you might see on buildings or street signs.\n\nSora is very much an ongoing work, as OpenAI shared during the launch. While it may offer a step up from other AI video generators, it's clear that there are just some areas where all AI video models are going to find challenging."

Styling as well as drying your hair, the device is the ideal way to get salon-perfect hair from home. Right now, there\u2019s 15% off the Shark FlexFusion range when you buy direct from Sharkclean.com. All you have to do is use the code FUSION15 any time between now and December 31. That means you could get a Shark FlexFusion from just $280 depending on the model you choose. Sounds good, right? Let\u2019s take a look at the range.\n\nWhy you should buy a Shark FlexFusion\n\nParticularly for anyone with thick hair, buying one of the best hair dryers is a huge game changer. However, it\u2019s an even bigger deal if you combine drying with styling components. Many people love the Dyson Corrale for this role but it isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s much more expensive than the Shark FlexFusion. Going with Shark means you can budget for an extra gift or simply enjoy a considerable saving.\n\nOne of the best options is the with Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush. Down to $280 from $330 when you apply the code FUSION15, you get the perfect all-in-one tool for drying, curling, volumizing, smoothing, or straightening. There\u2019s no risk of heat damage from styling and you can even dry and style wet hair. It also has a scalp shield for protecting your scalp, and it\u2019s developed by dermatologists so you\u2019re all good here.\n\nWhen buying, you can choose two accessories such as a FrizzFighter, Oval Burhs, or auto-wrapper. It\u2019s perfect for personalizing your gift choice for your loved one. If you want to spend more, you can do so by investing in more accessories, or by adding on an air straightener. It\u2019s great to have such flexibility here as it feels much more like picking an individual gift for someone rather than just choosing an out-of-the-box solution.\n\nThe Shark FlexFusion range is now available with 15% off when you use the code FUSION15 at Sharkclean.com. The code works until December 31 but we think it\u2019d be great to buy now to gift to someone ahead of the holidays. Check out which bundle works best for you by tapping the link below and don\u2019t forget to apply the code!"

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nStrange metallicity and superconductivity. Credit: Nature Physics (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s41567-024-02679-7\n\nA new study by Rice University physicist Qimiao Si unravels the enigmatic behaviors of quantum critical metals\u2014materials that defy conventional physics at low temperatures. Published in Nature Physics Dec. 9, the research examines quantum critical points (QCPs), where materials teeter on the edge between two distinct phases, such as magnetism and nonmagnetism. The findings illuminate the peculiarities of these metals and provide a deeper understanding of high-temperature superconductors, which conduct electricity without resistance at relatively high temperatures.\n\nKey to this study is quantum criticality, a delicate state where the material becomes ultrasensitive to quantum fluctuations\u2014microscopic disturbances that alter electron behavior. While ordinary metals obey well-established principles, quantum critical metals defy these norms, exhibiting strange and collective properties that have long puzzled scientists. Physicists call such systems \"strange metals.\"\n\n\"Our work dives into how quasiparticles lose their identity in strange metals at these quantum critical points, which leads to unique properties that defy traditional theories,\" said Si, the Harry C. and Olga K. Wiess Professor of Physics and Astronomy and director of Rice's Extreme Quantum Materials Alliance.\n\nQuasiparticles, representing the collective behavior of electrons acting like individual particles, play a crucial role in energy and information transfer in materials. However, at QCPs, these quasiparticles vanish in a phenomenon known as Kondo destruction. Here, magnetic moments in the material cease their usual interaction with electrons, dramatically transforming the metal's electronic structure.\n\nThis change is evident in the Fermi surface, a map of possible electron states within the material. As the system crosses the QCP, the Fermi surface abruptly shifts, significantly altering the material's properties.\n\nKondo destruction quantum criticality and large-to-small Fermi surface transformation. Credit: Nature Physics (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s41567-024-02679-7\n\nUniversal behavior across materials\n\nThe study extends beyond heavy fermion metals\u2014materials with unusually heavy electrons\u2014to include copper oxides and certain organic compounds. All of these strange metals exhibit behaviors that defy traditional Fermi liquid theory, a framework used to describe electron motion in most metals. Instead, their properties align with fundamental constants such as Planck's constant, governing the quantum relationship between energy and frequency.\n\nThe researchers identified a condition called dynamical Planckian scaling, where the temperature dependence of electronic properties mirrors universal phenomena like cosmic microwave background radiation and the radiation of the \"black body\" that approximates the behavior of stars. This discovery underscores a shared organizational pattern across various quantum critical materials, offering insights into creating advanced superconductors.\n\nBroader implications\n\nThe research implications extend to other quantum materials, including iron-based superconductors and those with intricate lattice structures. One example is CePdAl, a compound where the interplay of two competing forces\u2014the Kondo effect and RKKY interactions\u2014determines its electronic behavior. By studying these transitions, scientists hope to decode similar phenomena in other correlated materials, where complex interelectronic relationships dominate.\n\nObserving how these forces shape the material at QCPs could help scientists better understand transitions in other correlated materials or those with complex interelectronic relationships.\n\nThis research was co-authored by Haoyu Hu and Lei Chen from Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy, Extreme Quantum Materials Alliance and Smalley-Curl Institute.\n\nMore information: Haoyu Hu et al, Quantum critical metals and loss of quasiparticles, Nature Physics (2024).

On December 3, operators of the ship\u2019s Hercules ROV located four specimens of Palau nautilus (Nautilus belauensis) during the Nautilus Exploration Program\u2019s ongoing, 17-day survey in the Palau National Marine Sanctuary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s finally happened!\u201d one researcher exclaimed during the team\u2019s livestream on December 3rd, with another adding, \u201cA nautilus on Nautilus\u2014a dream come true.\u201d\n\nWhile the team recorded these particular examples swimming 220-to-375 meters (roughly 721-to-1,230 ft) below the Pacific Ocean\u2019s surface, the pelagic marine mollusk cephalopods can survive at depths approaching 2,500 feet. Their spiral-shelled bodies belong to one of Earth\u2019s oldest families of animals, with fossil records indicating the squid relatives have changed comparatively little even after nearly 500 million years. Unlike an octopus\u2019s eight tentacles, a nautilus features anywhere from 50 to over 90 appendages across digital, ocular, and reproductive classifications.

The high-definition cameras aboard the Hercules ROV allowed for detailed, lengthy looks at the animals in their natural habitat. As the organization\u2019s announcement explained, the Nautilus vessel isn\u2019t directly named for the cephalopods, but in honor of Captain Nemo\u2019s deepsea submersible in Jules Verne\u2019s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

According to the team, these relationships create circulation patterns that draw nutrient-heavy waters from deep in the ocean to the surface, which in turn fosters biological diversity in Palau\u2019s marine ecosystem. When not analyzing these dynamics, the team is also conducting seafloor mapping excursions inside the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, while ROV surveys will highlight \u201cbiologically and oceanographically significant sites around the Palauan Islands.\u201d"

(\u00a9 Alla - stock.adobe.com)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 When two of humanity\u2019s most powerful eyes on the cosmos agree something strange is happening, astronomers tend to pay attention. Now, the James Webb Space Telescope has backed up what Hubble has been telling us for years: the universe is expanding faster than our best physics can explain, and nobody knows why.\n\nScientists have long known that our universe is expanding, but exactly how fast it\u2019s growing is an ongoing and fascinating debate in the astronomy world. The expansion rate, known as the \u201cHubble constant,\u201d helps scientists map the universe\u2019s structure and understand its state billions of years after the Big Bang. This latest discovery suggests we may need to rethink our understanding of the universe itself.\n\n\u201cThe discrepancy between the observed expansion rate of the universe and the predictions of the standard model suggests that our understanding of the universe may be incomplete,\u201d says Nobel laureate and lead author Adam Riess, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University, in a statement. \u201cWith two NASA flagship telescopes now confirming each other\u2019s findings, we must take this problem very seriously\u2014it\u2019s a challenge but also an incredible opportunity to learn more about our universe.\u201d\n\nThis research, published in The Astrophysical Journal, builds on Riess\u2019 Nobel Prize-winning discovery that the universe\u2019s expansion is accelerating due to a mysterious \u201cdark energy\u201d that permeates the vast stretches of space between stars and galaxies. Think of this expanding universe like a loaf of raisin bread rising in the oven. As the dough expands, the raisins (representing galaxies) move farther apart from each other. While this force pushes galaxies apart, exactly how fast this is happening remains hotly debated.\n\nThis illustration depicts NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope \u2013 the largest, most powerful, and most complex space science telescope ever built \u2013 fully unfolded in space. (Credits: NASA/Adriana Manrique Gutierrez)\n\nFor over a decade, scientists have used two different methods to measure this expansion rate. One method looks at ancient light from the early universe, like examining a baby photo to understand how someone grew. The other method, using telescopes to observe nearby galaxies, looks at more recent cosmic events. These two methods give significantly different answers about how fast the universe is expanding \u2013 and not just slightly different.\n\nWhile theoretical models predict the universe should be expanding at about 67-68 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a unit of cosmic distance), telescope observations consistently show a faster rate of 70-76 kilometers per second per megaparsec, averaging around 73. This significant discrepancy is what scientists call the \u201cHubble tension.\u201d\n\nTo help resolve this mystery, researchers turned to the James Webb Space Telescope, the most powerful space observatory ever built. \u201cThe Webb data is like looking at the universe in high definition for the first time and really improves the signal-to-noise of the measurements,\u201d says Siyang Li, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University who worked on the study.\n\nWebb\u2019s super-sharp vision allowed it to examine these cosmic distances in unprecedented detail. The telescope looked at about one-third of the galaxies that Hubble had previously studied, using a nearby galaxy called NGC 4258 as a reference point \u2013 like using a well-known landmark to measure other distances.\n\nThe researchers used three different methods to measure these cosmic distances, each acting as an independent check on the others. First, they observed special pulsating stars called Cepheid variables, which astronomers consider the \u201cgold standard\u201d for measuring distances in space. These stars brighten and dim in a precise pattern that reveals their true brightness, making them reliable cosmic yardsticks. The team also looked at the brightest red giant stars in each galaxy and observed special carbon-rich stars, providing two additional ways to verify their measurements.\n\nDepiction of Hubble Telescope in bright outer space. Elements of this image furnished by NASA. (\u00a9 dimazel \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nWhen they combined all these observations, they found something remarkable: All three methods pointed to nearly identical results, with Webb\u2019s measurements matching Hubble\u2019s almost exactly. The differences between measurements were less than 2% \u2013 far smaller than the roughly 8-9% discrepancy that creates the Hubble tension.\n\nThis agreement might seem like a simple confirmation, but it actually deepens one of astronomy\u2019s biggest mysteries. Scientists now believe this discrepancy might point to missing pieces in our understanding of the cosmos. Recent research has revealed that mysterious components called dark matter and dark energy make up about 96% of the universe\u2019s content and drive its accelerated expansion. Yet even these exotic components don\u2019t fully explain the Hubble tension.\n\n\u201cOne possible explanation for the Hubble tension would be if there was something missing in our understanding of the early universe, such as a new component of matter\u2014early dark energy\u2014that gave the universe an unexpected kick after the big bang,\u201d explains Marc Kamionkowski, a Johns Hopkins cosmologist. \u201cAnd there are other ideas, like funny dark matter properties, exotic particles, changing electron mass, or primordial magnetic fields that may do the trick. Theorists have license to get pretty creative.\u201d\n\nWhether this cosmic puzzle leads us to discover new forms of energy, exotic particles, or completely novel physics, one thing is certain: the universe is expanding our understanding just as surely as it\u2019s expanding itself. And thanks to Webb and Hubble, we\u2019re along for the ride."

The upshot of that downfall: new scientific insights following over 20 years of painstaking work by researchers sorting through the spacecraft\u2019s contaminated remains.\n\nGenesis was loaded with delicate wafers that held precious samples of atoms and ions from puffs of solar wind that the probe accumulated while lingering at Lagrange Point 1, the spot in space where Earth\u2019s and the sun\u2019s gravity counteract one another. But Genesis \u2014 a Discovery-class spacecraft with a price tag of $264 million designed, built, tested and operated by Lockheed Martin \u2014 failed to deploy its parachutes due to an engineering error. The mishap was later tied to improper orientation of gravity-switch sensors that were to set off the capsule\u2019s parachute landing system. The resulting crash landing banged up the return capsule and shattered the collection wafers, corrupting the prized shipment of solar wind particles.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and scientists say they have clutched victory from the jaws of defeat. The researchers who have been meticulously cleaning and studying the fragments say they have been able to the samples to make new discoveries into the nature and impacts of solar wind that they plan to share Dec. 13 at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) being held Dec. 9 to 13 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCleaning and gleaning\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are finally getting to the point where we are starting to do the really interesting science,\u201d said Amy Jurewicz, a Genesis project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Now we\u2019re finding some really good stuff,\u201d Jurewicz told SpaceNews. The main message today, she said, is, \u201cYes, we had an accident. It didn\u2019t go as planned.

Credit: NASA\n\nAside from making sense of and cleaning the wreckage of the collection wafers, the process of piecing together valid scientific studies from Genesis involved comparing findings to data from other spacecraft observations, as well as data from additional instruments on Genesis \u2014 and studying the pieces with techniques and technology not yet developed when the spacecraft took off.\n\nFor one, there were a number of other instruments on Genesis, not just one big collector. Depending on how you count the busted-up solar wind collectors, there\u2019s between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces available for study, Jurewicz said, with specialists \u201cdonating their time to the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific work invested in a variety of collector materials allowed for several methods to make the same elemental or isotopic measurement. The bonus is that after the crash, some of the materials were more easily cleaned than others,\u201d Judith Allton, the Genesis sample curator at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told SpaceNews.\n\n\u201cThe payload design called for collector materials to be of a thickness unique to each solar wind regime captured. Thus, when collector pieces were dislodged and mixed together by the crash, the specific solar wind regime contained within each fragment is identified by measuring the thickness of the fragment,\u201d Allton said. \u201cThe 300 mirror-polished collectors looked so beautiful when the canister was closed in August 2000,\u201d she said, prior to the probe\u2019s sendoff a year later.\n\nThe team has also matched some Genesis findings against those of NASA\u2019s sun-observing Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, Jurewicz told SpaceNews. Launched in 1997, ACE produces space weather reports and keeps an eye on geomagnetic storms unleashed by the sun that can interrupt telecommunication services on Earth and harm astronauts in space.\n\nHaving \u201cmore than one shot\u201d at achieving a measurement proved beneficial, said Allton.\n\nMany people working on Genesis still feel a sense of camaraderie after all these years, Allton added, \u201cI suppose due to our common focus on salvaging the science.\u201d That sense of family and making a contribution may only happen on small missions like the Discovery Program missions, she added.\n\nResults and implications\n\nGenesis was designed to provide precise knowledge of the solar system initial isotopic and chemical compositions by returning solar matter for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the mission is perhaps best remembered by general audiences for the crash of the sample return capsule when the parachute failed to deploy,\u201d said Genesis Mission Science Team member and University of California, Los Angeles, researcher Kevin McKeegan. \u201cHowever, despite this setback, Genesis has accomplished all its major science goals and is continuing to achieve progress on secondary and tertiary tasks.\u201d\n\nMcKeegan observed in his AGU abstract that when it comes to the composition of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes in chondrite meteorites and inner solar system materials, \u201cwe now know that the standard model is grossly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned new things that have brought us to a new era of research, not just on solar wind, but space weathering and how things change due to the radiation damage,\u201d Jurewicz said. That information is useful in figuring out how the surface of the moon and asteroids are changed by solar bombardment, she added.\n\nGenesis samples are still available and remain useful to the research community. Given the cleaning alongside 20 years of advancements in scientific gear and techniques, \u201cthere is now a basis for people to look at the samples and move on from there,\u201d Jurewicz said. For instance, the work on Genesis offers the most precise solar data ever captured in space to aid cosmochemistry experts modeling solar system formation.\n\n\u201cGenesis occupied a special place in the history of robotic space exploration as the first mission to return to Earth from beyond the moon, and the first return in a series of robotic sample-return missions,\u201d said Roger Wiens, who runs the Wiens Planetary Spectroscopy Lab in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe mission will be remembered as coming from the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 era, and fortunately, its samples and science survived in spite of its low budget and its crash landing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery cosmochemistry class teaches\u201d about the spacecraft\u2019s discoveries."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s all gone from The Bronx now: the sizzle, the daily excellence, the at-bats conducted with flourishes of both art and science, those must-see moments watching a brilliant craftsman in the batter\u2019s box. Juan Soto left the Yankees Sunday to join the Mets for $765 million over 15 years, pending escalators, opt-outs and, perhaps, other fine print.\n\nFor the Yanks, it\u2019s gotta hurt. Heck, anyone who likes baseball should be sad that Soto and Aaron Judge will never be back-to-back in the same lineup again.\n\nBut the Yanks have little time to convalesce. Judge\u2019s prime is now. So is Gerrit Cole\u2019s. The Yankees were a World Series team last season, but their lineup just lost a generational hitter, plunging the club into what should be urgency mode. They must pivot and find reinforcements. If Soto was a splurge \u2013 they reportedly offered Soto $760 million over 16 years, a hefty bid \u2013 now they need to spread at least a big chunk of that money around to fill multiple holes.\n\nAnd they should start by going after Pete Alonso, the Mets\u2019 free agent. Is this leaning too much into \u201cnarrative?\u201d Maybe. But the Yankees need a first baseman and can you imagine the rockets someone with Alonso\u2019s thunder would launch at the bandbox known as Yankee Stadium? Alonso might as well switch sides of town \u2013 Soto, still only 26, will be the one breaking all the Mets\u2019 offense records over the next 15 years.\n\nSo put Alonso in pinstripes and let him and Judge \u2013 and Giancarlo Stanton \u2013 take turns hitting mammoth homers.\n\nTaking Alonso from the Mets is not without value, either, at least in the rivalry between fans. Those who love the Mets are trumpeting the Soto move as the moment their favorite team shed \u201clittle brother\u201d status and changed New York back into a Mets town. Remember the mid-1980s, when the brash bunch from Queens ran baseball here?\n\nNot exactly glory days for the Yankees.\n\nSo there is a lot at stake this Yankee winter. Their World Series drought remains alive, eating at their fan base and at those who walk the franchise\u2019s corridors of power. They have to determine whether Soto\u2019s departure is an isolated case or, perhaps, something deeper. Why did a player who thrived in The Bronx and enjoyed a run to the Fall Classic go elsewhere, especially if the money wasn\u2019t drastically different?\n\nThe fact that the Yankees were a known quantity for Soto seemed like an advantage for the Yankees, but it apparently ended up not moving the needle much. The lure of the pinstripes? Evidently not compelling enough to keep Soto at River Avenue and 161st Street.\n\nAug 21, 2024; Bronx, New York, USA; New York Yankees center fielder Aaron Judge (99) celebrates with right fielder Juan Soto (22) after hitting a two run home run in the third inning against the Cleveland Guardians at Yankee Stadium. / Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBut they must move on. There\u2019s plenty more on their roster to-do list.\n\nThey need either a second baseman or third baseman, depending on where they decide Jazz Chisholm fits best. They must rebuild the bullpen, recently such a big part of their pitching success. They have a full rotation, but is it good enough? Maybe they don\u2019t think so, because they\u2019ve reportedly had talks with both Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, the two biggest starters remaining on the free-agent market, and they\u2019ve been linked to young White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade front.\n\nWithout Soto, their lineup looks thin. There\u2019s other power still available on the free-agent market beyond Alonso \u2013 Anthony Santander hit 44 home runs for the Orioles last year. That\u2019s 10 more than Alonso and three more than Soto. Christian Walker, another possibility for first base, is available, as is Teoscar Hernandez, who played for the Dodger team that smoked the Yanks in the World Series.\n\nMaybe a trade for Cody Bellinger of the Cubs is worth pursuing. Bellinger, whose father, Clay, played for the Yanks at the tail end of their last dynasty, could man center field \u2013 Judge would shift back to right \u2013 or even first base.\n\nEven as they ache over Soto\u2019s departure, there are plenty of ways the Yanks can fortify this winter. Maybe spreading around some of that Soto money to bolster multiple spots is their ticket back to the World Series. If they make the right moves.\n\nAlonso could be one of them. It would make for great theater, at least. What if the Yanks did get back to the World Series, helped by someone they took from the Mets?\n\nWhose town would it be then?"

            "article_content": "Key Takeaways Probabilistic Thinking: Though it does not come naturally, seeing the world through the lens of probability helps us achieve positive outcomes in an uncertain world.\n\nMindset Shift: Embracing probabilistic approaches allows teams to manage uncertainty and control risk, rather than relying on flawed cause-and-effect assumptions.\n\nSystem Design: Developing adaptive systems that can adjust how we work to changing conditions is more effective than creating exhaustive upfront plans.\n\nBeyond Planning: By appreciating systems, thinking in bets, and focussing on outcomes, we can move past the need for detailed plans.\n\nControlling Volatility: Leaders can use various methods to make safe bets in a controlled environment, while responding and reacting to new developments as they emerge\n\nSoftware delivery at a very large scale is extremely complex. We are not just pulling stories from a backlog in a scrum of scrums; we coordinate the collective effort of hundreds or even thousands of engineers across dozens of teams and multiple organizations to deliver a single, integrated system. These are globally distributed products and services built by the world\u2019s largest companies and provided to the most demanding customers. With so many moving parts, each requirement, team, integration, and interaction point becomes a nexus of possible failure modes. The question looms in such a complex environment: How can we turn the odds in our favor when faced with complexity so vast that failures are inevitable? Surprisingly, the answer may lie in the strategies employed in an unlikely place - Las Vegas.\n\nGames of Chance\n\nIn 1960, MIT mathematician Edward Thorp visited Las Vegas with a skeptic\u2019s eye. He noticed other players were deluded by the potential for finding betting patterns that could give them an edge on the felt. In his autobiography A Man for All Markets, he wrote, \"Mathematicians had proved no system of varying bets could blunt the casino\u2019s edge. Generations of gamblers had been seeking the impossible. Players are confused about the inevitability of losing in the long term\". This failure to grasp the mathematical futility of their pursuit reveals a fundamental human bias.\n\nThe logic of probability defies our natural intuition. We live in a world of apparent cause-and-effect relationships - touch the stove, you get burned. This daily experience of determinism and certainty shapes our thinking, creating a cognitive trap when encountering complex, probabilistic systems. We instinctively search for deterministic patterns where none exist, making incorrect associations that obscure the true statistical relationships beneath the surface.\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\nYet our hero Thorp was no foolish gambler. His mathematical training told him there might be a way to bend the rules - not by finding misguided patterns, but by understanding the deep structure of the underlying probability of the game. While others failed with betting systems, Thorp saw something hidden underneath Blackjack: a dynamic system where the probability landscape shifted with each card played. Armed with a crucial advantage - a computer - he began a multi-year mission to map the odds of the game. Using an IBM 704, he methodically calculated the odds for millions of card combinations, analyzing how removing each card altered the probability space.\n\nThe result was revolutionary: a system for navigating the probability curve. Thorp could track how the odds shifted between dealer and player by keeping a running count of played cards. When low cards were depleted, leaving a deck rich in high cards, the odds turned in the player\u2019s favor - signaling when to increase bets. His 1962 book Beat The Dealer revealed this system to the world, spawning the famous MIT Blackjack Team and embedding card counting in popular culture. More importantly, it demonstrated how systematic thinking about probability could transform uncertainty from an obstacle into an opportunity.\n\nPlanning in Software\n\nFast forward to today, and our world is defined by computers. In very large software delivery projects, we\u2019re tackling incredibly complex problems using vast teams, aiming to deliver high-value outcomes on a global scale. The intuition here is precisely what you would expect from us, mere humans, the same humans that misunderstand probability - we apply a system of management based on causality. With this, we fall into the trap of classical logic: the idea that we can precisely lay out a path and then follow it correctly over many months and even years. Somehow, this seems to make sense. Fictional, though it may be, the story we tell feels real.\n\nTo that end, we have tried to apply the same management systems designed for delivering real-world outcomes - factories, bridges, skyscrapers - to software. These approaches suit the physical world and its classical mechanics, trying to create predictability through determinism. They operate from the premise that work can be exhaustively described, so the focus is on centralized planning, tracking, and reporting.\n\nBut plans like these need to be correct to be successful - they make big bets on a series of events that need to succeed. And when they don\u2019t? The belief that we can press the system into submission is also supported by the conventional wisdom of determinism, which argues that we can throw people, money, and more planning at the problem to eventually emerge with something that works. Unfortunately, the premise is flawed, and the plan will continue to execute exactly as it should: into failure. Since this kind of significant up-front correctness is not something we can count on in software, we have seen these approaches consistently fail.\n\nIn software, we don\u2019t get predictability through causality. Large batches, risk-aversion, phased process, over-planning, big bang deliveries - these are the mistakes we make when we try to wrestle certainty from the hand of randomness. Rather than be like the misguided gambler, we must resist the pull of deterministic thinking.\n\nBeat the Odds\n\nJust as Thorp used probabilistic thinking and system design to beat the odds in blackjack, software development teams can improve delivery outcomes by adopting probabilistic approaches and designing adaptive systems that manage uncertainty and control volatility. With this mindset, we can move beyond traditional planning methods and develop systems that guide us through complexity and uncertainty, much like Thorp did at the blackjack table.\n\nThorpe\u2019s Blackjack system is a fantastic example of thinking in probabilities to create a system that achieves consistent outcomes in a non-deterministic way. Using a card counting system won\u2019t win you every hand, but you will consistently walk away a winner over many hours. We cannot predict what will happen throughout the play; no chart shows when the winning starts and the losing stops. Instead, the player focuses on the system, using it to read the table, adapting the play to the changing odds, and creating the circumstances for long-term success within persistent uncertainty. As long as the player is using the system correctly and doesn\u2019t get distracted by everything happening around them, they will achieve success.\n\nWhat Thorpe managed to do is control volatility over time. In probability theory, volatility is the amount of variance we see in a system over time. The more volatile a system is, the more extensive the range of outcomes we expect. By reducing bets when the odds are bad and increasing them when the odds are good, card counting uses a boundary condition on the probability curve to detect when volatility increases and when it reduces. In other words, we restrict our actions when we are in the danger zone and open them up when the surface area of positive outcomes increases. This idea that volatility is a fixed system element and that we are merely subject to its whims is perhaps a common intellectual fallacy. With card counting, Thorp found a way to play with the risk curve and capitalize on its changes over time. And so can we.\n\nBeat the Plan\n\nIn enterprise software delivery, we, too, are trying to win a long series of bets. We play from a deck of visions, missions, roadmaps, priorities, and many small decisions as we try to harness the potential of an uncertain world. Thorp faced the volatility of card distributions and used a statistical system to gain an edge. Likewise, in software, we face volatility in project requirements, implementation details, customer expectations, and market directions, but just as Thorpe used his card counting system, we can use our systems to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nWe create systems to guide us through a series of events over a long period, allowing us to exceed the limitations in our ability to plan work. To do better than a plan - to beat the plan - we need systems. Where plans might fail us, systems can save us. How might we use thinking in probabilities to design better systems? I see three key areas:\n\nWe need to have an appreciation for systems, a phrase I am borrowing from W. Edwards Deming\u2019s System of Profound Knowledge. Effective systems will protect us from the probability of failures. It is our systems that give us the edge. Systems like quality frameworks, continuous integration, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems guide our decision-making. They are designed to enable us to make decisions safely while providing feedback to help us understand our risk and adjust accordingly. We want to elevate our perspective by looking at the network of components that work together, considering the relationships and interactions between different parts of a system and other systems and external factors. This is where probabilistic thinking becomes effective.\n\nThe next idea is to embrace a concept explored by former World Series poker player Annie Duke in her book Thinking in Bets. She defines a bet as a \"decision about an uncertain future\", and what\u2019s crucial to understand is that correct decisions don\u2019t guarantee a result. Every poker player knows the \"bad beat\", where a well-played hand loses due to sheer luck. To that end, Annie notes that the world\u2019s greatest poker players spend an unusual amount of time analyzing their decision-making process to understand whether they correctly applied their system, regardless of whether they win or lose. This wisdom is incredibly poignant to us in software, where we first need to view our decisions as bets and, second, place more value on reflecting on how we place them. We leave many parts of our work as tacit knowledge and only do retrospectives at a system level when things go wrong. We can build more resilient organizations by surfacing implicit systems and regularly examining how well we follow them rather than just reacting to successes and failures.\n\nOver time, what matters isn\u2019t individual decisions but our ability to achieve successful outcomes through consistent system-following behavior. Just as the card sharp doesn\u2019t need to win every hand to walk away ahead, a well-designed software delivery system should absorb the impact of failed experiments and wrong turns while keeping us moving toward our goals. Individual decisions - whether to refactor a service, which technology to adopt, how to structure a team, or which feature to build - may be right or wrong, but the wisdom of probability tells us the cumulative outcome matters. This is why the above two points are crucial: they help us understand whether we succeeded or failed and whether our systems are effectively guiding us toward desired outcomes despite inevitable setbacks. By setting our targets on outcomes rather than individual decisions, we create space for controlled experimentation and learning, allowing our systems to evolve and improve even as they keep us on track.\n\nThese three principles - systems thinking, betting mindset, and outcomes focus - reframe how we should approach planning in software delivery. Rather than creating perfect plans, we need to build systems that can guide us through uncertainty. A plan may tell us where we want to go, but our systems determine whether we\u2019ll get there. This brings us to the crucial question: How do we design systems that can navigate the complexities of large-scale software delivery while managing the inevitable volatility we\u2019ll encounter along the way?\n\nPlan the System\n\nWe can transform software delivery uncertainty into predictable outcomes just as Thorp transformed gambling uncertainty into a calculable advantage. But where Thorp dealt with the relatively constrained world of card probabilities, we face a far more complex challenge. Our deck contains countless variables with hidden interactions and long histories that come together and fall apart in different ways. Team dynamics, technical dependencies, market changes, customer needs, and organizational issues all interact and influence each other in ways that frustrate traditional planning methods. How might we leverage systems of software delivery to control this volatility?\n\nThe key lies in establishing boundaries that control volatility while maintaining the flexibility to adapt. Through years of experience and evolution, I\u2019ve identified five critical elements that work together to create such systems:\n\nAgility - decoupling predictability from causality\n\nContinuous Methods - using continuous methods to solve discrete problems\n\nPrioritization - working on areas with the highest volatility first\n\nConstraints - imposing enabling restrictions and limitations\n\nCulture - promoting healthy values and behaviors\n\nAll of these come together to help us design and execute systems that manage our bets and drive us toward targeted outcomes. Let\u2019s dig into each area.\n\n1. Agility - The first thing we need to do is decouple predictability from causality. We can achieve predictable outcomes without knowing all the details, creating paths that do not create much risk. Where Thorp managed the volatility of his game by adjusting bets according to his card counting system, in software development, we can manage project volatility by working in short cycles and adjusting in light of what our systems of work are telling us. We use these systems to take our \"count\", take it more often, assess our situation, and make small bets that succeed or fail without creating excessive risk. For example, we can reallocate resources to high-priority or high-risk areas as the project evolves or adjust requirements based on our learning. Agile, DevOps, and Lean methodologies form a system that gives us a regular \"read\" of the table, one we use to recalibrate where needed to land inside the range of desired outcomes eventually, which is why they are so effective for us. With this in mind, you don\u2019t need to cargo cult (imitation without understanding) practices into your organization - you can evaluate them in this light.\n\n2. Continuous Methods - The third element is continuous practices. We reduce the risk of our short-term decisions by situating them in systems of overarching engineering practices. This is the domain of Lean, where we convert discrete events into continuous practices so that each bet is placed under the same conditions. TDD, CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, Automated Governance, etc. Just as Thorpe updated his card count with every hand, we run our own operations with every iteration, perhaps with every code commit, ensuring that playing a hand does not change our risk assessment equation. If we allow failing tests, security issues, defects, and the like to build up, we will no longer play our hands under the same conditions. With creative thinking, we can find ways to convert all discrete elements of software delivery into continuous functions in our engineering systems.\n\n3. Prioritization - Next, how can we get an \"unfair\" advantage in our work? By stacking the deck! This is one area where we diverge from the gambler - we get to cheat. We can choose how we structure, scope, and sequence our work to create the least amount of risk for ourselves, prioritizing the work according to where the most volatility lies. For example, integrations always present a high degree of risk, but if we focus on them first, we can continuously integrate subsystem changes throughout the delivery process. This means we get to play the game knowing that the bad cards have already been dealt! Further, prioritization should be implemented as a continuous system, not as a big upfront plan. As we progress through our work, we gain insight into whether the rest of the deck is stacked for or against us and continuously re-evaluate our position. To achieve this, we need to involve the experts closest to the problem in the feedback loops of our work delivery systems. Having a generic, common-sense understanding of how the world works is not enough. We need the representation of technical experts with deep knowledge to guide difficult decisions and develop creative solutions that achieve an optimal balance of risk and reward.\n\n4. Constraints - The fourth element is the role of constraints, as in when and how to apply constraints to achieve better outcomes from the system. This differs from classical/deterministic systems, where the constraints are imposed upon the system from outside (the cost of materials, the laws of physics, etc.), and the system operates against them. In synthetic/non-deterministic systems, constraints are imposed; they are system elements we can experiment with, adding and removing as we evolve to get the right mixture of velocity and quality. We deliberately introduce helpful governing and enabling constraints into the system to contend with volatility. In Blackjack, Thorpe had only a few quantitatively defined boundary conditions to guide his system, but in software organizations, we have a wide variety of these boundaries with which to play. For example, we can introduce technical constraints, scheduling constraints, organizational constraints, resourcing constraints, and more. We can use these to create forces that will shape the direction of our work, implementing them in a wide variety of ways with various degrees of strictness.\n\n5. Culture - Finally, we have the values and behaviors that form our culture. Thorpe\u2019s card-counting system requires commitment, focus, and discipline to succeed. In the same way, we need cultural norms that will shape and guide participants\u2019 behavior in our systems. To compensate for the uncertainty and knowledge gaps from building complex distributed systems, we must promote values like learning, transparency, citizenship, and shared responsibility. And for us, like Thorpe, we need the discipline and commitment to follow the systems we put in place. A key goal is to motivate people to make decisions that are best for the overall system, not for themselves, because it is, in fact, the system that brings people success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe logic of probability is not readily forthcoming - our intuition does not give up on what we know well: a world of cause-and-effect relationships, reproducible and mechanical, in which one thing always leads to another. Touch the stove, and you get burned. The conditioning of classical logic in our daily lives creates a trap when we move into the world of probabilities. We are prone to making incorrect associations and false inferences that betray the underlying statistical relationships.\n\nThe journey from the casino floors of Las Vegas to the server rooms of Silicon Valley may seem a long one, but the underlying principles remain the same. Thorp showed us that by understanding volatility and designing systems to manage it, we can consistently win in a game designed for us to lose. By learning to \"count cards\" in our field - to read the shifting probabilities and adjust our strategies accordingly - we can turn the tables in our favor.\n\nThe key to mastering software development at scale lies not in our ability to predict the future but in our capacity to play with uncertainty. When we embrace the probabilistic nature of our work, we can unlock levels of efficiency and predictability that have eluded us. The question that concerns us is not how to make better plans but how to design systems that beat the plan, thrive, and even capitalize on uncertainty. This mindset shift will be one of the most crucial skills in the fascinating endeavor of large-scale software delivery."

However, these advancements also come with significant risks. The rapid growth of AI technology has raised concerns about privacy, job displacement, and the potential misuse of AI systems in surveillance and defense.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Push into Defense Raises Concerns Among Employees\n\nOpenAI is teaming up with Anduril Industries to enhance anti-drone systems using its AI technology, as per Bloomberg. This partnership aims to improve the detection and response to unmanned aerial threats. OpenAI is also expanding its role in the defense sector, including collaborations with the U.S. Air Force and hiring former Pentagon officials. The deal reflects the growing U.S.-China competition in military AI development, with Anduril seeing it as vital for addressing global air defense gaps. The partnership also signals increasing AI involvement in defense, following similar moves by other tech companies.\n\nHowever, OpenAI employees have raised concerns about the company\u2019s partnership with Anduril Industries, seeking more transparency from leadership. Internal messages viewed by The Washington Post revealed worries that the AI technology could be used beyond defensive applications against drone attacks, potentially targeting human-piloted aircraft or being deployed for other military purposes. Some employees expressed discomfort with collaborating with a weapons manufacturer, fearing damage to OpenAI\u2019s reputation. Others noted that even defensive uses of AI could contribute to its militarization, drawing parallels to the fictional Skynet system from The Terminator, which was originally designed for defense.\n\nApart from OpenAI, there are several other startups that are working in the military and defense sectors. One of them includes DEFCON AI, a company focused on next-generation modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) for military logistics. The company focuses on creating efficient, reliable systems that help address disruptions in logistics and supply chains, ensuring timely delivery of personnel, equipment, and cargo during critical situations.\n\nIts approach combines AI-driven intelligent agents and advanced modeling to help leaders test and prepare for contested logistics scenarios. In August, DEFCON raised $44 million in seed funding. The round was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Fifth Growth Fund and Red Cell Partners. With its strong leadership team, including retired military officials, the company is set to address the growing need for intelligent military technology in the face of increasing global competition.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

That has made the app a central information battlefield in the war. In some cases, Ukrainian and Russian drone pilots use Telegram groups to taunt each other and share videos of attacks.\n\nUkraine\u2019s concerns about Telegram parallel rising global scrutiny of the platform, which is approaching one billion users. Once seen as a haven for activists and those living under authoritarian governments, the app has angered governments as it has become a hub of illicit and extremist material. Pavel Durov, Telegram\u2019s founder, was arrested in France in August on charges related to the company\u2019s failure to address criminal activity on the platform.\n\nFor Ukraine, distancing itself from Telegram will not be easy. Roughly 70 percent of Ukrainians use Telegram as a main source of news, according to a recent survey commissioned in part by the U.S. government. When air raid sirens wail and missiles descend on Ukrainian cities, people flock to Telegram groups for real-time updates. The government broadcasts official announcements and gathers intelligence inside Russian-occupied territories through the app."

Russian state media later reported that Assad and his family had fled to Moscow.\n\nCrowds gathered in Damascus to celebrate the fall of Assad's government with chants, prayers and occasional gunfire, marking the end of a regime that, between the ousted president and his father, had ruled over Syria for half of a century.\n\n\"At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,\" President Biden said Sunday afternoon at the White House after convening his national security team to discuss the developments. He said the fall of Assad presented an \"historic moment of opportunity,\" and pledged support for Syria and its neighbors against any threats.\n\nLocal residents gather on a street in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana on Dec. 8, 2024, after Syrian rebels said that President Bashar Assad had fled the country. LOUAI BESHARA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSyrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said early Sunday that he'd remained in Damascus and the government was ready to \"extend its hand\" to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government, The Associated Press reported.\n\nWhat happened in Syria's civil war?\n\nThe war in Syria began in 2011 when a pro-democracy uprising calling for the end of Assad's long reign escalated quickly into a brutal civil war. Since then, the conflict has claimed more than 500,000 lives and displaced some 12 million people from their homes across the country.\n\nAfter a decade of brutal conflict, the war largely stalled after the Assad regime regained control over many major cities \u2014 with vital support from Russia and Iran, in addition to the powerful Iranian proxy group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Some northern and eastern areas of the country remained under the control of Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed rebel groups.\n\nBut in late November, rebel forces in the northwest launched a shock offensive, led largely by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Shams (HTS). HTS has tried for a number of years to publicly distance itself from its jihadist roots as a regional branch of al Qaeda. With other conflicts currently occupying Assad's backers Iran, Russia and Hezbollah, the rebel forces are believed to have seen an opportunity to renew their fight against his army.\n\nThe leader of HTS told CNN in a recent interview that the goal of the offensive was to remove Assad from power.\n\n\"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime,\" Abu Mohammad al-Golani told CNN. \"The seeds of the regime's defeat have always been within it\u2026 the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up. But the truth remains: this regime is dead.\"\n\nHow was the Assad regime toppled so quickly?\n\n\"Clearly HTS's military and political skills, honed over four years in rebel-held Idlib since the last ceasefire, have been a major factor in their successes. But the weakness of Assad's forces has been the other side of the story,\" Christopher Phillips, an associate fellow with the Chatham's House think tank's Middle East program, said in an analysis.\n\nPhillips said international factors played a significant role in Assad's inability to maintain power, including Assad's closest allies being weakened or otherwise occupied, but he said there were also a number of important domestic factors.\n\n\"Assad has been complacent. His military has melted away because it is deeply demoralized. Assad has focused on winning international recognition rather than consolidating his 'victory' in the civil war at home,\" Phillips said. \"There has been no peace dividend for those who stayed loyal during the war, or for those former rebel areas that opted to reconcile rather than fight the regime. Instead, regime corruption and continuing sanctions, not to mention the regime's characteristic brutality, has meant life for Syrians living under Assad has been grim. In retrospect, it is unsurprising then that, after HTS' advances in the north, former rebellious parts of Homs, the Houran and Damascus rejoined the rebel cause this week, ultimately hastening the regime's collapse.\"\n\nU.S. and Israel carry out strikes in Syria\n\nThe United States has around 900 soldiers on the ground in Syria. The U.S. forces have operated in the country for years as part of the American effort to support the Kurdish-led forces, and to combat the ISIS extremists who seized control of a huge part of Syria and neigboring Iraq in the years after the war began.\n\nThe U.S. said it carried out airstrikes against ISIS operatives and camps on Sunday, hitting 75 targets.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told journalists during a visit to Japan on Sunday that as the situation in Syria unfolds, \"there's a potential that elements in the area, such as ISIS, to try to take advantage of this, this opportunity, and regain capability.\"\n\nAustin said the U.S. was \"still evaluating the results\" of the strikes but that he believed they were successful in the goal \"to keep the pressure on ISIS and to deny them the ability to easily resurge.\"\n\nIsrael also carried out airstrikes Sunday in Syria, hitting sites linked to Syrian state forces and Iran, the Reuters news agency reported. Israel has moved tanks into a demilitarized zone along the country's border with Syria, but the Israeli military said it intended to remain out of any conflict there, calling the move a bid to prevent any possible spill-over of fighting into Israel, according to Reuters.\n\ncontributed to this report."

            "article_content": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's top electric vehicle maker BYD gained market share as the world's largest auto market recorded its fastest-growing month in 2024, setting BYD up to exceed its global annual sales goal and overtake Ford and Honda.\n\nBYD has been on an extraordinary expansion this year, growing capacity and undertaking a massive hiring spree to turbocharge revenue that surpassed EV leader Tesla in the third quarter.\n\nAided by robust sales in China, BYD is on course to top its annual sales target of 4 million vehicles, which would put it ahead of Japan's Honda and Detroit-based Ford for 2024.\n\nThe Chinese electric vehicle giant delivered 3.76 million vehicles in the first 11 months this year including 506,804 units sold in November.\n\nBolstered by strong sales led by a competitive lineup of models with its latest plug-in hybrid technology, BYD gained ground over rivals as China's car sales grew in November at their fastest from a year earlier since January, thanks to government-subsidised auto trade-ins.\n\nThe number of subsidised car trade-ins totalled more than 4 million as of Nov. 18, according to official data. Without such trade-ins, year-to-date car sales may have contracted versus a 4.4% increase for the January-November period, according to Reuters analysis based on industry numbers.\n\nAs of last month, BYD's share of the Chinese auto market, which makes up more than 90% of its total sales, stood at 17.1%, up from 12.5% in 2023, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).\n\nIn comparison, Volkswagen's two joint ventures with SAIC and FAW Group took a combined 11% market share in the January-November period, compared with 14.2% last year.\n\nIf that sales momentum continues, BYD could sell more than 6 million units in the next 12 months, which would put it on par with the world's leading automaker groups such as General Motors and Stellantis, according to Reuters estimates based on the automakers' existing sales.\n\nThe Chinese firm aims to deliver 5 million to 6 million cars in 2025, Citi analysts said in a recent note after a meeting with the automaker's management.\n\nBYD did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDuring August to October, the automaker added nearly 200,000 units in production capacity and hired 200,000 workers for auto and parts manufacturing, an executive said in November.\n\nThe total number of BYD employees was close to one million as of September, up from around 703,500 at the end of 2023.\n\nIts efforts to boost scale have helped it outpace rivals in growth, better control costs and win a brutal price war in China that has squeezed many foreign automakers. BYD has also asked dozens of its suppliers for price cuts, according to a recent state-owned media report.\n\nIn the latest sign of foreign car makers' deepening woes in China, GM said last week it would take more than $5 billion in charges on its China operation due to restructuring and the declining value of its joint venture, which has suffered losses and decreasing sales.\n\n(Reporting by Zhang Yan, Qiaoyi Li and Brenda Goh; Editing by Miyoung Kim, Lincoln Feast and Tom Hogue)"

            "article_content": "The economy in rural America starts and stops with the American farmer.\n\nAmid the deafening noise inside political echo chambers and ceaseless squabbling of Congress is one truth that we cannot ignore- we are a nation united in reliance on our farmers.\n\nWithout the American farmer, there is no adequate tax base for our school systems, local municipalities, or any services that rural Americans need to live and prosper in this country.\n\nEverybody eats, and we all need the food and fiber that our farmers produce to live. No one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of food, just like no one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of energy. Right now, our farmers need our help.\n\nHurricane Helene caused a devastating blow to Georgia's No. 1 industry, with over $6.4 billion in agricultural economic loss alone.\n\nIf we fail to provide agriculture-specific appropriations to help our farmers before the end of the year, we will see widespread, lasting economic loss across all of rural southeast America, especially in Georgia.\n\nAs I traveled across Georgia's 8th Congressional District in the immediate aftermath of Helene, I saw the devastation to our farms firsthand. From hundreds of demolished poultry houses and cotton fields in Coffee County to decimated pecan orchards in Berrien and Lowndes counties and vegetable rows and fruit bushes in ruins across Clinch County, it is clear that our farmers need immediate assistance.\n\nCongress cannot stop a hurricane, but we can fix the unnatural disasters that our farmers face to aid their recovery.\n\nHouse Agriculture Chairman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, R-Pa., Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., visited Georgia's 8th District with me recently to survey the damage after Helene across south Georgia and north Florida. Our farmers need help, and I appreciate the chairman and others taking the time to meet with them firsthand so we can better work together for relief.\n\nUnfortunately, trouble for our nation's farmers began far before Hurricane Helene. Since the last farm bill was passed in 2018, our farmers and nation have experienced excessively challenging events that have changed the political landscape in which we need to navigate to properly support the best stewards of our land.\n\nRelated Articles Opinion: The dire state of the American farm economy\n\nWith rising input costs, including the increased cost of labor, diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed, farming is more expensive than it has ever been in our country.\n\nGeorgia's farmers were also horribly impacted by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which caused more than $2.5 billion in losses to the state's agriculture industry. It took approximately 24 months for our farmers to get relief after Hurricane Michael, and I can assure you that the majority of producers and rural communities that Helene hit cannot survive another 24 months without something being done.\n\nAmerica's farmers are also suffering from the unnaturally disastrous policies of the Biden-Harris administration, which have contributed to record inflation and the rising cost of energy and food production.\n\nThere has to be a strong safety net to keep good farmers farming through bad years like this one. If you are an American who eats, you should deeply care about the passage of a comprehensive farm bill that prioritizes production agriculture.\n\nEarlier this year, the House Agriculture Committee passed the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (the farm bill). This legislation includes critical updates to reference prices and several of my priorities to ensure a strong farm safety net by expanding crop insurance options to specialty crops, all of which would greatly assist producers in times of natural disaster.\n\nHowever, this bill is stalled in Congress, and the Senate Democrats just released a half-baked last-minute \"farm bill\" just to look like they did something, further fueling the fear of the forgotten farmer as they struggle to feed us.\n\nWhen the American farmer stops farming, rural communities collapse because their core and main economic driver is gone. We need to give farmers the support they need to keep farming with the confidence to know they are not forgotten.\n\nIt is my hope that Congress passes both the Farm, Food, and National Security Act and an agriculture-specific disaster relief appropriations package before the end of the year so that our farmers can continue feeding our nation and supporting our rural communities.\n\nRepublican Rep. Austin Scott represents the 8th District of Georgia and is a member of the House Agriculture Committee."

From the sound of their fury, they could be there for a long while. (Thoughts and prayers.)\n\nWith Democrats now irrelevant, the second Trump administration has four years to take a wrecking ball to the Washington establishment, including deep cuts to federal spending and an overhaul of the bloated bureaucracy.\n\nTo understand why the wrecking ball is needed, look at the annual budget deficit \u2212 $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. In a time of relative peace and prosperity, the deficit grew 8% in one year, even though federal revenue increased by 11%. In other words, the Biden-Harris administration collected significantly more money from taxpayers in the last fiscal year but still managed to blow up the deficit by an additional $138 billion. That's simply unsustainable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter President-elect Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMusk operates at another level, building the most valuable automaker in the world in Tesla and the most important entity (public or private) in space travel and satellite communications with SpaceX.\n\nCan Musk succeed where Obama's Simpson-Bowles failed?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump joins SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to view the launching of the aerospace company's Starship rocket on Nov. 19, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nIf Musk and Ramaswamy are able to accomplish even a portion of what they envision \u2212 cutting $2 trillion in government spending \u2012 it could provide a remarkable boost for our economy.\n\n\"They're going to need inside Washington budget experts like ex-Capitol Hill staffers and the like,\" Chris Edwards, a Cato Institute economist who specializes in government spending, told me. \"People (who) used to be on the budget committees on Capitol Hill and used to work for the (Office of Management and Budget). They're going to need those sorts of people to tell them exactly how and what they can cut.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to cut government spending. In 2010, President Barack Obama created the Simpson-Bowles commission to recommend budget cuts that would trim the deficit over a 10-year period.\n\nThe commission's recommendations failed to gain traction in Congress. In fact, the federal government has added about $16 trillion to the national debt since Simpson-Bowles was created. So there's reason for cynicism. Trump and Congress will need to actually cut the programs Musk and Ramaswamy recommend, even if the president needs to use his veto power to do it.\n\nOpinion: Trump can fix what Biden broke. But he needs to seize the moment and stay on task.\n\nEdwards said Republicans need to be serious about deficit reduction starting next year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"(Republicans) need to at least show deficits kind of on a downward path,\" the Cato economist told me. \"They don't have to do a massive spending cut next year, but they've got to show financial markets and the Federal Reserve that the deficits are on a downward path.\"\n\nIt's a misconception that the executive branch doesn't play an important role in how the economy functions. The massive federal deficit helps fuel inflation. And as Edwards noted, \"The deficits and debt are so large now we're in uncharted financial territory for this country.\"\n\nDOGE should cut this department first\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy endorses former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign in Atkinson, N.H., on Jan. 16, 2024.\n\nThe Cato economist said DOGE could start to deliver better efficiency by initially focusing on a popular but underperforming section of the budget. A proposal to target federal spending on K-12 education might seem radical, but it also would signal that Musk and Ramaswamy are serious.\n\n\"K-12 schools is easily the biggest and most attractive opportunity for Trump and his team to cut,\" Edwards said. \"George W. Bush made a big show of signing the No Child Left Behind legislation ... and greatly increased federal subsidies and federal intrusion into the schools. That obviously failed. Test scores are down. I think today's Republican Party has completely changed on education. ... There's been the huge success of school choice.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion: Voters strongly rebuke Democrats by electing Trump. But will progressives listen?\n\nI second Edwards' suggestion.\n\nWhile public schools are necessary, more and more spending hasn't led to better results.\n\nThe Department of Education's budget for this fiscal year is almost $80 billion \u2012 nearly $10 billion more than the enacted budget only five years ago.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

            "article_content": "After Valve got a lot of PC gamers excited about gaming handhelds with its popular Steam Deck, the company appears to be working with third-party manufacturers on a comeback of Steam machines. The timing seems right now that SteamOS, Valve\u2019s Linux-based OS is a much better alternative to Windows when it comes to ease of use and game compatibility.\n\nYou may remember that back in 2015, Valve got Alienware and other manufacturers to release a couple of Steam machines for the living room. Valve even released its own Steam controller for these console-like devices, but these first Steam machines were probably ahead of their time. Indeed, that was before Valve started to invest in the Proton compatibility layer that made the most popular Windows games run seamlessly on SteamOS.\n\nWindows Intelligence In Your Inbox Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday \u2014 and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! \"*\" indicates required fields Email * Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. \u0394\n\nOver the summer, Valve confirmed to The Verge that it was working to make SteamOS compatible with third-party gaming handhelds such as the Asus ROG Ally. The latter ships with Windows 11, which is great for gamers who want to use PC Game Pass or install other game launchers like Gog or the Epic Games Store. However, Windows 11 isn\u2019t optimized for running on devices with a 7-inch display like the ROG Ally. It also doesn\u2019t help that Asus and other manufacturers of Windows-based gaming handhelds are all building custom overlays that aren\u2019t easy to use and may sometimes clash with Windows features.\n\nOver the weekend, The Verge published a detailed roundup of all the things Valve appears to be working on right now to grow the SteamOS ecosystem. That includes a new Steam controller and what could be a new living room Steam box codenamed \u201cFremont.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the company also updated a Brand guidelines document that includes the new \u201cPowered by SteamOS\u201d logo you can see at the top of this article. The document says this logo will be used \u201cfor hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.\u201d\n\nIf Valve\u2019s Steam Deck proved that there was an appetite for gaming handhelds providing seamless access to Steam games, Valve could significantly grow the SteamOS ecosystem with the help of third-party manufacturers. Unlike Windows, SteamOS is free, and it\u2019s optimized for gaming handhelds and the living room experience. Moreover, gamers don\u2019t need to pay a subscription like Xbox Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus to play the Steam version of multiplayer games.\n\nAs of today, Valve is making SteamOS free to install for anyone, though the installation process is quite technical and the OS only supports a certain set of hardware. However, this new \u201cPowered by SteamOS logo\u201d suggests that may soon see third-party devices shipping with SteamOS out of the box. Whether that includes both gaming handhelds and console-like devices for the living room remains to be seen, however."

But now, in an unexpected and puzzling move, the company is issuing instructions for installing Windows 11 on incompatible PCs.\n\nYou can find those official instructions on this support page. However, Microsoft begins the instructions with a direct warning:\n\n\u201cInstalling Windows 11 on a device that doesn\u2019t meet Windows 11 minimum system requirements isn\u2019t recommended. If Windows 11 is installed on ineligible hardware, you should be comfortable assuming the risk of running into compatibility issues.\u201d\n\nThe risk alluded to here includes system crashes and the lack of crucial security updates that would otherwise keep the PC safe and protected against malware, hackers, and scammers.\n\nTherefore, anyone wishing to install Windows 11 like this must first accept the following disclaimer:\n\n\u201cThis PC doesn\u2019t meet the minimum system requirements for running Windows 11 \u2014 these requirements help ensure a more reliable and higher quality experience. Installing Windows 11 on this PC is not recommended and may result in compatibility issues. If you proceed with installing Windows 11, your PC will no longer be supported and won\u2019t be entitled to receive updates. Damages to your PC due to lack of compatibility aren\u2019t covered under the manufacturer warranty. By selecting Accept, you are acknowledging that you read and understand this statement.\u201d\n\nInstalling Windows 11 on incompatible PCs\n\nWith Windows 11, Microsoft\u2019s chief requirement is the availability of a TPM 2.0 chip. We previously explained what a TPM is, and we also wrote about how you might not actually need to buy a TPM for Windows 11. But in most cases, you did need TPM 2.0 for Windows 11.\n\nGet Windows 11 Pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro Price When Reviewed: 199.99 Best Prices Today:\n\nUntil now. Users can now upgrade directly to Windows 11 even without the needed hardware. Microsoft doesn\u2019t explain the actual \u201cupgrading to Windows 11\u201d steps in the document, but we assume it\u2019s done via the Windows Update app and the PC Health Check app.\n\nAfter installing Windows 11, if your device doesn\u2019t meet the requirements, you\u2019ll see a watermark added to the desktop and you\u2019ll see a notification in the Settings app. These can only be removed with registry tweaks.\n\nCan I go back to Windows 10 afterwards?\n\nFor anyone who updates to Windows 11 despite not meeting the requirements, Microsoft offers the opportunity to return to Windows 10. However, this is only possible for 10 days after upgrading.\n\nThe option to revert can be found in Settings under System > Recovery > Recovery options. The step-by-step process will then take you back to Windows 10. However, you should create a backup before upgrading to be on the safe side in case something goes wrong."

Whishaw, meanwhile, plays Sam, an assassin sent to protect her.\n\nIt\u2019s been a massive hit since its released, shooting to the top of Netflix\u2019s charts in a busy period, beating out The Madness, The Pembrokeshire Murders, and A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter.\n\nAdvert\n\nAlready renewed for a second season before the show even came out, more Black Doves is on the way, but what inspired the show?\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the show\u2019s creator Joe Barton revealed a bizarre real-life discovery which he says inspired part of the plot.\n\nKeira Knightley in Black Doves (Netflix)\n\nAccording to Barton, he was inspired to write Black Doves after reading a newspaper advice column in which a widow discovered that her husband had had another wife, and their relationship was an affair.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe went on to say: \u201cShe was struggling with the fact that this man she loved had passed away, but she couldn\u2019t tell anyone or share her grief.\n\n\u201cShe felt she had to grieve in private, which is a fascinating and human emotional problem.\u201d\n\nAnyone who\u2019s watched the show will immediately see what that inspired, but if you didn\u2019t and for some reason are still watching, here is a massive spoiler warning.\n\nIf you read beyond this point and think to yell at me for spoiling it for you, don\u2019t .\n\nThe first episode reveals that, as well as engaging in a semi-fake marriage with a Government Minister to trade insider secrets, Knightleys\u2019s Helen was also engaging in an affair.\n\nAdvert\n\nHer affair with Andrew Koji\u2019s Jason is abruptly ended when he is murdered a mere three and a half minutes into the first episode.\n\nBarton also said of the Christmas-set spy thriller\u2019s inspiration in an interview with Variety: \u201cI just love stuff set at Christmas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Christmas film fan, also big [on] Christmas telly.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe\u2014life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy\u2014or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \"self-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\" That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter\u2014daily or weekly.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution is the process of change in systems. It can describe how a group of something becomes more complex \u2013 or even just different \u2013 over time.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe\u2014biological or not\u2014to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules\u2014at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it\u2014for life as we don't know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

In a research paper published on Monday in the science journal Nature, Google said its machine had surpassed the \u201cerror correction threshold,\u201d a milestone that scientists have been working toward for decades.\n\nThat means quantum computers are on a path to a moment, still well into the future, when they can overcome their mistakes and perform calculations that could accelerate the progress of drug discovery.

It performs these calculations by processing \u201cbits\u201d of information. Each bit holds either a 1 or a 0.\n\nBut a quantum computer defies common sense.

VinFuture's award criteria reflect this commitment to recognizing research with real-world applications.\n\nProfessor Richard Henry Friend emphasized that the VinFuture Prize continues to affirm its rightful mission and vision: honoring works that improve the lives of billions of people. Photo: VinFuture.\n\nHANOI, VIETNAM - Media OutReach Newswire \u2013 9 December 2024 - Prof. Richard Friend, Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge (UK), Chair of the VinFuture Prize Council, expressed his enthusiasm for this year's groundbreaking awards. He noted that the annual VinFuture Prize continues to surprise with its innovative selections.This year, he was particularly impressed by the Main Prize, which recognized a \"power trio\" in the field of Artificial Intelligence: Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun for their foundational mathematical and algorithmic work; Fei-Fei Li for her pioneering dataset; and Jensen Huang for his hardware breakthroughs. \"All of those three components brought together have made possible this astonishing AI revolution,\" he said.On December 6, 2024, the VinFuture Foundation recognized four groundbreaking scientific achievements. The US$3 million Grand Prize was awarded for transformative contributions to deep learning. Additionally, three Special Prizes honored innovations in oral cholera vaccination, polymeric biomaterials, and CAR T-cell therapy.Selected from nearly 1,500 nominations across 80+ countries, the four winning works represent the pinnacle of scientific innovation. These breakthroughs exemplify the \"resilient rebound\" spirit, demonstrating the potential to revolutionize various fields and shape a brighter future.Prof. Friend was deeply inspired by the groundbreaking achievements recognized by the Special Prizes. The revolutionary CAR-T therapy offers a beacon of hope for countless cancer patients. Dr. Firdausi Qadri's lifesaving cholera vaccine for Rohingya refugees exemplifies the power of science to address real-world challenges. And Prof. Kristi Anseth's pioneering research in biomaterials bridges the gap between laboratory innovation and clinical application.Prof. Friend highlighted that these remarkable works share a common purpose: enhancing the human condition. This aligns perfectly with VinFuture's mission to recognize and reward scientific breakthroughs that benefit humanity.Mr. Friend also highlighted the importance of diverse perspectives in scientific research. He noted that the unique experiences and approaches of scientists have led to remarkable breakthroughs. VinFuture's commitment to recognizing diverse talent reflects its belief in the power of different viewpoints to drive innovation.\"They have seen something that others have not, or they have had the perseverance to know that it is worth sticking with the journey. It is the collection of stories that is what we should celebrate. I believe it is the diversity in approaches and thinking among scientists that has led to the extraordinary breakthroughs we are witnessing,\" he shared.This year's VinFuture Prize celebrates a diverse range of innovators, from academic researchers to industry leaders like the CEO of NVIDIA. This recognition underscores the interconnectedness of fundamental research and technological application. The AI revolution, a testament to this synergy, has been propelled by advancements in mathematics, algorithms, datasets, and hardware. VinFuture's mission is to honor the full spectrum of contributions that drive scientific and technological progress.When academic research and industrial development converge, the potential for groundbreaking innovation is limitless. As Prof. Friend observed, \" Only when scientists and businesses collaborate can we create truly meaningful breakthroughs for humanity.\"This year's honored research is making significant strides in addressing humanity's most pressing challenges. In the healthcare sector, a paradigm shift is underway, moving from treatment to prevention. Preventive interventions offer a cost-effective and sustainable approach to improving public health. Prof. Friend emphasized the transformative potential of CAR-T cell therapy, a groundbreaking treatment that has revolutionized cancer care.\"In cancer treatment, we're seeing a historic turning point. Despite decades of understanding cancer, we haven't found truly effective treatments until now. CAR-T cell therapy has changed that, ushering in a new era of cancer treatment with promising results,\" said Prof. Friend.According to Prof. Friend, after decades of promise, AI has finally made significant breakthroughs. Discussions at the scientific conference revealed that while the achievements are impressive, they are only the beginning. Pioneering scientists in this field modestly acknowledge that there is much more to explore and develop.\"This year, I'm particularly proud to share that the VinFuture Prize has once again demonstrated its ability to recognize groundbreaking research with global impact. Before the Nobel Prizes were announced, we honored Professor Geoffrey Hinton, who subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to AI,\" said Professor Friend.In fact, VinFuture has a proven track record of identifying future Nobel Prize winners. Two years ago, VinFuture honored Demis Hassabis and John Jumper from Google DeepMind for their revolutionary work in protein structure modeling. Their recent Nobel Prize in Chemistry validates its commitment to recognizing groundbreaking research.Hashtag: #VinFuture\n\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement."
