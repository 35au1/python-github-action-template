With a simple reverse image search, Elizondo's fellow UFO hunter John Greenewald, Jr. traced it to its source: a Facebook group called \"Mysterious Ancient Discoveries.\"\n\nWhat's more, Greenewald suggested, per findings from another debunked viral UFO photo, that the \"mothership\" in the whistleblower's photo may well have been a chandelier.\n\nInstead of being angry at the revelation that his mothership was more mundane than met the eye, Elizondo lauded the teamwork it took to debunk his claim.\n\n\"Looks like we can put this one bed,\" he wrote. \"Excellent work to whoever solved this one and a big thank you! Crowdsourcing works.\"\n\n\"Now let\u2019s see,\" Elizondo continued, \"if together we can figure out the rest.\"\n\nWe've gotta hand it to him: for someone who's made some outrageous claims, including his recent insistence that there was a secret government program meant to \"trap\" alien tech,\" Elizondo's humility is welcome.\n\nMore on UFOs: Pentagon Officials Stumped by Mysterious Drones Haunting Military Base for Weeks"

The agency that reviews all of the new incidents being reported by military personnel and now additional federal agencies is the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\nFrom May 2023 to June 2024, AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 that occurred in that time period and another 272 reports from 2021 and 2022 that had not been previously sent to the agency. That's a sizable increase from previous reports, for example, last year's report cited 281 new reports during its review period, something Pentagon officials said Thursday was due to a greater awareness about reporting UAP incidents, not that they have been growing in frequency.\n\nThe Pentagon and the surrounding area is seen in this aerial view in Washington, D.C., Jan. 26, 2020. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP, FILE\n\nOverall the total number of cases that have been reviewed by AARO since its founding is now 1,652.\n\nAARO has \"discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology\" according to this year's report. A small number of this year's reports had terrestrial explanations and a significant number will be left for further review, but one thing they haven't found is that some of the reports are attributable to a \"breakthrough\" technology.\n\nHowever, during a press briefing Thursday, the head of AARO acknowledged that there are 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can't really explain.\n\n\"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the I.C. I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them,\" said Dr. Jon Kosloski, the new director of AARO. Kosloski said the 21 incidents occurred near national security sites and were recorded on video, had multiple eyewitnesses or were captured by other sensors.\n\nSo what do these unexplainable UAPs look like? \"Orbs, cylinders, triangles, in one of the cases, it has been happening over an extended period of time, and it is possible that there's multiple things happening\" Kosloski said, adding that the incidents might include drone activity that's being conflated with a UAP."

        "article_content": "iPhone users in some markets discovered a standalone Google Gemini app for iPhone a few days ago. The app wasn\u2019t available in most markets, as Google was apparently testing it ahead of a more widespread release. Fast-forward to Thursday, Google is ready to make the standalone Gemini app available to iPhone users around the world. The Gemini went up in the App Store quietly, and you can download it right now.\n\nThe Google Gemini app is now available as a separate app from the main Google app, where you might have accessed the Gemini AI on the iPhone in the past. The best part about the Gemini app is that it comes with support for Gemini Live, Google\u2019s version of ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nIt\u2019s a conversational AI that lets you talk to the chatbot just like you\u2019re speaking to a human. You can interrupt the AI and change prompts on the fly, similar to how a conversation between two people would flow.\n\nGemini Live isn\u2019t available in the main Google app on the iPhone, so Google\u2019s new standalone Gemini app is the only way to get it on your iPhone.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nGoogle Live will support personalization, as you can choose from various voices and languages.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone is available in the App Store. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nYou can use Gemini Live to talk about anything, just as you would with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode. Here\u2019s what the Gemini app description says Gemini can do for you on the iPhone:\n\nGo Live with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, simplify complex topics, and rehearse for important moments. Just click on the Gemini Live button in your Gemini app \u2013 Connect with your favorite Google apps like Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more \u2013 Study smarter and explore any topic with interactive visuals and real-world examples \u2013 Unlock a world of expertise and get tailored information about any topic \u2013 Plan trips better and faster \u2013 Create AI-generated images in seconds \u2013 Get summaries, deep dives, and source links, all in one place \u2013 Brainstorm new ideas, or improve existing ones\n\nFor example, Gemini Live can be a study companion, ready to assist you while you learn.\n\nThe Gemini app for iPhone also supports image generation, just like ChatGPT does.\n\nMore interesting to me is the Gemini\u2019s app integration with other Google apps and services you might be using on iPhone. The description says the Gemini app will connect with your favorite Google apps once you install it.\n\nGemini can connect to YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Calendar, and other apps straight from your chat. That\u2019s certainly a useful feature if you use Google apps on your iPhone and want to include Gemini in that. This sort of interaction goes beyond what ChatGPT can do, and it\u2019s all the more interesting as Google doesn\u2019t have any say in how iOS works.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone: Features and screenshots. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nAlso, Gemini isn\u2019t part of Apple Intelligence like ChatGPT will be. Even then, ChatGPT will not be able to connect to any other apps. Siri will handle such capabilities later down the road.\n\nGoogle Gemini is available as a free download from the App Store. If you want access to Google\u2019s latest Gemini models, you\u2019ll need a Gemini Advanced subscription priced at $19.99. You can test Gemini Advanced for free for a month before you decide to keep it."

Researchers used an improved scale to analyze responses from over 3,000 participants, revealing that traditional beliefs may reflect anxieties about external control.\n\nThe findings highlight the psychological differences between belief types but cannot confirm cause-and-effect relationships. Future research could explore how paranormal beliefs shape behaviors, such as attitudes toward alternative medicine and conspiracy theories.\n\nKey Facts:\n\nTraditional paranormal beliefs were associated with greater stress and reduced coping ability.\n\nNew age beliefs were not linked to stress or coping tendencies.\n\nThe study highlights the psychological impacts of external control perceptions in traditional beliefs.\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nIn a new study, feelings of distress and reduced ability to cope with stress were associated with traditional paranormal beliefs, but not with new age philosophy. Kenneth Drinkwater Ph.D. of Manchester Metropolitan University, U.K., and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on November 13, 2024.\n\nPrior research has suggested that paranormal belief, in general, is not linked to poorer psychological wellbeing, but that certain facets of paranormal belief, such as superstition, may be linked with stress vulnerability.\n\nHowever, much of this research relies on a questionnaire known as the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, which has statistical issues that limit its usefulness.\n\nA different version, known as the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, aims to improve on the earlier scale. To help deepen understanding of potential links between paranormal belief and stress, Drinkwater and colleagues had 3,084 people complete this scale alongside a questionnaire evaluating different facets of perceived stress.\n\nA key feature of the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is that it differentiates between two dimensions of belief: first, traditional paranormal belief, which deals with cultural concepts of traditional religious belief and witchcraft, and second, new age philosophy, dealing with individual paranormal abilities known as psi, spiritualism, and precognition.\n\nAnalysis of the study participants\u2019 responses revealed that people who scored higher for traditional paranormal belief tended to show elevated distress and reduced feelings of being able to cope with stress.\n\nHowever, belief in new age philosophy was not statistically linked to any tendencies regarding distress or coping.\n\nThese findings are in line with the idea that traditional paranormal belief reflects anxiety about a lack of control over external forces that influence one\u2019s existence. However, the authors note that this study was exploratory and does not support any cause-effect relationship.\n\nMore research will be needed to clarify the relationship between paranormal belief and stress. The authors suggest that such research is important because paranormal belief can influence people\u2019s everyday behavior and attitudes, such as those regarding alternative medicine, antivaccination, and conspiracies.\n\nThe authors add: \u201cFindings support the notion that traditional paranormal belief is associated with external control, specifically the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence.\n\n\u201cHowever, additional research is still needed if we are to further explore these fascinating relationships in connection to perceived stress, wellbeing and coping styles.\u201d\n\nAbout this neurotheology and stress research news\n\nAuthor: Hanna Abdallah\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nContact: Hanna Abdallah \u2013 PLOS\n\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\u201d by Kenneth Drinkwater et al. PLOS ONE\n\nAbstract\n\nRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\n\nRecent research indicates that paranormal belief, in the absence of allied cognitive-perceptual and psychopathology-related factors, is not associated with negative wellbeing outcomes. However, investigators have historically reported relationships between specific facets of belief (e.g., superstition) and stress vulnerability.\n\nThese typically derive from the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS), which has questionable psychometric integrity. The main issue being that several RPBS items perform poorly.\n\nNoting this, the present paper re-examined the relationship between paranormal belief and stress using the Rasch purified version of the RPBS. This comprises two dimensions, called Traditional Paranormal Belief (TPB) and New Age Philosophy (NAP). These are operationalised in terms of function. Specifically, whether belief provides a sense of control at the social (TPB) or individual level (NAP).\n\nAccordingly, this study examined whether TPB and NAP were differentially predictive of levels of perceived stress. In this context, stress served as an indicator of well-being. A sample of 3084 participants (Mage = 50.31, SD = 15.20, range 18\u201391) completed the RPBS alongside the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10).\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling revealed that TPB was significantly predictive of higher Distress, and lower Coping. NAP was neither predictive of Distress nor Coping.\n\nThese findings support the notion that TPB is attendant with external control, particularly the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence."

        "article_content": "Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Scientists said on Thursday they found what is believed to be the world's largest coral, which has been growing undisturbed in the Solomon Islands for possibly 300 years.\n\nA research vessel with the National Geographic Pristine Seas team found the coral in the Three Sisters Island group. The coral measured 112 feet wide, 105 feet long and 18 feet high with a circumference of more than 600 feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Just when you think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" Enric Sala, National Geographic Explorer in Residence and founder of Pristine Seas, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a significant scientific discovery, like finding the world's tallest tree. But there is cause for alarm. Despite its remote location, this coral is not safe from global warming and other human threats.\"\n\nCoral is a living organism made up of a complex network of coral polyps, tiny individual creatures. Coral reefs, however, are made up of many colonies of corals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists said the newly discovered coral is so large that it can be seen from space and looks more like a huge rock lurking just under the ocean. The discovery comes as concerns continue over dying coral reefs around the world because of climate change.\n\n\"The ocean provides for our livelihoods and has contributed so much to our national economy and communities,\" Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele, told National Geographic. \"Our survival depends on healthy coral reefs, so this exciting discovery underlines the importance of protecting and sustaining them for future generations.\""
