            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "He has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansjurgen Kohler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (Cenap), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says Kohler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office Cenap.\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" Kohler says.\n\nAccording to its director, Cenap has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, Kohler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines). Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa\n\nConspiracy theorists\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, Kohler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

The reflections are wrong, and the size of the craft changes sizes.\"\n\nAI is only becoming better when it comes to generating images, to the point that in some cases a non-trained eye could easily fall for its authenticity, leading to false news and other legal issues, like the spaceship video in question.\n\nJust recently, a picture of a Temu warehouse in China catching fire went viral across social media only to find out that it was created using X's Grok AI tool. Fact-checking website Snopes launched an investigation into the matter due to the Temu logo looking inauthentic compared to its official lettering and icons."

In his article \u201cThings we learned about LLMs in 2024,\u201d he simultaneously susses out how much happened in 2024 and why it\u2019s confusing. For example, we\u2019re all told to aggressively use genAI or risk falling behind, but we\u2019re awash in AI-generated \u201cslop\u201d that no one really wants to read. He also points out that LLMs, although marketed as the easy path to AI riches for all who master them, are actually \u201cchainsaws disguised as kitchen knives.\u201d He explains that \u201cthey look deceptively simple to use \u2026 but in reality you need a huge depth of both understanding and experience to make the most of them and avoid their many pitfalls.\u201d\n\nIf anything, this quagmire got worse in 2024. Incredibly smart people are building incredibly sophisticated systems that leave most developers incredibly frustrated by how to use them effectively. \u201cThe default LLM chat UI is like taking brand-new computer users,\u201d Willison argues, \u201cdropping them into a Linux terminal and expecting them to figure it all out.\u201d It\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s getting worse, not better.\n\nSmall wonder that the biggest AI flops of 2024, as captured by MIT Technology Review, largely relate to our collective inability to turn AI into applications that normal people want to use. Even basic things, like Apple\u2019s attempt to summarize my incoming text messages, are more confusing than useful. Some of this stems from the inability to trust AI to deliver consistent results, but much of it derives from the fact that we keep loading developers up with AI primitives (similar to cloud primitives like storage, networking, and compute) that force them to do the heavy lifting of turning those foundational building blocks into applications."

The group intends to invest this money into datacenter development, AI training, and improvement of its cloud-based and AI applications throughout the year.\n\nMicrosoft announced its plans for AI investment in 2025 in a blog post on the Microsoft website from President and Vice Chair Brad Smith. There, Smith laid out Microsoft\u2019s plans and priorities for this investment, including which specific areas in which the money is planned to be spent.\n\nIn FY 2025, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world. More than half of this total investment will be in the United States, reflecting our commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy.\n\nMicrosoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith shared details about the massive investment the company is making into AI and where the money will go.\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only one going whole-hog on AI investment in 2025. As shared by The Register, Amazon also previously signaled it was set to spend around $75 billion in capital expenditure during the entirety of 2024, with more spending coming in 2025.\n\n\"The majority of it is for AWS and, specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by generative AI,\" CEO Andy Jassy said on the matter.\n\nWith so much spending going into generative AI and various related technologies and applications, it looks like some of the biggest companies in the world are continuing to go all-in on the trend. As we wait to see where this leads, stay tuned for more updates on Microsoft and other AI-focused companies in 2025."

            "article_content": "AI\u2019s double-edged sword for job seekers\n\nFor job seekers, AI tools have significantly altered how they approach applications, from crafting CVs to interview preparation. With platforms like GPT-4 maker OpenAI offering polished text at the click of a button, the application process has become faster and more accessible.\n\nYet, these same advancements have also heightened competition, creating a new challenge: how to stand out amid a growing \u2018sea of sameness\u2019 in AI-generated applications.\n\nAI tools are undeniably effective at helping candidates get the basics right. A tailored CV can pass through an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that companies use to streamline the recruitment process by automatically screening job applications and resumes. Additionally, auto-generated cover letters can be crafted to align perfectly with job descriptions.\n\nThese tools are particularly beneficial for candidates at the beginning of their careers or those unfamiliar with the conventions of job applications. However, over-reliance on AI often creates generic and impersonal submissions. Hiring managers regularly tell us that such applications are polished but ultimately lack the individuality and personality that make a candidate memorable. Job applicants must ensure that their CV not only passes ATS scanning but also stands out to human reviewers, especially as many applications tend to look alike.\n\nThe efficiency of AI has also lowered the barrier to entry for job applications, enabling people to apply for jobs with minimal effort, leading to a major surge in application volumes, especially at the lower rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\nIn the UK, employers received an average of 140 applications per role for graduate training schemes in 2024 \u2013 a staggering 59% jump from 2023, according to the Institute of Student Employers.\n\nHowever, this ease of application has paradoxically created a more challenging environment for candidates. With employers now inundated with hundreds \u2013 sometimes thousands \u2013 of applications per position, simply meeting basic criteria is no longer enough.\n\nAnother concern is the risk of misrepresentation. Some candidates lean too heavily on AI, exaggerating qualifications or presenting an overly polished image. This can lead to uncomfortable mismatches later in the hiring process, especially during interviews, where authenticity and depth of experience become critical."

            "article_content": "Ranking All 10 Entries of the 50th MMFF\n\nCEBU, Philippines \u2014 The ten entries of the 50th Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) remind moviegoers that cinema is not just about entertainment, it\u2019s about telling stories that reflect the pressing issues of our times -- a fitting takeaway from the festival\u2019s golden anniversary.\n\nFrom the struggles of a soldier grappling with PTSD, an OFW discovering her family\u2019s misuse of her hard-earned remittances, and the tensions between two families over their patriarch, to the bold reimagination of a Philippines untouched by colonization, these films serve as cultural time capsules that capture the essence of what the Philippines was thinking in 2024.\n\nWhile all these entries have cinematic value and strong relevance, some stand out more than others based on the execution of their concepts. Here\u2019s our ranking of all ten MMFF films from least to best:\n\n10. Topakk\n\nPTSD is a central theme in \u201cTopakk\u201d, as Arjo Atayde\u2019s character, a former soldier confronting his trauma, helps Julia Montes flee a brutal drug cartel. Unfortunately, the thinly written script squanders the potential to make its characters engaging on the big screen.\n\nThe ensemble cast, led by Atayde, Montes, and Sid Lucero, shows clear dedication to their meticulously executed action choreography. However, this effort is undermined by distant camerawork that fails to engage with the intensity of the gritty action.\n\nWhile \u201cTopakk\u201d is a welcome revival of the Philippine action genre, its lack of engaging characters and questionably shot action scenes leaves it as a missed opportunity of what could\u2019ve been a compelling story of mental health in an action backdrop. Two stars out of five.\n\n9. Hold Me Close\n\nProcessing trauma and learning that avoiding pain does more harm than good is what makes the chemistry between Julia Barretto and Carlo Aquino shine in \u201cHold Me Close\u201d, an odd yet intriguing tale of larger-than-life Filipinos in Japan.\n\nThe unusual plot, which has Barretto\u2019s character Lynlyn able to feel if someone can bring them joy or harm by touch, may alienate some viewers, and a lack of precise explanation of why the leads are in Japan leaves questions unanswered.\n\nBut the film\u2019s thoughtful exploration of its themes makes it worth the watch for patient viewers who want something lighthearted. Three stars out of five.\n\n8. Espantaho\n\nTwo feuding families, bound by the legacy of a late patriarch with a looming supernatural entity on the loose, form the core of \u201cEspantaho\u201d, which would have fared better as a family drama with paranormal elements rather than a straight-up horror.\n\nWhile the scares fall flat, the compelling performances of Judy Ann Santos, Lorna Tolentino, and Chanda Romero stand out, as do the themes of family conflict and land disputes, making this a quintessential MMFF entry. Just don\u2019t expect to be spooked as its jump scares barely make an impact. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n7. My Future You\n\n\u201cMy Future You\u201d surprises with its substance, weaving real-life tragedies like a 1990s boat-sinking accident and Typhoon Ondoy into its narrative. These events shape the characters played by Francine Diaz and Seth Fedelin, who portray star-crossed lovers separated by a 15-year time gap as they learn that these events happen for a reason.\n\nThe infectious chemistry of FranSeth makes this a strong film debut for the love team, enhancing the story's charm and quirks. However, the significant age gap between the characters risks venturing into uncomfortable territory. Despite this, the film\u2019s heartfelt moments make it an endearing watch. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n6. Strange Frequencies: Taiwan Killer Hospital\n\nThe found footage genre may feel oversaturated, but \u201cStrange Frequencies: Taiwan Killier Hospital\u201d revitalizes its appeal, in ways that \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d once showcased by delivering a genuinely chilling experience.\n\nWith realistic performances from Jane De Leon, Alexa Miro, and Enrique Gil, the film is elevated by its timely critique of the dangers of \u201cclout-chasing\u201d for social media engagement. This underrated MMFF gem effectively combines horror with sharp social commentary, leaving viewers on edge in Black Mirror-like fashion. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n5. Isang Himala\n\n\u201cIsang Himala\u201d could have benefited from a tighter pace in its second act, but its character-driven journey of a regular woman-turned-messianic figure in a poor town captivates with operatic musical numbers that expose the emotional truths of each character.\n\nFeaturing live-recorded performances by an ensemble cast led by Aicelle Santos, the film modernizes the timeless 1982 classic starring Nora Aunor that powerfully reminds viewers that miracles come from within us, and that blind faith and cult-like deviation have consequences. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n4. Uninvited\n\nDrawing inspiration from a 1990s rape-torture-murder case of two college students where a former mayor was found guilty as the mastermind, \u201cUninvited\u201d offers a scathing critique of the unchecked power of the elite and their crimes.\n\nOut of the star-studded cast, which doubles down the film\u2019s opulent appeal, three performances shine the brightest: Aga Muhlach delivers a chilling turn as the evil billionaire Gilly; Vilma Santos offers a humanistic portrayal of Eva, a grieving mother consumed by revenge; and Gabby Padilla adds emotional depth as her late daughter, whose tragic fate anchors the narrative.\n\nWhile the film could\u2019ve developed its concept further, \u201cUninvited\u201d still delivers a satisfying revenge narrative of a mother taking justice into her own hands Four stars out of five.\n\n3. The Kingdom\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom\u201d delivers on its ambitious premise, imagining an alternate Philippines called Kalayaan which was never colonized.\n\nVic Sotto stars as the nation\u2019s monarch, Lakan Makisig, alongside his children Dayang Matimyas (Christine Reyes), Dayang Lualhati (Sue Ramirez), and Magat Bagwis (Sid Lucero) \u2014 all vying as potential heirs to the throne.\n\nFar from a utopia, Kalayaan mirrors the real-life Philippines\u2019 struggles with poverty and corruption. These societal issues are explored through the lens of Piolo Pascual\u2019s character, Sulo, whose perspective challenges Lualhati to broaden her worldview.\n\nWith detailed world-building and insightful execution of its political landscape, \u201cThe Kingdom\u201d captivates as an epic that has the potential to expand as a franchise. Four stars out of five.\n\n2. And the Breadwinner Is\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd the Breadwinner Is\u2026\u201d is Vice Ganda\u2019s most grounded and mature work to date. While it retains the comedian\u2019s signature comedic flair from past films, it also leans heavily into heartfelt drama reminiscent of 2016\u2019s \u201cDie Beautiful\u201d, also helmed by Jun Lana.\n\nVice portrays Bambi with empathy and care, creating a character that resonates as a breadwinner often taken for granted by family. The script skillfully portrays the family\u2019s flaws without fully demonizing them, presenting a realistic dynamic of a Filipino family.\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to see Vice's acting range which is amplified by Lana\u2019s character-driven direction. Most characters feel authentic, and their situations are relatable, reflecting challenges many viewers might face in real life.\n\n\u201cBreadwinner\u201d shows potential for future collaborations between Vice and Lana, echoing Vice\u2019s earlier projects with the late Wenn V. Deramas. Four stars out of five.\n\n1. Green Bones\n\n\u201cGreen Bones\u201d challenges viewers to move beyond preconceived notions and see the humanity in others through its poignant story of a prisoner and a guard.\n\nDennis Trillo and Ruru Madrid deliver award-winning performances as Domingo and Xavier respectively, bringing depth and emotional nuance to their roles that enriches the narrative.\n\nThis film feels particularly relevant in today\u2019s social climate, where people are often quick to judge without considering the backstories that shape who they are today.\n\nUnder Zig Dulay\u2019s empathetic direction and with a heartfelt script by Ricky Lee and Anj Antienza, \u201cGreen Bones\u201d deservedly won Best Picture at the MMFF Gabi ng Parangal. It may well set a standard for future Filipino dramas on how to capture audiences with a compelling, meaningful story. Four stars out of five. \u2014 (FREEMAN)"

She\u2019s been working as a journalist for more than 10 years.\n\nWe are well into the new year (six days), which means we are well on our way to an onslaught of new TV.\n\nThe bulk of today\u2019s dispatch comes from Crunchyroll, where the winter anime season is in full swing. We\u2019ve offered only a handful of the many premieres this week over there, but suffice it to say: hard to go wrong! Particularly with titles from CloverWorks, MAPPA, and Toho all launching (and again: just to start!).\n\nOf course, the biggest Event\u2122 comes in a few flavors this week: Are you watching the sure to be ruthless and cutthroat crossover event (Abbott Elementary meets It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia), or are you watching WWE Raw on Netflix?\n\nHere\u2019s the best new TV premieres of the week.\n\nNew shows on Netflix\n\nWWE Monday Night Raw\n\nGenre: Wrestling\n\nRelease date: Jan. 6 at 5 p.m. PST/8 p.m. EST\n\nHosts: Joe Tessitore and Wade Barrett\n\nNetflix is continuing its run of live programming with maybe its biggest get (after the NFL Christmas Beyonc\u00e9 halftime show): WWE Monday Night Raw! If it\u2019s anything like the rest of WWE, it will be surprisingly good, after a year or so of the wrestling program remaking itself. If it\u2019s anything like Netflix\u2019s other live offerings, it will be glitchy as hell. Either way, it\u2019s sure to be an event.\n\nSakamoto Days\n\nGenre: Aging assassin who just wants to live his life\n\nRelease date: Jan. 11, with one episode\n\nStudio: TMS Entertainment\n\nYou\u2019re familiar with the story: A legendary hitman, Taro Sakamoto, was once feared by all who knew him. Then, one day, he retired, fell in love, gained weight, and now aspires to live a life with his wife and children free from conflict. But his skills are still there, as are his enemies. And so Sakamoto will break his one rule in order to preserve the life he has, even if it means introducing a bit of goofy chaos.\n\nNew shows on Hulu\n\nAbbott Elementary/It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia crossover\n\nPhoto: Gilles Mingasson/Disney\n\nGenre: Sitcom hijinks\n\nRelease date: Jan. 8 at 8:30 p.m. EST; next day on Hulu\n\nShowrunner/creator: Quinta Brunson\n\nCast: Quinta Brunson, Tyler James Williams, Sheryl Lee Ralph, and more\n\nTwo shows, one hometown.

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jin Yi (Jeanie) Tan told the school children she was supervising for a science outreach programme \u2018you can collect anything you want\u2019, she didn\u2019t expect one to bring in goose droppings. She also wasn\u2019t expecting the programme to lead them to a new cytotoxic peptide.\n\nTan, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Brian Murphy\u2019s lab from the University of Illinois Chicago, US, leads a team of researchers in an outreach collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, one of the city\u2019s oldest youth development organisations. With 21 locations, and 20,000 young members, the clubs provide resources and support to aid members\u2019 personal and professional development. So far the team has worked with two local branches: the Bartlett J McCartin club and the James R Jordan club, the latter of which is named after Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan\u2019s late father.\n\nThe 14-week after-school programme, termed the Chicago antibiotic discovery lab, offers middle school students (aged 11\u201313 ) from underrepresented communities, a hands-on learning experience searching for potential antibiotics in their own neighbourhoods . Funded by the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant that Tan received for her PhD, the programme teaches the fundamentals of microbiology research, from sample collection to laboratory analysis. Students are also introduced to environmental issues, engineering, robotics and related careers. \u2018We\u2019ve done four different cohorts of this programme, constantly tweaking stuff to make things better,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018One of our strengths is that the programme is very small, allowing us to give one-to-one mentoring and tailor the work to the students\u2019 interests.\u2019\n\nSemi-automated\n\nTan\u2019s PhD project focusses on finding new antibiotics to combat multi-drug resistance by harnessing antimicrobial toxins secreted by other bacteria. She has developed a pipeline for screening bioactive compounds from the natural environment, \u2018integrating things like robotics, bioassays and bioinformatics to create a streamlined workflow\u2019, she explains. This approach simplifies the initial stages of microbial drug discovery by allowing steps to be carried out in a semi-automated manner, making it safe and accessible enough to be taught to middle school students. \u2018The researchers were very good at mentoring the students \u2026 [the students] were constantly supervised and because of the robotics, had no interaction with hazardous bacteria,\u2019 adds Jonathon Rodriguez, the technology program manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.\n\nThe mentor team encourages students to carry out each stage of the process autonomously \u2013 instilling a sense of ownership over their results. While some students collect samples from lake water or flowers, others get more creative, swabbing everything from air conditioning filters to playground slides. \u2018The kids are always collecting the weirdest stuff t hey can find,\u2019 says Tan.\n\nStudents then program a robot to isolate the bacterial colonies grown from their samples and test the ability of each one to prevent the growth of multi-drug resistant bacteria. \u2018At first when they look at the environmental bacteria plates, they are really grossed out,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018But after five minutes, they\u2019ll be looking really closely? Like \u201cwait, what\u2019s this one? Why is this one pink?\u201d It\u2019s exciting for them to be able to understand microbiology and that they can produce medicines.\u2019\n\nTan successfully isolated a new anti-bacterial compound from Pseudomonas idahonensis, a bacterium cultured from the goose dropping sample. It turned out to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that they named orfamide N . Using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis she elucidated the structure of the new bioactive molecule. It comprises 10 mixed D- and L-amino acids and a distinct lipid tail, which sets it apart from other known orfamides and is thought to contribute to its biological activity. While the peptide demonstrated minimal antibacterial activity, it showed cytotoxicity in bioassays against human cancer cell lines, warranting further investigation in its application for cancer therapy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really happy and grateful that I was able to merge two big interests of mine and showed that this can happen. Biomedical research and Stem outreach can lead to a publication ,\u2019 says Tan. The research, published in the journal ACS Omega, lists the the student who collected the goose dropping sample as a co-author, underscoring their integral role in this discovery. \u2018The student was really excited about it,\u2019 adds Rodriguez.\n\nAs the project continues into its third year, the team hopes its approach can serve as a model for university\u2013community partnerships elsewhere. \u2018There is often a disconnect between a university and the neighbouring communities it should serve,\u2019 says Murphy. \u2018Both teams are learning about one another and building trust, and that barrier that typically exists between university and community is being systematically broken down.\u2019"

            "article_content": "In a post on his personal blog, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he believes OpenAI \u201cknow[s] how to build [artificial general intelligence]\u201d as the company has traditionally understood it, and is beginning to turn its aim to \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future,\u201d Altman wrote in the post. \u201cSuperintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.\u201d\n\nAltman previously said that superintelligence could be \u201ca few thousand days\u201d away, and that its arrival would be \u201cmore intense than people think.\u201d\n\nAGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a nebulous term, but OpenAI has its own definition: \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d OpenAI and Microsoft, the startup\u2019s close collaborator and investor, also have a definition of AGI: AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits. When OpenAI achieves this, Microsoft will lose access to its technology, per an agreement between the two companies.\n\nSo which definition might Altman be referring to? He didn\u2019t specify, but the former seems likeliest. Altman wrote that he thinks AI agents \u2014 AI systems that can perform certain tasks autonomously \u2014 may \u201cjoin the workforce,\u201d in a manner of speaking, and \u201cmaterially change the output of companies\u201d this year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s also true that today\u2019s AI technology is significantly limited. It hallucinates, for one; it makes mistakes obvious to any human; and it can be very expensive.\n\nAltman seems confident all this can be overcome \u2014 and quickly. Still, if there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve learned about AI from the past few years, it\u2019s that timelines can shift.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cGiven the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company. How lucky and humbling it is to be able to play a role in this work.\u201d\n\nOne would hope that as OpenAI telegraphs its shift in focus to what it considers to be superintelligence, the company would devote sufficient resources to ensuring superintelligent systems behave safely.\n\nOpenAI has written several times about how successfully transitioning to a world with superintelligence is \u201cfar from guaranteed,\u201d and that it doesn\u2019t have all the answers. \u201c[W]e don\u2019t have a solution for steering or controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post dated July 2023. \u201c[H]umans won\u2019t be able to reliably supervise AI systems much smarter than us, and so our current alignment techniques will not scale to superintelligence.\u201d\n\nSince that post, however, OpenAI has disbanded teams that were focused on AI safety, including superintelligent systems safety, and seen several influential safety-focused researchers depart. Several of these staffers cited OpenAI\u2019s increasingly commercial ambitions as the reason for their departure. The company is currently undergoing a corporate restructuring to make it more attractive to outside investors.\n\nAsked in a recent interview about critics who say OpenAI isn\u2019t focused enough on safety, Altman responded, \u201cI\u2019d point to our track record.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Sunday said that the company is currently losing money on its $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan because people are using it more than the company expected.\n\n\u201cI personally chose the price,\u201d Altman wrote in a series of posts on X, \u201cand thought we would make some money.\u201d\n\nChatGPT Pro, launched late last year, grants access to an upgraded version of OpenAI\u2019s o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model, o1 pro mode, and lifts rate limits on several of the company\u2019s other tools, including its Sora video generator.\n\nChatGPT Pro\u2019s price point wasn\u2019t a slam dunk at launch. It\u2019s $2,400 per year, and the value proposition of o1 pro mode in particular remains murky. But judging by Altman\u2019s posts, it seems that users who have bitten the bullet are making the most of it \u2014 at OpenAI\u2019s expense.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time OpenAI has priced a product somewhat arbitrarily. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Altman said that the original premium plan for OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, didn\u2019t have a pricing study.\n\n\u201cI believe we tested two prices, $20 and $42,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cPeople thought $42 was a little too much. They were happy to pay $20. We picked $20. Probably it was late December of 2022 or early January. It was not a rigorous \u2018hire someone and do a pricing study\u2019 thing.\u201d\n\nOpenAI isn\u2019t profitable, despite having raised around $20 billion since its founding. The company reportedly expected losses of about $5 billion on revenue of $3.7 billion last year.\n\nExpenditures like staffing, office rent, and AI training infrastructure are to blame. ChatGPT was at one point costing OpenAI an estimated $700,000 per day.\n\nRecently, OpenAI admitted it needs \u201cmore capital than it imagined\u201d as it prepares to undergo a corporate restructuring to attract new investments. To reach profitability, OpenAI is said to be considering increasing the price of its various subscription tiers. Altman also hinted in the Bloomberg interview that OpenAI may explore usage-based pricing for certain services.\n\nOpenAI optimistically projects that its revenue will reach $11.6 billion this year and $100 billion in 2029, matching the current annual sales of Nestl\u00e9.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "OpenAI has announced that its primary focus for the coming year will be on developing \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d according to a blog post from Sam Altman. This has been described as AI with greater-than-human capabilities.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s current suite of products has a vast array of capabilities, Altman said that superintelligence will enable users to perform \u201canything else.\u201d He highlights accelerating scientific discovery as the primary example, which, he believes, will lead to the betterment of society.\n\n\u201cThis sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. That\u2019s alright\u2014we\u2019ve been there before and we\u2019re OK with being there again,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe change of direction has been spurred by Altman\u2019s confidence in his company now knowing \u201chow to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is typically defined as a system that matches human capabilities, whereas superintelligence exceeds them.\n\nSEE: OpenAI\u2019s Sora: Everything You Need to Know\n\nAltman has eyed superintelligence for years \u2014 but concerns exist\n\nOpenAI has been referring to superintelligence for several years when discussing the risks of AI systems and aligning them with human values. In July 2023, OpenAI announced it was hiring researchers to work on containing superintelligent AI.\n\nThe team would reportedly devote 20% of OpenAI\u2019s total computing power to training what they call a human-level automated alignment researcher to keep future AI products in line. Concerns around superintelligent AI stem from how such a system could prove impossible to control and may not share human values.\n\n\u201cWe need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us,\u201d wrote OpenAI Head of Alignment Jan Leike and co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in a blog post at the time.\n\nSEE: OpenAI and Anthropic Sign Deals With U.S. AI Safety Institute\n\nBut, four months after creating the team, another company post revealed they \u201cstill (did) not know how to reliably steer and control superhuman AI systems\u201d and didn\u2019t have a way of \u201cpreventing (a superintelligent AI) from going rogue.\u201d\n\nIn May, OpenAI\u2019s superintelligence safety team was disbanded and several senior personnel left due to the concern that \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\u201d including Jan Leike and the team\u2019s co-lead Ilya Sutskever. The team\u2019s work was absorbed by OpenAI\u2019s other research efforts, according to Wired.\n\nDespite this, Altman highlighted the importance of safety to OpenAI in his blog post. \u201cWe continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications.\u201d\n\nThe path to superintelligence may still be years away\n\nThere is disagreement about how long it will be until superintelligence is achieved. The November 2023 blog post said it could develop within a decade. But nearly a year later, Altman said it could be \u201ca few thousand days away.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brent Smolinski, IBM VP and global head of Technology and Data Strategy, said this was \u201ctotally exaggerated,\u201d in a company post from September 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re even in the right zip code for getting to superintelligence,\u201d he said.\n\nAI still requires much more data than humans to learn a new capability, is limited in the scope of capabilities, and does not possess consciousness or self-awareness, which Smolinski views as a key indicator of superintelligence.\n\nHe also claims that quantum computing could be the only way we might unlock AI that surpasses human intelligence. At the start of the decade, IBM predicted that quantum would begin to solve real business problems before 2030.\n\nSEE: Breakthrough in Quantum Cloud Computing Ensures its Security and Privacy\n\nAltman predicts AI agents will join the workforce in 2025\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions or make decisions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads.\n\nTechRepublic predicted at the end of the year that the use of AI agents will surge in 2025. Altman echoes this in his blog post, saying \u201cwe may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies.\u201d\n\nSEE: IBM: Enterprise IT Facing Imminent AI Agent Revolution\n\nAccording to a research paper by Gartner, the first industry agents to dominate will be software development. \u201cExisting AI coding assistants gain maturity, and AI agents provide the next set of incremental benefits,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nBy 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, according to the Gartner paper. A fifth of online store interactions and at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be conducted by agents by that year.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The big picture: A debate surrounding Northeastern's computer science curriculum highlights the ongoing challenges in higher education about how to best prepare students for rapidly evolving technical fields. While Python is currently popular in the industry, the choice of programming language for teaching should be based on pedagogical merit rather than current trends, writes one student.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The Huntington News, Derek Kaplan, a fourth-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University, presented a compelling argument about the future of computer science education at his institution. The piece comes in response to Northeastern's announcement of a complete overhaul of its computer science curriculum.\n\nKaplan makes the case that the rapidly evolving nature of the tech industry requires a focus on timeless principles rather than current trends and that an effective curriculum should emphasize fundamental principles that are widely applicable, enabling students to easily adapt to new technologies in their future careers. \"A curriculum focused on current industry trends risks becoming obsolete before students even graduate,\" he noted.\n\nNortheastern's current curriculum, particularly the \"Fundies\" courses, focuses on systematic program design and problem-solving skills. These courses teach a design recipe that provides a consistent formula for tackling unfamiliar problems, training students to reason about code \"rather than to mindlessly write it,\" he said.\n\nThe \"point of Fundies is \u2026 to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language\u2026 A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language.\"\n\nHowever, the proposed changes to the curriculum have raised concerns. The plan is to phase out core courses like Fundies 1, Fundies 2, and Object-Oriented Design in favor of new courses primarily teaching Python, which Kaplan sees as potentially misguided.\n\nRacket, the language currently used in introductory courses, was chosen for its teaching-oriented features, which Python lacks. Kaplan also views as problematic the decision to allow students to place out of new courses with AP Computer Science credit, as AP courses do not teach the same systematic design skills as Northeastern's current introductory courses.\n\nThese changes suggest a shift away from systematic program design as a central aspect of the curriculum, which could leave students ill-prepared for advanced coursework and future careers. The Object-Oriented Design course, while challenging for many students, teaches essential skills such as working with code written by others and managing large software projects.\n\nKaplan also questions the motivations behind the curriculum change, suggesting that it may be driven by a desire to make the core curriculum easier and reduce the number of students withdrawing from certain courses.\n\n\"I know one professor who has been telling students that the college wants to reduce the number of students who withdraw from Fundies 2 and Object-Oriented Design. While this is an understandable sentiment, it would be a mistake to remove the most important parts of the curriculum to do so.\"\n\nFinally, he notes that experienced teaching assistants could provide valuable input into the curriculum revision process. Their unique perspective, having both taken the courses and helped other students succeed, could help ensure that core principles are not compromised while allowing for beneficial changes.\n\n\"As a former teaching assistant, or TA, for Object-Oriented Design, I have seen many students struggle through the class. But I have also seen those same students become better programmers because of what they learn in that class.\""

While she said she doesn\u2019t have to worry about clothing choices for a boy, she previously admitted to putting rules on her son\u2019s social media use.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have never allowed Jackson to have any type of social media presence whatsoever outside of what I share of him on my stuff because I don\u2019t want him to build some type of following, see a paycheck that comes in that looks like that, and then turn 16 years old, start working at Chick-Fil-A, and the paycheck looks very, very different,\u201d she said on the November 7 episode of the Coffee Convos podcast.\n\nLindsie is Todd\u2019s oldest daughter from his first marriage to Teresa Terry. She has become estranged from the family following the investigation into Todd and his wife Julie Chrisley\u2018s bank and tax fraud that led to their 2022 conviction and combined 19 years in prison.\n\nSavannah Chrisley, Todd\u2019s daughter with Julie, has accused Lindsie of helping investigators in the criminal case against her parents. Lindsie has denied this.\n\nIn April 2024, Savannah answered fan questions on Instagram, where she was asked why Lindsie didn\u2019t attend Todd and Julie\u2019s appeal hearing. \u201cI told her that she was not wanted, that my dad did not want her there, and that he didn\u2019t care to have a relationship with her,\u201d she stated.\n\nLindsie opened up about the situation on her Southern Tea podcast on April 19, 2024, saying, \u201cI do feel that it was in the best interest for me and everyone else. My sister privately let the message get to us that she did not want us present at the hearing. And it was shared with me that if we were there, there would be issues and that we would be asked to leave.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Construction workers expanding a section of road north of London needed to pause their project after uncovering an unexpected find\u2014a small Roman cemetery dating back roughly 1,500 years. Excavating just one of the coffins in their way was no small feat, either. According to the England\u2019s National Highways department announcement on January 6th, the largely intact stone casket weighed as much as \u201can adult male polar bear.\u201d For those unsure about that exact unit of measurement, that puts the coffin at around 1,650 lbs.\n\n\u201cWhile our main focus has been on building a road to improve journeys for road users, it\u2019s been extremely satisfying to play a part in uncovering such an unusual archaeological find,\u201d said Chris Griffin, the National Highways east region program leader.\n\nThe coffin weighs roughly 1,650 lbs. Credit: National Highways\n\nWhile a sovereign state today, a large portion of the UK once composed the Roman territory of Britannia. Julius Caesar initially invaded the island in 55 and 54 BCE during the Gallic Wars, but it wasn\u2019t until Claudius\u2019 reign that a much larger campaign commenced. Rome officially annexed the province of Britannia in 43 CE before ruling over the region for roughly the next 400 years. This means that locals likely buried the large stone coffin towards the end of Roman occupation following almost a half-century of cultural exchange and improvements made to Britain\u2019s agriculture, architecture, urban planning, and industry. One of the most notable Roman additions to the area was a vast network of roads connecting much of the territory. Despite their immense influence, however, only an estimated 800 Latin words were ultimately incorporated into Common Brittonic by the time of Rome\u2019s withdrawal from the island. The vast majority of the proto-English language remained firmly intertwined with its Germanic origins.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Using blockchain technology to convert real-world assets into digital tokens, Rexas Finance solves major issues like lack of liquidity, high cost, and inaccessibility. Real-world assets are illiquid and expensive, and some cannot be accessed from anywhere in the world. However, tokenization makes it possible to trade these assets anywhere in the world, even from the comfort of home. It also removes the cost barrier by enabling investors to buy just a fraction of these assets. As a result, Rexas Finance creates new opportunities in the lucrative trillion-dollar RWA market. Rexas Finance offers powerful tools that boost its utility. At its core is the Token Builder, a no-code tool that simplifies asset tokenization for users. The QuickMint Bot allows users to manage and generate tokens effortlessly through smartphones or computers. These tools are easy to use, enabling even those without technical knowledge to access the RWA market.\n\nOn the security front, the Rexas AI Shield is an AI-powered auditing tool offering real-time smart contract audits. The Rexas Estate also serves as a platform for investing in whole and fractional real estate. The Rexas Finance presale launched in September and has since captured significant attention. Within three months, it achieved nine stages. Each RXS token is priced at $0.15 at stage ten and will officially launch at $0.20. Over 360 million tokens have been sold, raising a staggering $31 million. This shows high demand and investors' confidence in the project.\n\nRexas Finance also recently completed a security audit with Certik, a renowned blockchain auditing firm. This audit underscores the platform's dedication to maintaining a secure and trustworthy ecosystem, reinforcing investor confidence. To engage its growing community, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway. Twenty winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens.\n\nRXS will launch in Q1 2025, making the year a big year. It plans to list on three tier-1 exchanges, a strategic move that will significantly boost liquidity and accessibility for RXS tokens. The project is expected to achieve massive success post-launch, with RXS delivering remarkable profit. Its utility and innovative approach make it stand out, and with the token launch being a pivotal moment, Rexas Finance is a project you must watch closely in 2025."

Non-Nvidia GPU users have long lusted after an upscaler that can compete with DLSS, and according to AMD, there are significant improvements here that may do just that.\n\nThe bad news? You'll need one of those fancy new RDNA 4 cards to take advantage of it. AMD says that FSR 4 was \"developed for RDNA 4 and the unique compute aspects of the RDNA 4 AI accelerators\", which means that this new machine learning-powered solution will need an RX 9070 XT or RX 9070 to power all the AI gubbins.\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nMy RX 7800 XT weeps. Anyway, AMD also says that FSR delivers \"very high quality 4K upscaling with a dramatic improvement in terms of performance and quality compared to prior generations.\"\n\nIt's interesting that performance is touted as one of the great improvements to FSR 4 over the previous version, as my FSR 3.1 testing shows that AMD's most recent upscaler release can, in most scenarios, keep up with DLSS 3 in the framerate stakes\u2014and sometimes even slightly surpass it.\n\nAs my comparison with Nvidia's efforts demonstrates, however, FSR's image quality still lags far behind DLSS on anything but Quality settings\u2014so here's hoping the machine learning improvements in the new version equate to less fizzy, grainy images, particularly at Performance setting levels.\n\nWith the Nvidia announcement due to take place later today, part of me wonders whether the performance improvement claims are in anticipation of extra juice found in DLSS 4, if it's announced this evening. Still, speed and image quality gains are what I was hoping for out of the next version of FSR 4, and AMD says it can provide.\n\nIt also claims that FSR 4 can deliver \"very low latency gaming\" in combination with AMD Anti Lag 2, an existing tech designed to minimise latency from input to presented image on GPU-bound games.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe real issue, to me at least, is adoption. FSR 3 suffered from relatively slow developer uptake on release\u2014and while it looks like FSR 4 might simply be a bolt-on upgrade for games that already feature FSR 3.1, devs will want to see the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 selling well if they're going to prioritise FSR 4 integration into games alongside DLSS.\n\nCES 2025 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2025: We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more.\n\nWith Nvidia's RTX 50-series cards presumed to be waiting in the wings for their debut (and possibly a DLSS 4 announcement), we may have another upscaler showdown on our hands. As AMD is only releasing cards in the mid-range this generation, it'll likely be hoping that FSR 4 can be the great equaliser to tempt would-be-buyers away from higher-end Nvidia offerings, of which it has no competition.\n\nThat's all dependent on the pricing of the new Radeon cards, at least. Anyway, FSR 4. It's coming, AMD says it's better, and you'll need some new silicon to run it. Things are heating up, folks."

The Nifty Midcap Select fell 2.00 per cent to 12,749.90, while the banking sector indices also faced significant losses with Nifty Bank down 1.61 per cent at 50,167.95 and Nifty Financial Services declining 1.35 per cent to 23,415.20.\n\nMarket breadth remained heavily negative with 3,223 stocks declining against 734 advances on the BSE. The number of stocks hitting lower circuit at 365 significantly outnumbered those touching upper circuit at 228. Despite the broad market weakness, 159 stocks managed to hit their 52-week highs, while 67 touched their 52-week lows.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals emerged as the top gainer on the NSE, rising 0.91 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank and Titan with modest gains of 0.15 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively. The major losers included Tata Steel (-4.18 per cent), BPCL (-3.46 per cent), Adani Enterprises (-3.22 per cent), Kotak Bank (-3.10 per cent), and Trent (-3.05 per cent).\n\nThe market sentiment was affected by news of two HMPV cases detected in Karnataka, both involving infants. The Union Health Ministry confirmed that the cases were identified through routine surveillance, with both patients admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, for bronchopneumonia. Neither patient had any international travel history.\n\nWhile the Health Ministry maintained that the HMPV strain is already in global circulation and that there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses, the news appeared to trigger concerns among investors, leading to broad-based selling across sectors.\n\nThe market reaction comes despite the Ministry\u2019s assurance of preparedness and ongoing monitoring through the ICMR and IDSP network, with support from the WHO in tracking the situation in China."

            "article_content": "Only 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n\u2013 To hear US President-elect Donald Trump tell it, he is about to take over a nation ravaged by crisis, a desolate hellscape of crime, chaos and economic hardship. \u201cOur country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the world!\u201d he declared on social media last week.\n\nBut by many traditional metrics, the America that Trump will inherit from President Joe Biden when he takes the oath for a second time, two weeks from Jan 6, is actually in better shape than that bequeathed to any newly elected president since Mr George W. Bush came into office in 2001.\n\nFor the first time since that transition 24 years ago, there will be no US troops at war overseas on Inauguration Day. New data reported in the past few days indicates that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been.\n\nThe manufacturing sector has more jobs than under any president since Mr Bush. Drug overdose deaths have fallen for the first time in years. Even inflation, the scourge of the Biden presidency, has returned closer to normal, although prices remain higher than they were four years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is inheriting an economy that is about as good as it ever gets,\u201d said Mr Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.\u201d\n\nThose positive trends were not enough to swing a sour electorate behind US Vice-President Kamala Harris in the November election, reflecting a substantial gap between what statistics say and what ordinary Americans appear to feel about the state of the country. And the US clearly faces some major challenges that will confront Trump as he retakes power.\n\nThe terrorist attack that killed 15 people in New Orleans early on New Year\u2019s Day, carried out by an American man who said he had joined the ISIS extremist group, served as a reminder that the group \u2013 which Trump likes to boast he defeated during his previous term \u2013 remains a threat and an inspiration to radicalised lone wolves. The wars in Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip are daunting challenges even without US troops engaged in combat there.\n\nThanks in part to Covid-19 relief spending by both Trump and Mr Biden, the national debt has ballooned so much that it now represents a larger share of the economy than it has in generations, other than during the pandemic itself. Families remain pressed by the cost of living, including housing, healthcare and college tuition. The cost of petrol , while down from its peak, is still about 70 US cents per gallon higher than when Mr Biden took office.\n\nMoreover, Americans remain as divided as they have been in many years \u2013 politically, ideologically, economically, racially and culturally. As healthy as the country may be economically and otherwise, a variety of scholars, surveys and other indicators suggest the US is struggling to come together behind a common view of its national identity, either at home or abroad.\n\nIndeed, many Americans do not perceive the country to be doing as well as the data suggests, either because they do not see it in their own lives, they do not trust the statistics or they accept the dystopian view promoted by Trump and amplified by a fragmented, choose-your-own-news media and online ecosphere.\n\nOnly 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. In another Gallup survey in September, 52 per cent of Americans said they and their own family were worse off than four years ago, a higher proportion than felt that way in the presidential election years of 1984, 1992, 2004, 2012 or 2020.\n\nIt was in Trump\u2019s political interest, of course, to encourage that sentiment and appeal to it during 2024 \u2019s campaign. He was hardly the first challenger to emphasise the negative to defeat an incumbent president.\n\nDwight Eisenhower disparaged the state of the country when he first ran for president in 1952, much to the irritation of president Harry S. Truman, only to have John F. Kennedy do the same to him when running in 1960.\n\nKennedy hammered away at a \u201cmissile gap\u201d with the Soviet Union that did not exist, then after winning declared that the US was in \u201cits hour of maximum danger\u201d, in contrast to Eisenhower\u2019s view of his security record.\n\n\u201cThis is a contrast you oftentimes find,\u201d said historian Michael Beschloss, who has written nine books on the American presidency. \u201cCandidates who are running against incumbent presidents or sitting governments make it sound much worse than it is.\u201d\n\nStill, few have been as extreme in their negative descriptions as Trump, or as resistant to fact-checking. He has suggested falsely that immigration, crime and inflation are out of control, attributed the New Orleans incident to lax border policies even though the attacker was an American born in Texas and as recently as Jan 4 called the country \u201ca total mess\u201d.\n\nYet Trump is moving back into the White House with an enviable hand to play, one that other presidents would have dearly loved on their opening day. President Ronald Reagan inherited double-digit inflation and an unemployment rate twice as high as today. President Barack Obama inherited two foreign wars and an epic financial crisis. Mr Biden inherited a devastating pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stepping into an improving situation,\u201d Dr William J. Antholis, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Centre of Public Affairs, which has studied presidential transitions, said of Trump.\n\nDr Antholis compared the situation with then President Bill Clinton\u2019s arrival in 1993, when he took over a growing economy and a new post-Cold War order. While the country had already begun recovering from recession during the 1992 election, many voters did not yet feel it and punished President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the economy had turned just before the election, and kept moving in the right direction when Clinton took over,\u201d Dr Antholis recalled.\n\nMuch as it did for the first Mr Bush\u2019s team, the disconnect between macro trends and individual perceptions proved enormously frustrating to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, who failed to persuade voters during the 2024 election that the country was doing better than commonly believed. Rattling off statistics and boasting about the success of \u201cBidenomics\u201d did not resonate with voters who did not see it the same way.\n\n\u201cOf course, not everyone is enjoying good economic times, as many low-middle income households are struggling financially, and the nation has mounting fiscal challenges,\u201d Mr Zandi said. \u201cBut taking the economy in its totality, it rarely performs better than it is now as President Trump takes office.\u201d\n\nMr Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the latest reports demonstrated that Mr Biden\u2019s policies are working and argued that Republicans should not seek to repeal them once they take control of the presidency and both houses of Congress.\n\n\u201cAfter inheriting an economy in free fall and skyrocketing violent crime, President Biden is proud to hand his successor the best-performing economy on earth, the lowest violent crime rates in over 50 years, and the lowest border crossings in over four years,\u201d Mr Bates said.\n\nMs Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump, responded by citing the election: \u201cAmericans delivered an overwhelming Election Day rebuke of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s abysmal track record: communities being overrun with millions of unvetted migrants who walked over Biden\u2019s open border, lower real wages, and declining trust in increasingly politicised law enforcement agencies that are unable to even publish accurate crime data.\u201d\n\nTrump does not have to share a positive view of the situation to benefit from it. When he takes office on Jan 20, absent the unexpected, he will not face the sort of major immediate action-forcing crisis that, say, Mr Obama did in needing to rescue the economy from the brink of another Great Depression.\n\nTrump instead will have more latitude to pursue favoured policies such as mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally or tariffs on foreign imported goods. And if past is prologue, he may eventually begin extolling the state of the economy to claim successes for his policies.\n\nHe has already taken credit for recent increases in stock prices even before assuming office. He has a demonstrated skill for self-promotion that eluded Mr Biden, enabling him to persuade many Americans that the economy during his first term was even better than it actually was.\n\nAt the same time, with unemployment, crime, border crossings and even inflation already pretty low, it may be difficult for Trump to improve on them significantly. Trump obliquely seemed to acknowledge as much when he noted in a post-election interview with Time magazine that he may not be able to live up to his campaign pledge to lower grocery prices. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Trump faces the risk that the economy goes in the other direction. Some specialists have warned that a tariff-driven trade war with major economic partners could, for instance, reignite inflation.\n\nDr N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard University and chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under the second Mr Bush, recalled that even his former boss faced significant challenges when he took office in 2001 as the economy was already heading into a relatively mild recession following the bust of the dot-com boom.\n\n\u201cThere are no similar storm clouds on the horizon right now,\u201d Dr Mankiw said. \u201cThat is certainly lucky for Trump. On the other hand, all presidents must deal with unexpected shocks to the economy. We just don\u2019t know yet what kind of shocks President Trump will have to handle.\u201d NYTIMES\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

            "article_content": "Zscaler ThreatLabz research team has revealed critical insights and predictions on ransomware trends for 2025. The latest Ransomware Report uncovered a surge in sophisticated tactics and extortion attacks. As ransomware remains a key concern for CISOs and CIOs, the report sheds light on actionable strategies to mitigate risks.\n\n\n\nTop Ransomware Predictions for 2025:\n\n\u25cf AI-Powered Social Engineering: In 2025, GenAI will fuel voice phishing (vishing) attacks. With the proliferation of GenAI-based tooling, initial access broker groups will increasingly leverage AI-generated voices; which sound more and more realistic by adopting local accents and dialects to enhance credibility and success rates.\n\n\n\n\u25cf The Trifecta of Social Engineering Attacks: Vishing, Ransomware and Data Exfiltration. Additionally, sophisticated ransomware groups, like the Dark Angels, will continue the trend of low-volume, high-impact attacks; preferring to focus on an individual company, stealing vast amounts of data without encrypting files, and evading media and law enforcement scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Targeted Industries Under Siege: Manufacturing, healthcare, education, energy will remain primary targets, with no slowdown in attacks expected.\n\n\n\n\u25cf New SEC Regulations Drive Increased Transparency: 2025 will see an uptick in reported ransomware attacks and payouts due to new, tighter SEC requirements mandating that public companies report material incidents within four business days.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Ransomware Payouts Are on the Rise: In 2025 ransom demands will most likely increase due to an evolving ecosystem of cybercrime groups, specializing in designated attack tactics, and collaboration by these groups that have entered a sophisticated profit sharing model using Ransomware-as-a-Service.\n\n\n\nTo combat damaging ransomware attacks, Zscaler ThreatLabz recommends the following strategies.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Fighting AI with AI: As threat actors use AI to identify vulnerabilities, organizations must counter with AI-powered zero trust security systems that detect and mitigate new threats.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Advantages of adopting a Zero Trust architecture: A Zero Trust cloud security platform stops ransomware at every stage of the attack cycle:\n\n\u25cb Minimizing the attack surface: Replacing exploitable VPN and firewall architectures with a zero trust architecture hides users, applications, and devices behind a cloud proxy, making them invisible and undiscoverable from the threats on the internet.\n\n\n\n\u25cb Preventing compromise: TLS/SSL inspection, browser isolation, advanced sandboxing, and policy-driven access controls prevent access to malicious websites and detect unknown threats. This removes the possibility of accessing the corporate network, reducing the risk of initial compromise.\n\n\n\n\u25cb Eliminating lateral movement: Leveraging user-to-app (and app-to-app) segmentation, deception, and identity threat detection and response (ITDR), allows users to securely connect directly to applications, not the network, eliminating lateral movement risk.\n\n\n\n\u25cb Stopping Data Loss: Inline data loss prevention measures, combined with full inspection, thwart attempts at data theft.\n\nTo learn more about ransomware threats and download the Zscaler 2024 Ransomware Report please visit here."

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

It was one of the last refuges of the Anakim (literally, \u2018giants\u2019) in front of the conquering Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 11:22). Gath, a Philistine city, was either subdued during the days of the prophet Samuel, or by King David. The first book of Kings (2:39) states that in the time of King Solomon it was still ruled by a Philistine king named Achish (1 Samuel 27:1\u20137). The narrative in the first book of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 7:21) relates that Ezer and Elead, sons of Ephraim, were killed by men who were natives of Gath, because \u201cthey came down to take their livestock\u201d. In Hebrew, Kiryat Gat means \u201cthe place of the winepress\u201d.\n\nThe Israel Land Authority views this discovery as symbolic of the connection between past and future.\n\nDirector Yaacov Kvint commented: \"[the authority] invests tens of millions of shekels annually in salvage excavations for various projects across the country, aimed at uncovering and documenting the rich history and archaeology beneath the neighbourhoods of the future.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic floor will be relocated to an open area in the city and made accessible to the public.\n\n8 Included in these ten buildings is a monastery, which makes up a site which is thought to have functioned for 600 years Credit: Reuters\n\n8 A winepress was also discovered during the excavation Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "He has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansjurgen Kohler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (Cenap), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says Kohler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office Cenap.\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" Kohler says.\n\nAccording to its director, Cenap has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, Kohler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines). Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa\n\nConspiracy theorists\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, Kohler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

Excavating just one of the coffins in their way was no small feat, either. According to the England\u2019s National Highways department announcement on January 6th, the largely intact stone casket weighed as much as \u201can adult male polar bear.\u201d For those unsure about that exact unit of measurement, that puts the coffin at around 1,650 lbs.\n\n\u201cWhile our main focus has been on building a road to improve journeys for road users, it\u2019s been extremely satisfying to play a part in uncovering such an unusual archaeological find,\u201d said Chris Griffin, the National Highways east region program leader.\n\nThe coffin weighs roughly 1,650 lbs. Credit: National Highways\n\nWhile a sovereign state today, a large portion of the UK once composed the Roman territory of Britannia. Julius Caesar initially invaded the island in 55 and 54 BCE during the Gallic Wars, but it wasn\u2019t until Claudius\u2019 reign that a much larger campaign commenced. Rome officially annexed the province of Britannia in 43 CE before ruling over the region for roughly the next 400 years. This means that locals likely buried the large stone coffin towards the end of Roman occupation following almost a half-century of cultural exchange and improvements made to Britain\u2019s agriculture, architecture, urban planning, and industry. One of the most notable Roman additions to the area was a vast network of roads connecting much of the territory. Despite their immense influence, however, only an estimated 800 Latin words were ultimately incorporated into Common Brittonic by the time of Rome\u2019s withdrawal from the island. The vast majority of the proto-English language remained firmly intertwined with its Germanic origins.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to Archeology News, a team of 50 archeologists and 20 civil engineers spent seven months excavating 17 different sites along the roadway. Many of these discoveries will be showcased in the new season of Digging for Britain. The first episode\u2014which includes the polar bear-sized casket\u2014will premiere on BBC 2 on January 7th."

Has solving a century-old paradox now undermined their existence?\n\n\u00a9 William Horton, William Horton Photography\n\nEvery now and then, it is worth pausing for a second and giving thanks to the many, ever so slightly different versions of you that exist in parallel realities. It is these alternative selves that help to keep these universes in balance.\n\nAt least, that is what\u2019s going on if you happen to subscribe to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. First proposed more than 65 years ago, the idea is that reality is constantly splitting off into parallel paths, due to subtle interactions at the level of quantum particles. Though it may boggle the mind, it also smooths over some devilishly tricky problems in physics and, for that reason, plenty of clear-eyed physicists believe it to be true.\n\nBut now this strange idea might be facing a huge challenge, thanks to physicists Sandu Popescu and Daniel Collins at the University of Bristol, UK. They initially set out to solve a 100-year-old puzzle in quantum theory, but ended up undermining the idea of parallel universes. \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially demolished one of the arguments for it,\u201d says Collins.\n\nIt might sound like a destabilising development, but it may actually prove to be a shot in the arm for quantum theory. Already, Popescu and Collins\u2019s work is helping to resolve other long-standing quantum paradoxes and, in the eyes of some theorists, it points to a fresh way of thinking about the cosmos as a singular quantum reality built from the inside out. \u201cThis is something deep and new. I think it could become really important,\u201d says Nicolas Gisin, who researches\u2026"
