        "article_content": "Caroline Quill, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, discussed how artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies could revolutionize chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis and treatment at the CHEST 2024 annual meeting in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nShe began her presentation during the session, \u201cNew Horizons in COPD,\u201d by discussing the difference between AI and digital technologies. Quill defined AI as computers performing high-order tasks that previously required human input; the 2 most common AI types seen in clinical practice are machine and deep learning, where computers and programs learn from existing data to improve prediction and inform practice.\n\nConversely, digital technologies include broader tools like telehealth and remote monitoring. AI is more frequently used during diagnosis and screening risk, while digital technologies are used to assess therapy use and adherence. Overall, Quill said the innovations most used by clinicians treating those with COPD are digital communication with patients and remote monitoring and symptom recognition.\n\nCaroline Quill, MD, highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies to enhance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment at the CHEST 2024 annual meeting in Boston, Massachusetts. | Image Credit: Shuo - stock.adobe.com\n\nBefore discussing the benefits of AI and digital technologies, Quill warned that the market may attract app developers for the wrong reasons due to moneymaking opportunities. She highlighted that the global mobile health app market is currently valued at about $70 billion.\n\nThe FDA only regulates apps intended as an accessory to medical devices. Therefore, all app developers must do is call their program a \u201chealth app\u201d to avoid FDA regulation. Developers can also bypass FDA regulatory oversight by saying that the app is intended for education and entertainment purposes despite clear intentions for its use as a medical care adjunct.\n\nAt their best, digital health innovations promise patient-centered care, self-efficacy, and self-management while being affordable and scalable. Conversely, these tools may encourage patients to adopt poorly regulated, non-evidence-based interventions that distract from proven treatment methods. Additionally, digital health innovations may deliver more care to patients already receiving treatment but exclude those who receive very little treatment.\n\nDespite these negative possibilities, AI is being used within COPD diagnosis and treatment, and Quill said she considers these technologies a \"major part of the future\" for COPD treatment. An area with potential for AI use is pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Since PFTs are standardized globally, AI would incorporate subtle diagnostic and defining characteristics of PFTs into a diagnostic algorithm; this patient-driven AI will get smarter over time. She noted that this AI is very population-specific, so clinicians must input data on all populations they wish to treat.\n\nAs for digital technologies, Quill discussed the potential use of digital inhalers among patients with COPD. Several past studies suggest that less than 50% of patients with COPD use their inhalers correctly. Consequently, various digital devices have been made available to help improve inhaler adherence.\n\nMost digital inhalers can detect the date and time of actuation, while more advanced ones can detect peak inspiratory flow and share personalized data with health care providers. Therefore, digital inhalers can help clinicians identify early exacerbation signs or symptoms.\n\nQuill noted that most studies show that people using digital inhalers take their inhalers more, but they did not decrease patients' exacerbation frequency or improve their quality of life. Because of this, Quill explained that it would be more beneficial to make inhalers more affordable and improve inhaler education; most of her patients cannot afford their inhalers or use them incorrectly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that digital inhalers are what we need right now,\u201d Quill said. \u201cWhat we need is better access to controller medication for people with COPD. This [digital inhalers] doesn\u2019t strike me as super useful in resource-limited settings, and, again, in COPD, no real change in patient-centered outcomes occurred.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Quill explained that digital technologies offer effective methods to deliver pulmonary rehab to patients with mobility or transportation difficulties. There are various delivery methods: synchronous vs asynchronous, real-time vs recorded, group vs individual, video demonstrated vs fully supervised, and human vs app delivered.\n\nSeveral studies suggest that telerehab is safe and brings the best care to more people, including those in resource-limited settings. Although guidance on which program or plan to use is lacking, Quill suggested that clinicians share reliable online resources with patients to guide them in the right direction.\n\nQuill urged clinicians to acknowledge the digital inequities and exclusions across all AI and digital technology interventions. More specifically, she emphasized that they ensure program training data is diverse and reflects their patient population. Also, initiatives are needed to help bring diagnostic tools to areas of low resources, especially low- and middle-income countries, where the COPD burden is high.\n\nLastly, she stated that digital development is occurring faster than research, so clinicians must bridge the evidence gap, be discerning consumers, and help patients be discerning consumers.\n\n\u201cI think digitally augmented care has the potential to increase quality and quantity of care for COPD,\u201d Quill concluded. \u201c...Building an evidence base is really essential to make sure that we\u2019re deploying high-quality care to the right patient at the right time, and then keeping an eye on the digital divide.\u201d"

DPX researches and investigates reportedly haunted locations to help explain the causes of the phenomena experienced there. DPX has appeared on Travel Channel's Paranormal Survivor, Haunted Case Files, Paranormal 9-1-1, Most Terrifying Places, Paranormal Caught on Camera and Destination FEAR, as well as on Local 4.\n\nPeople always ask us, what are DPX\u2019s favorite haunted places in the state? We decided to do something fun and come out with our list of haunted pubs, bars and restaurants.\n\nOver the course of 2021 we visited and researched these amazing places! Some of the criteria we used to determine our list was history, ambiance, personal stories, our own experiences, atmosphere and the reported hauntings. The stories we heard from each of these locations was really interesting and we found out things we didn\u2019t know! We hope you enjoy and we recommend checking them out for yourself.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMost haunted bars and restaurant in Michigan\n\nTwo Way Inn, Detroit\n\nTwo Way Inn, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nBuilt in 1873 and known as Detroit\u2019s oldest bar, it opened as a saloon in 1876 and also served as a general store, stagecoach, railroad station, hotel, jail, dance hall, and possibly a brothel. During Prohibition, the Two Way was owned by a dentist, which is significant because doctors could prescribe up to a pint of whiskey every 10 days for pain under The Volstead Act. There have been several deaths in the building throughout its lifetime.\n\nOne of the apparitions reportedly seen here is a cowboy with a long white beard and cowboy hat, who many believe to be the spirit of Col. Philetus Norris, the building\u2019s former owner. He was not only a bar owner, but also a Union spy during the Civil War, an archaeologist and a superintendent at Yellowstone National Park.\n\nRelated: \ud83d\udd12 Detroit ghost hunters share 5 scariest paranormal experiences\n\nNancy Whiskey\u2019s, Detroit\n\nNancy Whiskey's, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nNancy Whiskey\u2019s dates back to 1902. According to staff and regulars, this 119-year-old pub is believed to be haunted by no fewer than three spirits. Some of the activity reported includes disembodied voices when staff are closing and all guests have left, mirrors breaking on their own, and much more.\n\nJust inside the doorway is an old phone booth, which was reportedly used by Jimmy Hoffa on a regular basis. It\u2019s also possible that members of the Digby family, who opened the general store on this site in 1902, still remain to this day.\n\nCadieux Cafe, Detroit\n\nCadieux Cafe, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Cadieux Cafe is one of Detroit\u2019s most well-known reportedly haunted locations. A pair of Belgian immigrants, Yvonne and Robert Devos, founded the cafe on Detroit\u2019s east side in the early 1930s. In its early days, it was a Prohibition-era speakeasy. The Devos family purchased it in 1962, and in 2018 it was purchased by Paul Howard, co-owner of Cliff Bell\u2019s, and musician John Rutherford.\n\nIt was famously showcased by Anthony Bourdain during a visit for his TV show \u201cNo Reservations.\u201d Some have seen an apparition that they believe to be Yvonne sitting at a table near the bar area. Others have seen her husband, Robert, in the basement of the cafe, as well as objects reportedly moving on their own throughout the building.\n\nAtwater in the Park, Grosse Pointe Park\n\nThe church the brewery is housed in opened in 1936. The building was once home to Grace United Church.\n\nAtwater in the Park, Grosse Pointe Park MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nPeople heard strange noises and odd occurrences while the church was being transformed into the brewery. Atwater in the Park opened in 2014, and a priest came out to bless the brewery soon afterward. Employees fear going in the basement, where the fermenters, liquor and various supplies are kept. The basement once housed a nursery school and daycare.\n\nShadow figures, children\u2019s disembodied voices and lights flickering on, a video capturing a dove shadow flying inside are a few of the paranormal experiences that have been reported\n\nRelated: \u2018Ghost\u2019 captured on camera during investigation at Atwater brewery in Michigan\n\nTommy\u2019s Bar and Grill, Detroit\n\nTommy's Bar and Grill, Detroit MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nTommy\u2019s Detroit Bar is one of the city\u2019s most historic and reportedly haunted locations. Dating back to the mid-1800s, the building is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Road and served as a speakeasy during the prohibition era before it became Tom\u2019s Tavern in 1938.\n\nThe bar\u2019s owner, Tommy Burelle, says he\u2019s heard about and experienced plenty of unusual encounters in the building. One of the paranormal hot spots is the basement, which is where the hidden speakeasy was. Urban legend says the basement is also where a body was once buried by the mob.\n\nGandy Dancer, Ann Arbor\n\nGandy Dancer in Ann Arbor (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Gandy Dancer restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was originally a Michigan Central Train Depot dating back to 1886. Considered the finest station on the Michigan Central line when it was built, this building features heavy stone walls, deep-set, round-arched openings, large fireplaces and beautiful stained glass windows. It\u2019s also said to be haunted possibly due to some of the traumatic events of its past.\n\nIn Sept. 1940, some kids put a railroad spike on the tracks, which caused a freight train to derail, killing Walter Flinn. The train depot also was where American military members killed in action during several wars were unloaded. It\u2019s said that during WWI, the bodies of deceased soldiers who weren\u2019t claimed by their family were stored temporarily in the basement of the depot.\n\nEven today, the Gandy Dancer showcases much of its historical authenticity. Be sure to check it out when you\u2019re in the area.\n\nThe Whitney, Detroit\n\nThe Whitney in Detroit (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe Whitney restaurant was built between 1890 and 1894 by a prominent lumber baron, David Whitney. It served as his families home until 1920. The Whitney is 21,000 square feet with 52 rooms (including 10 bathrooms) and 20 fireplaces. Our favorite spot is the Ghost Bar! It\u2019s also been long rumored to be haunted. We were lucky enough to investigate a few years ago and captured an \u201cavp\u201d of what we think is Grace Whitney in the carriage house. Listen close for Grace humming a tune.\n\nHuron River Inn, Rockwood\n\nHuron River Inn, Rockwood MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nHRI, once known as the Burton Manor & Tavern, was originally built in 1860 and operated through the Civil War Years. It was the center of social life in what was then called Huron Station (current day Rockwood). In the early 1900s, the Burton Manor caught fire and had to be rebuilt. In 1907, out of the ashes arose the Rockwood Hotel!\n\nHRI is well-known to be haunted. Staff and patrons have reported seeing the apparition of a woman in a bonnet sitting at the bar, as well as shadowy man standing in the old coal bin entry in the basement. There have also been reports of loud noises, children\u2019s laughter and unexplained footsteps running down the second floor hallway.\n\nWalldorff Brewpub, Hastings\n\nWalldorff Brewpub, Hastings MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nNow a brewery, this building dating back to 1866 has been many things throughout its lifetime, including a funeral home, hardware store, furniture shop, clothing retailer, and a drug & grocery store. Staff and guests have reported numerous paranormal encounters, including objects unexplainably flying off the bar on their own, lights coming on, being touched, shadow figures and much more.\n\nThe White Horse Inn, Metamora\n\nWhite Horse Inn (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nThe White Horse Inn dates back to 1848 and is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. It originally served as a general store, but throughout its lifetime has also been an inn, dance hall and now a restaurant. The building has quite a haunted reputation, with many reporting to hear the sound of boots walking across its second floor when no one is up there, doors slamming, lights flickering and more. Some have even seen apparitions, including those of a man in a 1940s tuxedo, an older man and a young girl.\n\nOne of the haunted legends says that a handful of patrons and a worker were killed in a fire in the front section of the bar. To this day, people in the bar continue to report hearing screams, possibly of those who perished in the fire.\n\nBone Heads BBQ, Willis\n\nBone Heads BBQ is known to be one of the most haunted places in the state. Now a bar/restaurant, the building dates back to around 1865 and previously served as coach stop, grainery, butcher shop, ice house, post office and general store. Numerous paranormal encounters have been reported by staff and guests.\n\nSome have seen apparitions near the host stand and bar, heard footsteps and whispers when others weren\u2019t present, and seen the apparition of a woman in a white dress walking down the stairs.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not known who all the spirits are at Bone Heads, there\u2019s one the owners and staff call Nellie, who they believe may have lived in the building in the early 20th century.\n\nBone Heads BBQ, Willis MI (Detroit Paranormal Expeditions)\n\nLearn more about Detroit Paranormal Expeditions on their website here."

        "article_content": "CASPER \u2014 Who you gonna call in Wyoming when the door slams in an empty room and a mysterious disembodied voice whispers \u201cget out?\u201d\n\nCasper\u2019s Pete McDaniels.\n\nA longtime fan of the 1984 hit movie \u201cGhostbusters\u201d starring Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Harold Ramios McDaniels and his team of ragtag wranglers of all things supernatural are listed are on an official \u201cwhoyougonnacall.org\" website that lists paranormal investigators in each state.\n\nHe is one of 165 franchises nationwide, and the only listed in Wyoming.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole group of folks that use that movie to help people in their communities,\u201d McDaniels said.\n\nIn addition investigating potential hauntings, Casper\u2019s Ghostbusters do birthday parties, food drives, conventions, \u201ctrunk\u201d or treats and raises money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nLike the movies that feature iconic ghost-busting cars, McDaniels drives his own version of \u201cEcto-1,\u201d the famous converted ambulance with the unique whiney siren. It has similar paraphernalia on top and Ghostbusters stickers on the side.\n\nHe bought the 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor from someone in Glenrock a few years ago.\n\nA hospital security guard when not busting ghosts, McDaniels had his uniform on when he initially drove the unmodified car. Wyoming Highway Patrol pulled him over, thinking he might be trying to impersonate a police officer.\n\nGhostbuster Interceptor\n\n\u201cI thought I should probably make this car less cop like and more something fun. And I had always wanted to have a Ghostbusters car, so I started to put stickers on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell then I thought, now I\u2019ve got to build a top in it, it can\u2019t just be stickers right? So, I started piecing together bit by bit the roof rack and housing and built all that out. There is one piece of pipe up that\u2019s up there being held onto the roof by a toilet flange.\u201d\n\nOnce he had his wheels, as well as the \u201cECTOI\u201d license plate, the doors opened for him to use it for fundraisers and to market his ghost removal side gig.\n\nOctober becomes the busy season. There is a \u201cTouch a Truck\u201d event on Oct. 12 at the Excel Academy Private School that allows kids to get in the vehicle, turn on the sirens, read the special tag fastened on the dash that labels the machine as belonging to Wyoming Ghostbusters, and check out the glove compartment.\n\n\u201cThere is a ghostbuster\u2019s employee handbook and a little canister of ectoplasm slime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids like to play with all that stuff.\u201d\n\nHe also plans to be at a car show and food drive at the Izaak Walton Clubhouse in Casper on Oct. 18 and end the month on Oct. 25, 27 and 28 with actual ghostbusting demonstrations at the Casper Elks Lodge No. 1353 where he said the equipment used by paranormal investigators will be explained and a walk through of the lodge will be conducted.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m discussing a fundraiser for a lady that is trying to fight cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try and kind of use the car as a way to help people out.\u201d\n\nAs in the movie, McDaniels and some other members of the team have uniforms and he and a buddy have the proton packs used in the last version of the film series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the iconic part of Ghostbusters history, it gets people excited,\u201d he said.\n\nSupernatural Missions\n\nIn addition to the fundraising, and parties, McDaniels also has been on an estimated 15 missions to identify or remove potential paranormal spirits in places around the region and state.\n\nHe recently was called to a Casper home where the owners discovered a set of footprints on concrete that went from a pickup truck to the garage door and then just vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat it looked like was that somebody had walked through a puddle of grease, made about four or five steps to the garage door and then nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels pulled out his EMF meter that measures electro-magnetic energy and found it registered a few points over the footprints and faded when pulled away from them. He checked to see if there were any internet routers or other source of energy nearby that would trigger the meters. There were none.\n\nOther tools in his ghostbusting toolbox include REM-Pod devices that reflect electromagnetic field changes and air temperature changes and a specialized SLS (Structured Light Sensor) camera that uses infrared light. It can 3D map areas in front of it \u201cso we can see things the human eye might miss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also uses other cameras that can capture images in ultraviolet, infrared, and the normal spectrum of light.\n\nAt the garage, McDaniels set up some REM Pods around the area to see if anything would trigger them. Nothing happened. Photos with the infrared camera found nothing.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always that way. McDaniels tells the story of being called to a Casper home about five blocks from the cemetery with a man experiencing doors being slammed in his home for no reason.\n\n\u201cHe said he was sitting on the couch one day and he felt like his leg started to burn,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHe looked down and it looked like a handprint had been slapped on his thigh. So, we got to go down and work with that.\u201d\n\nThe man requested that McDaniels and his team bless the house. McDaniels said he has studied different spiritual beliefs including druidism and another team member is a Norse shaman.\n\nPeter McDaniels' version of Ecto-1 is a former police interceptor that he has adapted for his Ghostbuster gigs.

(Courtesy Peter McDaniels)\n\nThe Casper-based Ghostbuster mobile has been on missions across the state. (Courtesy Peter McDaniels) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nStubborn Spirit\n\nTheir attempts to get rid of the spirit by blessing the house did not work. He claims it was forced into a back room. McDaniels had read about a dybbuk box used in Jewish tradition that is supposed to be able to contain a spirit. So, he tried using one.\n\n\u201cWe kind of forced this thing into the dybbuk box and sealed it,\u201d he said. McDaniels said as he was talking to the man at the house, he placed the box by the front tire of his Ghostbuster car and the tire deflated. He had to pump it up to leave.\n\nThere was another hurdle as well. Weather at the time was cold and the ground hard, so he couldn\u2019t bury the box as would be his practice. So, he kept it in a storage area at his house. McDaniels noticed the wax seal that he put on the box kept cracking. He needed to keep sealing it nearly every day.\n\nThen his radio started to flip on in his house at random times and the song coming out of the speakers would have a lyric such as \u201cset me free\u201d or \u201clet me loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, no buddy, that\u2019s not how this works,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cAs soon as it was warm enough we went and buried the box and all of that stopped afterwards.\u201d\n\nHe said the man in the house never had issues again as well.\n\n\u2018Get Out\u2019\n\nThe 39-year-old talks about an incident several years ago when he went to a trailer in the \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d as he was receiving training from a woman he labels a \u201cChristian witch.\u201d\n\nThe trailer sat on a plot of land that was said to have had a Native American burial ground underneath it. He said he entered the trailer and it was dark and he was trying to feel his way around and made it to a bedroom and sat on the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of sitting there trying to feel things out and I felt the bed depress behind me like someone was standing on it and then I hear the words \u2018get out\u2019 whispered in my ear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, I calmly stood up, and I walked out the front door and I got into the car next to the lady that was helping us. And she said, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018nope,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt scared me, oh man, it scared me.\u201d\n\nDale Killingbeck can be reached at dale@cowboystatedaily.com."

        "article_content": "A trio of stars just under 5,000 light-years away has absolutely smashed a long standing record.\n\nTIC 290061484 is a system of gravitationally bound stars consisting of a tightly-orbiting binary pair with a third star that circles both. Astonishingly, they're so close together the entire system would fit inside the orbit of Mercury.\n\nAnd that's not all. The tight trio seems to have another friend; there are hints of a fourth star describing a path at a much greater distance.\n\nAll three of the stars in the central trinary are on a collision course, destined to collide, merge, go supernova, and leave behind a single neutron star, in around 20 million years.\n\nThe discovery was made using the TESS exoplanet-hunting space telescope, which is optimized for detecting the minute changes in the brightness of a star that indicate an orbiting world.\n\nSystems of stars that eclipse each other along our line of sight also demonstrate changes in brightness, as the stars pass in front of each other and block at least some of each other's light. TESS's observations can detect these brightness changes, too. This is a powerful tool for finding these systems, because, from the distance at which we see them, they usually just look like a single star.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nThis is the case with the central trinary of TIC 290061484. The orbital plane on which they are all aligned is pretty much edge-on to our line of sight, meaning that we're treated to different eclipse configurations as the three stars go about their cosmic dance.\n\nA team of scientists led by astrophysicist Veselin Kostov of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center discovered the system after an extensive analysis of TESS data. They used a machine learning algorithm to filter the data based on the expected signal of star system eclipses, and then set a tiny army of citizen scientists loose on the results to refine it further.\n\n\"We're mainly looking for signatures of compact multi-star systems, unusual pulsating stars in binary systems, and weird objects,\" says physicist Saul Rappaport of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"It's exciting to identify a system like this because they're rarely found, but they may be more common than current tallies suggest.\"\n\nOnce they had identified the system as one of interest, the researchers could then analyze the changes in its light to determine its characteristics.\n\nThe two stars making up the central binary clock in at 6.85 and 6.11 times the mass of the Sun, with an orbital period of just 1.8 days.\n\nThe third star has a mass of 7.9 times the Sun's and orbits the central pair with a period of 24.5 days. That period blows the previous known smallest trinary, with an orbital period of 33 days, out of the water.\n\nFinally, the probable fourth star would have a mass of about 6.01 times the mass of the Sun. It is estimated to circle the central trinary on a much, much wider orbit of about 3,200 days.\n\nStars are born from abnormally dense regions of matter within vast clouds of gas. Usually, such clouds are speckled with a number of baby stars, some of which drawing close enough to merge, others to spend their lives together locked in orbit.\n\nMost of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy are in systems like these. When you look up into the night sky, more than half the stars you see are actually multiple stars, too distant to discern.\n\nWe know there are multiple-star systems out there that we haven't yet identified. This discovery suggests that there may be many more out there than we imagined. The next step will be to turn the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope to the task of finding them, once it reaches the skies.\n\n\"Before scientists discovered triply eclipsing triple star systems, we didn't expect them to be out there,\" says astronomer Tam\u00e1s Borkovits of the Baja Observatory of The University of Szeged in Hungary. \"But once we found them, we thought, well why not? Roman, too, may reveal never-before-seen categories of systems and objects that will surprise astronomers.\"\n\nThe research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal."

(Kyusung Gong / Associated Press)\n\nIn what is becoming an almost annual event, Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur on Sunday will be scheming to help defeat his brother, Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur.\n\nMatt LaFleur, 44, was the Rams\u2019 offensive coordinator under coach Sean McVay in 2017. Mike LaFleur, 37, is in his second season with the Rams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of getting old hat now,\u201d Mike LaFleur, who was previously on coaching staffs with the Cleveland Browns, Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers and New York Jets, said of the matchup against his brother. \u201cIt seems like we play every year right now\u2026. The only thing I look forward to, outside of the challenge that we have on Sunday, is getting to see my nephew that gets to come into town.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, the Packers defeated the Rams at Lambeau Field.\n\nMike LaFleur said he spoke with his brother early in the week but refrained from discussing schematics. Defensive coordinator Chris Shula probably was thinking more about Matt, Mike said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking more about having to go against that [defensive] personnel that they got that\u2019s really talented, athletic and the scheme that they\u2019re doing,\u201d Mike said.\n\nBut what about extended family members?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my mom likes it,\u201d Mike said, \u201cbut again, I said that last year too and I probably said that the year before that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing all the time. I think everyone\u2019s just getting used to it. I don\u2019t think anyone really enjoys it that much. We got a job to do, and we know what we want as a result.\u201d\n\nSo if Matthew Stafford throws a long touchdown pass to Tutu Atwell on Sunday, how will Lafleur\u2019s mother react?\n\n\u201cMy mom likes me more,\u201d Mike joked, \u201cso she\u2019s cheering for me.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Beginning in the late 2000s, tech enthusiasts and journalists \u2014 including the cofounders of Technical.ly \u2014 recognized that tech startup culture was spreading beyond Silicon Valley. They launched blogs and news sites to cover emerging communities in other cities.\n\n\n\nStorytelling is a crucial yet often overlooked component of building innovation ecosystems. It promotes local culture, connects communities and guides new participants, but remains the least addressed part of the \u201cInnovation Ecosystem Stack.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany dedicated local tech media outlets have struggled to survive in a crowded digital landscape. At the same time, there\u2019s a growing desire among innovation ecosystem leaders for their region\u2019s narrative to gain recognition \u2014 both within and beyond their immediate community.\n\nLooking back, I got plenty of grief as a 20-something journalist reporting on tech and startups in Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\nBack in 2008, neither the subject matter nor those cities were taken seriously. But two friends and I realized no newspaper would hire us, and we believed Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture was already spreading to other cities. The year prior, Wall Street Journal veterans launched AllThingsD to add journalistic rigor to tech startup coverage, which TechCrunch had begun in 2005.\n\nIt seemed clear that the rise of the internet, software and consumer electronics could be found anywhere there were enough smart, forward-thinking people. We weren\u2019t alone.\n\nFrom the late 2000s through the early 2010s, other under-employed journalists and tech enthusiasts started tracking local startup communities through spreadsheets, maps and social media. Many launched newsletters, blogs, and news sites \u2014 like Technical.ly.\n\nMost of these efforts have come and gone, reflecting the broader and ongoing challenges of the local news business. But as tech becomes more central to economic strategy, civic leaders are investing more in workforce and entrepreneurship programs. With local newsrooms shrinking, there are fewer places for people to follow those investments \u2014 and even fewer outlets to tell stories beyond their immediate community.\n\nThat\u2019s why the least solved part of what I call the \u201cInnovation Ecosystem Stack\u201d is storytelling \u2014 aka publishing narrative change about a specific scene. It\u2019s the role I want Technical.ly to play in more places (hmu if you wanna talk about it!).\n\nIn 2019, Technical.ly produced a report for the Kauffman Foundation on how local entrepreneurship communities were getting news and information. Five years and a pandemic later, I returned to that report and want to share what I see.\n\nWhat kind of storytelling do you want\u2026or is it a need?\n\nThe onset and effects of the pandemic reversed declines in entrepreneurship, underscored the need for digital access and reinforced demand for a STEM workforce. Every US state now has at least one organization focused on startups or technology \u2014 or both.\n\nWith growth comes complexity. In a community\u2019s early days, a few key connectors can serve as nodes of information. Eventually, startup and tech activity grow to a point where it\u2019s not possible for a few individual connectors to do this on their own. Rather than a problem, it\u2019s actually a sign of success.\n\nBy my count, however, there are currently less than two dozen dedicated publications focused on a given region\u2019s tech and startup issues.\n\nMost specialize only in startups and are based in a single market. A notable exception is BostInno, a startup blog founded in 2008 that was acquired in 2012 by American City Business Journals (ACBJ). The \u201cInno\u201d brand is now used for ACBJ\u2019s tech coverage across multiple markets, though much of it is behind a hard paywall.\n\nA few publishers, including Technical.ly, pair important information sharing with original reporting on hard-but-useful truths.\n\nThe biggest tech markets, Silicon Valley and New York City, are awash in national tech and business coverage, though they each have local resources too, like the San Jose Mercury\u2019s SiliconValley.com and AlleyWatch. Chicago\u2019s Crain\u2019s has built a well-liked tech vertical, and publications like GeekWire in Seattle and dot.LA in Los Angeles have emerged to serve their respective communities.\n\nSmaller hubs also use storytelling to connect local ecosystems: Around the same time we launched Technical.ly, Silicon Prairie News became a beloved resource across the Midwest, and in 2022 was donated to the Nebraska Journalism Trust, where it continues. The Research Triangle\u2019s local NBC affiliate has published its TechWire since 2002.\n\nLike Technical.ly today, all of those are independent news resources, offering distance from the people and organizations directly creating programming for startups. That\u2019s in contrast to respected efforts like Startland News in Kansas City and Refresh Miami in Florida, which are different in that they\u2019re entrepreneur support organizations that employ journalists.\n\nSeveral other efforts don\u2019t employ journalists at all, and most avoid challenging subject matter \u2014 like, say, a failing startup or touchy issues with elected officials.\n\nNo matter their provenance, all these publications share a common goal: to promote the local innovation culture and guide new entrants to the ecosystem. A few, including Technical.ly, go further by reporting on the hard truths and uncomfortable realities within the local scene.\n\nLocal startup news is easy to envision, hard to sustain\n\nWhile most local efforts focus on internal storytelling, many civic leaders want their innovation stories to reach outside their markets.\n\nThis can be a challenge for single-market publications, though good stories occasionally break through. In a recent survey, nearly a third of Technical.ly readers reported researching regions beyond their own.\n\nWith limited storytelling resources, local business and talent attraction executives often lump a variety of tactics under the \u201cstorytelling\u201d banner \u2014 including standalone websites with catchy slogans, splashy photos and flattering data. Some organizations have gone further, such as Milwaukee\u2019s chamber of commerce, which launched in 2022 its own standalone news site focused on startups.\n\nWhat most efforts overlook is how tough it is to sustain a media business.\n\nWith digital tools, the cost to start an online publication is effectively zero, but a crowded marketplace has spiraled the cost of growing an audience. Of roughly 150 regions with some entrepreneur or tech engagement strategy, fewer than 15% of regions have a dedicated news resource.\n\nThe best evidence of how difficult this work is can be found in the number of efforts that no longer exist. After changing ownership in 2018, Tech.co, founded as TechCocktail by Frank Gruber and Jen Consalvo, was turned into a tech review site. The erratic COVID era was especially challenging: Multi-local, biotech-focused Xconomy, Iowa-focused Clay&Milk and Midwest minded Mug.news all ceased publishing. And these were the strongest. Many more never got to their level of traction.\n\nFifteen years after launching Technical.ly, the beat\u2019s importance has grown. The examples of doing it well haven\u2019t."
