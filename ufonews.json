A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward. blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\n(Image: Freelance)\n\nThey are amongst 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated interactive map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States.\n\nAnd last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).\n\nExperts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence.\n\nA quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

Credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAdult content, including AI-generated nudes, remains banned on Facebook and Instagram, despite recent policy changes at Meta.\n\nHowever, that hasn't stopped \"nudify\" apps \u2014 platforms that create nonconsensual AI-generated nudes of celebrities and influencers \u2014 from advertising on Meta's platforms. And those ads have been extremely successful for at least one service called Crush AI.\n\nAccording to a new report from 404Media , as originally reported in Alexios Mantzarlis' Faked Up newsletter, the Crush AI modifier app receives the vast majority of its traffic from Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. According to Similarweb's data, last month Crush AI received more than a quarter of a million visits to its service \u2014 and roughly 90 percent of that traffic was from Meta's platforms.\n\nCrush AI makes it quite clear what the purpose of its service is in its advertisements. The company's ads include photos of real-life individuals like Instagram influencer and model Mikayla Demaiter and OnlyFans creator Sophie Rain. The ads boast that users can \"upload a photo\" and \"erase anyone's clothes.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Crush AI creates fake profile pages using AI-generated profile pictures and runs new ads using those pages. The ads promote different domain names that then redirect to Crush AI when clicked.\n\nMashable has previously reported on other deepfakes and AI platforms that utilize Meta's advertising platform to generate traffic and revenue from AI-generated adult content. These ads are strictly against Meta's policies, and the company often removes them once it becomes aware of specific advertisements.\n\nHowever, as 404Media previously reported , Meta appears to have different standards for ad moderation. Policy-breaking content published by users as Facebook or Instagram posts will often be automatically detected by Meta and subsequently removed. Yet, that same content will not be detected when uploaded to Meta's advertising platform."

Like, one of my favorite memes I've seen so far is just like, \"hello, Americans, show us your cats!\" Like, if there's one thing that binds the internet, it's that we all love cat pictures, you know?\"While China has for years tightly controlled its cyberspace through its \"Great Firewall\" - and Chinese social media platforms have in the past run separate domestic and abroad versions of their apps, RedNote is unique as it only maintains one version of its app and it gives both Chinese and American users a rare opportunity to interact directly with each other.\"I'm not sure how many of the new users will actually stick around and hang out. But I hope that they do.\"\"Because I think that that would be a really important shift in cultural exchange that for the first time in a long time, puts the ball in China's court a little bit more. But then even more specifically, puts the ball in the hands of Chinese people in China.\"In China, RedNote as a platform is popular for finding recommendations for beauty, travel or food.On Wednesday many of its users posted selfies and messages welcoming new American users.Though Beijing-based academic Liu Xingliang, who studies the digital economy, says RedNote was caught unprepared.\"It is an accident. But since it is an accident, it is actually good for them, and there also may be certain risks. If they want to catch this wave of prosperity, I think they may have to do at least a few things. The first thing is to make your interface and UI more friendly.\"\"It is the first time that a large number of people have had such a very large-scale exchange, and the exchanges between the two sides are relaxed and enthusiastic. From what I've seen, they were all learning about each other's living habits, local conditions and customs.\"There were also signs that some new foreign users were testing the platform's censorship limits with some posting on social media network X that they were unable to post about topics known to be sensitive in China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.For now - China's welcoming the migration of TikTokers to RedNote with open arms.Chinese state media CCTV ran reports saying that TikTok users had found a \"new home\".And China's foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday the use of social media is a \"personal choice\", and China \"encourages and supports\" people-to-people exchanges."

            "article_content": "To ring in 2025, several folks gathered at the Chadron Public Library for a chance to get an eye on some spooks at the building. While there were no books flying off the shelves or any spiteful spirits looking to harm anyone, there certainly was a lot of activity happening on devices provided by Richard Dabney and apps that participants downloaded.\n\nFollowing the event, Dabney stated, \u201cWe got some interesting results from the ghost hunt.\u201d He found several \"electronic voice phenomena\" and a possible paranormal photo. He shared them with a friend in Omaha who has paranormal experience and thinks they might be the real deal and not recordings of people who were in the group.\n\nDabney also utilized a Ovilus spirit box, through which several words could be heard, as well as flashlights that would flicker, or turn off or on when questions were asked without anyone touching them.\n\n\u201cI have been ghost hunting since around 2005 after accidentally getting some inexplicable orbs and mists in photos taken with my first digital camera, the orbs showing up in large quantities at Athens State University in Alabama during a bluegrass music festival, and some background research revealing that two of the oldest buildings there were widely believed to be haunted by the locals and students,\u201d Dabney said.\n\n\u201cIn Chadron I captured my first EVP recordings at the Olde Main Street Inn using a small Sony mp3 recorder, that place is so haunted EVP'S can be captured in the parking lot and across the street as well! The Bean Broker is also a great place for ghosts, with objects occasionally getting bumped off shelves or moved around inexplicably, and EVP'S often happening unexpectedly when recording radio announcements, abruptly inserted between the announcer's words.\u201d\n\nDabney has also expressed interest in having another \u201cghost hunt\u201d in the former Chadron Record building.\n\nRegardless if the phenomena on Dec. 31 was actually ghosts helping ring in the New Year, Library Director Rosella Tesch said there have been some unexplained events. There was a lot of active phenomena back in the \u201870s, she said, and the janitor at the time had seen an apparition of a woman in white. Another staff member confirmed the sighting, she added.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I have seen books moving,\u201d Tesch said, noting that things seem to happen during the day more than the night. \u201cI saw one shelf, all the books moved.\u201d Staff have also found books on the floor during mornings, and during the Covid pandemic when absolutely no patrons allowed in the building staff would get frustrated because they would organize books to come back and find them out of order.\n\nAside from the books, custodial staff have seen lights turn off by themselves at night when nobody else is around.\n\n\u201cIt might be months with nothing happening, and then something goofy happens,\u201d Tesch said. While nobody has gotten hurt, she said, \u201cyou never know.\u201d\n\nThe library formerly utilized the annex building for a regular ghost hunt, though Tesch said, \u201cthat place was really weird and bizarre.\u201d She recalled one of the hunts, during Halloween, resulted in some very strange photos, and she once saw a floating orb.\n\n\u201cThat place was disconcerting,\u201d she said of the annex. \u201cI could never be there on my own.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Claudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall. The six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d She and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said. They're not alone. Surging auto insurance premiums, driven by the rising cost of claims and other factors, have led to a record number of consumers shopping for cheaper policies. Analytics company LexisNexis Risk Solutions ranked New York third among the states with the largest annual increases in shopping growth in the third quarter of 2024, reporting a 58% jump. The most expensive auto insurance in 2024 in Nassau County\u2014and on Long Island \u2014 was in an Inwood ZIP code, 11096, where the annual average premium was $4,464 last year, 52% higher than a year earlier, according to The Zebra, an insurance comparison company. The second-highest premium was in a Valley Stream ZIP code, 11581, where the 2024 average was $4,436, a 53% hike from the 2023 price. Nassau County's average insurance rates are higher than Suffolk County's, partly due to Nassau's higher wages and its proximity to heavily congested New York City, which has the state's highest premiums. But Suffolk car owners are still feeling the pinch. The highest auto insurance rate in Suffolk County was in a Brentwood ZIP code, 11717, where the annual average premium in 2024 reached $3,653 \u2014 a 43% increase compared to 2023, according to The Zebra. A Central Islip ZIP code, 11722, ranked second with a $3,640 average premium in 2024 \u2014 also a 43% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the statewide average rose 50% to $2,526 last year compared to the national average, which increased 19% to $2,189, according to The Zebra\u2019s \u201c2025 Auto Insurance Trends Report.\u201d The rising costs are leading some car owners to make difficult decisions, experts said. An increasing number of motorists are going uninsured, said David Seider, chief commercialization officer at The Zebra, which is based in Austin, Texas. \"The trend is totally understandable, as Americans have grappled with how to manage basic household spending amidst rapidly inflating costs on everything from groceries to rent,\" Seider said. Car insurance prices are rising for several reasons, including an increase in the number of car accidents and their severity, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a Malvern, Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that represents the insurance industry. \u201cThere have also been more fatalities and injuries, leading to increased attorney involvement in claims,\u201d institute spokeswoman Loretta L. Worters said. Cars are being built with more advanced technology, which saves lives but also makes repairs more costly, she said. Wildfires, flooding and other weather disasters also are a factor in insurers raising rates to account for financial losses, according to The Zebra report, which cited the 24 separate billion-dollar weather events last year in the U.S., including Hurricanes Helene and Milton on the East Coast. While the rising costs of parts and labor to repair cars contribute to higher insurance premiums, a bigger factor is the greed of insurance companies whose rate hikes have exceeded the nation\u2019s overall rate of inflation, argued Michael DeLong, a research and advocacy associate at the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. \u201cAnd most of the [states\u2019] insurance regulators are letting them get away with it,\u201d he said. Insurers seeking to raise premiums in the state must get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, but there are exceptions. The state has a \u201cflex rating\u201d law that allows insurers to raise premiums by an average of less than 5% in a 12-month period without seeking department approval. \u201cAll auto rates, whether prior approval or flex rating, must be actuarially justified and cannot be excessive, inadequate, destructive of competition, or detrimental to the solvency of insurers,\u201d according to the agency, which said that it reviews applications individually. Insurance companies consider several factors when calculating auto premiums, including consumers\u2019 driving records, education, occupations, credit scores, ages and genders. They also consider ZIP codes, which take into account the prevalence of auto insurance fraud, costs of medical care and weather in the area. New York, California, Georgia, Hawaii and Massachusetts have banned insurance companies from considering consumers\u2019 education and occupations when setting auto policy rates, DeLong said. While the price of auto insurance is surging in New York, the number of insured vehicles is declining. Registration suspensions for uninsured vehicles increased by 25,959, or 7%, to 406,051 statewide between 2022 and 2024, according to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. The number of tickets that police wrote to drivers operating uninsured vehicles in the state grew by 5,711, or 9%, to 70,733 between 2022 and 2023, according to the DMV. The 2024 ticket data is not available yet. But the number is expected to be a few thousand higher than the amount in 2023, the agency said. The DMV cannot definitively attribute the increase in registration suspensions and tickets for uninsured vehicles to the rising costs of auto insurance, according to the agency. The rate of uninsured driving is increasing in some states by as much as 30%, said Shannon Martin, insurance analyst at Bankrate, a Manhattan-based consumer financial services company. But driving without insurance is a risk that should be avoided. \u201cAllowing car insurance to lapse due to non-payment can trigger a range of issues, including state fines and higher insurance rates when the policy is reissued,\u201d Martin said. Instead of dropping insurance, drivers should discuss with their insurers removing unnecessary coverage, or consider switching to a usage-based insurance policy, she said. Stony Brook resident Lee Chaconas, 67, was able to apply discounts to her Geico policy for her 2019 Honda Accord, she said. A retired Geico personal-injury claims adjuster, Chaconas pays $789 for a six-month premium with a 10% discount because she is a member of the insurer\u2019s credit union and an additional 10% discount for taking a defensive driving course every three years, she said. But with her premium increasing $20 to $30 annually, \u201cwhich adds up,\u201d she doesn\u2019t plan to ever buy another car if she can help it. \u201cThey\u2019re going to bury me in that car,\u201d she said. Insurance companies experienced big profit losses in 2022, as steep inflation drove up the costs of repairs, labor and used cars. They have raised rates in the past few years to try to offset those losses. \u201cInsurance companies now are running to the bank with record profits,\" said Aaron J. Stein, president of Norton & Siegel Inc., an insurance agency in Babylon. \"They\u2019re trying to make up for the years they lost, but at some point \u2026 this is a problem.\u201d Geico\u2019s underwriting profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. In the third quarter of 2024, Progressive\u2019s revenue grew 25% to $19.5 billion compared to the same period a year earlier. The company had 33.9 million active insurance policies, a 14% increase from the same period in 2023. In New York state, Geico, State Farm, Allstate and Progressive accounted for 70.87% of the market share for auto insurers in 2023, according to a report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Among the insurers with more than $100 million in written premiums in the state, State Farm had the biggest auto insurance rate increase for renewing customers last year, an average of 24.9%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a Manhattan-based financial analysis provider. State Farm, New York's second-largest auto insurer, said it has experienced unprecedented growth in its car insurance business in the state. \u201cWhile it is a privilege to be chosen by so many New York drivers, it is important that our rates are adequate to support the business and that we\u2019re able to match price to risk,\u201d said Justin Tomczak, a spokesman for the Bloomington, Illinois-based company. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Co. had the second-largest car insurance rate increase in New York last year, averaging 18.7%, according to S&P. The insurer did not respond to requests for comment. Progressive, which averaged increases of 19.7% in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024, also did not respond. Geico is New York state's largest auto insurer, holding 28.37% of the market share in 2023, according to NAIC. Geico had an average New York car insurance rate hike of 7% in March 2024 and a 10% increase in August 2023, according to S&P. Newsday asked Geico about the premiums it charges in the state and why it has increased them. The Chevy Chase, Maryland-based company forwarded the inquiry to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, which responded by email: \u201cAcross the country, auto insurance premiums have been on the rise for the simple reason that the cost of things that auto insurance pays for has been rising,\" said Kristina Baldwin, vice president in state government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based association. \"The cost of medical care for accident victims continues to increase as well as the cost of the parts and labor to repair vehicles.\u201d She also cited riskier behavior, including distracted and impairing driving, as factors that are increasing injury and collision claim costs and compounding the effects of inflation. Between 2019 and 2023, car crashes in the state fell 18% to 418,687, but fatal crashes rose 16% to 1,022, according to the Institute for Traffic Safety Management & Research. On Long Island, crashes dropped 5% to 77,547, while fatal crashes grew by nearly a fifth, reaching over 200 annually. Insurance rate increases are expected to continue in 2025 across Long Island, New York and the nation, but will likely proceed more modestly than in the past two years as inflationary pressure eases on the cost of repairing and replacing damaged vehicles, said Tim Zawacki, insurance sector strategist at S&P. The second half of the year should bode better for consumers, he said. \u201cAssuming no unexpected economic events, we would expect price competition to pick up across markets,\" he said. \"And we\u2019re already seeing carriers spend significantly more money on advertising seeking to attract new customers.\"\n\nClaudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall.\n\nThe six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said.\n\nThey're not alone.

Named Anello di Accumulazione (AdA), the experiment was the world\u2019s first collider of matter and antimatter.\n\nThrough new research published in +, Luisa Bonolis, a historian of physics from MPIWG in Berlin, together with particle physicists Franco Buccella from INFN Roma1 and Giulia Pancheri at INFN Frascati Laboratories, tell the little-known story how AdA\u2019s theoretical foundations were shaped by the collaboration between Bruno Touschek and Raoul Gatto: two pioneering physicists with a deep knowledge of the properties of fundamental particles.\n\nBuilt at Frascati in 1961, AdA was a ring-shaped collider around 1.3 metres in diameter, which operated until 1964. Despite its short lifetime, the experiment lay vital groundwork for ADONE: an electron-positron collider 105 metres in diameter, which would go on to operate until 1993.\n\nThis larger collider helped to refine the methods, which in 1974, would lead to the groundbreaking discovery of the J/psi meson. This particle was crucial in advancing our understanding of quarks and their interactions \u2013 ultimately paving the way for the discovery of the Higgs boson several decades later.\n\nTouschek is well known for his contributions to the AdA experiment, but less is known about the crucial role played by his friend, Gatto, who he met in Rome in 1953. In their paper, the team investigate the collaboration between the pair based on a wide range of available sources: including Gatto\u2019s personal exchanges with Touschek, and their own private communications with Gatto.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings highlight the close friendship between the two scientists, and paint a picture of the discussions between them which would prove the feasibility of collider rings as tools for probing the world of elementary particles.\n\nThe paper also explores the duo\u2019s friendship with Wolfgang Pauli and Gerhard L\u00fcders, whose theoretical work was a vital basis for AdA\u2019s success, and highlights Touschek and Gatto\u2019s contribution in mentoring many of the great Italian physicists whose work would shape the foundations of the Standard Model.\n\nReference\n\nL Bonolis, F Buccella, G Pancheri.

            "article_content": "NEW DELHI \u2014 The recent death of an Indian man working for the Russian army in Ukraine has brought renewed focus to the Kremlin\u2019s use of foreign nationals on the front lines \u2014 from North Koreans to Cubans \u2014 and revived a thorny issue in the otherwise thriving relationship between New Delhi and Moscow.\n\nNearly 100 Indians have been lured to Russia by offers of jobs or education, only to find themselves forced into service by the army, according to Indian government statements and interviews with families of men sent to fight in Ukraine. This month, Binil Babu, a 32-year-old electrician from the southern state of Kerala, became at least the 10th Indian to die in the war, drawing a sharp response from officials here.\n\n\u201cThe matter has been strongly taken up with the Russian authorities in Moscow as well as with the Russian Embassy in New Delhi today,\u201d a spokesman for India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe have also reiterated our demand for the early discharge of the remaining Indian nationals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoscow has consistently denied any wrongdoing on its part and promised to release Indians from its armed forces. \u201cThe Russian Government has at no point of time been engaged in any public or obscure campaigns, more so in fraudulent schemes to recruit the Indian nationals for military service in Russia,\u201d the Russian Embassy in New Delhi said in an Aug. 10 statement.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in July he would not comment on this topic \u201cin any way,\u201d and there have been no other official Russian statements about it, though Russian media reported that it was discussed in meetings between the countries\u2019 leaders.\n\nDespite the close coordination between the two governments, Indian recruits like Babu are unable to escape the fighting, reportedly because of the Russian military\u2019s unwillingness to let them go. The allegedly fraudulent recruitment has emerged over the last year as a recurring point of tension between India and Russia, even as the two countries have expanded their economic and military ties.\n\n\u201cIt is very painful to see innocent Indians still getting caught up in the conflict there,\u201d said Ashwin Mangukiya, whose 23-year-old son Hemil was the first Indian to be killed in the war last year. \u201cThe Indian government has failed to stop this by arresting the agents who take advantage of people\u2019s ignorance to lure them into dangerous jobs.\u201d\n\nFamilies say most of the unwitting recruits were duped by an international network of employment agents and social media influencers, who promised them high wages for low-skilled jobs such as driving, cooking, plumbing and electrical repairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo Indian men reached by phone in Ukraine last year told The Washington Post that upon arriving in the war zone, they were made to sign Russian documents they could not read and that their passports were confiscated. They said they were later forced to fight alongside Russian soldiers with very little military training.\n\nAfter several of India\u2019s citizens were killed on the front lines last year, Indian officials took up the issue with their Russian counterparts and secured the release of dozens of men pressed into military service. In a July meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanded the early release of those who had been \u201cmisled.\u201d\n\nYet some remain entangled in the conflict. Last month, responding to a question in Parliament, an Indian government official confirmed that 19 Indian citizens were still serving in the Russian army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lingering issue has been a rare sore spot in a relationship that has grown considerably in recent years. Trade between India and Russia has increased since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, helping to blunt the impact of Western sanctions on Moscow. India is now the second-largest importer of Russian crude oil, after China, with purchases amounting to $46 billion in the last fiscal year, according to statistics released by India\u2019s Commerce Ministry.\n\nBefore his death, Babu had been pleading for months with the Indian Embassy in Moscow to secure his release from the Russian army, the Indian Express newspaper reported.\n\nHis brother-in-law, Saneesh Scaria, told The Washington Post by telephone from Kerala that \u201cthe Indian Embassy in Moscow asked Binil to tell his commander that Prime Minister Modi had canceled all their agreements. But the commander told him he could only go after their one-year contract was complete.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNearly a year ago, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation launched a human trafficking probe against at least 19 individuals and private companies accused of luring workers to Russia, according to the official complaint.\n\nIn addition to preying on those seeking employment, agents also targeted Indian students \u201cfor admission in dubious private universities in Russia,\u201d investigators said in their complaint.\n\nFour arrests were made in May, on charges of fraud, human trafficking and criminal conspiracy, but the suspects have since been released on bail, and there has been noreported movement in the case since."

            "article_content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 After more than a year of painstaking negotiations, Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to a ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip that, if implemented, could see nearly three dozen Israeli hostages reunited with their families and give hungry and displaced Palestinians a reprieve from months of violence.\n\nIsrael\u2019s government still needs to formally approve the deal, in a vote officials say will take place Thursday morning. But the agreement could mark a first step toward ending a 15-month war that has destroyed Gaza and divided Israelis.\n\nThe truce, mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, would begin on Sunday and cover an initial period of 42 days.\n\nPalestinians in Khan Younis celebrated the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. (Video: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis is one of the toughest negotiations I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d President Joe Biden said Wednesday in remarks from the White House. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply satisfied this day has come \u2026 for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\u201d\n\nUnder the first six-week phase of what mediators hope will evolve into a three-stage process for peace, 33 of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2014 mainly women, children, the elderly and wounded \u2014 will be released from Hamas captivity in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli detention, in a carefully choreographed sequence that will involve humanitarian groups and coordination between Hamas, Egypt and Israel.\n\nAmong the 33 captives slated for release are Americans Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDekel-Chen was wounded in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Siegel, 65, will be freed because of his age. A third U.S. citizen, Edan Alexander, was abducted near Gaza while serving in the Israeli military and won\u2019t be released until the second phase of the ceasefire.\n\nHamas agreed to release five female Israeli soldiers in the first phase. The remains of at least four more Americans are also still in Gaza. \u201cWe are committed to getting the remains out,\u201d the official said.\n\nIsrael and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Jan. 15, following more than 15 months of devastating war. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)\n\nIsrael will withdraw troops from some parts of Gaza and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into the enclave, where 90 percent of the population, or 1.9 million people, are displaced in squalid conditions with little food, water or shelter from the cold.\n\nDuring the first phase, the volume of aid entering Gaza is supposed to reach more than 500 trucks per day, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday \u2014 a more than sixfold increase over the average number in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even once the bombs stop falling, steep challenges will remain in getting lifesaving assistance to civilians who need it, including abiding lawlessness in Gaza, destroyed roads and onerous Israeli inspection processes for cargoes entering the territory, aid workers say.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of hope and opportunity, but we should be under no illusions how tough it will still be to get support to survivors,\u201d U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said in a statement. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nMohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign affairs minister, spoke on Jan. 15, as Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire. (Video: Reuters)\n\nIsraeli forces will remain in a buffer zone along Gaza\u2019s borders, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a news conference in Doha, where negotiators spent the last few days hammering out the deal. After a week, if the truce holds, Palestinian civilians sheltering in southern and central Gaza will be allowed to return to the north, which in recent months has been decimated by intense Israeli bombardment and clashes with Hamas militants.\n\nSince October, Israeli forces have besieged the northernmost part of the enclave, blocking most aid and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. Israel divided the territory into a north and south with a line of fortified checkpoints known as the Netzarim Corridor just outside Gaza City, only occasionally allowing humanitarians to cross into northern areas.\n\nNegotiations for Phase 2 of the deal \u2014 during which the remaining living hostages would be released and Israel would withdraw completely from Gaza \u2014 are supposed to begin in the coming weeks. During Phase 3, Hamas would return the bodies of hostages who were killed and the reconstruction of Gaza would get underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal has offered a glimmer of hope in a conflict that has taken an immense human toll: Israeli attacks have killed more than 46,700 people in Gaza and injured more than 110,200, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 405 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.\n\nA war that began with Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel spiraled into a regional conflagration, marked by more than a year of exchanges of fire between Israel and its allies and Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThere was still much that could go wrong during the deal\u2019s implementation, and Israeli officials have emphasized that so far, it is a temporary pause. The thorniest questions \u2014 including who will govern and secure Gaza \u2014 remain unresolved, and negotiations over these and other issues are expected to begin later in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombardment of Gaza hasn\u2019t let up: At least 19 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across the territory on Wednesday night after the ceasefire was announced.\n\nStill, even before mediator Qatar declared that a deal was reached, celebrations broke out in Gaza and among hostage families and supporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a statement shortly after the announcement insisting that some details still needed to be worked out. But President-elect Donald Trump had already blasted out the news to the world, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cWE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday night, the parties were still arguing over the names of high-profile prisoners to be released under the agreement, according to an official familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s cabinet and members of his coalition government must vote on Thursday morning to approve the deal. His far-right allies in government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, both slammed the agreement as a bad deal that spares Hamas and threatened to withdraw from Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\nStill, the prime minister is widely expected to have enough votes to push through the agreement, and Israel\u2019s Supreme Court is expected to dismiss possible legal challenges to the deal.\n\n\u201cThis is an important move. This is a necessary move,\u201d Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in televised remarks Wednesday night, urging the government to make the ceasefire official. \u201cThere is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us \u2014 whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.\u201d\n\nLeaders from mediating countries appeared to dismiss the procedural steps in Israel as mere formalities. Qatar\u2019s Mohammed, Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi each declared victory after months of stop-and-start negotiations that repeatedly saw negotiators and intelligence chiefs huddle in Middle Eastern capitals, only to return home empty-handed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cToo many innocent people have died. Too many communities have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe mediators, at least for now, overcame the herculean task of reconciling the diametrically opposed positions of Israel and Hamas. Israel wanted to continue the fighting after a temporary pause and hostage-for-prisoner exchange, while Hamas insisted on a permanent end to the war before it would surrender any captives.\n\nBut pressure on both parties pushed them to close the gap. Netanyahu was under fire from hostage families and those who lost loved ones in the war. He was also in potential legal peril abroad, after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas was severely weakened after Israel killed its top leaders and kneecapped regional allies. Residents grew increasingly angry as they struggled to survive the punishing campaign Israel launched in response to the Hamas attacks.\n\nIn the end, the deal agreed to Wednesday aligns to a large extent with the phased approach Biden proposed in May: An initial pause in hostilities and release of hostages is intended to lead to \u201csustainable calm,\u201d according to a joint statement by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. Those three countries are meant to serve as guarantors of the deal, and Mohammed said a monitoring body would be established in Cairo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden and Trump each claimed credit for a diplomatic achievement closed through rare foreign-policy collaboration between the outgoing and incoming administrations. As Biden officials carried out the formal diplomacy, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, met with Netanyahu over the weekend to pressure the Israeli prime minister to agree to a deal before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nBiden said \u201cthis deal was developed and negotiated under my administration\u201d but that his officials had been speaking \u201cas one team\u201d with their soon-to-be successors in recent days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas leader Khalil al-Hayya hailed the ceasefire as a triumph for the militant group: \u201cToday we prove that the occupation will never defeat our people and their resistance,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHospitals in Israel are preparing to receive hostages who may be malnourished, injured or ill \u2014 and will certainly be traumatized, Israeli media reported.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, where thousands have gathered for months each Saturday night to protest the government\u2019s failure to bring all of the hostages home sooner, crowds beat drums and chanted.\n\n\u201cI hope it will not just be a ceasefire but a stop to the war,\u201d said Benjamin Terem, 65, from Tel Aviv. \u201cWe cannot stay in this situation.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, 20-year-old Farah Hathout said she was displaced nine times throughout the war. She woke up where she is sheltering in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, to check the news.\n\n\u201cIs it real? Have they signed?\u201d she said she asked herself.\n\n\u201cI pray it goes through,\u201d said Hathout, who was in tears. \u201cMay God compensate us for what we experienced.\u201d\n\nDeYoung reported from Washington, Shih from Jerusalem, Balousha from Toronto and Mahfouz from Cairo.

In 2023, Tesla's share stood at 19 percent before dropping to 18 percent in first nine months of 2024, according to analyses by EV Volumes published on CleanTechnica.\n\nThe competition is now hot on Tesla's heels. As Statista's Florian Zandt shows in the chart below, the Chinese conglomerate BYD, which produces standalone electric vehicle batteries and associated electronics in addition to plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, increased its market share by 9 percentage points between 2021 and 2024.\n\nInfographic: Tesla and BYD Claim a Third of the Global BEV Market | Statista\n\nYou will find more infographics at Statista\n\nAs CleanTechnica points out, BYD's market share in the BEV market might not increase that much in 2025 due to the manufacturer focusing on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the upcoming year.\n\nThe BEV portfolio of legacy automakers like Volkswagen and Geely-Volvo stood at 7 and 8 percent, respectively, while SAIC, which includes the joint venture between the Chinese state-owned SAIC Motor and Wuling as well as General Motors, also had a market share of 8 percent as of the most recently available data.\n\nBetween 2023 and January to September 2024, BYD's and Tesla's shares dropped by 1 percentage point each. BYD is focused on providing BEVs to a more general consumer base, while Tesla's products have a higher price tag. This difference might be slightly mitigated through the increase of tariffs on Chinese-made cars from 25 to 100 percent which came into effect in August 2024.\n\nAccording to EV Volumes, 14 million electric vehicles were sold globally in 2023, 70 percent of which were BEVs. However, 84 percent of all light vehicles sold still ran on traditional combustion engines or other non-electric fuel sources. The biggest exporter and market for both hybrids and BEVs was China with shares of 65 and 59 percent, respectively.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com"

            "article_content": "Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei. I hope 2025 has been kind to you so far.\n\nI am writing this week's newsletter having just finished attending my eighth year-end banquet hosted by Taiwanese tech suppliers since the middle of December -- and I have three more still to go. The year-end banquet, or weiya in Mandarin, is a traditional ritual for tech suppliers in Taiwan, who host the events ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays to show their gratitude to their tens of thousands of employees. The banquets include performances by the most popular singers of the year, lucky draws and endless supplies of alcohol (the companies always prepare empty containers at the exits of the venue with a big label saying \"puke barrel.\")\n\nI have always attended these events with joy, as I could meet longtime industry friends, exchange the latest industry information (sometimes gossip), and scream with excitement just like all the employees did when watching the great performances. At Pegatron's banquet this year, I found myself standing and dancing next to Vice Chairman Jason Cheng when famous Taiwanese band Accusefive were performing their hit songs on the stage, and I am pretty sure he was singing and dancing along, too. There was also an American company's head of procurement in Taiwan standing on a chair and dancing happily at contract PC maker Compal's year-end party.\n\nBut I attended this year's events with much more mixed feelings about the year ahead than before. Apart from AI, especially AI servers, I have not yet heard any tech suppliers expressing optimism about other tech sectors, including smartphones and PCs, that used to be the pillars of the industry. And supply chain sources are telling me that even the outlook for AI servers has become less certain due to increasing geopolitical complexities.\n\n\"Watch out for the stock markets this year. The AI supply chain is going to face a lot of turbulence,\" an executive with a server and graphic card distributor told me last night before I left a party.\n\nThe environment is certainly getting more volatile, especially after the Biden administration this week rolled out a flurry of export controls on semiconductors and AI data centers in its final attempts to curb China's tech prowess before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House on Monday.\n\nIn fact, just as I was about to wrap up this week's newsletter on Wednesday night and go to bed, my colleague Pak Yiu in New York pinged me and Annie Cheng Ting-Fang to let us know that the Biden administration made yet another announcement, this time aimed largely at TSMC and Samsung.\n\nNvidia and Apple supplier Quanta Vice Chairman C.C. Leung said to his employees: \"I don't know what in the world will happen after Jan. 20, but lately I've been thinking about mankind's history [and] all these challenges, hardships, struggles with nature and fights between men. We still managed to overcome them and move forward. We should keep working hard and never give up!\"\n\nI think that is quite the spirit to hold on to for this year.\n\nMaking memories\n\nChina's global market share for memory chips has surged from zero to 5% in just five years despite U.S. restrictions and is on course to climb to 10% this year, which would put pressure on global leaders Samsung and SK Hynix of South Korea and Micron of the U.S., Nikkei Asia's Cheng Ting-Fang and Lauly Li write.\n\nChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), a Hefei-based supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), is the major driver behind China's inroads in this industry and it is also working on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips for AI computing. Washington-blacklisted companies Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. (FJICC) and SwaySure are also making progress in DRAM.\n\nDRAM is a vital component in every type of electronic device, but it is extremely sensitive to market demand as it is also considered a \"commodity.\" The presence of these players, while small, is still significant and can easily affect the market.\n\nMusk to the rescue?\n\nOfficials in Beijing are discussing using billionaire Elon Musk as a broker in a potential sale of TikTok's U.S. operations, just days before the Chinese-owned social media app faces a ban from Washington, write the Financial Times' Madhumita Murgia and Zijing Wu.\n\nThe officials are hoping that Musk could help broker a deal that might prevent the platform from being forced to shut down, according to two people familiar with the talks. This includes Musk helping to persuade President-elect Donald Trump to avoid implementing a ban.\n\nThe discussions are \"very preliminary and mostly brainstorming\" at this stage, according to one of the people. They added that ByteDance and TikTok teams were still primarily focused on winning the legal battle with the U.S. government to stop the bill coming into effect.\n\nThe bill passed by Congress in April, which requires TikTok's Beijing-based parent ByteDance to sell its stake in the app or face a ban because of security concerns, comes into effect on Sunday.\n\nAn earlier Bloomberg report suggested that Chinese officials were discussing a sale of TikTok to Musk, the owner of social media app X and a close confidant of Trump.\n\nIn response to a question of whether Chinese officials had discussed such a sale to Musk, the company said, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from the Financial Times.\n\nIn the home stretch\n\nApple is in the final stage of verifying its first \"Made in America\" cutting-edge processing chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s first advanced chip manufacturing facility in the U.S. The first batch of commercial mass-produced chips is expected as early as this quarter, according to this scoop by Nikkei Asia's Cheng Ting-Fang. AMD and Nvidia are also running some wafer test production at TSMC's facility in Arizona.\n\nSuccessful commercial output would mark a significant victory for U.S. efforts to bring advanced semiconductor production back home from Asia.\n\nTSMC has endured a longer-than-expected learning curve for the Arizona plant since announcing its intention to build the facility in May 2020, such as a labor crunch, an incomplete supply chain, cultural differences, higher costs and lengthy permitting processes. Several suppliers to TSMC and Intel had postponed plans to build chemical facilities nearby, but some progress has resumed now that TSMC's plant is back on track.\n\nSlowing the flow\n\nChina has been tightening its customs checks on exports by Apple and other American tech companies since December, hindering their attempts to increase production capacity in Southeast Asia and India, writes Nikkei Asia's Lauly Li.\n\nCiting Beijing's newly introduced export controls on dual-use items and technologies, Chinese customs have been holding up some exports of materials and equipment for production use for days and even weeks, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\nSoutheast Asia and India have been the major beneficiaries of the supply chain diversification mega trend. American companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, HP and Dell all have built up certain new production capacity outside of China since the trade war. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose more tariffs on all Chinese goods is making such a shift even more urgent. However, these companies still rely on materials and equipment -- either existing or newly made -- exported from China to keep building up their new production lines elsewhere.\n\nSuggested reads\n\n1.

            "article_content": "Scientists studying a 5,000-year-old monument in the Middle East have made a startling discovery about the structure.\n\nCalled Rujm el-Hiri, it is often referred to as the 'Stonehenge of the East' due to its similarities to the English monument.\n\nOfficially called 'megalith' structures, it is scientific speak for prehistoric constructions put together using large stone with many of them found across Europe in particular; some 35,000 exist on the continent alone.\n\nAdvert\n\nRujm el-Hiri is not found in Europe, though, with it located in the Golan Heights region of Syria.\n\nRujm el-Hiri from the sky (MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat is Rujm el-Hiri?\n\nRoughly 16 kilometres inland from the Sea of Galilee, it is made up of more than 42,000 rocks arranged in concentric circles.\n\nAdvert\n\nAt the middle of it all is a large mound of rocks that is 15 foot high at its tallest point, which is roughly 4.6 metres.\n\nBut to this day people aren't quite sure what the point of Rujm el-Hiri is. Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

            "article_content": "The 29th Traditional Beijing New Year Goods Fair opens to visitors at the National Agricultural Exhibition Center on Jan 3, 2025 attracting eager shoppers. LI ZHIMING/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nMany famous people were born in the Year of the Snake. There's Polish astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), a major figure in the \"scientific revolution\", who established that Earth revolved around the sun, not the other way around. Then there's the greatest of German literary figures, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\n\nBut let's talk about years, not people. One of the traditions of the Year of the Snake in China is transformation. There have been plenty of bad \"snake\" years. One is reminded of the Great Depression and the Wall Street Crash of (October) 1929. Another year I would like to mention is 2001. It was the year when the Sept 11 terrorist attacks on the United States took place. It was also the year when China joined the World Trade Organization \u2014 which helped expedite China's economic development and integrate its economy with the global economy.\n\nLooking back at the past year, two trends stand out for me. One is the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East. The region is seeing a genocide being committed by the Israeli state, witnessed in real time on TV screens across the world. And the US is complicit in this genocide, with its global standing going down drastically, even in parts of the West. On the other hand, apart from the West and a few US ally countries, China's standing has improved across the world, because it has stood with the ordinary people against the Israeli and American ruling elite.\n\nThe other development is the continuing rise of BRICS, along with China's rising economic status throughout the world. The year 2024 saw the addition of several major countries to BRICS, with Indonesia becoming the first country to join the grouping in the first days of 2025.\n\nThe rise of BRICS frightens the US elite, because it symbolizes the loss of their global economic dominance because of the decline of the US dollar as the principal international reserve currency. Although the decline of the dollar is an ongoing process, the year 2024 saw the acceleration of the process.\n\nSo what about 2025? I believe it will be a good year for China. Of course, we have to take into account Donald Trump's return to the White House after four years and his threat to impose high tariffs on imports from China, as well as other countries.\n\nIf Trump imposes punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, I believe he will cause more damage to the US than China. Looking at recent history, we can clearly see that the Chinese people's spirit of independence and self-reliance is very strong. They will not cave in under the pressure of punitive US tariffs.\n\nSelf-reliance is a major part of Chinese culture, which has influenced China's development. The other features include the emphasis on education and resolving problems harmoniously. Despite the bad periods in China's history, Chinese people's resilience, fighting spirit and industriousness have seen them through many a crisis. Three factors stand out in all this.\n\nThe first is the Chinese people's love for peace. Contrary to what the Western media say, I regard China as a peace-loving country. Unlike the US, which has been at war throughout its entire history, China avoids war. The century of humiliation taught it that a country is better off strong than weak. However, that does not mean it wants war.\n\nThe second factor is China's emphasis on reducing pollution and moving toward a sustainable, green economy. China's leadership of the green revolution over the last few years has been extremely impressive. The country is now the global leader in electric vehicles (EVs), and solar and wind energy. This is a remarkable achievement, and shows China is sensitive to the dangers that climate change poses to our world.\n\nSome Western countries have recently accused China of \"over-production\" of EVs, which are important to build a sustainable, green world in the future. However, the Western countries have targeted China because they are afraid that they will lose their market share of vehicles to China. But their attitude is mean considering how important EVs are to sustainable living. More importantly, these countries don't mind dominating markets through \"over-production\" when it suits them.\n\nThe third factor is China's technological advancement. China's scientific prowess before the \"scientific revolution\" beginning in the 16th century was unsurpassed in the world. But after that, China failed to advance like the West. But those days are over, with China catching up with the West in terms of technology and in some ways even eclipsing the West.\n\nIn space research, China has moved ahead so fast that it became the first country to bring lunar rock samples from the far side of the moon. And despite Western attempts to hold it back, Huawei remains a global leader in innovative telecommunications.\n\nChina is a global leader also in artificial intelligence. Despite the controversy over the rapid development of AI and its implications on human society, its importance in the world is undeniable. Plus, AI will be a major determinant of the global geopolitical order.\n\nThe geostrategic balance of power in the world has changed greatly in the last half a century, in China's favor. China faces some major problems, economic and environmental, as do other countries. But the Chinese people seem to be overcoming their problems more sensibly and calmly than others. I think it is largely due to their culture of education, harmony, peace and rationality. I expect the coming Year of the Snake to see further Chinese advancement.\n\nThe author is a Sinologist and an emeritus professor at Griffith University in Australia.

            "article_content": "In 1980, amid the turmoil of the Iranian Revolution, Katayoon \u201cKatie\u201d Dehesh fled Iran on a cold October night, leaving behind the life she knew.\n\nStaying would have provided physical safety but at the expense of her intellectual and personal freedom. She would have lost the freedom to teach, to learn, and to engage with the world beyond Iran\u2019s borders. Compelled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and an unwavering desire to shape her own path, Dehesh embarked on a journey that would take her first to Germany and then to the United States, carrying with her a guiding mantra: be powerful.\n\nSince joining UC Riverside in 2016, Dehesh has led the Dehesh Lab as a distinguished professor and molecular biochemist, where she drives pioneering research in botany and plant sciences. As the Director of UC Riverside\u2019s Institute for Integrative Genome Biology, the holder of the Ernst and Helen Leibacher Endowed Chair, and a member of the German National Academy of Sciences, Dehesh has established herself as a leading figure in plant science.\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh, distinguished professor and molecular biochemist, discusses plant growth progress with a student in her lab on August 15, 2023. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nHer love for life \u2014 as well as her family, students, and for science \u2014 is palpable. That passion is what triggered her journey to freedom, one that she often recalls with picturesque memory.\n\n\u201cIt took four days by bus to reach the Turkish border, no flights were leaving Iran because of the Iran-Iraq war. We traveled at night with the headlights off. I was the only woman on board, and people assumed I was a prostitute,\u201d Dehesh said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t washed, gone 24 hours without food, and no hotel would rent me a room. When we reached Istanbul, I finally found a place to stay and barricaded the door with a bed. By dawn, I was buying my ticket to Germany, and I\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d\n\nStanding just above 5-feet, Dehesh\u2019s presence is grand. She walks in powerful strides and speaks with conviction. She did, after all, serve in the Iranian military, a requirement for working women with a Ph.D under the Shah. Though she initially dreamed of journalism, Dehesh\u2019s scientific journey took root during a university class trip to Maharloo Lake in southern Iran. Watching succulent plants thrive in saline waters, her curiosity sparked. This moment was the beginning of her fascination with plant biology.\n\n\u201cThe memory of those resilient succulent plants serves as a constant reminder of the boundless potential for discovery within the natural world. It underscores the power of nature to inspire and guide us toward our true callings,\u201d said Dehesh in a Q&A with the Association of American Universities, of which UCR is a member. \u201cFrom that moment forward, I embarked on a journey that would not only deepen my understanding of the botanical world but also lead to significant contributions in the field of plant biology.\u201d\n\nDehesh\u2019s passion for learning is contagious, and she is deeply committed to empowering women in science. She actively participates in conferences and collaborations aimed at supporting women, especially women of color, in scientific fields. She motivates her students too. In a recent lecture to 500 students, she paced the room, sparking discussions on lipids and membranes projected on large screens. Each time a student responded, she reinforced their confidence with a resounding \u201cPOWER!\u201d\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh, distinguished professor and molecular biochemist, teaches a biology class on lipids and membrane\u2014structure and function, on January 22, 2024. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nWithin her lab, Dehesh cultivates a culture of critical thinking, curiosity, and intellectual growth. Recently, she guided a discussion on plant senescence, challenging her lab members to think deeply about their hypotheses and methods. Her team describes her as a supportive mentor, encouraging them to balance their personal lives with their scientific pursuits.\n\n\u201cPersonal joy is as important as scientific joy,\u201d she often tells her team, embodying her belief in a balanced approach to life and work.\n\nDehesh\u2019s lab explores diverse topics, from understanding the breakdown of E. coli biofilms to uncovering how plants adapt to environmental stresses.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding flora is fundamental to understanding life across all species,\u201d she said, bridging insights from plant biology to broader ecological and interspecies connections. \u201cWe start with plants and move outward, exploring the fascinating overlaps and distinctions between plants and animals.\u201d\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh checks in with her lab team on August 15, 2023. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nHer commitment to diversity is central to her lab, where she brings together students from varied backgrounds and areas of expertise. Having experienced the challenge of adapting to new cultures, Dehesh values the richness of perspectives that diverse voices bring to academia.\n\nLeaving Iran meant accepting a permanent ban on returning, a price she willingly paid for the opportunity to pursue her dreams.\n\n\u201cAny success I achieve here comes with a responsibility to pay it forward,\u201d Dehesh said.\n\nThis commitment to mentorship inspires her to guide the next generation, encouraging them to overcome barriers and make meaningful contributions.\n\n\u201cIn the tapestry of life, resilience and adaptability are woven into success,\u201d Dehesh said. \u201cAs immigrants, our journeys are filled with both challenges and opportunities. Every hurdle you overcome is a steppingstone to your dreams. Embrace your experiences, they\u2019re the colors in our nation\u2019s mosaic. Believe in yourself, lift others as you climb, and let excellence guide you. In the U.S., the land of boundless possibilities, your journey stands as a testament to hope, perseverance, and achievement.\u201d\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh talks about her love for life, plants, and teaching. Her Riverside home has a garden that includes herbs, shrubs, and trees that remind her both of Iran and her journey in the United States. Photo taken on November 13, 2023.
