        "article_content": "Many of the reported cases of alleged alien encounters, flying saucers, or abductions take place in remote locations, far from the eyes and cameras of almost anyone, or in conditions that make it difficult to see anything clearly. For those who fabricate such experiences, it is a necessary alibi. The case of New Yorker Linda Napolitano, a housewife of Italian descent who said she was abducted by aliens in 1989, generated huge media coverage for exactly the opposite reason: she claimed that a UFO had taken her from her bedroom by means of a tractor beam in the early hours of the morning, in the middle of Manhattan.\n\nTogether with researcher Budd Hopkins, one of the most famous figures in ufology, she brought 23 witnesses to the table who supported her story and said they had seen her fly over the Brooklyn Bridge. The family not only confirmed the veracity of her experiences, but also declared themselves victims of interventions from outer space. And they all stand firm, to the point that Napolitano, who is now 77 years old, has just sued Netflix over a documentary that casts serious doubts on what some media dubbed \u201cthe abduction of the century.\u201d\n\nThe three-episode series, The Manhattan Alien Abduction, was written by Linda Napolitano herself and premiered in the U.S. on October 30, just in time for Halloween. It certainly has terrifying elements, not so much in the dramatizations of the abduction itself, but testimonies such as that of her son, who appears with his face obscured and claims to have been in psychological treatment for years over the trauma of alien visits of which he, who experienced the coverage of the case as a child, is entirely convinced. However, there is another woman who manages to displace Napolitano from the center of the documentary: Carol Rainey, Hopkins\u2019 ex-wife and a notable skeptic of her former husband\u2019s work, especially on the Manhattan case. The basis of the complaint against Netflix is that the participation of Rainey, who died in 2023, is much greater than the aggrieved party expected. Napolitano says she was assured Rainey would make only one appearance, but she is, by all accounts, the co-star.\n\nThe apartment block in Manhattan where Linda Napolitano was allegedly abducted by aliens in 1989. General (\u00a92005 Credit:TopFoto/Fortean)\n\nAs such, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is much more interesting than a mere reconstruction of a 35-year-old UFO file. Its unexpected focus on Rainey allows us to access another story, that of someone who, out of respect for the man she had once loved, for the credibility and objectivity she once had, made the tough decision to disavow him in a shattering publication that questioned his rigor and methodology. \u201cI saw that I was losing objectivity. I loved Budd. He seemed to me to have complete integrity. Completely honest. But if it was a hoax, I needed to know if my husband was complicit,\u201d Rainey states in the documentary. Peter Robbins, Hopkins\u2019 assistant and friend, who blames Rainey for Hopkins\u2019 book Witnessed: The True Story Of The Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions (1996) not being republished or made into a film adaptation, doesn\u2019t see it that way: \u201cHer goal in life was to destroy this man and destroy his reputation.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a harpy,\u201d Napolitano goes so far as to say on camera.\n\nThe housewife\u2019s story contained bizarre elements that went beyond the 1989 abduction. A year later, Napolitano alerted Hopkins that she was being harassed by two men named Dan and Richard, who had witnessed the event from an official car in which they were transporting none other than then-Secretary General of the United Nations Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Hopkins, who never saw them himself, gave credence to the letters she received signed in their name and that of the diplomat. According to Napolitano, the men kidnapped her and Dan, who was madly in love with her, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. She also underwent an X-ray test to prove that a lump in her nose was the result of an alien graft. The X-ray revealed that it did appear to house a small cylindrical object, but when she later agreed to undergo surgery to remove it, the object never appeared.\n\nI want to believe\n\nSociologist, writer and editor Pablo Vergel, a contributor to Spanish TV show Cuarto Milenio, which covers mysteries and enigmas, spoke to Napolitano several years ago via Facebook. His intention was to have her participate in a report on the show, although he was unable to get her to appear in front of the cameras. Vergel acknowledges to EL PA\u00cdS that it is \u201ca very problematic case,\u201d which owes its popularity to the context and \u201cthe series of incredible twists and turns that followed, a real soap opera, thanks to which it had a lot of coverage in the tabloid press [...] Iconically, this UFO that lifts someone from their apartment with a ray, takes them out and crosses the most famous skyline in the world, over the Brooklyn Bridge, cannot be more powerful,\u201d he says. In 2021, Vergel published in Spain a book by Budd Hopkins, Intruders, originally from 1987 and one of the key titles in the abduction phenomenon in the United States.\n\nWhitley Strieber photographed in 2016. David Livingston (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBudd Hopkins is part of the triad of researchers who created the great wave of abductions in the United States, almost a sociological phenomenon, along with Whitley Strieber and John E. Mack,\u201d explains the editor. \u201cHe did have a certain courage; he created support groups for people who said they had been abducted, he established mechanisms and protocols\u2026 Whitley Strieber, the famous author of Communion (1987), turned to Budd Hopkins and said in his book that he helped him a lot in managing his emotional crisis after the traumatic experience he had [his alleged encounter with extraterrestrials]. But at a certain point he began to act like a devotee, like an absolute believer who could not conceive of any alternative explanation. Many people have accused him of having been an evangelist of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, rather than of investigating it. He abused hypnosis a lot. If you read his books, hypnosis does not follow methodological controls, it leaves suggestion very open. There is even the possibility of ending up implanting memories in the person. Budd Hopkins \u2014 and I say this as his editor \u2014 seems to me to be an interesting author, but also very questionable.\u201d\n\nThe sociologist refers to a study of the Napolitano case published in 1993 by parapsychologist George P. Hansen, together with Joseph J. Stefula and Richard D. Butler, who was critical of Hopkins for not verifying the \u201cvery close\u201d relationship between the housewife and the professional who performed the X-ray test, or the independence of the supposed 23 witnesses to the phenomenon. Among the testimonies that Hopkins had accepted as valid was that of a woman who said she had not been able to see clearly because of the fog \u2014 on a morning when such weather conditions did not occur \u2014 or that of another who, excusing herself on the grounds of her fear, did not close the curtains at her window that night. Hansen and his colleagues found as many as 16 parallels between Napolitano\u2019s story and Garfield Reeves-Stevens\u2019 1989 science fiction novel Nighteyes. They also questioned Hopkins\u2019 honesty, noting that the alleged abductee said he had promised her half the profits from his book about her case.\n\nRobbins, the colleague who backs Hopkins in The Manhattan Alien Abduction, brings up in his statements that Rainey, the researcher\u2019s ex-wife, grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family belonging to the Plymouth Brethren, to suggest that she opposed the extraterrestrial hypothesis because of her religion. Rainey argues in the documentary that, precisely, her experience with Hopkins reopened a wound from the past, when she was estranged from her entire family for questioning the faith: \u201cHis dogma was as radical as my father\u2019s. They both never doubted and seemed to be in possession of the truth. I could not tolerate what he was doing to very vulnerable people,\u201d Rainey said in reference to Hopkins\u2019 hypnosis sessions with people convinced they were being visited by extraterrestrials.\n\nNapolitano, who is said in the series to have had a frustrated vocation as a music star, has called the late Rainey \u201cresentful and alcoholic\u201d in her lawsuit, as well as damaging to her reputation. Nevertheless, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is conciliatory to anyone who really wants to believe her story. Through the theme of faith, the documentary does allow us to glimpse that, among the scholars or mere lovers of the UFO phenomenon, there are those who, with more or less rigor, try to collate their research, and those who only seek to confirm their own beliefs.\n\nDepending on your preferences, the Brooklyn Bridge story generated a previous documentary that completely takes the authenticity of the matter for granted: Linda Napolitano: The Alien Abduction of the Century (2022). Although Napolitano does not participate in it, we are told, based on the thesis of a certain Corrado Malanga, an Italian researcher of the holographic universe, that humans are the most spiritually developed creatures in the universe and that aliens abduct us to imprint their memories in our unconscious, in order to become immortal with our soul.

        "article_content": "Microsoft\u2019s been pretty crafty with integrating AI in multiple Windows 11 native apps. Paint got an AI overhaul last year when it debuted with \u201cCocreator, an AI-powered image generation feature.\n\nThe company later rebranded the feature to \u201cImage Creator\u201d and reserved the Cocreator feature for Copilot+ PCs. Now, it is testing Generative Erase and Fill features in the Insider channel.\n\nThe names are self-explanatory. Generative Fill uses AI models to add elements to the existing image. So, you can select an image area and enter a simple prompt like \u201cadd a cat,\u201d and it\u2019ll do that for you.\n\nSimilarly, the Generative Erase detects the highlighted area, wipes it, and blends it with the background colors, like there wasn\u2019t anything there.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any submenu for Generative Fill and Erase. These options appear after selecting the image area with the selection tool.\n\nWe installed the latest version of Paint that contains both these features, aka version 11.2410.28.0, but remember the new experience is only for Windows 11 Canary and Dev Insiders. Generative Fill is only available and works on Copilot+ Insider PCs, while the Erase feature works on every machinein the Insider Program.\n\nGenerative Fill and Erase AI features in MS Paint\n\nDue to the lack of a Copilot+ PC, we could only test the Generative Erase feature on our AMD hardware. We were happy with the overall performance as it didn\u2019t struggle much while removing an object from the image.\n\nThe feature works without the internet, so you don\u2019t have to worry about exhausting daily credits like the Image Cocreator feature. Generative Fill must also work on the same idea because Copilot+ PC has local AI models that can create AI images quickly.\n\nNote that the Erase feature isn\u2019t something new. The Photos app has had it for quite some time, and the feature underwent multiple name rebrandings before Microsoft settled on \u201cGenerative Erase.\u201d\n\nWe like this approach as the name is less confusing, and having similar names for identical features is helpful for end users.\n\nHow to use Paint AI\u2019s Generative Fill and Erase features in Windows 11\n\nAs mentioned above, the selection tool is the entry point to invoke both these features. Click on the Selection Tool and choose the \u201cRectangle\u201d or \u201cFree-form\u201d option. Then, drag the cursor to select a portion of the image.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the \u201cFill\u201d and \u201cErase\u201d icons along with the \u201cBackground Remover\u201d icon. Click on the Fill icon and describe the element you want to add to the image. Then, click the Create button to generate the image with locally stored AI models.\n\nIf you\u2019re satisfied, click on the Keep option to finalize the image. Otherwise, click the retry icon to generate the image again and experiment with designs.\n\nNext, we tried the Generative Erase option, which doesn\u2019t need a Copilot+ PC to work. We selected a portion of the image and clicked on the Erase icon. It worked its AI magic and removed the Insider build watermark in the image with the background.\n\nYou can also use it with the Eraser tool. Select the Eraser tool from the menu bar, and you\u2019ll see the same Erase icon on the left side.\n\nDrag the slider to adjust the brush size and then drag it to highlight the area. It\u2019ll automatically wipe and blend the image. Hit Apply to finalize the changes.\n\nWhen will both these features arrive?\n\nGenerative Fill will undergo more tests in the Insider channel before it arrives in the stable version. Initially, it will be limited to Copilot+ Snapdragon PCs, but Microsoft plans to bring it to more AI PCs from Intel and AMD.\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to wait for Generative Erase, as it\u2019s already available in the Windows Photos app since Windows 11 23H2.\n\nThe Paint version won\u2019t be coming soon, so use the Photos app if you have something urgent to remove from a photo."

        "article_content": "Anthropic has been gaining on arch rival OpenAI in recent months, according to data from a popular developer tool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI SDK is a toolkit that helps developers build AI-powered applications. It provides code libraries that developers install to get their apps to communicate with different AI models. Data is publishes showing how many times these code packages are downloaded each week.\n\nThis is a useful window into how popular the top AI models are with developers, a key constituency of early tech adopters.\n\nThe data shows that OpenAI remains in the lead. However, Anthropic has been growing faster lately in terms of developer mindshare.\n\nIn the week of August 18, the OpenAI code library was downloaded almost 229,000 times by developers. The equivalent Anthropic library was downloaded almost 38,000 times, according to the data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late October, OpenAI downloads had remained relatively unchanged, while Anthropic downloads were much higher: about 244,000 for OpenAI and 100,000 for Anthropic.\n\nData from NPM Trends NPM Trends\n\nThe recent adoption trends can be partly explained by a new AI model that Anthropic released in the summer.\n\n\"Anthropic's recent gains can be attributed to their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, which, among many tasks, excels at understanding and generating code,\" said Jared Palmer, VP of AI at Vercel, a startup that offers the AI SDK and other developer tools. \"Its combination of speed, cost, and output quality has won over the developer community for the time being.\"\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet came out in June, and it has been particularly useful for tasks that developers need to do regularly, such as understanding and generating software code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, OpenAI has maintained its lead among developers, according to the data. That's primarily due to its first-mover advantage and other factors such as cheap pricing of its GPT-4o-mini AI model and strong developer tooling and documentation.\n\nThere's also pretty widespread adoption of their API, or application programming interface. This is a common way for different software applications to communicate and share data.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that OpenAI's lead is slightly inflated by the download data. That's because many AI model providers have adopted OpenAI's API specification as a de facto standard. That allows developers to use the same OpenAI code library package but point their apps to different models.\n\nIt's hard to quantify how much this exaggerates OpenAI's lead, but it also supports the general conclusion that Anthropic has been gaining on its main rival in recent months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said usage of the startup's API has doubled since it released its GPT-4o mini AI model in July. OpenAI has also tripled the number of active apps running in production on its platform in the past year.\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson shared a critique of the NPM data, saying downloads of these code libraries are not technically an accurate representation of developer audience since it doesn't reflect actual usage or spending.\n\nAnthropic had no problem with the data and what it shows. The company said its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model helps developers handle complex software architecture and multi-step processes. It also noted that enterprises are increasingly adopting Claude for business-critical functions where accuracy is key, such as software development and data analysis.\n\n\"Our new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is the ideal choice for developers to build AI-powered applications with state-of-the-art performance across the board, including coding, complex financial analysis, and live chat support,\" Dianne Penn, product lead at Anthropic, told Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenn cited DoorDash, Sourcegraph, and GitLab as companies that are using Claude to reduce development time, increase code acceptance rates, and build AI features."

Google app tinkerer AssembleDebug has shared a screenshot of a new setting in the Google Meet app for Android called Studio Sound that'll apparently use AI to improve audio quality. We don't know much more about the feature, and it's not rolling out yet, but it seems like it should be soon.\n\nStudio Sound's description in Google Meet's settings says the feature \"Filters out background noise and improves audio quality.\" AssembleDebug says that Studio Sound will replace the existing Noise Cancellation setting, and elaborates on how it improves audio quality. When active, Studio Sound will apparently use AI to \"recreate higher audio frequencies.\" Noise cancelling generally has trouble with higher-frequency sounds, so it seems like Studio Sound could use AI to sort of imitate your voice in instances when high-frequency noise that normal ANC can't handle makes it difficult to hear you on the other end of your call.\n\nThe new \"Studio Sound\" option in Gmail and Google Meet app which will replace the \"Noise Cancellation\" options.

In effect, Studio Sound will likely just make Meet's already impressive noise cancellation sound even more effective. That said, we don't have much to go on here.\n\nStudio Sound should be coming to Android soon\n\nGoogle's used the phrase \"studio sound\" in support documentation to describe the Meet desktop interface's noise cancellation functionality since at least the beginning of 2024, but this setting in the Meet app on Android is the first time the name's been used in Meet's UI. Studio Sound will apparently be coming to both Google Meet and the Gmail app's Meet tab.\n\nAssembleDebug doesn't share a timeline for when we should expect this feature, only saying that it's \"Not rolled out yet.\" Still, that it's surfaced in this way seems to indicate it'll be available in the near future.\n\nGoogle Meet\n\nGoogle LLC\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.5\n\nDownload"

This is intended to make the voice assistant respond to natural language and handle some writing queries.\n\niOS 18 beta 2 also adds:\n\nThe new camera controls focus the image with one press and take the picture with a second. This appealingly evokes an analog camera, but time will tell whether it will feel clunky on the phone.\n\nFind My will now allow users to share the location of a lost item with another person. It will send a link that users can open on any device, not just from Apple.\n\nA new design for the Mail app adds Gmail-like category tabs.\n\nVarious new settings and UI changes are available to explore.\n\nThese AI features align with offerings from Apple\u2019s competitors. Still, it will be interesting to see if Siri loyalty attracts an energetic new audience to the possibility of custom \u2014 or even agentic \u2014 AI voice commands.\n\nHowever, in the release notes for iOS 18.2, Apple notes that requesting ChatGPT to create images in Writing Tools might not work. Users may also need to reboot their device after downloading the beta so that messages can appear in the Messages app.\n\nSEE: The UK offers a free AI self-assessment tool for businesses to help manage the risks of AI.\n\nUpcoming feature may estimate how much time it will take for your phone battery to charge\n\n9to5Mac was the first to report that iOS 18.2 includes a handy feature called Battery Intelligence, which provides a time estimate for how long it will take to charge your phone battery.\n\nI can envision this as a pleasant, small reduction of range anxiety when I\u2019m in an airport for a work trip or out in the city for the day. 9to5Mac searched the beta\u2019s code for the charge time estimate, so don\u2019t expect the feature to be available in the beta or the public release. Furthermore, with \u201cintelligence\u201d in the name, I wonder whether Apple considered attaching AI to this estimate\u2014but that may just be a matter of branding.\n\nGet a first look at the app transaction options now required in the EU\n\nThe iOS 18.2 beta will show Apple\u2019s upcoming changes to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the EU.\n\nThese include options for developers to offer iOS and iPadOS apps on app stores outside of the Apple Store. Developers can create their own app marketplaces, and users can choose which app marketplace and contactless transaction app to set as their default and which to delete. To comply, support for exporting user data in Safari and for web browsers to import user data was also added in iOS 18.2.\n\nApple isn\u2019t happy about the changes, saying the EU directives introduce new possibilities for \u201cmalware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\u201d The EU says Apple\u2019s \u2018walled garden\u2019 ecosystem prevents competition from other app stores, payment methods, and creators.\n\nHow to download the iOS 18.2 beta\n\nTo participate, sign up for the free Apple Beta Software Program. Apple Intelligence features require iPhone 15 Pro or later to run generative AI on-device."

        "article_content": "Britain's most haunted towns have been revealed with the spookiest place in the country named based on the number of ghost sightings.\n\nThe research, which analysed reported paranormal sightings and haunted locations across the country, offers ghost hunters and thrill-seekers a guide to the spookiest locations. The study ranked counties and local authorities based on reports of paranormal activity per square mile, creating a \"paranormal activity score\" to determine the most supernaturally dense areas in the UK. This approach highlights where ghostly encounters are most concentrated.\n\nSo which town is officially the most haunted with a Paranormal Activity Score of 100 and 43 reported paranormal activities and haunted locations all concentrated in just 15 square miles? The would be Ipswich. The Ancient House is known for ghostly monk sightings and mysterious footsteps, while Christchurch Mansion is home to the ghost of a young Victorian maid. The Ipswich Museum, with reported sightings of a phantom Edwardian lady, offers a cultural twist to ghostly encounters.\n\nAlex Wilson, CEO and founder of Affordable Urns, said: \"Our research reveals some exciting destinations for paranormal enthusiasts. The high concentration of reported hauntings in these areas speaks to the rich history and enduring legends of the UK. While we encourage people to explore these fascinating locations, we also urge visitors to approach them with respect and caution. Many of these sites have historical significance and may have restricted access. Always ensure you have proper permission before visiting and follow all safety guidelines. Whether you're a believer in the supernatural or simply enjoy a good scare, these locations offer a supernatural way to connect with the past and perhaps experience something unexplainable.\"\n\n1.

Even, the Ipswich Museum chills visitors with a phantom Edwardian lady stalking its halls.\n\n2. Lincoln\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nLincoln emerges as a close second on the spooky scale, ranking high with a Paranormal Activity Score of 82.20. The city's 14 square miles shudder with 33 reports of hauntings and ghost sightings. Lincoln Castle's walls echo with the cries of a woman executed after being accused of witchcraft. The Magna Carta pub buzzes with stories of a ghostly monk and a cavalier. And, the imposing Lincoln Cathedral's Gothic setting comes with many tales of the spiritual realm, including the \"Swinging Monk\".\n\n3. Cambridge\n\nImage: Cambridge News) Cambridge News)\n\nIn third place, Cambridge lurks with a ghastly score of 74.09. Paranormal enthusiasts have recorded 34 unsettling spiritual occurrences across the city's 16 square miles. Amongst Cambridge's spooky highlights are Corpus Christi College, haunted by the apparition of former master Dr. Butts, while Peterhouse College hosts the ghost of Francis Dawes.

It seemed that whenever anyone posted about paranormal experiences or stories on that group, the store was mentioned.\n\nHelen, a former employee, said it was \u201calways freezing\u201d in the shop. Alongside this cold temperature was a sense of unease, or of being watched; the hairs on the back of the arms and neck prickling.\n\nSome reported a gentler sensation, of feeling like someone else was there. Not necessarily a frightening feeling \u2013 just unexplainable. There were places in the building where these feelings or the presence were particularly strong, such as the attic.\n\nMary, another ex-employee, described hearing voices. She said she heard someone call for her from the back store room, which she assumed was one of her colleagues. But when she reached the top of the stairs to see what they wanted, there was no one there. Footsteps were also often heard on these stairs when no one else was in the building.\n\nThen there were the reports of \u201ccrying\u201d being heard coming from a back room.\n\nThe appearance of Aggie\n\nThree witnesses, Becky, Jodie and Millie, say they have seen an apparition or a ghost at the shop.\n\nJodie claims to have seen someone, a female, moving around when it was closed for Christmas at the time. She thought it was odd, but had no idea that the shop was reportedly haunted. She came forward when she saw other people talking about it online.\n\nA customer called Jenny describes the ghost as being that of a young maid who died in the building, and says that her name was Aggie. She says: \u201cI felt her presence, and I also felt someone watching me when I was working in the office, but I was never scared.\u201d\n\nAnother post about the apparition was shared on Facebook in 2015 by someone who didn't work in the Poundstretcher, but had heard that Aggie was the victim of the Great Fire of Biggleswade."

Data gathered from the rover, along with information from orbiting spacecraft, reveals geological features on Mars that resemble those found along coastlines on Earth. These features, including sediment channels, mud volcanoes, and troughs, point to the presence of a large body of water in the past.This discovery supports the theory that Mars, once a potentially habitable planet with a warm atmosphere, may have had conditions conducive to microbial life. The study, published in Scientific Reports, offers new insights into Mars' evolutionary history and adds weight to the possibility that liquid water once flowed across its surface.Findings from China's Tianwen-1 Orbiter, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and Zhurong point to a period when Mars may have been cold and dry, with a much thinner atmosphere, yet still harboured a significant body of water. Evidence of ancient coastlines, including troughs, sediment channels, and mud volcanoes, hints at both shallow and deep marine environments on Mars.\"We estimate that Utopia Planitia flooded around 3.68 billion years ago, with the ocean likely freezing over in a short geological period,\" said Bo Wu, a planetary scientist from Hong Kong Polytechnic University and lead author of the study published in Scientific Reports. The ocean seems to have vanished by around 3.42 billion years ago. The water, likely laden with silt, contributed to the layered deposits on the Martian surface, according to co-author Sergey Krasilnikov.Mars formed around 4.5 billion years ago, like the other planets in our solar system. This ancient ocean\u2019s presence suggests that Mars may have once been transitioning from a more habitable environment. \"The presence of an ancient ocean on Mars has been proposed and studied for several decades, yet significant uncertainties remain,\" Wu added. \"These findings not only provide further evidence to support the theory of a Martian ocean but also present, for the first time, a discussion on its probable evolutionary scenario.\"Water is a critical component for life, and the possibility of an ancient Martian ocean hints that Mars might have once supported microbial life. \"At the beginning of Mars' history, when it probably had a thick, warm atmosphere, microbial life was much more likely,\" said Krasilnikov.Zhurong, named after a mythical Chinese fire god, started its mission with six scientific tools in May 2021 and went into hibernation a year later, likely due to dust accumulation. The rover surpassed its original three-month mission timeline. Meanwhile, researchers continue to explore Mars' water history. A separate study, based on seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, suggests a massive liquid water reservoir might exist deep within fractured rocks beneath Mars' surface."

Read more\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump\u2018s impending return to the White House means he\u2019ll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that the second won\u2019t look much like the first one Trump established after his 2016 victory.\n\nThe president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump\u2019s team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: The latest news and updates following Election Day\n\nThat includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of cabinet departments to those selected to serve part time on boards and commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting to Republican control.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced his first significant appointment. He named Susie Wiles, the de facto manager of his victorious campaign, as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to hold the influential role.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nWhat will the transition look like?\n\nThough the turnover in the new administration will be total, Trump will be familiar with what he needs to accomplish. He built an entirely new administration for his first term and has definite ideas on what to do differently this time.\n\nHe\u2019s already floated some names.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: To win Pennsylvania, Donald Trump did exactly what he needed to in Philly: Improved slightly\n\nTrump said at his victory party early Wednesday that former presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy Jr. will be tapped to \u201chelp make America healthy again,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019re going to let him go to it.\u201d Ahead of the election, Trump didn\u2019t reject Kennedy\u2019s calls to end fluoridated water. Trump has also pledged to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump campaign, a secretary of federal \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d and the Tesla CEO has suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to wipe out.\n\nThe transition is not just about filling jobs. Most presidents-elect also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the transition.\n\nIn 2008, outgoing President George W. Bush personally briefed President-elect Barack Obama on U.S. covert operations. When Trump was preparing to take office in 2016, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, briefed Michael Flynn, her designated successor in the new administration. In 2020, Trump\u2019s legal challenges of the election\u2019s results delayed the start of the transition process for weeks, though, and presidential briefings with Biden didn\u2019t begin until Nov. 30.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump won Pa. with more votes than any statewide Republican candidate in history. Here\u2019s how he did it.\n\nWho is helping Trump through the process?\n\nTrump\u2019s transition is being led primarily by friends and family, including Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as well as the president-elect\u2019s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. Transition co-chairs are Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, Haverford College\u2019s largest donor, and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nLutnick said this year\u2019s operation is \u201cabout as different as possible\u201d from the 2016 effort, which was first led by Chris Christie. After he won eight years ago, Trump fired Christie, tossed out plans the former New Jersey governor had made and gave the job of running the transition to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Pa. Democrats on what went wrong against Donald Trump and what\u2019s next\n\nAt the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible \u2014 a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs and bombastic professional style.\n\nUnlike the campaign of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\u2019s team didn\u2019t sign any pre-Election Day transition agreements with the General Services Administration, which essentially acts as the federal government\u2019s landlord. He has therefore already missed deadlines to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech support and with the White House on access to agencies, including documents, employees, and facilities.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Disappointed voters and organizers in Philadelphia say gender and racial biases contributed to Harris\u2019 loss\n\nNew transition rules\n\nIn 2020, Trump argued that widespread voter fraud \u2014 which hadn\u2019t actually occurred \u2014 cost him the election, delaying the start of the transition from his outgoing administration to Biden\u2019s incoming one for weeks.\n\nFour years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s win touches off a mix of celebration and trepidation in the Philly region\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally \u201cascertain a president-elect\u201d and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate.\n\nTo prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election \u2014 even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that \u201can \u2018affirmative ascertainment\u2019 by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,\u201d according to agency guidelines on the new rules.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s growing support among Latino voters helped him clinch battleground Pennsylvania\n\nThe uncertainty stretched even longer after the 2000 election, when five weeks elapsed before the Supreme Court settled the contested election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. That left Bush with about half the usual amount of time to manage transitioning the government from the outgoing Clinton administration. That ultimately led to questions about national security gaps that may have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks the following year."

        "article_content": "Generative AI is still very much an emerging technology and it\u2019s morphing and evolving rapidly, as is illustrated with the trend toward agentic AI, which we\u2019ve written about previously. But enterprise adoption is ramping quickly and organizations are moving from testing out the technology to applying it to various use cases.\n\nJeremy Foster, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Compute, saw that at a recent meeting of the IT vendor\u2019s Customer Advisory Board, where almost all of the companies said they had AI projects underway to one degree or another.\n\n\u201cSome of those projects might be starting in the cloud and some of those projects might be starting in projects on-prem, but we\u2019re seeing that process accelerate over the last six months or more from where it was and we think it\u2019s just going to continue to go faster,\u201d Foster told The Next Platform. \u201cSome of them made initial orders and they are waiting on delivery. Between the order and delivery, they\u2019re defining their use cases and how they\u2019re going to develop those applications to deliver value. It\u2019s still very early in the enterprise, but it\u2019s not one or two organizations of ten, it\u2019s eight or nine. When they get there, it\u2019s all going to come very, very fast.\u201d\n\nOne challenge they\u2019ll have to contend with is ensuring they have the right infrastructure to run AI workloads. According to Cisco\u2019s AI Readiness Index, 89 percent of IT professionals surveyed said they plan to deploy AI workloads within the next two years, but only 14 percent said their infrastructure is ready for the jobs. Overhauling infrastructure can be a costly and complex proposition.\n\nCisco is looking to make that transition easier and cheaper with new hardware offerings announced this week at its Partner Summit in Los Angeles that pull from its UCS portfolio and validated design initiatives, which put as much of the technology needed into converged and highly integrated systems. Such offerings are important to enterprises that are weighing what AI tasks they want to do in the cloud and on premises.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a lot of preference for being able to deploy things on-prem and the infrastructure patterns depend on what you\u2019re going to do,\u201d Daniel McGinniss, vice president of product management for Cisco Compute, told The Next Platform. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re training as an enterprise in the cloud and then you go on-prem. People have a lot of data on-prem and that\u2019s got a lot of gravity. If a lot of these applications are important to them, are their crown jewels, then they\u2019ll want to run them on-prem. That will lead to what we\u2019re seeing, which is all the use cases around all this coming together and taking the guesswork out, because all of those infrastructure patterns are different. I will do inferencing on a CPU but I won\u2019t be doing training on a CPU. Some of our large enterprise customers are doing that training in the cloud or maybe they\u2019ll be doing that training on-prem.\u201d\n\nAt the event, Cisco unveiled the UCS C885A M8 servers, aimed at large GPU-intensive AI training and inferencing jobs. It\u2019s the latest edition to the UCS portfolio, which Cisco first introduced in 2009 as it expanded its datacenter presence beyond networking to compete with the likes of Dell and Hewlett Packard in compute.\n\nThe UCS C885A M8 is built atop Nvidia\u2019s HGX supercomputing platform and is powered by eight Nvidia H100 or H200 Tensor Core GPUs or eight AMD MI300X OAM GPUs \u2013 support for Intel chips is expected later \u2013 and includes a Nvidia ConnectX-7 network interface card (NIC) or BlueField-3 SuperNIC for each GPU, allowing for AI model training workloads to run across a cluster of the servers. There also are Nvidia BlueField-3 data processing units (DPUs) and comes with two 4th or 5th Gen EPYC chips from AMD.\n\nThe systems are managed via Cisco\u2019s Intersight cloud-based platform.\n\nAt the same time, Cisco announced its AI PODs, which extend the vendor\u2019s validated designs \u2013 which Cisco has been offering for more than two decades \u2013 with pre-configured infrastructure stacks for AI inferencing workloads that can scale from edge deployments to large-scale clusters to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\nThe AI PODs are based in large part on Nvidia technology, including its GPUs and AI Enterprise software platform and HPC-X toolkit, as well as Cisco\u2019s UCS X-Series modular design, chassis, M7 compute nodes, a PCI-Express node with Nvidia GPUs, Cisco UCS fabric interconnects, and Intersight management software.\n\nIt also includes Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift application platform and the ability to choose between Nutanix, NetApp\u2019s FlexPod or Pure Storage\u2019s FlashStack.\n\nSuch a technology stack can be benefit to organizations still trying to get their heads around the complex infrastructure environment needed for AI, according to Cisco\u2019s McGinnis.\n\n\u201cPeople have been doing virtualized environments for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the beginning, that was confusing, too. Now we\u2019re seeing the same thing. It\u2019s almost history repeating itself. The concept of a stack is really reassuring to a customer in that they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know yet. They don\u2019t know how to size their environment yet and they don\u2019t understand this combination of CPUs and memory and drives and GPUs. It\u2019s a whole new vector that needs to be considered. There\u2019s a confidence when we can say, \u2018We\u2019ve already done the sizing for you. Here\u2019s this entire stack for where you need to get started.\u2019 They will customize it and deviate as they learn more about their needs and their environments, but the concept of a of a solution is probably very important.\u201d\n\nThe UCS C885A M8 servers \u2013 which can be ordered now and will ship by the end of the years \u2013 and AI PODs (orderable in November) are joining a growing portfolio of AI infrastructure from Cisco, which includes 800G Nexus switching platforms running on the Cisco Silicon One G200 chip and the Nexus HyperFabric AI clusters developed with Nvidia and introduced in June and which combine Cisco\u2019s AI networking with Nvidia\u2019s accelerated computing and AI Enterprise software and a data store from VAST.\n\nCisco\u2019s Foster said Nexus HyperFabric AI clusters, which will be orderable next year, allow enterprises to quickly get the necessary AI network in place.\n\n\u201cIf you think about training two networks, you\u2019ve got the frontend network and backend network,\u201d he said. \u201cWe collapse that together one Ethernet network and allow them to manage them all the way from the network down to the NIC on the back of the server and then we leverage Intersight to keep that server environment up and running and optimized based on the requirements of their use cases.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Anthropic has been gaining on arch rival OpenAI in recent months, according to data from a popular developer tool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI SDK is a toolkit that helps developers build AI-powered applications. It provides code libraries that developers install to get their apps to communicate with different AI models. Data is publishes showing how many times these code packages are downloaded each week.\n\nThis is a useful window into how popular the top AI models are with developers, a key constituency of early tech adopters.\n\nThe data shows that OpenAI remains in the lead. However, Anthropic has been growing faster lately in terms of developer mindshare.\n\nIn the week of August 18, the OpenAI code library was downloaded almost 229,000 times by developers. The equivalent Anthropic library was downloaded almost 38,000 times, according to the data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late October, OpenAI downloads had remained relatively unchanged, while Anthropic downloads were much higher: about 244,000 for OpenAI and 100,000 for Anthropic.\n\nData from NPM Trends NPM Trends\n\nThe recent adoption trends can be partly explained by a new AI model that Anthropic released in the summer.\n\n\"Anthropic's recent gains can be attributed to their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, which, among many tasks, excels at understanding and generating code,\" said Jared Palmer, VP of AI at Vercel, a startup that offers the AI SDK and other developer tools. \"Its combination of speed, cost, and output quality has won over the developer community for the time being.\"\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet came out in June, and it has been particularly useful for tasks that developers need to do regularly, such as understanding and generating software code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, OpenAI has maintained its lead among developers, according to the data. That's primarily due to its first-mover advantage and other factors such as cheap pricing of its GPT-4o-mini AI model and strong developer tooling and documentation.\n\nThere's also pretty widespread adoption of their API, or application programming interface. This is a common way for different software applications to communicate and share data.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that OpenAI's lead is slightly inflated by the download data. That's because many AI model providers have adopted OpenAI's API specification as a de facto standard. That allows developers to use the same OpenAI code library package but point their apps to different models.\n\nIt's hard to quantify how much this exaggerates OpenAI's lead, but it also supports the general conclusion that Anthropic has been gaining on its main rival in recent months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said usage of the startup's API has doubled since it released its GPT-4o mini AI model in July. OpenAI has also tripled the number of active apps running in production on its platform in the past year.\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson shared a critique of the NPM data, saying downloads of these code libraries are not technically an accurate representation of developer audience since it doesn't reflect actual usage or spending.\n\nAnthropic had no problem with the data and what it shows. The company said its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model helps developers handle complex software architecture and multi-step processes. It also noted that enterprises are increasingly adopting Claude for business-critical functions where accuracy is key, such as software development and data analysis.\n\n\"Our new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is the ideal choice for developers to build AI-powered applications with state-of-the-art performance across the board, including coding, complex financial analysis, and live chat support,\" Dianne Penn, product lead at Anthropic, told Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenn cited DoorDash, Sourcegraph, and GitLab as companies that are using Claude to reduce development time, increase code acceptance rates, and build AI features."
