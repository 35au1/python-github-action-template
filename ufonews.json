        "article_content": "I love diving into gaming history, playing old games and keeping those experiences in my mind for when I play new ones. There\u2019s a whole new world of insight you can access when you come into something armed with context of what came before. Even in my short time at Shacknews I\u2019ve pushed things like preservation because capturing, holding onto, and sharing knowledge feels like an important and underserved piece of criticism in games. UFO 50, a collection of retro-styled games from Mossmouth, feels as much like validation for those principles as it does a new, original work. It\u2019s a fictional portfolio from a long-lost video game studio that celebrates not just games themselves, but the value of going back and unearthing art from the past to both enjoy it and learn from it.\n\nReal games, fictional context\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 doesn\u2019t narrate its story to you, but there\u2019s still a compelling framing device that bleeds into the game\u2019s nuts and bolts. You\u2019re playing a set of 50 games developed by UFO Soft, a company that developed and published games on its series of LX consoles. The games were made throughout the 1980s, and you literally wipe the dust off each cartridge when you play them for the first time. In the main menu each title has a little synopsis, as well as a sentence or two adding some kind of additional historical context. Perhaps it\u2019s an anecdote about a game\u2019s inspiration, such as from a poster in the studio\u2019s bathroom. Other times you\u2019ll get something like how Night Manor, a point and click-style horror game, was UFO Soft\u2019s only game featuring required warning text.\n\nDespite only being a few paragraphs of text in total, there\u2019s a real sense of UFO Soft being a real company that existed in UFO 50\u2019s imagined world. You can feel the vibe that this was a small group in an era when games could be pumped out based on singular ideas, then iterated on in further sequels and other new projects, enough to sustain a company and build not just a library, but an identity. Each little snippet of context feels like reading through old gaming magazines and building a picture in your mind of what it may have looked like to work in gaming in the 1980s.\n\nA complex collection\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s deliberate or not, considering how in interviews the folks behind this game didn\u2019t initially view this project as a single package. But the ways in which the games in UFO 50 follow a sort of evolutionary path is fascinating. If you play each game in order you can map out the trajectory in your mind, especially when you come across sequels and spinoffs of what seem to be UFO Soft\u2019s core IPs. It\u2019s actually wild to think about how the real-life developers plotted out the fictional devs\u2019 progress and laid it out across these titles, rather than simply making each individual game as \u201ccomplete\u201d with all the lessons we\u2019ve collectively learned as devs and gamers in 2024. You\u2019ll see an idea introduced in a game early in the list, then grow and improve over time as you move through the years until there are games towards the end that feel like several ideas and learned lessons culminating into bigger, more elaborate productions.\n\nThat being said, not every game on this list is going to be a certified banger for every player. There\u2019s a wide selection of genre, as well as complexity and that mythical force we refer to in shorthand as \u201cpolish.\u201d There are games here I booted up, played for a couple minutes, and moved on from. I probably won\u2019t play Bug Hunter ever again, for example. But there are other games like Grimstone, a full-by-god wild west JRPG, that I will absolutely go back to and see all the way to the end. It almost feels like I\u2019ve gone back to my formative years playing around with emulators and huge ROM lists, going through and finding what resonated with me while taking in little pieces of everything. Fist Hell felt like a bad version of River City Ransom, while Valbrace is a strange hybrid of Wizardry and Punch-Out that feels like nothing I\u2019ve ever played before. It\u2019s an eclectic mix, and each individual piece contributes to the overall bigger picture of UFO Soft as an entity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that as fun as these games can be, there's a sort of line being toed between authenticity and approachability. A lot of the games in the collection are tough even by the standards of their era, mostly because a lot of them give you one life and no continues. If you die, you simply start right back at the beginning. Other games that are more substantive may offer multiple lives or chances, but it's still a harsh Game Over when you use them up. Features like rewind or unlimited continues may clash with the idea that you're literally cleaning up and playing old cartridges in the narrative, but some kind of compromise would have made trying to really dive into and complete each game a more appealing venture. To UFO 50's credit, the longer games (especially the RPGs) do have auto-saving and checkpoint systems. But having auto-save kind of invalidates the earlier remark about authenticity, so there's a little inconsistency there anyway.\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 is like stumbling across a time capsule and discovering a wealth of lost knowledge inside. And yet, it\u2019s entirely a singular work of fiction. That by itself is deeply fascinating and makes this thing worth playing. Even if you pass over most of the games and only find a few that stick with you from a fun perspective, the depth on a conceptual level is absurd and gratifying to simply think about. We\u2019re living at a time in which older games are vanishing from both physical reality and our sort of collective cultural well at an increasing rate, when remakes are seen as replacements for original work and curiosity to seek out history is dwindling unless there\u2019s a purchasable remaster. UFO 50 is fun to play and take at face value, but it also highlights how age really isn\u2019t a detriment to having a great time and engaging with games.\n\nUFO 50 is available now for PC. The game was purchased by Shacknews for this review."

Nickles says the show is the perfect combination of spooky and family-friendly \"Each year I come up with new arrangements of things,\" Nickle said. \"I like playing the Ghostbusters theme, the Thriller theme, the funnest thing is playing on instruments that are a little unconventional like a coffin or a car.\"\n\n\"It's really just about a bunch of us drummers who have been drumming our whole life just getting out here and beating some drums and having a good time together,\" said Paranormal Percussions performer, Derek Julio.\n\nSince the show started in 2019 people have traveled from all across the state to see their favorite Halloween songs come to life on the stage. Nickles and Julio say the audience feedback so far has been spooktacular.\n\n\"It just feels wonderful when we know they have had a really good time, a really good experience,\" Julio said. \"It's meant to be spooky, it's meant to be a little fun, I think it's really funny, a lot of aspects of it,\" Julio said.\n\nWarehouse 5 Drum Theatre hopes to continue making audiences smile and putting drummers in the spotlight by eventually putting on other seasonal shows.\n\n\"It's really fulfilling for me, the first year was really scary because I had these arrangements, but I didn't know if they would make sense live but once we put the show together it was really nice,\" Nickles said.\n\nFor show times, locations, and tickets you can click here."

But there\u2019s something they have yet to spot with any certainty: moons around those worlds.\n\nNow a recent discovery around a Saturn-size planet 635 light-years from Earth offers one of the best potential clues that exomoons orbit exoplanets out there in the Milky Way. And this possible moon, as described by scientists, is putting on an explosive show, blasting volcanic matter and noxious gases that then drift off into its stellar neighborhood like a comet\u2019s serpentine tail.\n\nThe possible evidence of an erupting satellite was described last month in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Astronomers have been observing a puffy planet named WASP-49 b for years, but the new paper argues that a sodium cloud whizzing around it does not come from the planet. It might be created by a hypervolcanic companion moon spewing 220,000 pounds of the material every second.\n\nThe abundance of moons in our own solar system implies that exomoons certainly exist. But as they are so tiny, researchers have been conjuring up ways to indirectly detect them. Searches in recent years have identified several promising candidates, and the cloud around WASP-49 b offers the latest strong prospect \u2014 a satellite that may resemble Io, the moon of Jupiter that is the most volcanically active world in our solar system."

        "article_content": "The automation marketplace has changed vastly from what it was 30 years ago, but many trends persist and intensified during this time. The first is the increasing emphasis on software and services. Rapid advances in processing capability launched the decade of industrial, artificial intelligence (AI). Cloud computing, edge data processing, virtualization, containerization, Open Process Automation (OPA) and time-sensitive networks (TSN) have transformed the world of control systems. Suppliers continue to beef up their software capabilities, as we saw in 2022 with Emerson buying a majority stake in AspenTech, and Schneider Electric\u2019s acquisition of industrial software giant Aveva that closed in January 2023. ARC Advisory Group keeps reporting this in just about every Control/ARC Automation Top 50 article in recent memory, but software is the driving force behind today\u2019s market, and AI is now the tip of the spear. Suppliers know this, and will continue expanding and honing their software expertise and industrial AI solutions.\n\nGet your subscription to Control's tri-weekly newsletter.\n\nApproaching the Control/ARC Automation Top 50 global and North American automation suppliers is a unique exercise because we must keep one eye in the rearview mirror and the other on the road ahead. According to our standard methodology, ARC has a strict definition and scope of the automation marketplace that you can read about here. We examine supplier performance based on calendar-year revenues. ARC uses publicly available data in addition to information from our own database that we\u2019ve developed during more than 30 years of following the automation marketplace, the overall operations technology (OT) space, and the key end-user trends that drive them.\n\nHardware and services\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean hardware isn\u2019t important. The influx of commercial, IT-based solutions began in the automation marketplace more than 30 years ago, too, with the adoption of commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) operating systems and computing components. The industrial sector debated the benefits of Ethernet for years, until the dam finally burst, and just about every control network available today is based on Ethernet technologies with a few modifications. Today, this trend is accelerating faster than ever, with demand for industrial, edge-based systems and cloud-based automation architectures soaring. Computing requirements for industry will increase exponentially over the next decade, with AI again leading the way. Ethernet Advanced Physical Layer (APL) networking was also introduced in 2023, and will bring the benefits of Ethernet down to the device level and hazardous locations.\n\nAveva and AspenTech aren\u2019t the only recent software acquisitions, though they are substantial. In 2023 alone, ABB acquired a majority stake in Swedish AI startup Viking Analytics; Emerson acquired National Instruments (NI); PTC announced its acquisition of pure-systems; Belden acquired edge-software provider CloudRail; Rockwell Automation acquired OT cybersecurity provider Verve Industrial; and the list goes on. ARC expects more acquisitions as suppliers continue to strength their AI and cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the services business for all of these automation suppliers that continues to grow at the fastest rate. Almost universally, supplier service revenues are increasing faster than either their hardware or software businesses. Suppliers continue to differentiate themselves based on their deep understanding and engineering knowledge of specific industrial and customer requirements, and are striving to create lifelong partnerships with their clients where they provide a continuous stream of value-added lifecycle services. Many of these services are increasingly tailored to help users get more value out of their sustainability and digital transformation programs.\n\nSupplier performance in 2023\n\nOn a year-over-year (YoY) basis, consolidated supplier revenues grew by 8% worldwide and by more than 3% in North America during 2022. This continues the post-COVID-19 growth trend that we\u2019ve seen since 2021, when the market sharply rebounded from the pandemic. In typical fashion, the discrete manufacturing markets were the first to contract and the first to bounce back, while the process industries lagged slightly behind.\n\nIn typical fashion, the overall market leaders haven\u2019t changed significantly, though some smaller suppliers gained ground during 2023. It\u2019s worth noting that changes in relative position on this list don\u2019t necessarily indicate the strength or competence of any supplier, and could be due to other factors, the most obvious being merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. This list will give you an idea of who the market leaders are, but any evaluation of suppliers should obviously be more in-depth than their positions in the Control/ARC Top 50 rankings. With the rapid changes taking place in the automation market, it\u2019s also a good time to reevaluate supplier selection criteria.\n\nBig acquisitions fortify positions\n\nEmerson\u2019s acquisition of NI cemented its number-one position in North America with total revenues close to $8 billion. NI\u2019s consolidation into Emerson also removed it from the list, affecting the relative positions of other suppliers.\n\nThe same happened with Schneider Electric, which now wholly owns Aveva. It likewise cemented its number-four position worldwide, and moved up the list in North America to the number four position, placing it very close to ABB. In North America, Hexagon gained some ground to reach the eighth slot by acquiring several software suppliers concentrated in the digitalization, optimization and AI spaces.\n\nAutomation market hitting a wall?\n\nAfter robust growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, the global and North American automation markets remain strong, but they\u2019re also facing some serious headwinds and signs of softening in several sectors. We expect an overall slowdown in growth, but not a market contraction. Uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and mounting geopolitical conflicts and tensions also contribute to future market uncertainty.\n\nFor example, ARC\u2019s Automation Index declined in 2Q24, which was the first time since the post-pandemic recovery. The automation markets had experienced growth since 3Q20 (past 12 consecutive quarters). Demand for automation products continued to expand in the U.S. market, but at a slower pace. The YoY growth cycle started showing a decline since late 3Q23, and shows further decline through 1Q24. Many of the leading automation suppliers in North America have also increased prices to keep pace with rising production and distribution costs.\n\nMany of the key automation suppliers in North America are reporting strong backlogs, which they plan to work through in 2024. ARC is seeing a shift in growth from converting backlogs to new orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excess inventory. Supply-chain issues have also eased since our last report, and because of this, we\u2019re witnessing improved lead times.\n\nNew energy and decarbonization activities also remain strong, as we'll discuss later in this report. Aside from obvious investments in renewable energy, sustainability is also driving investments in automation for hydrogen infrastructure and its frequent counterpart, carbon capture and storage. Investment in plastics and other recycling technologies, such as wind turbine blade recycling, are increasing. Electrification, utilities, data centers and infrastructure (rail, port and marine) sectors are all experiencing strong growth.\n\nHowever, automotive growth remains weak as automotive manufacturers focus on near-term profitability amid a slowdown in demand for electric vehicles. In addition, semiconductor growth remains weak as manufacturers face several different challenges, including excess memory capacity and workforce shortages. Despite these signs of softening, our outlook remains positive for continued growth in both North America and worldwide through the end of 2024.\n\nHow AI is transforming industry\n\nAI has revolutionized the way we approach problem-solving and decision-making in various industries. Often described as prediction machines or inference engines, AI systems are designed to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions about future events or outcomes. This predictive capability is central to AI's value proposition, enabling businesses to anticipate trends, optimize processes, and make informed decisions. For instance, in the industrial sector, the most widely deployed AI use case involves predicting equipment failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.\n\nThe surge in investment in AI infrastructure is a testament to this technology's transformative potential. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have highlighted the rapid growth in AI investment since the breakthrough of Generative AI (Gen AI) with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5, with projections indicating a global spend nearing $200 billion by 2025.\n\nOver the longer-term, AI-related investment could peak as high as 2.5% to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. and 1.5 to 2.5% of GDP among other major AI leaders, if Goldman Sachs Research\u2019s AI growth projections are fully realized. This investment is driving down the cost of AI solutions, making them more accessible, and enabling broader adoption across industrial sectors. They\u2019re hungry to apply the technology to address growing skills gaps, control spiraling energy costs, and meet demand for more sustainable products and services with more resilient supply chains.\n\nAI and the data explosion\n\nThe industrial sector's challenges aren\u2019t just about volume, but also involve the complexity and fragmentation of data generated by sensors, machines and smart factories. This data is often disconnected and scattered across various applications, making it difficult to harness for insights and decision-making. Many end-users find it necessary to build a better framework for managing data when implementing new technologies like AI, and this is driving growth in industrial IoT platforms like Honeywell\u2019s Forge, Siemens\u2019 MindSphere, ABB\u2019s Ability, Rockwell Automation\u2019s FactoryTalk InnovationSuite, and Schneider Electric\u2019s EcoStruxure. Other suppliers like Yokogawa are implementing their own industrial AI platforms that allow connections between operational assets and the enterprise.\n\nEach industrial AI use case requires specific datasets, and may necessitate different tools and techniques. For instance, predictive maintenance relies on sensor data to forecast equipment failures, while generative design uses parameters like materials and cost constraints to create product designs.\n\nSustainability drives digital transformation\n\nThe real question is how all this technology is applied and what its business case is. Energy transition and sustainability are being woven into the core business strategies of most of the world\u2019s largest industrial companies, which now have a mandate and opportunity to not only to tackle environmental and social challenges, but also take advantage of the commercial opportunities and competitive advantages that sustainability offers.\n\nFor several years, sustainability issues were approached as something to be dealt with cautiously in reaction to increasingly stringent regulations. However, massive commercial opportunities have emerged beyond just regulatory compliance. Many companies are discovering that ramping up digital transformation initiatives can help reach their sustainability goals. Sustainability can provide business value across several dimensions, including increased energy efficiency, new processes for carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen production and transportation.\n\nSpending on sustainability increases\n\nFor instance, Bank of America (BoA) reports that, prior to COVID-19, the U.S. spent about 0.4% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy, while Germany spent 0.5% or more, and the EU\u2019s other member nations spent more traditionally. Today, the U.S. spends 0.8% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy thanks to passing its $1.8 trillion stimulus package. The most recent stimulus is structured quite differently from what the U.S. did before. It doesn't peak until 2026, and will run until 2031. The stimulus was designed so that many projects are in \u201cred states,\u201d and $2.4 trillion is needed to meet net-zero emission targets laid out for the U.S. over the next five years, according to BoA\u2019s research.\n\nMost companies are enhancing energy efficiency and switching to clean-energy sources. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) facilities have also been growing significantly. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, Section 45 Q tax credits for capturing carbon have increased to $85 per ton, and most companies can do this at a much lower cost. This makes CCUS extremely profitable, which is why we see so much activity in it, including ExxonMobil\u2019s acquisition of Denbury, Occidental\u2019s acquisition of Carbon Engineering and others.\n\nEdge computing push intensifies\n\nIndustrial, edge-computing solutions can overcome limitations such as latency, reliability and security by extending the cloud into OT environments, while also reducing cloud-input data volumes and egress costs. Data at the edge of networks can be aggregated and contextualized to deliver summary information and insights directly to the cloud, ultimately reducing cloud-based, data-storage costs. Edge functionality has likewise expanded digital transformation\u2019s reach into remote, hazardous and other distributed environments, simultaneously addressing potential lacks of reliable network connections and skilled IT personnel in the field.\n\nCustomers and suppliers alike are aligning their edge strategies to take advantage of the cloud\u2019s centralized management, security and scaling capabilities, while preserving operational integrity by marrying these with onsite, edge capabilities. The descent of cloud-native, containerized architectures to the edge is simplifying deployment and management of edge applications, a key edge value driver, by providing a lightweight and portable way to package software and its dependencies. Industrial data can be pre-processed at the edge, sent to the cloud for analytics or model training, and then redeployed at the edge in lightweight software containers.\n\nIndustrial automation and cloud-native architectures are coming together, while industrial automation itself is increasingly software-defined. The data sought by edge and cloud-based solutions resides in the logic, process and motion controllers sold by traditional automation suppliers, which are typically large players with deep domain knowledge that closely integrate their edge offerings with their higher-level, software-based solutions.\n\nThese products typically focus on domain-specific use cases that relate to their core automation competencies. Early offerings look to apply analytics to monitoring and maintenance applications focused on reduced downtime and asset utilization objectives. Automation suppliers are also taking advantage of existing edge technology and ecosystems, and partnering with and/or investing in complementary infrastructures, open-source and multiple cloud providers."
