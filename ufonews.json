        "article_content": "It\u2019s been nearly 2 decades since the \u2018Tic Tac\u2019 incident, here\u2019s what we know about the iconic UFO encounter\n\nLAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2014 The most consequential UFO incident in modern history is about to reach a milestone, and while the Pentagon still can\u2019t explain what happened, the incident\u2019s impact is still being felt 20 years later.\n\nOn Nov. 14, 2004, U.S. Naval aviators were sent to intercept an otherworldly object that \u201ctook off like a bullet fired from a gun.\u201d It was dubbed the \u201cTic Tac\u201d UFO due to its shape and color, which resembled the popular breath mint. However, this breath mint was 45 feet across. It was detected by the Navy dozens of times in Nov. 2004.\n\nThe now-famous video of the Tic Tac, which was recorded by Navy pilots, was initially buried by the military. However, a clandestine investigation based in Las Vegas eventually documented why the encounter was so revolutionary.\n\nDuring two weeks in Nov. 2004, the world\u2019s most sophisticated sensor systems attached to the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group were befuddled by repeated cat-and-mouse type incursions by unknown objects off of the coast of Southern California. Objects were detected one moment and gone the next. On Nov. 14, radar operators finally got a lock on one object\u2014the Tic Tac.\n\nTop Gun pilot David Fravor was sent to investigate. The commander of the \u201cBlack Aces\u201d Strike Fighter Squadron 41 sped through the skies in his F-18 and could not believe what he saw. Years later, his opinion hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nDavid Fravor, the commander of the \u201cBlack Aces\u201d Strike Fighter Squadron 41 sped through the skies in his F-18 and could not believe what he saw.\n\n\u201cThe video was taken by a crew after us when we came back and landed,\u201d Fravor recounted. \u201cThere were four of us. We chased it visually, and I looked at it for over five minutes.\u201d\n\nFravor described watching it move and interact with his jet. He was confident that what he saw was not one of the usual aerial suspects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bird. It\u2019s not a weather balloon. It had no wings, it had no rotors, there was no wash,\u201d he said. \u201cThe four of us will to this day tell you that we have no idea what we saw, as far as where it was from or what it was, but it had incredible performance characteristics that were well beyond brand new Super Hornets right out of the factory, which [were] the jets we were flying.\u201d\n\nCommander Chad Underwood was in the second F-18 sent after the Tic Tac. A recording device on his plane recorded the grainy image from an infrared sensor. Underwood said a second recording of the incident has never been released, adding that the Tic Tac engaged in active jamming.\n\n\u201cI did get jamming cues on my radar tape,\u201d Underwood said.\n\nAccounts vary regarding what happened to the recordings afterward, although the encounter was not investigated by the Navy, nor was it sent up the organization\u2019s hierarchy. A few years later, a bootleg of the recording appeared online without much fanfare. A more detailed article penned by a former Navy pilot appeared in an online aviation publication without much notice.\n\nIn Dec. 2017, the Tic Tac became worldwide news as the centerpiece of a front-page story in the New York Times. The article revealed the existence of previously unknown Department of Defense programs looking into UFOs. The video of the Tic Tac alongside Fravor\u2019s account was, and still is, viewed as solid proof that genuine unknowns have continued to perplex the world\u2019s most powerful military.\n\nThe New York Times article turned the UFO subject on its head, and other mainstream media started investigating the cover-up. Members of Congress asked questions and demanded briefings. The public showed renewed interest in a subject long dismissed as nonsense. Veteran journalist Ralph Blumenthal said the story was a tough sell to his editors.\n\n\u201cEverything was, you know, it was documented,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cBut it was still a difficult topic for the times to grapple with, and the Times has a history of being very skeptical of UFOs.\u201d\n\nThe larger story exposed a previously unknown investigation into UFO encounters within the U.S. Military. AATIP, or the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, was described as \u201ca program\u201d by some and \u201ca working group\u201d by others.\n\nLue Elizondo, a career intelligence officer who left his Pentagon position in 2017, was instrumental in getting the Tic Tac video into the hands of the New York Times. In 2018, he confirmed that other instances similar to the Tic Tac exist in hidden military files.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many Nimitz incidences that are equally compelling that are told from the eyes of people like Commander Dave Fravor,\u201d Elizondo said, with documents later confirming that Elizondo had taken formal steps to get the Tic Tac video and others like it, released to the public.\n\nChris Mellon, a former intelligence insider, admitted that he put the videos into the hands of the New York Times, creating a wave of publicity that led to the creation of a new Department of Defense investigation: the UAP Task Force. That organization, headed by veteran intelligence professional Jay Stratton, quietly compiled and analyzed other UFO videos and cases. A few of them eventually surfaced in media reports.\n\nVeteran intelligence professional Jay Stratton is interviewed on camera for the first time.\n\nIn Stratton\u2019s very first on-camera interview, he said a major goal of the task force was to reduce the stigma so that more military pilots would be willing to report their encounters, and to give them a formalized process to submit what they saw.\n\n\u201cIf you look back to that Tic Tac incident that happened in 2004, and you know from some of the releases that it wasn\u2019t until 2009, 2010 that things were looked at because they had nowhere to send it,\u201d Stratton said.\n\nWhat has changed in 2024? Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, head of UFO investigation AARO, or the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said the majority of UFO cases can be explained, as could the Tic Tac if more data were available. However, a detailed analysis of the Tic Tac and its capabilities was created. It was the first case investigated by AAWSAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program, another secretive program based in Las Vegas.\n\nIt\u2019s a project that Dr. James Lacatski, former director of AAWSAP, said did not have a vague purpose.\n\n\u201cIt was completely UFO-related,\u201d Lacatski said.\n\nContrary to what the public has been told, the U.S. government knows quite a bit about the Tic Tac, with one of its goals being to construct its own.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "If I had to recommend a single indie release this year, it'd probably be Mossmouth's UFO 50, mainly because it's a retro game anthology that actually feels like it could've been made back in the NES era (for the most part) while offering a fresh package.\n\nAmidst the usual onslaught of huge releases towards the end of the year, it's hard to find time for smaller titles if you're in this line of work. Hell, I spend like half of my work hours consuming and writing about other stuff, yet video games are the medium that requires more time and attention. It's easy to get burned out, which is why smaller and breezier games are almost as important as the big ones to stay healthy.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nFor the last few weeks, UFO 50 (only available on Steam for now) has been my 'game to play while having something on in the background' and I couldn't be more impressed with what Derek Yu and the talented developers behind Downwell, Air Land & Sea, Skorpulac, Catacomb Kids, and Madhouse have put together over nine flippin' years (check out this report on the collection that VG247 published... back in 2017).\n\nOf course, almost everyone has had more projects in the works meanwhile. Chief among them was Spelunky 2, which Yu finally unleashed in 2020. Meanwhile, UFO 50 continued to evolve in silence, and this last September it dropped without making much noise until the press got on top of it. After spending some time (less than I'd like) with it myself, I'm happy to report folks were not exaggerating. This thing whips and should be in the GOTY conversations coming up.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nSure, plenty of solo developers and indie studios have totally nailed the NES-era aesthetic and overarching design philosophies over the years (I just won't stop here to name countless examples), yet a recurring feeling I have is that most of those either feel a tad too modern despite everything else or just old in the worst possible way (rusty and not very fun to play). UFO 50, meanwhile, while not a complete home run (I mean, it literally packs 50 fully-featured, old-ass titles), completely feels like one of those bootleg cartridges full of whatever.\n\nI'm not gonna lie: I noped the f**k out of a handful of the games I've played so far, mainly because I wasn't in the mood to figure out obtuse mechanics or perfect timings, but almost no title in this fictional collection has felt bland or uninspired. There's a clear intent and vision behind all of them, and even if many don't click with me, I can see someone else enjoying the crap outta them. After all, they cover all sorts of genres and even try to replicate the 'evolution' of a fictional game company during the 1980s. Of course, this has led players to discover a meta layer that only makes the package even nuttier.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nControls are kept pretty simple in most cases too, which definitely helps the accessibility factor that permeates the whole thing. I'd consider most of the games included 'hard' by today's standards, but in most cases, it all comes down to the unique game design and the developers going 'look, you gotta master this s**t like back in the day, no excuses' (which rocks). This also applies to titles that include a multiplayer option or are straight-up designed as local party games; they're meant to be easy to pick up and just play in quick sessions.\n\nThis ain't a review, so I won't pretend to have played the full collection nor I'll get into specifics. This is a super juicy bundle of joy that I'll be playing for a long time, and I'm taking my time with it. It shines brighter when played between larger gaming sessions or during lunch breaks, and I strongly believe it doesn't benefit from brain-rotting, sweaty marathons better suited for modern video games. This is the message I'm trying to get across; I want you to discover what it has to offer for yourself.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nThis also means it's sort of the perfect game to play on your Steam Deck; I'd be surprised if it doesn't reach the Switch sooner rather than later. Instead of \"one more round,\" you'll be saying \"one more game,\" as you never know what you'll come across next. It's okay if you never beat them, as the experience alone of booting them up and fumbling around is magical and enriching enough. In a way, UFO 50 brings back that magic of ancient games you booted up over and over again but rarely managed to beat. Achievements await true sickos though.\n\nOkay, maybe I'll let you have some of my personal recommendations so far before I leave: Mortol, Velgress, Attactics, Bushido Ball, Camouflage, Campanella, Warptank (this one is genuinely fantastic), and Porgy. Try not to look them up before jumping in, trust me. This wild ride shouldn't be spoiled by our modern model of consumption. Your list of favorites might look very different, and that's the entire point of this trip down a memory lane that doesn't quite exist."

        "article_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nApple Intelligence launched on Monday, but the rollout is just a glimpse of how Apple hopes to transform its products with artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tech giant unveiled initial features of Apple Intelligence \u2014 its suite of AI tools \u2014 on select devices with its latest software update for iPhones, iPads and Macs.\n\nApple\u2019s AI features for iPhones will be available for free to users with any iPhone 16, iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, who update to iOS 18.1. Apple Intelligence is also available for iPad and Mac models that support iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, the company is implementing its first set of generative AI tools that aim to change how people use their iPhones and cement Apple\u2019s stake in the AI race against competitors like Microsoft and Google. Generative AI is the technology that produces unique text and images in response to user-prompts \u2014 from obscure images to relentlessly catchy music.\n\nThe release of Apple Intelligence comes on the heels of the iPhone 16 release in September, which is equipped with chip hardware designed to support Apple\u2019s AI-powered features.\n\nA pivot to AI has been a focus for Apple since it first unveiled the suite of Apple Intelligence features at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Implementing new generative AI is at the forefront of Big Tech ambitions to maintain exponential growth, and after years of sluggish sales, Apple is betting on AI to boost its performance and reinvigorate its consumer base.\n\nThe AI features rolling out with iOS 18.1\n\nThe Apple Intelligence features rolling out Monday include improvements to writing and editing, Siri and the Photo app.\n\nApple Intelligence\u2019s Writing Tools bring users improved proofreading, summarizing and editing features. Another focus of the release is Siri, which is supposed to become \u201cmore natural and conversational\u201d with Apple Intelligence, and will appear as a glowing light when activated.\n\nWith the software update, Apple says the Photos app is \u201cmore intelligent,\u201d with the ability to search for photos and videos by typing visual descriptions, like what someone was wearing. Users will also be able to edit photos and remove unwanted visual elements with another new feature called Clean Up.\n\nAdditionally, users will be able to record and transcribe calls, with Apple Intelligence providing a summary.\n\nUsers will be able to record and transcribe audio in the Phone and Notes apps, and Apple Intelligence will summarize the transcript. Apple\n\nApple Intelligence\u2019s features most likely fit into the \u201cnice to have\u201d category rather than necessary features most new phone buyers actively seek, however.\n\nAngelo Zino, a technology analyst at CFRA Research, told CNN in September that \u201cyou need to wait for word of mouth to trickle through the consumer base over the next couple of quarters\u201d before consumers will see the value of the new technology.\n\nAnd Apple\u2019s loyal customers or AI-curious consumers who were intrigued by images of Apple\u2019s new AI-generated \u201cGenmoji\u201d may feel underwhelmed by this launch, as many new features, like Image Wand \u2014 which lets users turn sketches into AI-generated images \u2014 won\u2019t be available until at least December, when iOS 18.2 debuts.\n\nWhile the first set of Apple Intelligence features might leave some iPhone users wondering if that\u2019s all there is to it, some analysts are bullish on Apple\u2019s plan to implement AI across its products, largely thanks to the company\u2019s large position in the market.\n\nDan Ives, a managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note Sunday that the rollout is the start of what will be an evolving process. \u201cConsumer AI will go through Apple\u2019s ecosystem with over 20% of the world\u2019s population ultimately interacting with AI on an Apple device the next few years,\u201d Ives said.\n\nApple is betting big on AI to boost its sales, and the rollout follows the iPhone 16 release, which didn\u2019t initially sell as well as Apple may have hoped. Apple sold just an estimated 37 million units in the first weekend of iPhone 16 pre-sales, down more than 12% compared to the same period last year, according to a blog post from Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with TF International Securities.\n\nAdditionally, Apple recently cut orders for iPhone 16s by about 10 million units through the end of 2024 and into 2025, according to another blog post by Kuo. That cut will result in less production of iPhones, he noted. According to Kuo, iPhone production for the fourth quarter of 2024 is now forecast at around 80 million, down year-over-year from 84 million.\n\nKuo noted that he did not think Apple Intelligence would immediately boost Apple\u2019s prospects for better sales.\n\n\u201cSome market participants are optimistic that Apple Intelligence could dramatically boost iPhone shipments soon,\u201d Kuo said in the blog post. \u201cHowever, Apple\u2019s recent order cuts suggest this optimistic expectation may not materialize in the short term.\u201d\n\nThe first rollout of Apple Intelligence features are available on devices with language settings set to American English. The ability to use Apple Intelligence in other languages like French or Japanese will roll out in 2025.\n\nCustomers line-up inside the Apple Store, Regent Street on September 20, 2024 in London, England. Following Apple's new product announcements, customers can pick up the new iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Max from UK Apple Stores today. Peter Nicholls/Getty Images\n\nApple promises more to come for December\n\nA bigger slate of AI features is expected in December when Apple debuts iOS 18.2, inclinding \u201cGenmoji,\u201d a feature that lets users create their own emoji, along with ChatGPT-powered Siri and Writing Tools.\n\nApple is also planning to introduce a \u201cvisual intelligence experience\u201d which would allow iPhone 16 users to hover their iPhone camera over objects and retrieve real-time information.\n\nWedbush\u2019s Ives said the implementation of Apple Intelligence will produce positive long-term results for the company.\n\n\u201cThis will be a multi-year AI journey that will define the future for Apple with its next generation chip architecture, hardware releases and future iPhone models built around the AI foundation that many consumers will ultimately embrace,\u201d Ives said in a note.\n\nCFRA Research\u2019s Zino said Apple\u2019s December rollout should prove more impactful than the October release.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect the Apple Intelligence capabilities rolling out this week to have a notable impact on consumer behavior and Apple-related product sales,\u201d Zino said in an email to CNN. \u201cPlanned Apple Intelligence new features expected in December and early 2025 will be much more impactful to the company\u2019s ecosystem, in our view, and will be viewed favorably by Apple\u2019s installed base.\u201d\n\nApple (AAPL) will report its quarterly earnings on Thursday. Shares of Apple on Monday closed at $233.40, a gain of $1.99, or 0.86%."

        "article_content": "While the paranormal might be a cause for fear to many, an intrepid group of Aggies prefer exploring the most haunted locations in Texas to find proof of lingering spirits.\n\nIn 2023, Forbes ranked Texas as the most haunted state in America with over 13,710 cemeteries, 7,517 ghost sightings, 925 haunted locations and 158 paranormal investigators. The Brazos Valley is no stranger to ghost stories and haunted locations, including the LaSalle Hotel in Downtown Bryan and the Animal Industries Building on the Texas A&M University campus.\n\nThe Texas A&M Paranormal Society (TAPS) brings believers and skeptics alike to haunted locations across Texas along with professional-level ghost hunting gear to test for paranormal activity and, hopefully, find evidence to one of life\u2019s greatest mysteries.\n\nIsa Rodriguez, TAPS president, recently led a paranormal investigation at the Queen Theatre in Downtown Bryan, which was rumored to be haunted after someone died from suicide in a nearby building years ago.\n\n\u201cWe also went to the Queen Theatre last semester and had a great time. I think that was one of the most active places I had ever been to back when I was vice president,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cLuckily, we have a really good relationship with the owner. They love to hear what we find and they trust us. \u2026 There\u2019s this pit in the back, behind the screen, and we got a lot of vocal evidence with the spirit box.\u201d\n\nParanormal investigators use a variety of tools to find evidence of the paranormal. A spirit box, also known as a ghost box, is a radio with a frequency scan that jumps from station to station, occasionally giving the listener words or phrases as it is believed that spirits communicate over different radio frequencies. Similarly, investigators may use an EMF (electromagnetic field radiation) reader, thermometer or motion detector in their hunts.\n\nRodriguez said she\u2019s had her own paranormal encounter on campus at Francis Hall which has been rumored to be haunted since 2003, especially in the early morning hours.\n\n\u201cWe investigated Francis Hall on campus and that was one of the first places that I\u2019d genuinely had a paranormal encounter and something that was inexplicable, because we were up on the third floor and I heard a child\u2019s laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cEver since then, I thank God I\u2019m not a construction science major, because I do not step foot in there by myself.\u201d\n\nOne of the other supposedly haunted locations on campus is the Animal Industries building where it is rumored, in 1965, the meat laboratory manager accidentally sliced through his femoral artery when trying to cut meat. The man bled to death and has allegedly been haunting the building ever since with some saying they have heard screams in the hallways late at night.\n\nAs a senior soon to graduate from A&M, Rodriguez hopes TAPS continues to grow and welcome both believers and non-believers.\n\n\u201cI think the paranormal is definitely something to explore and to accept, regardless of if you\u2019re a skeptic or not. There\u2019s skeptics in our organization,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a joy to lead this group and cultivate a space for them to be themselves and explore things that are still unknown.\u201d\n\nRhett England, public relations officer for TAPS, has been in the group for nearly four years since freshman year and has seen his fair share of haunts and paranormal encounters.\n\n\u201cWe went to a location called Tejas Barbecue in Tomball. At that investigation, I was touched on my side. I thought it was one of the members who was standing by me, and I asked him if he was touching me. He said no,\u201d England recalled. \u201cAnd we got this on video, but I had a drawstring bag and one of the strings kept moving side to side while I was standing still.\u201d\n\nMultiple types of hauntings exist, England said, which could influence the evidence the group is able to find.\n\n\u201cResidual haunting is just repetitive and triggered by something, like a certain day of the year,\u201d England said. \u201cFor example, if you died on Oct. 31, you\u2019re more likely to reappear on that day, or like Gettysburg where you\u2019ll hear the sounds of screaming soldiers.\u201d\n\nEngland said one of the biggest misconceptions people may have about TAPS is that they deny scientific knowledge.\n\n\u201cI think people should approach the paranormal with an open mind because I do believe in science, but I think science is a developing field, so it can only explain so many things,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that we\u2019re about to actually go and investigate places with actual equipment because I\u2019ve never had the opportunity before in my life to do something like that.\u201d\n\nAngelina Garcia, vice president of TAPS, is currently a sophomore sociology student at A&M and has a deep appreciation for learning about how cultures around the world discuss the paranormal.\n\n\u201cI think where I grew up in San Antonio and being Hispanic, there\u2019s obviously a very big connection to the dead and what happens after you die,\u201d she said. \u201cSo maybe, subconsciously, my Hispanic heritage and my family really pushed me to go into both my degree and TAPS.\u201d\n\nParanormal investigations often have been portrayed on TV shows and video games but their level of accuracy is not always accurate, Garcia said.\n\n\u201cEspecially now that I\u2019ve done my own investigations, and I\u2019ve used a decent amount of the equipment, everything that you watch is obviously very dramatized, and a lot of it is faked,\u201d she said. \u201cI think at the core of a lot of shows, it is true to how investigations are conducted, especially for the more realistic shows like the earlier seasons of \u2018Ghost Adventures.\u2019\u201d\n\nGarcia said, in her experience, people can have a pessimistic view on the afterlife while TAPS gives A&M students the opportunity to explore the unknown with friends.\n\n\u201cI feel like TAPS is a very good club, for lack of a better word, for the misfits, the ones who believe in spirits and those who may be a little alternative. There\u2019s not a lot of spaces for us on campus and I really want us to stay and expand so we can be a space for the kids that may not fit in with the general student population,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to think it\u2019s worth investigating into spirits. It\u2019s good to know there\u2019s more than just us on Earth or out there.\u201d\n\nAlas, no reports of paranormal activity was experienced in the group\u2019s latest trip to the Queen Theatre."

        "article_content": "Timed with Halloween, a group of thrill-seekers gathered at Oak Park\u2019s historic Pleasant Home on Friday to learn more about the 19th century mansion\u2019s alleged supernatural occurrences from experts.\n\nParticipants explored the historic Pleasant Home alongside a team of paranormal investigators from The Other Side Investigations, roaming the eerie rooms and corridors of Pleasant Home using ghost-hunting equipment to uncover the mysteries behind its storied past and reported supernatural phenomena.\n\nIn small groups, attendees explored different areas of the house. Equipped with devices provided by The Other Side Investigations team, they searched for signs of paranormal activity. The Other Side Investigations team guided them through the experience explaining the equipment used to detect paranormal activity, such as the REM Pod, ghost box, and K2 meters. They also shared personal stories and insights from their own ghost hunting experiences.\n\nAnd indeed, after the event, some claimed to have experienced some paranormal activity.\n\nOak Park resident Elli Wade, visiting Pleasant Home for the first time, said the group encountered some paranormal activity in the billiard room. Wade was holding the K2 Meter while in a circle with other attendees sitting down and the reading of the K2 meter went from a 0.1 to a 0.4 reading. The Other Side Investigations told the room that because of the change of that meter, there was paranormal activity going on.\n\n\u201cIt was very cool to actually see it happen in front of my eyes,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThis is such a beautiful house and it\u2019s fun to do something like this. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I love Halloween. We joke that Halloween is my Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nPhoto provided\n\n\u201cThis was a little sample bite and appetizer of ghost hunting. We love to help people. Sometimes the unknown is very scary for some people,\u201d said Lesley Tuton, an investigation coordinator from the team.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations acquisitioner David Amesquita shared his hopes for the event, saying he wanted attendees to experience the beauty of Pleasant Home firsthand. For those who hadn\u2019t visited before, he felt it was a perfect opportunity to appreciate the mansion\u2019s charm up close.\n\n\u201cI go out and try to find different locations for us to visit, whether it\u2019s through various park districts or libraries. I try to get our name out there and secure more places to explore. I also look for different haunted houses and people often reach out to me so we can set something up,\u201d Amesquita said.\n\nNoelle Combs, historic properties and special events coordinator for the Park District of Oak Park, started her work with the park district in March and has had her fair share of eerie experiences at Pleasant Home.\n\nCombs told the group that she recently saw a figure in a top hat walk by in the mirror that can be seen when heading up to the second floor and when she looked up, there was nothing.\n\nCombs said she has seen unexplained door slammings and that Susan Crane, the historic properties and special events manager, smelled tobacco when nobody would be smoking.\n\n\u201cI never feel scared in this house. I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about those things. You guys are experts, but like you said, you only get to come at night. I\u2019m here sometimes from nine in the morning until eleven at night and things do happen,\u201d Combs said.\n\nEvent attendees also heard about the rich history of Pleasant Home from Paula Fenza, a docent for the mansion for more than nine years. Fenza said that Pleasant Home was built in 1897 by architect George Washington Maher for John Farson, his wife, Mamie, and their two sons, John Jr. and William. The family moved into the house in 1899.\n\n\u201cJohn and Mamie had wonderful, lavish parties. They would be so happy to see all of you here, because this is what they loved to do, welcome people into their home,\u201d Fenza said.\n\nPhoto provided\n\nAfter John Farson died in 1910, Mamie sold Pleasant Home, along with its custom furnishings, to inventor Herbert Mills, known for creating the slot machine and the railroad crossing gate. Mills lived in the house with his wife Leonie and their eight children until his death in 1929, followed by Leonie\u2019s passing in 1930.\n\nIn 1939, the children sold the house and its four-acre estate to the Park District, stipulating two conditions: the grounds were to be opened as a public park named Mills Park in honor of their father; and the home was to be preserved and used as a gathering space for the community. Today, Pleasant Home serves as a historic landmark and venue for guided tours and local events.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations team is expected to return to Oak Park this spring for another public investigation, this time at the historic Cheney Mansion.\n\nRelated"

        "article_content": "Researchers have uncovered a rare and intelligent fungus. The fungus is called Phanerochaete velutina, and while it isn\u2019t overly intelligent\u2014it won\u2019t be taking over the world anytime soon like the fungus in The Last of Us\u2014it still shows signs of recognizing shapes and even being able to communicate about its surroundings with the rest of its fungal network.\n\nThe researchers who made the discovery highlight their findings in a paper published in the journal Funal Ecology. In the paper, they discuss how they conducted various experiments, including one where they arranged small wood blocks in several different shapes and allowed the fungi to spread within the shapes.\n\nAs the rare and intelligent fungus spread, they found that it was able to make different decisions based on the type of arrangement the blocks had been set up in. Instead of just spreading out from a central point, they were able to change how they spread out to fit the shape more effectively. This suggests a rudimentary level of intelligence is found within P. velutina.\n\nAccording to the paper, when the fungi were placed in a circle arrangement of blocks, they were able to figure out where the blocks were and then pass that information to the rest of the network, as they never moved to the center of the circle. They seemed to realize that no blocks would be found there. The researchers say this means that the fungal mycelium can \u201crecognize\u201d the difference in the spatial arrangement of wooden blocks.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

        "article_content": "When we're researching a company, it's sometimes hard to find the warning signs, but there are some financial metrics that can help spot trouble early. More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well. And from a first read, things don't look too good at Beta Systems Software (FRA:BSS), so let's see why.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Beta Systems Software, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.044 = \u20ac2.2m \u00f7 (\u20ac86m - \u20ac35m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Beta Systems Software has an ROCE of 4.4%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 15%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Beta Systems Software\n\nroce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Beta Systems Software's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Beta Systems Software .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nIn terms of Beta Systems Software's historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. About five years ago, returns on capital were 9.2%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Beta Systems Software to turn into a multi-bagger.\n\nOn a side note, Beta Systems Software's current liabilities have increased over the last five years to 41% of total assets, effectively distorting the ROCE to some degree. If current liabilities hadn't increased as much as they did, the ROCE could actually be even lower. What this means is that in reality, a rather large portion of the business is being funded by the likes of the company's suppliers or short-term creditors, which can bring some risks of its own.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn summary, it's unfortunate that Beta Systems Software is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. But investors must be expecting an improvement of sorts because over the last five yearsthe stock has delivered a respectable 60% return. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere.\n\nStory Continues"
