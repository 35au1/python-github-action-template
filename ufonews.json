The previous record was 5.65 inches set on Nov. 1, 1901.\n\nMore flash flooding is possible with more rain and storms in the forecast for Sunday in the Roswell region of eastern New Mexico, the National Weather Service stated.\n\nRoswell, NM flooding rescue efforts\n\nThe New Mexico National Guard said that its troops and other agencies rescued nearly 300 people in the overnight hours, including at least one swift water rope rescue and 38 people who were taken to hospitals.\n\nSearch and rescue efforts continued Sunday morning as water levels remained high in the downtown area, the city of Roswell said in a statement. Flood waters entered many houses and other buildings.\n\nMany vehicles got stuck in flash flood waters with some vehicles swept into the river channel. Other motorists waited to be rescued on top of their vehicles that were covered by water, Roswell authorities reported.\n\nAll roads leading to and from Roswell had been closed due to heavy flooding overnight, New Mexico State Police said.\n\nRescue operations taking place involve the Roswell police and fire departments, the Chaves County Sheriff's Office, county volunteer fire departments and New Mexico State Police and the state's National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard is using light/medium tactical vehicles, known as LMTVs, capable of driving in up to four feet of water to transport residents to safety. There were 57 guardsmen in Roswell as of Sunday morning, the National Guard said in a statement.\n\n\"We feel for the New Mexicans affected by this latest flooding in our state,\" Maj. Gen. Miguel Aguilar, the NM National Guard's adjutant general, said in a statement. \"Because of the previous flooding in Ruidoso, we have the experience and were ready for this. We've worked all night, and continue to work with swift water rescue teams and other partner agencies to help our fellow citizens get to safety.\""

WhatsApp is no exception, with the app gaining the services of the Meta AI chatbot not too long ago. We've seen WhatsApp make multiple changes to its Meta AI implementation over the past few updates, with the app recently adding granular editing controls for AI-generated images. WhatsApp is now working on another update for its AI chatbot, one that could make it easier to manage what it remembers about your chats.\n\nThe WhatsApp sleuths over at WABetaInfo dug into version 2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android to find a new Memory section within the app. More specifically, this Memory option has sprung up within the Chat info page, accessed by tapping the top of a chat.\n\nOn older betas of WhatsApp for Android, the Chat info page contains minimal options, including buttons for Message, Share, and Search, followed by a brief disclaimer about how AI can get things wrong at times.\n\nThere are also options for managing notifications and deciding whether media generated by Meta AI is saved to the device's gallery. But with v2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android, a brand-new Memory option appears right below Media visibility, along with the description \"What Meta AI remembers about you.\"\n\nA much-needed privacy addition\n\nWhatsApp Meta AI Memory Tab\n\nThe text inside the Memory page mentions that \"Meta AI automatically remembers certain parts of your chat to give you more relevant responses.\" Users can ensure the chatbot remembers something by asking it to \"remember this\" after a prompt. Having Meta AI remember specific parts of your conversation should help generate better-quality responses over a period of time, especially if it's a subject you bring up frequently with the chatbot.\n\nWhile it's unclear what this Memory page will look like when populated, we suspect there will be an easy option to remove any memory the chatbot has stored. WABetaInfo says this feature is still in development, which explains why I couldn't get it to appear despite sideloading the APK from APKMirror. Nevertheless, given how important a feature like this is, particularly from a privacy perspective, we expect it to eventually make it to the stable version of the chat app.\n\nWhatsApp Messenger\n\nWhatsApp LLC\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.3\n\nDownload"

        "article_content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Just in time for Halloween, the West Virginia Paranormal Trail has added four new paranormal attractions for participants to visit, the West Virginia Department of Tourism announced Thursday.\n\nThe trail, which launched two weeks ago, is based off of the West Virginia Waterfall Trail that the department has seen do so well. The trail started with only 14 attractions but with the addition they will have 18 spooky attractions for people to see. And since its launch the trail has seen almost 5,000 participants sign up already, and those signatures have come from 39 different states and three different countries.\n\nAnd Lauren Bodnar, Director of Public Relations for the WV Department of Tourism said that this has already helped tourism in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cNot only are people excited about it but there coming here and there traveling around to these different stops,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nAnd the reason that it has garnered so much attention so fast, is because of social media which allows them to reach more people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something a little bit different that we\u2019ve done in the past, it just caught people\u2019s attention, I think,\u201d Bodnar said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s one part but also just our promotion on our social media helps spread the word pretty easily.\u201d\n\nThe four new attractions include the West Virginia Bigfoot Museum in Sutton, Silver Run Tunnel in Cairo, Cryptid Mountain Miniature Golf in Morgantown, and Hempfield Tunnel in Wheeling, however Bodnar says that there are a wide variety of what visitors can expect during the trail.\n\n\u201cThey really range from kind of these haunted tunnels, there\u2019s the insane asylum in Weston, there\u2019s the state penitentiary up north, so really there are a range of different places to visit across the state,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nYou can find the whole list of attractions when you go to the West Virginia Department of Tourism website.\n\nAnd since it\u2019s gained so much participation, Bodnar anticipates that the trail could be something they could keep going.\n\n\u201cI definitely think it\u2019s something that we would consider extending, especially if we get a lot of feedback, that it\u2019s something that people want to keep adding to and that they want to keep checking into,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nBodnar also said that they don\u2019t know every haunted attraction in the state, and they encourage people to go to their website to recommend an attraction.\n\nPeople who are interested in participating in the trail, can go to the Department of Transportation website and sign up for a virtual passport.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll sign up, you\u2019ll put in your name and some of your contact information in a form, and then the passport will be sent directly to your phone either via text or the email that you provided,\u201d Bodnar said.\n\nAlthough the trail is related to all things spooky, it is expected to last until the end of this year."

It's also said to be haunted by the ghost of Gulielma \"Elma\" Sands, the woman whose body was found in the well more than two centuries ago.\n\nHistorical novelist Lauren Willig, who researched the trial for her upcoming book, \u201cThe Girl From Greenwich Street,\u201d said the ghost stories began immediately after Sands\u2019 death.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re going and collecting testimony about Elma\u2019s murder, there are all of these stories about people hearing a voice in the night from the meadow crying, \u2018murder, murder, help me,\u2019\u201d she said, noting that at the time, the well was located outdoors in an area known as Lispenard\u2019s Meadow.\n\nSands, 22, disappeared after leaving her boarding house on the evening of Dec. 22, 1799. She\u2019d told her cousin she was on her way to marry Levi Weeks, a man who had been courting her. Her bruised body was found in the well about a week-and-a-half later. Sands\u2019 family immediately suspected that Weeks was behind her murder, and a grand jury later indicted him.\n\nWeeks\u2019 brother Ezra was well connected in New York, and retained the services of an all-star legal team consisting of Henry Brockholst Livingston, Aaron Burr, and none other than Alexander Hamilton.\n\nAccording to the Historical Society of the New York Courts, the state\u2019s case was \u201centirely circumstantial,\u201d while the defense team produced witnesses who testified that Weeks was with his brother and other friends the night Sands went missing. The jury acquitted Weeks of the murder after just five minutes of deliberation, and Sands\u2019 murder remains unsolved.\n\n\u201cI think the ghost story, in some ways, catches on that sense of injustice and uncertainty, because where there can't be earthly justice, there's still the ghost trying out for some sort of restitution, or just for attention,\u201d Willig said.\n\nA four-story building was built just south of the well in 1817. It eventually came to house the Manhattan Bistro starting in the 1950s, when the well was no longer visible at street level. It was rediscovered when the owner excavated the basement in the 1980s, according to a 2011 Wall Street Journal report. Although the owner said at the time that she wasn\u2019t sure about paranormal activity, she added that bottles had inexplicably shot off the shelves behind the Bistro\u2019s bar on two occasions.\n\nCOS moved in after the building was sold in 2015."

You must take two materials that have the properties that you want and, like making a baby, you must see how to combine them to get exactly the offspring that you want.\n\nMeta (formerly, Facebook), often bashed for cashing-in on data, has now given a meta gift to mankind: tomes of data \u2014 for research into functional (meta) materials.\n\nThe global giant has just released copious amounts of data about behaviour of materials at the atomic level, under its Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) initiative, for free.\n\nThis data can help scientists combine different materials with different desired properties to create something new. Examples of functional materials that can tackle climate change include new catalysts for renewable energy storage, carbon neutral fuels, new sorbents for direct air capture, etc.\n\nCreating such materials is somewhat similar to discovering a drug molecule for disease by trying out different combinations of molecules or making a dish of desired taste, texture and flavour from millions of ingredients.\n\nTraditionally, making meta materials involved playing trial-and-error with millions of data points from thousands of materials. But now, there is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can deliver the goods, however, AI is data hungry.\n\nMeta has provided this food for AI. The OMat24 dataset is a collection of data generated from simulations and calculations on different inorganic materials. This dataset contains information on 118 million atomic structures, whichhas information on three parameters \u2014 total energy (the overall energy of the material\u2019s structure), forces (acting on each atom) and cell stress (indicating how the material could deform under certain conditions.) All this was calculated using \u2018density functional theory\u2019, a quantum mechanics-based method for predicting material properties .\n\n\u201cThe search space of possible materials is enormous and remains a significant challenge for both computational and experimental approaches to material science,\u201d says a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper by scientists at Meta\u2019s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group. \u201cIdentifying promising candidates through computational screening with machine learning models offers the potential to dramatically increase the search space and the rate of experimental discovery,\u201d says the paper, written by Luis Borroso-Luque et al.\n\nFAIR scientists took over 400 million core-hours of computing to get the data of 118 million structures labelled with total energy, forces and cell stress. (One CPU core used for one hour is one core-hour.) These parameters give an idea of the stability of materials under given conditions.\n\nNow that there is data on over 118 million atomic structures, one can train an AI model to come up with the best combination of any of them for a desired material."

With age, he developed lifestyle diseases and decided to reverse them by changing diet and lifestyle. This led him to study and research in the field of nutrition and plant-based whole food field. Eventually, he successfully got rid of all his chronic diseases and reinvented himself. Lalit became an inspiration for his IIT-K batch mates and started to guide them with his learnings. Many of them benefitted and successfully reversed their chronic diseases. He further incorporated the Nobel prize winning work by Nobel laureates Dr Yoshinori Ohsumi (2016) on autophagy, Dr Jeffery Hall (2017) on circadian rhythm and Dr Tasuko Honzo (2018) on immunotherapy into his recommendations. He has conducted over 450 course sessions which have been attended by over 150,000 people in over 50 countries with thousands of success stories. He runs over 100 active social groups and his NGO \u201cPlant Based Wellness Foundation\u201d has over 40 centers worldwide. Lalit has also taught a course as a visiting faculty on Nutrition & Health at IIT Kanpur for one semester. LESS ... MORE\n\nDuring the early 20th century, several significant developments led to the emergence of what we now call modern medicine:\n\n1. The overhaul of medical education, initiated by the Flexner Report in 1910, commissioned at the request of John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, the two richest men in the world.\n\n2. The discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, a bacteriologist at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London.\n\n3. The discovery of vitamin C by Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi in 1928, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1937.\n\nIt had long been known that sailors on extendegd voyages suffered from a disease called scurvy. The French and British navies had established recommendations for sailors to consume citrus fruits daily. However, after the discovery of vitamin C, it was believed that the ill health of sailors was due to a deficiency in vitamin C. This understanding contributed to the evolution of the science of nutrition as we know it today. Modern nutrition is largely reductionist, focusing on breaking down food into its nutrient components. Patients are diagnosed based on the composition of nutrients in their blood, with deficiencies supplemented and surpluses managed through dietary restrictions.\n\nHad early observers of scurvy in sailors concluded that the problem was due to a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, rather than solely a vitamin C deficiency\u2014which we now know to be a more accurate understanding\u2014the trajectory of nutrition science might have been different. However, this approach would have posed a challenge: it wouldn\u2019t have generated profit. Neither doctors, supplement manufacturers, nor pharmaceutical companies would have benefited. Dr. Colin Campbell, regarded as one of the foremost nutritionists today, has consistently emphasized the need to rewrite nutrition science and unlearn much of what has been taught over the past century.\n\nThe discovery of epigenetics in recent decades has shown us that it is not just the individual components of nutrition that matter, but the whole food, along with its inherent bacteria. As Dr. Campbell puts it, rather than focusing on individual instruments, we should focus on the symphony.\n\nNutrition science has unfortunately centered around creating a \u201cnormal\u201d range for various nutrients, against which any sample is analyzed. Let\u2019s explore how these so called normal ranges are derived.\n\nWhat is normal?\n\nWhen you get lab tests done\u2014whether blood, urine, or stool\u2014the report compares your results to a range called \u201cnormal.\u201d But have you ever wondered who decided what \u201cnormal\u201d is?\n\nThis range is derived from a large sample of the population. For any test, readings vary from person to person, forming a bell curve. The area under two standard deviations (2\u03c3) covers about 95% of the total sample. This is what \u201cnormal\u201d means. For example, if your hemoglobin is between 14-17 g/dL, you fall within the 95% of the population. If your reading is above 17 or below 14, it simply means you\u2019re in the top or bottom 2.5%. This is often misunderstood as a sign of a problem, which may or may not be the case.\n\nIt\u2019s essential for both you and your doctor to understand why your reading is outside the \u201cnormal\u201d range. For some blood chemistry markers, the cutoff is determined by committees made up of healthcare providers, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and government agencies like the FDA. For example, the criteria for total cholesterol, vitamin D, fasting glucose, and blood pressure are established by different bodies.\n\nThere are various vested interests in keeping these cutoff points low (or high), as it can increase the number of patients, benefiting doctors and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSince modern medicine has largely developed in Western countries like England and America, large samples were taken from their local populations to establish these \u201cnormal\u201d criteria. These reflect the diet, lifestyle, and health of those populations. However, in countries like India, medical guidelines are often adopted from the West without considering genetic differences and dietary habits.\n\nFor example, Americans predominantly consume meat, while many Indians are vegetarians, leading to discrepancies. Hemoglobin is one area where Indian people often fall short of the established \u201cnormal\u201d range. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are unhealthy or in need of medication or supplements.\n\nAnother example is potassium. The normal range is 3.6 to 5.2mmol/L. Americans typically don\u2019t consume much green leafy vegetables, which are rich in potassium. Once you start a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, intermittent fasting, or similar health-conscious programs, your potassium intake rises, and blood tests may show levels above the upper range. This doesn\u2019t mean you have a health problem\u2014it means you\u2019re healthier than 95% of Americans!\n\nVicious cycle of overdiagnosis\n\nWhat increasingly happens is that a seemingly healthy person with poor eating habits undergoes a checkup at age 45 or 50. The doctor orders various tests, points out discrepancies, and prescribes medication or supplements. You take the medication, start to worry, and a \u201cnocebo effect\u201d takes hold\u2014you imagine symptoms. Medication also comes with side effects or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Within six months, you feel unwell and visit the doctor again, who prescribes more medication. This vicious cycle continues, and before long, you\u2019re 60 years old and taking five medications. This is what happened to me.\n\nDoctors today are not trained in nutrition, so they don\u2019t provide dietary guidance. If pressed by patients, they share whatever they\u2019ve gleaned from mass media, which is heavily influenced by the food and drug industry.\n\nDon\u2019t kill the messenger\n\nLifestyle diseases exist on a continuum. They start as soon as a child is weaned off breast milk and begins eating whatever their parents feed him. If the diet is unhealthy, the body compensates by increasing blood pressure, insulin secretion, or other mechanisms. These compensatory systems keep major markers like blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol in check. However, once the body can no longer compensate, these markers slowly rise. When they reach a certain point, as determined by governing bodies like the ADA, AHA, or ACP, the person is labeled as having a chronic disease.\n\nThe right approach would be to correct the diet and lifestyle that led to the rise in markers. However, in practice, doctors focus on lowering the markers through medication. When the markers return to the \u201cnormal\u201d range, the person feels \u201chealed,\u201d but no attention is paid to the underlying cause. Over time, the markers rise again, and the doctor either increases the medication dose or adds a new drug. The side effects of these medications often lead to other health issues.\n\nI call this the suppression of symptoms, akin to killing the messenger. Rather than addressing the root cause\u2014an unhealthy diet and lifestyle\u2014we attack the symptoms. Most medications for lifestyle diseases work this way: they don\u2019t address the disease\u2019s cause, just the symptoms. Unfortunately, nutrition science is not part of medical school curricula, and doctors are trained to focus on managing symptoms and bring them in normal range rather than understanding the bigger picture of health.\n\nPlease listen to Padma Vibhushan Dr. B.M.Hegde and Dr. Colin Campbell speak on the subject.\n\nWhat is Normal BP\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NQoD-LiwSFw? si=swZtRjvq4LIgzI1V\n\nT.

        "article_content": "Summarize Simplifying... In short A recent study has discovered that the liver's bile production, which helps flush out cholesterol, is influenced by the rate of blood flow from the intestine.\n\nThis blood flow, which varies throughout the day due to activities like exercise and eating, triggers a protein that converts cholesterol into bile acids.\n\nHowever, low bile production can lead to high cholesterol levels, potentially causing liver diseases.\n\nThis groundbreaking research could aid in treating liver and digestive system diseases. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe discovery could help in treating cardiovascular diseases\n\nNew study reveals how liver flushes out cholesterol\n\nBy Akash Pandey 01:21 pm Oct 20, 202401:21 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a groundbreaking study, researchers at the University of Leeds have revealed a new way in which the liver rids the body of cholesterol. The discovery could pave the way for more effective treatments for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. The study looked at bile production, an essential process for removing excess cholesterol from the body, and its link with blood flow into the liver.\n\nKey findings\n\nBile production and blood flow: A crucial connection\n\nThe study found bile production is affected by how quickly blood enters the liver via the \"portal\" vein from the intestine. It was found that this blood flow varies throughout the day as a result of movement, rest, and eating. The researchers found an inverse relationship between bile production and portal vein blood flow, with bile production increasing during periods of decreased blood flow due to exercise or fasting.\n\nHealth risks\n\nImplications of low bile production on health\n\nThe research also emphasized that low bile production can result in high cholesterol levels in the blood, which may contribute to fatty liver disease. If untreated, this can progress into liver inflammation and fibrosis. Dr. Laeticia Lichtenstein, the lead researcher of the study, stressed the importance of their findings saying, \"This discovery...is incredible.\" She added that these findings could help doctors treating liver and digestive system diseases.\n\nNovel discovery\n\nLink between portal vein blood flow and cholesterol\n\nPublished in Science Advances, the study is the first to link portal vein blood flow to blood cholesterol levels. It found that a pressure-sensing protein called PIEZO1 senses the change in blood flow rate through the vein. This initiates a chemical reaction that converts cholesterol into bile acids for removal from the body. The study highlights the liver's importance in controlling fat levels in blood and avoiding fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer.\n\nCholesterol types\n\nCholesterol: A double-edged sword\n\nCholesterol, a fat necessary for normal body functioning, can be both good and bad. There are two types of cholesterol - \"good\" cholesterol that helps body functions and \"bad\" cholesterol that can build up in arteries, increasing heart disease and stroke risks. High cholesterol levels may be due to genetics, certain medications or health conditions but are also associated with lifestyle factors like unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption."

        "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 High Growth Software Stocks That Are Profitable In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) stands against the other high growth software stocks.\n\nThe Software Industry: An Analysis\n\nThe software market is experiencing robust growth, driven by various trends and technological advancements. According to Precedence Research, the global software market size reached $659.17 billion in 2023\u200b. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% during 2024 \u2013 2034 to reach $2.24 trillion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. In 2023, the North American region led the software market, holding a substantial share of 44%. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.\n\nA key factor influencing the market is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being integrated into software solutions to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. A study from Salesforce reveals that 85% of IT leaders expect AI to boost developer productivity over the next three years. This expectation underscores the growing recognition of AI\u2019s role in streamlining workflows and optimizing software performance.\n\nAnother significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based software. Companies are migrating from traditional on-premises solutions to cloud services due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This transition allows businesses to access applications remotely and across various devices, which has become crucial in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nThe 2024 AlgoSec State of Network Security report highlights a notable shift towards multi-cloud environments. The research, based on surveys conducted in H2 of 2022 and 2023, evaluated major players like AWS and Microsoft Azure. It indicates that security, continuity, and compliance are key factors driving organizations to adopt cloud platforms. While cloud adoption is growing, Azure remains the most popular platform, with AWS rapidly gaining ground.\n\nThe report also reveals that the move to remote work has significantly boosted Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) deployment, dropping the percentage of organizations without SD-WAN from 55.2% in 2022 to 34% in 2023. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022. This trend reflects a growing focus on securing cloud networks against external threats.\n\nWith an overview of the global software market in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 50 largest software companies by market cap.\n\nTo narrow down our list to high-growth software stocks, we focused on companies with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in net revenue exceeding 18% over the past 5 years.\n\nNext, we focused on profitability. From this initial list of high-growth software stocks, we narrowed our choices to stocks that had positive trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income and stocks that have grown their net income positively over the past 5 years.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the net income CAGR and revenue CAGR over the past five years, and YCharts, which offered information on TTM net income.\n\nFinally, from this list of high-growth software stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024 are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT)\n\nTTM Net Income: $1.31 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 28.51%\n\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 23.11%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a cybersecurity company that develops and sells software and network security solutions. The company\u2019s portfolio of more than 50 enterprise-grade products is the largest integrated offering available, delivering protection to networks, users, and data from continually evolving threats.\n\nThe company is actively pursuing its strategy to lead in the rapidly growing Unified SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and Security Operations markets while also increasing its market share in Secure Networking. The company aims to differentiate itself as a SASE leader, being the only vendor recognized in multiple Gartner Magic Quadrant reports for both Single-Vendor SASE and various network security categories. By developing all SASE functions organically within a single operating system, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) offers a comprehensive stack that includes its market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB, Firewall, and more, enhancing user experiences while securing access to both on-premise and cloud applications.\n\nRecently, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) acquired Next DLP, a cloud-native data protection platform that will enable the company to enter the enterprise DLP market and enhance its SASE solutions.\n\nThe company is also enhancing its Secure Ops portfolio by leveraging over a decade of AI experience to provide advanced analytics and sensors that continuously monitor access activities for signs of cyber threats. In August, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) acquired Lacework, a cloud security and cloud-native application protection platform, which significantly broadens the company\u2019s security offerings and increases the company\u2019s total addressable market by $10 billion. This acquisition, combined with the integration of AI-driven solutions, positions Fortinet to deliver comprehensive protection across network, cloud, and endpoint environments.\n\nFrom its acquisitions of Next DLP and Lacework, Fortinet Inc.

(NASDAQ:FTNT) has seen impressive growth over the last five years, with revenue increasing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.11% and net income rising at a CAGR of 28.51%.\n\nOverall FTNT ranks 7th on our list of the high growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of FTNT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FTNT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\nDisclosure: None.
