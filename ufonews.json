        "article_content": "Brits can see where UFOs have been spotted across the country during the past four years on a map - showing nearly 2,000 extra-terrestrial sightings.\n\nIt has been an intriguing time for UFO enthusiasts around the world with an American fighter jet shooting down an unexplained flying object that was later identified as a Chinese balloon last year. It was suspected of being on a spying mission along with three other objects in or near American airspace.\n\nAnd then whistle-blower Major David Grusch, a former Air Force intelligence officer, set the internet on fire when he claimed the US was concealing a long-standing programme that retrieves and reverse-engineers unidentified flying objects. The intrigue has continued into 2024, with Ukrainian troops recording a huge disc-shaped object over the battlefield of Donetsk, while closer to home a hiker came upon a mysterious monolith on a hilltop in Powys, Wales.\n\nHe initially assumed was \u201csome sort of UFO\u201d, and has since left some speculating it may have been planted by aliens. But despite increasing speculation about alien visitors online the skies above the UK have been relatively quiet in the past year and we are no closer to finding out if we are not alone in the universe.\n\nIn its annual report, the research group UFO Identified documented 395 sightings in the UK in 2023 - a 20% drop from 497 sightings in 2022 and lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484). That adds up to 1,789 sightings in four years. Information was taken from social media, newspaper reports, and over 50 Freedom of Information requests, as well as from reports made directly to UFO spotter groups around the UK.\n\nAccording to the report, people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39). That is broadly similar to the location of sightings in 2022 and 2021. Over the four years UFO Identified has documented the phenomenon, the highest number of sightings have been seen in the South East (233), followed by the North West (218) and then the South West (193). The lowest number of sightings have been reported in Northern Ireland (30), and the North East of England (63).\n\nWhile flying saucers and other unexplained phenomena were most likely to be spotted in the North West or the South East, the data shows that the best time to see a UFO last year was on a Monday evening between 9pm and 10pm. The most common sighting was a \u201cstar-like\u201d UFO, followed by an orb - with several different witnesses reporting clusters of orbs in the skies across different locations.\n\nThe vast majority of sightings were of far-off objects in the sky, but there were 27 \u201cClose Encounters of the First Kind\u201d, more than double the previous year. These are reports of UFOs seen up close, at a distance of no more than 500 feet away. There were also two \u201cClose Encounters of the Second Kind\u201d which is when a UFO sighting appears to cause a physical effect, such as a car malfunction, a ground impression, or a reaction in animals.\n\nSightings documented last year include:"

        "article_content": "BELLEVILLE \u2014 Back in 1987, a strange set of lights shone in the skies over Belleville. Every year since, residents have carried out 5K runs, craft markets and parades under the title UFO Days, perhaps hoping to tempt extraterrestrial visitors to come back.\n\nSaturday\u2019s UFO Parade marked 38 years of the alien-centric festivities \u2014 and 100 years of lifelong Belleville resident Art Fahey, the parade\u2019s grand marshal who lives in the same farmhouse he was born in.\n\nHaving lived through the Great Depression, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and multiple wars, Fahey isn\u2019t much fazed what he sees on on a day-to-day basis \u2014 even when dozens of little green martians follow him down Main Street toting huge bags of candy. (Little known fact: If you throw a peanut butter cup hard enough, it briefly becomes an unidentified flying object.)\n\n\u201cThey asked me if I would be (grand marshal) because I\u2019m 100 years old and I live on the farm I was born in, so I said, \u2018Well, yeah I guess I could do it,\u2019\u201d Fahey said Saturday.\n\nHometown Olympian Lauren O\u2019Connor was originally named grand marshal. But the rower was out of town during the festivities, and Fahey graciously agreed to take her convertible seat and wave to the town he\u2019s loved his whole life.\n\nA colorful array of creatures waved back at Fahey, children breaking in their costumes in the days leading up to Halloween and little fairies dancing in the grass, their wiry wings struggling against the bulk of coats and sweatshirts. Dinosaurs and vampires chased each other, vying for those coveted sour gummies and string cheese sticks. Elvis even made an appearance. He isn\u2019t dead \u2014 he\u2019s just shorter now, wears Nike sneakers and carries a Halloween candy tote.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve led a good life\u2019\n\nIn the hours before he was due to lead the parade, Fahey recalled his own childhood, when his house had no electricity and an ice cream bar cost a nickel. He obliged the Wisconsin State Journal\u2019s many questions about life at 100, surrounded by family in the Lingonberry Llama, a Main Street coffee shop. He may not have been to the Olympics, but his is a story worth hearing nonetheless.\n\nHe\u2019s a lifelong farmer. He loves his beer. He\u2019s been to Hawaii twice. The highlight of his life, apart from his wedding day and the birth of his four children, of course, was getting electricity in his home in 1942.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain it, but I\u2019ve led a good life,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday nights, Fahey and his brother could go to free movies in a nearby park. Their father would send them out with a dime each, enough for a bag of popcorn or an ice cream bar, each of which, Fahey said, cost a nickel.\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019d bring home a nickel,\u201d he said. \u201cA nickel was a nickel.\u201d\n\nFun in those days looked like a battery-powered radio, a local party or a dance. Fahey dated on and off, but back then, he said, he wasn\u2019t in much of a hurry to get to the altar.\n\n\u201cSome of these farm girls, they want to get married,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to go out with the boys for a couple of years, that was kind of a fun time with the boys.\u201d\n\nFahey and friends learned that if they carried around a pencil and looked at the marks on the hands of people who\u2019d already paid, they could copy the marks and get in for free. Now that he\u2019s out of the woods of criminal liability for those petty crimes, Fahey said the trick worked about 90% of the time.\n\nA close family\n\nFahey met his late wife dancing and continued dancing with her until her death. They had four children, John, Art, Connie and Nancy, all of whom are exceptionally proud of their father.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen a lot in his life so he\u2019s very generous, ya know,\u201d Art said. \u201cI think it\u2019s faith, family and friends, and not necessarily in that order.\u201d\n\nFahey is equally as proud of his kids, though he contends that he isn\u2019t quite sure how he managed to do such a good job raising them.\n\n\u201cWe got a close family. I can think of a couple families right now where brothers and sisters don\u2019t even talk to each other, but we are close,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cI guess I did a pretty good job. I didn\u2019t really know I was doing it.\u201d\n\nThe reason Fahey has stayed in Belleville is simple \u2014 he sees no reason to move anyplace else.\n\n\u201cBelleville\u2019s got everything. They got church, they got the store, they got the bank, that\u2019s all I need,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s even allowed to drive still \u2014 though not farther than 10 miles. Given his affinity for his hometown, though, that isn\u2019t much of a problem for Fahey. If he needs to go farther, he gets a ride from family or friends.\n\nHe\u2019s kept up his health, although he doesn\u2019t see much use for his occasional doctor appointments.\n\n\u201cYou know, I get into the doctor, he\u2019ll tell me exactly what I already know. Why should I go at 100 years old?\u201d Fahey said. \u201cThe splendid thing is, I don\u2019t have to use a cane or a walker. My balance isn\u2019t that great, but I got to have something wrong with me at 100 years.\u201d\n\n50 best alien movies #50. The Vast of Night (2019) #49. Starman (1984) #48. Gandahar (1987) #47.

        "article_content": "Illustration: Tang Tengfei/Global Times\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a cutting-edge technology that the world's scientific and technological powers compete to develop. In the military field, the development of \"AI-powered autonomous weapons\" has become the focus of technology applications. Currently, the \"revolving door\" phenomenon produced by US politics has appeared in the technological, political and military realms.It is obvious that the US has recently been stepping up the promotion of AI technology in the military and intelligence field. US President Joe Biden signed a memorandum on Thursday, instructing national security agencies to accelerate the adoption and integration of AI systems. As some US media reports commented, this shows that the US military and intelligence agencies are required to \"more quickly embrace and deploy artificial intelligence as a matter of national security.\"The world's concern about the security and humanitarian risks behind such a move from the US has grown stronger. For emerging technologies that still face imperfections in regulation and governance, the promotion of their weaponization needs to be built on a complete risk-control system. Otherwise, its unpredictability and uncontrollability will pose a major threat to global peace and security. The US' unilateralist concept of security has jeopardized the security interests of other countries and exacerbated the arms race in the field of AI military applications, to a certain extent, while hindering the process of AI security governance. There are certain differences in the positions, attitudes and views of countries participating in AI security governance, and the future of the governance of AI military applications remains uncertain.International cooperation is especially needed in the field of AI security governance, and the common wisdom of mankind should become a \"creator\" of human happiness, not a \"stumbling block\" to security and stability. We should strengthen common security in the field of AI and fully support the UN in playing its role as the main channel of global scientific and technological governance. We also need to appropriately respond to all kinds of AI security issues and challenges, ensuring that AI is always under human control.In order to truly promote the effective governance of technology, it is necessary to abandon the zero-sum mentality. Adhering to the principle of indivisibility of security, we resolutely oppose prioritizing the security of one country over the insecurity of others. Only by effectively respecting and safeguarding the legitimate security concerns of each country, and group, can we truly safeguard the common security interests of the majority of the global community from infringement.To promote safe collaboration in the field of AI, it is essential to encourage broader participation from various stakeholders. Countries around the world are facing similar security threats in an increasingly uncertain and unstable environment, and thus should become active \"participants\" of security governance. Ensuring that global issues are addressed by all countries and that global rules are established collectively is crucial for achieving more open and inclusive governance in the technological realm.The development and application of AI across various fields, especially in the military domain, are significantly affecting the global security environment. However, the specific forms, means and consequences of these impacts remain uncertain, and how new security risks evolve is yet to be observed. Therefore, it is vital for the international community to jointly explore safe development paths for military AI.Recent international practices have shown that achieving collaborative security governance is not an easy task. With respect to military AI, on the one hand, certain countries have severe tendencies toward pan-securitization and unilateralism, continuously constructing technological barriers and digital divides. The technological competition and \"cold war\" in science and technology are becoming realities. On the other hand, the dual-use nature of AI, to some extent, increases the costs of trust between nations and raises the threshold for global cooperative governance. To this end, the international community needs to actively seek cooperation paths.The author is a scholar at the CPC Theory Innovation Research Center of the Armed Police Force. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn"

        "article_content": "Standing below the hay loft, Julie Bukovich listened to the heavy grunts and creaks of the old barn as the sun set outside and the evening grew colder. She\u2019d been living with her boyfriend on the 19-acre Chesapeake farm for long enough that the sounds were familiar. But the feeling she\u2019d recently been getting \u2014 a sense, like an invisible presence, something hovering, something watching her \u2014 was new. On this March evening, she watched the expert she\u2019d called to investigate go to work.\n\nThe lanky, blue-eyed teenager strode through the barn, past rows of hanging tools and between stacks of horse feed. He held a bundle of smoldering sage above his head like an Olympic torch and left a trail of scented smoke.\n\n\u201cThank you. Thank you for being here,\u201d Bukovich said, opening a side door and pointing into a hallway, fumbling to find a light switch. \u201cIn there is where there\u2019s been a lot of activity.\u201d\n\nGhost hunter William Abbitt, 18, took a deep breath, pulled out a bottle of holy water that had been blessed by a Catholic priest in Virginia Beach, and stepped into the darkness.\n\nAbbitt isn\u2019t a devout follower of any one religion but knows items such as holy water and crucifixes calm the nerves of those who do or believe. He often suspects a haunting has more to do with faulty wiring, chemical-induced hallucinations or anxiety.\n\nHe walked into the dim hallway that led to a storage area, sprinkled the holy water on the far door and recited a Catholic prayer.\n\n\u201cSt. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection \u2026\u201d\n\nAbbitt started investigating suspected paranormal activities as a sophomore at Grassfield High School in Chesapeake. His reputation has grown among his peers as he\u2019s outlined cases on his website and in videos on a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploits of his team: WTCW Paranormal.\n\nHe has led WTCW Paranormal on 35 investigations into local lore and claims of the supernatural in Hampton Roads, at historical sites, businesses and homes. The group\u2019s mission is to research and remain skeptical. He isn\u2019t sure how much he believes in the supernatural. Which is why he got into the whole ghost thing in the first place.\n\n___\n\nWhen Abbitt was around 7, he, his mom and his two big sisters moved into a Virginia Beach house where doors opened and closed inexplicably and it felt like he was living with an angry spirit. \u201cClassic poltergeist activity,\u201d he now says.\n\nAfter the family moved to Chesapeake, he wanted to disbelieve what he remembered. Except he couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn high school, he started by reading the Bible and the Torah.\n\nHe moved to theology and dabbled in demonological literature with texts including Frank and Ida Mae Hammond\u2019s \u201cPigs in the Parlor: The Practical Guide to Deliverance\u201d and dove into mysticism with texts such as the anonymously authored grimoire \u201cThe Lesser Key of Solomon.\u201d He combed through online parapsychological studies and developed a disdain for TV shows that depicted paranormal investigations lacking the scientific method.\n\nToo many people, he thought, took the subject too lightly. Plus, he was having fun.\n\nAbbitt started saving money he made after school at Wendy\u2019s and during the winter break selling Christmas trees to buy equipment that he\u2019d read was essential for paranormal investigations: A camcorder with night vision; a digital audio recorder; flashlights and headlamps; six motion sensors; an infrared laser temperature reader in case ghosts prompt drops in temperature; an ambient temperature deviation device that doubles as a spirit box which cycles through radio frequencies and may be a useful tool for the dead to speak through; an EMF reader, based on hypotheses that ghosts cause shifts in electromagnetic field strengths; frankincense; myrrh; holy water; and walkie-talkies, all of which he stores in a traveling case.\n\nWTCW stands for the founders\u2019 first names: William, Tate, Chris and William. Abbitt is the only founder remaining. Two left the group to pursue other interests and one died this year. But on July 14, 2022, they were all together when they set out to conduct their first \u201cbig\u201d investigation.\n\nThe four of them spent part of the night at the Ferry Plantation House, which dates back to about 1830 and is said to have multiple spirits. Abbitt\u2019s camcorder caught a creaking sound like someone walking up the stairs.\n\nAt her farm in March, Bukovich found nothing funny about what she had experienced in and around her barn. She\u2019d been scared by an icky presence in the barn and showed Abbitt a recording on her security cameras which showed a bright orb of light floating in her driveway. She felt more at ease after his visit and liked the seriousness with which he performed the cleansing ritual in her barn. She felt heard.\n\n___\n\nAbbitt frequently posts online notices for new team members, and responses come in from teens to people older than 50. They want to be investigators, camera operators, psychics or demonologists for the team, which has fluctuated between two and eight people.\n\nRecently he got his first post-high school job working construction and uses it to fund WTCW Paranormal. In May, he investigated the Wells Theatre in downtown Norfolk with his then-newest team member. Sammi Cocuzzo, 25, a psychic from Chesapeake, was excited. According to the Wells, the theater is home to three ghosts, including Ned the Stagehand, who haunts the backstage fly rail where he used to raise and lower stage backdrops.\n\nOn a Friday morning, theater staff led the team backstage. The performance space was dark, and Abbitt handed out headlamps. Two team members stayed on the first floor, and he and Cocuzzo climbed a staircase toward a balcony overlooking the stage and Ned\u2019s favorite stomping grounds.\n\nStanding the dark, Cocuzzo lifted her hands to about chest height, one palm facing out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m picking up on a woman,\u201d she said, and spoke into Abbitt\u2019s nearby spirit box, hoping for a reply.\n\n\u201cNed, if you\u2019re here can you give us a sign? Can you manipulate this energy?\u201d she later asked.\n\nShe continued to ask questions. Abbitt stared at the EMF meter. Then, suddenly, they heard a bang from the staircase. It sounded like the thud of a heavy object after a fall, and Abbitt\u2019s walkie-talkie lit up.\n\nYes, Abbitt said. But no one had seen anything.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really active,\u201d Cocuzzo said, standing close to Abbitt. \u201cBut they are kind of chilling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, they aren\u2019t really messing with us right now,\u201d Abbitt said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good thing.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d brought his skepticism to the investigation, but in the moment he sounded like a believer.\n\nCocuzzo looked over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cI get the feeling that they like it here.\u201d\n\nColin Warren-Hicks, 919-818-8138, colin.warrenhicks@virginiamedia.com"

In short Scientists have discovered a group of neurons in the brainstem that could be the control center for REM sleep, a stage often disrupted in sleep disorders.\n\nBy manipulating these neurons, they were able to alter sleep patterns in mice, suggesting potential new treatments for conditions like sleep apnea and narcolepsy.\n\nThis breakthrough could pave the way for better understanding and treatment of sleep disorders. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe discovery was made through experiments on mice\n\nBreakthrough discovery could lead to new treatments for sleep disorders\n\nBy Akash Pandey 04:58 pm Oct 27, 202404:58 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a major breakthrough in sleep research, a team of scientists has identified the neural control center for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The discovery, made through experiments on mice, saw researchers inducing REM sleep by stimulating a specific circuit at the top of the brainstem. The findings could potentially deepen our understanding of human sleep biology and its disorders.\n\nTherapeutic implications\n\nPotential applications in treating sleep disorders\n\nThe team's findings could have major implications in treating sleep disorders like sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and REM disorders. These conditions often involve distressing nightmares or physical manifestations of dreams through movement or vocalizations. The newfound knowledge about the brain's control center for REM sleep, could potentially be used to manipulate this stage of sleep in patients suffering from these disorders.\n\nResearch challenges\n\nUnraveling the mysteries of REM sleep\n\nThe precise location and role of the brain's REM sleep control center have long been debated among scientists. Some researchers have proposed that neurons in the mammalian brainstem are key to triggering REM sleep. This theory stems from observations in cats, where removal or damage to the brainstem prevents proper REM sleep and leads to dream enactment behaviors.\n\nNeurological insights\n\nBrainstem's role in REM sleep and related disorders\n\nSimilar dream enactment behaviors have been seen in humans with known brainstem degeneration (like in Parkinson's disease). This further supports the theory of the brainstem's role in REM sleep. The pons, at the top of the brainstem, has been identified as a potential 'control center' for muscle relaxation during REM sleep through rodent studies. However, identifying specific pathways responsible for this crucial phase has proved challenging due to intermingling neurons promoting wakefulness and sleep.\n\nNeuronal discovery\n\nDiscovery of REM-related neurons in the brainstem\n\nNeuroscientist Mitsuaki Kashiwagi and his team have pinpointed a cluster of REM-related neurons in the dorsal region of the pons. These neurons, called Crhbp+ neurons due to their expression of a corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein, project from the pons to Nos1+ neurons in the medulla oblongata. This loop could potentially act as a core circuit for REM sleep, Kashiwagi and his colleagues said.\n\nExperimental results\n\nManipulation of pons neurons affects REM sleep\n\nThe team's experiments revealed that when pons neurons were taken out of the loop, mice had less sleep and impaired muscle relaxation during REM sleep. On the other hand, activating these neurons increased the number and duration of REM episodes at the cost of wakefulness. This indicates that manipulating these neurons could potentially be used as a therapeutic strategy for sleep disorders."

The city has unveiled its very first dinosaur fossils, which likely belonged to a large dinosaur. These fossils were located on a remote island, adding substantial value to the field of palaeoecological studies in the area.\n\nThe fossils, which experts have dated back to the Cretaceous period, are undergoing further examination to determine their exact species. This new find is poised to shed light on the region's prehistoric past, acting as a cornerstone for future research efforts.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"
