            "article_content": "Charter is hosting its first AI-focused summit, Leading with AI, in New York City on January 30. Two of our sessions\u2014\u201cGenAI 102\u201d and \u201cThree ways of using genAI you have to try at work tomorrow\u201d\u2014address an observation of ours that many people are stuck using genAI in the same simple ways they\u2019ve been using it for over a year now. They\u2019ll use ChatGPT to draft an email, summarize a report, or analyze some data, but the experimentation stops there. Attendees will leave both of these sessions with new ideas on how they can use genAI in their work.\n\nThis is also a focus of ours. The Charter Pro Digest newsletter sometimes features an \u201cAI tip of the week\u201d with new ideas on how to use AI at work and in your personal life. As 2024 came to an end, I wondered: Out of all of those tips, which ones do I continue to use on a regular basis? I went through every single AI tip of the week I wrote last year\u2014here\u2019s what stuck:\n\nSign up for Charter's newsletter to get the handbook for the future of work delivered to your inbox.\n\n1. Using Reader to convert articles into audio.\n\nThere was a lot of excitement last year about Google\u2019s NotebookLM, which can turn any piece of text into a podcast. I was also impressed by this feature, and I use it from time to time. But I usually want to read the original article, itself, rather than an AI-synthesized version of it. ElevenLabs\u2019s Reader app can convert text to audio, so I can listen to the article as it was originally written. If I\u2019m on a walk or doing chores, I\u2019ll upload the article I want to read into the Reader app and listen to it. The app is free and easy to use.\n\n\n\n2. Using ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode to learn new things.\n\nWhen ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode was released to the public, I was most excited by the prospect of using it to practice languages. I used to speak Russian at an advanced level, but I\u2019m rusty after a few years without practice. Now, I can open the ChatGPT app on my phone and have a 15-minute conversation in Russian about whatever\u2019s on my mind. I could see this being a great way to brush up on a language before traveling to some destination.\n\nI\u2019ve recently been even more excited about using voice mode to learn about new subjects. The beauty of this form of learning is that it\u2019s hyperpersonalized\u2014you can focus on the aspects of the topics you\u2019re most confused about and keep asking questions until you understand. You can then test your understanding by asking voice mode to quiz you.\n\nWHAT TO TRY\n\nHere are some tactics I\u2019ve found useful for using voice mode to learn about topics:\n\nInterrupt it when you\u2019ve missed something or if you\u2019re confused about what it said.\n\nAsk for analogies when you\u2019re struggling to understand something.\n\nRepeat back to it your understanding of the concept and ask it to tell you if you\u2019ve understood it correctly.\n\n3. Using Claude or ChatGPT to search for information in my source material.\n\nI wrote earlier last year about how I used ChatGPT while writing a Work Tech article about the best AI-powered search engines. I primarily used it to:\n\nSummarize my notes about each search engine.\n\nHelp me rank the search engines based on my notes, with me pushing back when I disagreed with its interpretation.\n\nFind specific examples from my notes that illustrate my point while I write.\n\nOut of all three, the third use has continued to be the most helpful for me. I write articles that pull information from interviews, academic papers, my notes, and other news articles. While writing, I\u2019ll sometimes upload my source material into Claude and ask questions like, \u201cDo any of the documents have information on [topic]?\u201d or \u201cI remember seeing a stat that suggested [concept]. Can you help me find it in my documents?\u201d This helps me spend more time thinking about the story and less time searching through my notes.\n\n\n\n4. Using ChatGPT or Claude to give me code that automates tasks.\n\nI\u2019ve written about how genAI allows everyone to do a little bit of everything. An outcome of that is that non-technical workers can build bespoke tools and workflows that help with their jobs. Building GPTs, customized versions of ChatGPT, is one example of this. Another example involves having ChatGPT or Claude produce code you can use to automate a task.\n\nI built one such automation that sends me an email every afternoon with all of the AI stories from the publications I follow. ChatGPT gave me the code, which I ran in Google Apps Script, a platform that lets you build integrations and automations across Google products. Now, every day at 3pm, I get an email with all of the AI stories I should read that day.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Charter Pro.

While the popular app already serves its intended purpose, Meta is exploring new ways to modernize it. According to a recent WhatsApp beta build for Android, Meta AI character creation could soon be coming to the mobile app.\n\nPer a WABetaInfo report, Meta is preparing to bring AI character creation to WhatsApp. Version 2.25.1.26 beta for Android reveals how the feature could work if the company proceeds with its plans. Similar to the existing Meta AI Studio tool on Instagram\u2019s website, WhatsApp will seemingly let users build custom AI chatbots by describing their personality, expertise, unique qualities, etc.\n\nTo inspire users creating Meta AI characters, WhatsApp may display trait suggestions when building a chatbot. Based on the included screenshot, there also appears to be a refresh button that will generate new recommendations if users are unhappy with the presented ones.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the AI characters themselves aren\u2019t new; eligible WhatsApp users can already access first- and third-party chatbots in the app. The upcoming addition will only popularize creating them by making the building tools easily accessible.\n\nOtherwise, WABetaInfo highlights that WhatsApp for Android may soon drop the Communities tab in favor of a new one dedicated to AI chats. Those who rely on the Communities feature will still be able to access it through the main Chats tab. It remains unclear when and if Meta will roll out these changes, as they\u2019re still in development.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

But when the 59-year-old, best known for playing Barry Evans in EastEnders, was pushed down the stairs of his Isle of Sheppey home \u2013 which he shares with his wife Adele \u2013 that was the final straw.\n\n\u201cWhen we moved into the house, there were the usual bumps every old house gets in the night. It could be wind in the attic, anything really. But then pictures started coming off walls \u2013 they were securely fastened \u2013 that\u2019s when I knew something was up,\u201d says Williamson.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Live Kent A289 traffic updates following crash involving car and motorbike\n\nREAD MORE: Route used as rat run in Kent town shuts for urgent roadworks\n\n\u201cI remember when we were doing our kitchen extension, we got to know the builders really well, so sometimes we would go off to work on a Friday at the weekend and leave them to lock up after saying goodbye. Once, half an hour later, they phoned and said \u2018You haven\u2019t left then yet?\u2019 but we were halfway out on the M25. They said there was a woman upstairs looking out at us.\n\n\u201cI also used to sit in my office, which was on the second floor, and I could feel a hand at the top of my chair, rocking me. There are all sorts of things. It was never a nasty or malignant presence, I could always deal with it. No problem. But then one day, I was walking down the stairs with a cup of tea in one hand and a plate in the other and I just fell. It wasn\u2019t like a buckle, I went up in the air, both feet and landed on my back. My cup of tea and plate smashed. It took me five minutes to get my breath back. I just thought, \u2018Christ, what was that?\u2019 At the back of your mind, you wonder if it\u2019s the ghost. When the team moved in we found out that there was a strong presence on that stairway.\u201d\n\nCelebrity! Help My House is Haunted. Presenters: Jayne Harris, Ian Lawman and Barri Ghai help stars with their ghostly problems -Credit:2023 Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc\n\nCelebrity Help! My House Is Haunted is a weekly series returning to Discovery+ for its fourth season, where this time six new celebrities call upon the help of paranormal experts, broadcaster Ian Lawman, TV presenter Barri Ghai, and paranormal researcher Jayne Harris.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom midnight opera singers to vengeful souls of highwaymen, the team triggers, confronts and banishes some of the most intimidating and defiant spirits of celebrity homes \u2013 including comedian and writer Dom Joly, 57, model and TV personality Jo Wood, 69, actress and singer Claire Sweeney, 53, TV personality James Argent, 37, former England rugby union player Chris Robshaw, 38, and his wife British singer Camilla Kerslake, 36, and of course Williamson.\n\nFor Williamson, his five-bedroom house hasn\u2019t felt safe to live in. But in a dramatic spirit-trigger session during the second episode of the show, he confronts the spirit of a man named George, who murdered his wife in the 1900s.\n\n\u201cIt needed to be exorcised,\u201d says Williamson. \u201cI can understand why people would say this is all crap. But there was no other reason why I fell like that. I\u2019ve always been open to it [paranormal activity] and believed that the spirits of people linger after they are gone. But I was still 50-50 until the ghost started to inflict physical damage on you, that\u2019s just a different league.\u201d\n\nCombined with the use of cutting-edge technology, the ghost-busting trio immerse themselves into the dark histories of inhabitants before them to help the celebrities reclaim their space once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe kit they\u2019ve got is really interesting, especially when they managed to frame his energy at the top of the stairs and create a human image,\u201d says Williamson.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a religious ceremony but it\u2019s a set ceremony where they get in contact with the ghosts, which means you have to move out of your house for one night. It\u2019s like a ritual where they also leave various things in their house, such as a crystal and gradually over time it diminishes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit weird. Even when they were gone, stuff still kept happening but not as bad. I still hear noises and sometimes the television comes on for no reason. So we got in touch with the team, who told us that it takes a while. It\u2019s like they get the crap beaten out of them and then drain away.\u201d\n\nBut how angry was Williamson with the spirit for disrupting his home?\n\n\u201cAll it [ghost] did was insult me. It wasn\u2019t great. I was angry it pushed me down the stairs, and that he wouldn\u2019t let go of the spirit of his wife. So he\u2019s just a wrong un, George is an a***hole and he had to go. That\u2019s why I\u2019m really glad of this programme, because now, even if bits of his spirit remain, it\u2019s not doing any harm,\u201d says Williamson.\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s brother who was interviewed in the show definitely felt it. We don\u2019t really do that many sleepovers, so I think he\u2019s the main member of the family who has moved into our home when we go on holiday, as an anti-burglary device. It was there, so it wasn\u2019t just us.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of anything like this, so it\u2019s all new to me. It didn\u2019t freak me out. I was more fascinated rather than frightened. I think the team has done their job, George is impotent.\u201d\n\nCelebrity Help! My House is Haunted comes to Discovery+ on Thursday, January 23."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

Among these bodies are quasars \u2014 distant galaxies that host supermassive black holes surrounded by hot disks of gas capable of emitting powerful jets.\n\nadvertisement\n\nQuasar looks like a star when seen through a telescope, but it is actually a region surrounding a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy.\n\nAn aspiring naval officer Olivia Achenbach from the United States Naval Academy has unveiled surprising characteristics of one such quasar, J0742+2704, using NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble captured intriguing hints of interaction, if not full merging, between galaxies including quasar J0742+2704. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nAchenbach's discovery, made during a four-week internship, revealed a distinct spiral shape in the images captured by Hubble.\n\n\"The biggest surprise was seeing the distinct spiral shape in the Hubble Space Telescope images. At first, I was worried I had made an error,\" she stated.\n\nThis finding is particularly significant as quasars are typically associated with older, massive galaxies that have undergone chaotic mergers and exhibit elliptical shapes.\n\nAstronomer Kristina Nyland, Achenbach\u2019s research advisor at the Naval Research Laboratory, emphasised the rarity of finding a quasar-hosting galaxy with spiral arms and a black hole more than 400 million times the mass of the Sun. \"It's extremely rare and exciting to find such a quasar with young jets that weren't detectable 20 years ago,\" Nyland noted.\n\nThe quasar J0742+2704 contributes to ongoing debates within the astronomy community regarding the origins of quasar jets, which play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by suppressing star formation.\n\nWhile some scientists believe these jets are triggered by major galaxy mergers, the spiral structure of J0742+2704 suggests alternative pathways for jet formation. The Hubble Telescope. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nInterestingly, Hubble\u2019s images show signs of potential interaction with nearby galaxies. One arm of J0742+2704 appears distorted, hinting at gravitational influences from another galaxy.\n\nNyland remarked, \"While the quasar has not experienced a major disruptive merger, it may be interacting with another galaxy, which is gravitationally tugging at its spiral arm.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nA nearby galaxy visible in Hubble's image features a ring structure, indicative of interactions where smaller galaxies pass through larger ones. Nyland speculates that this could provide clues about the processes triggering J0742+2704's young jets.\n\nBoth Achenbach and Nyland view this discovery as just the beginning, with plans for further analysis using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and ALMA in Chile.\n\nAchenbach encourages ongoing observation: \"If we looked at this galaxy 20 years ago, we would have seen a fairly average quasar. It shows that continued exploration can lead to remarkable discoveries.\""

The rest is history.\n\nIn 2016, Jack Clark walked up to me in Bloomberg's San Francisco newsroom and asked if we could go for a walk. As an editor, it's often not good when one of your reporters makes a request like this.\n\nAD\n\nSure enough, as we sat on a bench looking over the bay, Jack told me he was quitting to join a nonprofit called OpenAI.\n\nI said this was a terrible idea. OpenAI was less than a year old at the time and was still a relatively obscure AI research group. Its major claim to fame was Elon Musk's (uneven) financial support.\n\nAD\n\nI pressed my case.

In contrast, OpenAI didn't seem to have much of a direction, and I couldn't see a path for it to become financially sustainable beyond asking Musk for more money. I selfishly also wanted Jack to stay at Bloomberg and keep covering Google and AI, which he was good at.\n\nI thought I was pretty persuasive, but Jack ignored me and left .\n\n\"Just read the research papers\"\n\nJack Clark Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images\n\nHe went on to be an influential expert and advisor on AI safety and related topics, co-authoring several AI research papers . Jack also built one of the most popular AI email newsletters, called Import AI , which researchers widely follow in the field. He still writes this regularly.\n\nAD\n\nHe often told me to \"just read the research papers\" when I asked how to learn more about AI and get better stories about the technology. He was right. There's a lot of valuable information buried in these papers.\n\nJack stayed at OpenAI for over four years, doing strategy and communications before becoming a policy director. He may have gotten some equity in that startup, but I'm not sure.\n\nThen, in 2020, he left OpenAI and I didn't hear from him for a while. He popped up a few months later as one of seven cofounders of Anthropic, which was started by a bunch of early OpenAI employees.\n\nAD\n\nCofounders reminisce\n\nAnthropic is now challenging OpenAI at the forefront of generative AI and large language models. It's backed by Amazon and Google, along with several top venture capital firms.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe cofounders got together last month to talk about the start of Anthropic. Jack holds court with his colleagues, who reminisce about the early days.\n\n\"I met Dario in 2015 when I went to a conference you were at, and I tried to interview you, and Google PR said I would've read all of your research papers,\" Jack says to Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, who used to work at Google.\n\nAD\n\n\"I think I was writing 'Concrete problems in AI safety' when I was at Google,\" Amodei replies. \"I think you wrote a story about that paper.\"\n\n\"I did,\" Jack says, with a cheeky smile.\n\nNot his style\n\nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Anthropic was raising money at a $60 billion valuation. Then, Forbes reported that the seven cofounders, including Jack, are set to become billionaires.\n\nAD\n\nI asked Jack about this last week and said I wanted to interview him for a story.\n\n\"Haha, Ali, thanks, but really not my style,\" he replied.\n\nIt's true. Jack is among the gentlest, kindest, and most self-deprecating people I've ever met. He's not classic billionaire material.\n\nAD\n\nI'm still stunned and trying to process his new situation. What I do know is that Jack's decision to ignore me was a testament to his passion, single-mindedness, and vision.\n\nBack in 2015, when very few people thought about AI, he was obsessed with it and was constantly pushing to write about the technology at Bloomberg.\n\nJack knew that AI was important. When his chance came, he took a risk and went for it."

            "article_content": "Some researchers think AI systems will reach human-level intelligence soon; others think it\u2019s far away.Credit: Getty\n\nThe technology firm OpenAI made headlines last month when its latest experimental chatbot model, o3, achieved a high score on a test that marks progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI\u2019s o3 scored 87.5%, trouncing the previous best score for an artificial intelligence (AI) system of 55.5%.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nThis is \u201ca genuine breakthrough\u201d, says AI researcher Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, who created the test, called Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI)1, in 2019 while working at Google, based in Mountain View, California. A high score on the test doesn\u2019t mean that AGI \u2014 broadly defined as a computing system that can reason, plan and learn skills as well as humans can \u2014 has been achieved, Chollet says, but o3 is \u201cabsolutely\u201d capable of reasoning and \u201chas quite substantial generalization power\u201d.\n\nResearchers are bowled over by o3\u2019s performance across a variety of tests, or benchmarks, including the extremely difficult FrontierMath test, announced in November by the virtual research institute Epoch AI. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely impressive,\u201d says David Rein, an AI-benchmarking researcher at the Model Evaluation & Threat Research group, which is based in Berkeley, California.\n\nChatGPT broke the Turing test \u2014 the race is on for new ways to assess AI\n\nBut many, including Rein, caution that it\u2019s hard to tell whether the ARC-AGI test really measures AI\u2019s capacity to reason and generalize. \u201cThere have been a lot of benchmarks that purport to measure something fundamental for intelligence, and it turns out they didn\u2019t,\u201d Rein says. The hunt continues, he says, for ever-better tests.\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, has not revealed how o3 works, but the system arrived on the scene soon after the firm\u2019s o1 model, which uses \u2018chain of thought\u2019 logic to solve problems by talking itself through a series of reasoning steps. Some specialists think that o3 might be producing a series of different chains of thought to help whittle down the best answer from a range of options.\n\nSpending more time refining an answer at test time makes a huge difference to the results, says Chollet, who is now based in Seattle, Washington. But o3 comes at a massive expense: to tackle each task in the ARC-AGI test, its high-scoring mode took an average of 14 minutes and probably cost thousands of dollars. (Computing costs are estimated, Chollet says, on the basis of how much OpenAI charges customers per token or word, which depends on factors including electricity usage and hardware costs.) This \u201craises sustainability concerns\u201d, says Xiang Yue at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who studies large language models (LLMs) that power chatbots.\n\nGenerally smart\n\nAlthough the term AGI is often used to describe a computing system that meets or surpasses human cognitive abilities across a broad range of tasks, no technical definition for it exists. As a result, there is no consensus on when AI tools might achieve AGI. Some say the moment has already arrived; others say it is still far away.\n\nMany tests are being developed to track progress towards AGI. Some, including Rein\u2019s 2023 Google-Proof Q&A2, are intended to assess an AI system\u2019s performance on PhD-level science problems. OpenAI\u2019s 2024 MLE-bench pits an AI system against 75 challenges hosted on Kaggle, an online data-science competition platform. The challenges include real-world problems such as translating ancient scrolls and developing vaccines3.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nGood benchmarks need to sidestep a host of issues. For instance, it is essential that the AI hasn\u2019t seen the same questions while being trained, and the questions should be designed in such a way that the AI can\u2019t cheat by taking shortcuts. \u201cLLMs are adept at leveraging subtle textual hints to derive answers without engaging in true reasoning,\u201d Yue says. The tests should ideally be as messy and noisy as real-world conditions while also setting targets for energy efficiency, he adds.\n\nYue led the development of a test called the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI (MMMU), which asks chatbots to do university-level, visual-based tasks such as interpreting sheet music, graphs and circuit diagrams4. Yue says that OpenAI\u2019s o1 holds the current MMMU record of 78.2% (o3\u2019s score is unknown), compared with a top-tier human performance of 88.6%.\n\nThe ARC-AGI, by contrast, relies on basic skills in mathematics and pattern recognition that humans typically develop in early childhood. It provides test-takers with a demonstration set of before and after designs, and asks them to infer the \u2018after\u2019 state for a novel \u2018before\u2019 design (see \u2018Before and after\u2019). \u201cI like the ARC-AGI test for its complementary perspective,\u201d Yue says."

Or, as the case may be, in data conglomerates (aka \u201cdata brokers\u201d) that specialize in collecting financial, health, relationship, and other types of data about you and others. One of the best ways to defend against this data collection is to take a proactive stance, opting out whenever possible and asking to be removed as much as possible. An easy way to do this is to use Incogni, a service dedicated to removing your personal info from the internet. Right now you can get this service for 55% off of an annual plan if you use the code DIGITALDEAL when you check out. That brings the cost to $81 from $180, and saves you $99 for the year. Tap the button below to check it out yourself, or keep reading to see what makes Incogni special.\n\nUse Incogni to keep your private info private\n\nAccess to your private info is like an onion, it has layers. (Speaking of onions, check out the best VPNs for more ways to stay secure online.) The first layer is those so-called \u201cpeople search sites\u201d that give out your address and phone number, like a sort of digital phone book. When you sign up for Incogni these are the first sites you\u2019ll see lose your info. This can do everything from reducing spam calls to keeping your home\u2019s location a bit more private.\n\nAnd this outer layer is where many services stop. However, Incogni goes for the deeper stuff, too. The next layer targets other types of data brokers, including the ones that you can\u2019t easily access from a name search. We\u2019re talking about the ones that hold onto health information, relationship status, and your private interests. In other words, stuff that you might not want put out into the world via a data leak. Incogni will also go the extra mile by repeatedly contacting these sites for you so you don\u2019t reappear, negotiate with the sites on your behalf, and just generally automate the process for you.\n\nThis means that the most proactive you have to be about your digital data with Incogni is upon startup. Remember, if you start using Incogni now you can get it for a year at 55% off with code DIGITALDEAL. This drops the price from $180 to just $81, saving you $99. Just tap the button below and follow the sign up instructions to get started. Then, go check out the top tech of CES this year, that you\u2019ll be able to put in your now more private home."

Many items such as safety glass (1903) taken for granted in today\u2019s windscreens but one of earliest uses was in gasmasks, for troops in WWI. Vaseline (1870) an accidental find, when \u2018gunk on pipes\u2019 was used by troops as a staple; to sooth burns, wounds and trench foot.\n\nSimple items, such as matches (1826), are taken for granted. Superseded by lighters, they play a part in history. Even 25 years after the war, men lighting cigarettes would only light one, then another, before putting the match out and starting again. This habit was engrained because during the war a sniper could use a bullet to \u2018home in\u2019 and take out the third light.\n\nCoco-Cola (1826) yet another derivative from \u2018war\u2019 when its American inventor, following his experience in American Civil War, wanted to create an opiate free drink, to alleviate his addiction to morphine. Unfortunately, caffeine and stimulants still included, offended the Temperance Movement insisting it be alcohol free so, changes resulted in a sugar syrup concoction of carbonated water. Dynamite (1847) invented by a lab chemist, very wary of progressing development when conscious it was more powerful than gunpowder, yet more volatile. However not deterred, his colleague, saw the potential in mining, demolition and armament for war. Play-Doh\u2019s inventor nearly went bankrupt, when changes in society changed his customer base.\n\nPre 1942 homes heated with coal, left sooty deposits on walls and this was used as a cleaning product, until post war electric and gas meant soot was less of an issue. Bankruptcy was only avoided because the inventor\u2019s sister took it into a primary school, to use as modelling clay, initially called Rainbow Craft, before developing the product we know today.\n\nAccidents continue; Cornflakes as a healthy veg option, developed when boiled wheat left to go soggy was put in an oven to crisp up. The initial microwave (1967) was 5 ft tall, weighing 750lbs yet; few homes are now without one. Similarly, the most common used antibiotic in the world Penicillin, developed by accident after its inventor left a messy worktop, which became mouldy.\n\nAnother invention, much taken for granted; smoke detectors save millions of lives because, in fires smoke kills.

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

They lost the first meeting of the season to the 10-win Rams, 30-20 in Week 8.\n\nBoth teams should be able to put an ample amount of points on the board, so the top recommended bet is to take the Over at 47.5 (-118). Minnesota finished the regular season with the 28th-ranked pass defense in the NFL, and Los Angeles ranked 20th.\n\nExpect Kyren Williams to tote a heavy load on offense as the Rams look to control the clock as much as possible while trying to stave off the Minnesota blitz. The Minnesota pass defense will have its hands full trying to contain Puka Nacua. When the Vikings have the ball, though, they have the ability to strike quickly with Sam Darnold\u2019s top targets, Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison.\n\nBut Darnold does show a tendency to make an untimely error, and an interception could cost Minnesota the game. Also consider the Rams to cover the spread."

First, the company recommends creating nationwide \"rules of the road\" for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach. Image Credit: Reuters\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, unveiled a comprehensive \u201ceconomic blueprint\u201d outlining its vision for AI competition and regulation. This strategic plan is designed to guide tech policy in the US as a new administration takes power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s recommendations come at a time when Elon Musk, a vocal critic of the company, is expected to play a prominent role in Washington. The company is keen to solidify its position and ensure that the US stays ahead in the global race for AI development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFocus on US-made AI and equitable access\n\nAt the heart of OpenAI\u2019s recommendations is the desire to promote AI made in the US, ensuring that emerging technologies are not shaped by authoritarian governments like China. The company argues that AI should be developed in a way that benefits all regions of the country, not just the tech-heavy coastal cities.\n\nOpenAI stresses the need for equitable access to AI, aiming to ensure that its advantages are available to everyone from the very start. According to OpenAI\u2019s VP for global affairs, Chris Lehane, AI is now as essential as electricity, and there\u2019s an urgent need to \u201cget it right\u201d to prevent other nations from taking the lead.\n\nKey recommendations for a competitive AI ecosystem\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint outlines several key steps to position the US as a global AI leader. First, the company recommends creating nationwide \u201crules of the road\u201d for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach.\n\nIt also proposes easing restrictions on the export of advanced AI models to allies and partners, enabling them to build their own ecosystems based on US technology rather than relying on Chinese models. Additionally, OpenAI suggests the formation of a consortium of AI developers to identify best practices for working with national security issues and advancing AI responsibly.\n\nBuilding AI hubs across the US\n\nAnother important recommendation is to use states as \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d to create AI hubs that focus on regional needs. For example, Kansas could develop AI applications tailored to agriculture. This approach would spread AI job opportunities and expertise across the entire country, rather than concentrating them in just a few areas.\n\nOpenAI also calls for increased federal investment in infrastructure, including energy sources and power grids, to support new data centres and AI advancements. Other suggestions include requiring AI companies to provide substantial computational resources to public universities and ensuring that AI can learn from universal, publicly available information, while still protecting creators\u2019 intellectual property.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s strategic positioning amid competition\n\nWhile Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants face significant regulatory scrutiny, OpenAI remains a young company with a focused mission: to build advanced AI. As it prepares for the incoming administration, OpenAI is eager to make the case for how its vision could benefit communities across the US, from job creation to economic investment.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint seeks to reinforce the US\u2019s ability to \u201cthink big, act big, build big,\u201d ensuring that the country maintains an edge in the global AI race. Lehane highlighted that there is currently $175 billion in global investments for AI infrastructure, and the US needs to act quickly to attract that funding before it ends up supporting Chinese-led infrastructure instead.\n\nAdvertisement"

            "article_content": "The lack of interpretability in black-box AI models presents several risks, including:\n\n1. Bias and Discrimination: Black-box models often reflect the biases present in the data from which they learn. Because these models lack adequate transparency, biases can emerge, leading to over- or underrepresentation of certain groups in the population, ultimately favoring one group over another.\n\n2. Lack of Accountability: In high-stakes sectors such as criminal justice and healthcare, AI systems make critical decisions without being able to explain their reasoning. This lack of accountability can be problematic when a wrong decision results in negative consequences, as it becomes difficult to attribute responsibility.\n\n3. Trust Breakdown: As AI technology becomes more widespread, establishing trust is essential for its acceptance. If users do not understand or trust the decisions made by AI, it could lead to resistance against the technology, limiting its potential benefits.\n\n4. Regulatory Compliance: When governments implement regulations concerning AI transparency, organizations that utilize black-box models may face challenges in meeting legal standards, putting them at risk of fines or restrictions."

            "article_content": "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained\n\nThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running and most violent disputes in the world. Its origins go back more than a century.\n\nThere have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place.\n\nThe consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhat was Israel before 1948 and how was it created?\n\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups.\n\nTensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people.\n\nJews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected.\n\n[Getty Images]\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven.\n\nThe Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947.\n\nIn 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller.\n\nBritain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948.\n\nJewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year.\n\nWhat was the 1948 Arab-Israeli war?\n\nThe day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations.\n\nThe conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence.\n\nA Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli war of independence in 1948 [Getty Images]\n\nBy the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory.\n\nAgreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees.\n\nThe event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe).\n\nArab Legion soldiers fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948 [Getty Images]\n\nIn the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel.\n\nWhat was the 1967 Middle East war?\n\nWhat is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians.\n\nThe war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan.\n\nIt started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force.\n\nBy the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control.\n\nIsraeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967 [Getty Images]\n\nIsrael's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day.\n\nIsrael signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai.\n\nIt annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, making them part of Israel, although this has not been recognised by most of the international community.\n\nWhat is the status of the West Bank now?\n\nThe West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians.\n\nAlong with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what are widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe Palestinians have always opposed Israel's presence in these areas and want them to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community.\n\nIsrael still has overall control of the West Bank, but since the 1990s, a Palestinian government - known as the Palestinian Authority - has run most of its town and cities.\n\n[BBC]\n\nThere are about 150 Israeli settlements, housing about 700,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinians want all Israeli settlements to be removed and they are considered illegal under international law.\n\nHowever, Israel's government disputes this. It says the biggest settlements at the very least are permanent and that all settlements are rooted in its historical rights.\n\nIt does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state and argues that the West Bank is part of the Israeli homeland.\n\nThe Israeli government announced plans to expand settlements after coming to power in 2022. It says the creation of a Palestinian state would be a threat to Israeli security.\n\nIn July 2024, the top court of the UN, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal. It said that Israel should withdraw all settlers and that it was in breach of international agreements on racism and apartheid.\n\nWhat is the dispute over Jerusalem?\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital.\n\nIsrael, which already controlled West Jerusalem, occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later declared the entire city its permanent capital. It says Jerusalem cannot be divided.\n\nThe Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\n\nMost of the population of East Jerusalem is Palestinian, only a small minority of whom have chosen to become Israeli citizens.\n\n[AFP]\n\nHoly sites in Jerusalem are at the centre of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The most sacred site - known to Muslims as Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and to Jews as Temple Mount - lies in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe UN and most international opinion consider East Jerusalem to be Palestinian land occupied by Israel.\n\nWhat has happened in the Gaza Strip?\n\nThe Gaza Strip is a stretch of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.\n\nHome to about 2.3 million people, it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.\n\n[iStock]\n\nEven before the current war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Many people were living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive.\n\nGaza's boundaries were drawn up as a result of the 1948 Middle East war, when it was occupied by Egypt.\n\nEgypt was driven out of Gaza in the 1967 war and the Strip was occupied by Israel, which built settlements and placed Gaza's Palestinian population under military rule.\n\nIn 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods.\n\nThe UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.\n\nHamas won Palestinian elections in 2006, and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.\n\nIsrael and Egypt imposed a blockade in response, with Israel controlling most of what was allowed into the territory.\n\nIn the years that followed, Hamas and Israel fought several major conflicts - including those in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. The last major conflict between the two sides was in May 2021, which ended in a ceasefire after 11 days.\n\nEvery round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nOn 7 October 2023, Hamas fighters launched an assault from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people in Israel and taking more than 250 hostages.\n\n[Getty Images]\n\nThis triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza. More than 46,000 people have been killed, the majority of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nDays before Israel marked a year since the 7 October attacks, UN humanitarian agencies signed a declaration demanding an end to \"appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza\".\n\nWhich countries recognise a Palestinian state?\n\nIn May 2024, 143 out of 193 members of the United Nations' General Assembly voted in favour of a Palestinian bid for full UN membership, something that is only open to states.\n\nKnown as the State of Palestine at the UN, it has an official status of \"Permanent Observer State\", which gives it a seat but not a vote.\n\nSome European countries, along with the US, do not recognise a Palestinian state and say they will only do so as part of a long-term political solution to the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIn the UK, MPs voted in favour of recognition in 2014, but the government has not done so. In 2021, the then Conservative government said: \"The UK will recognise a Palestinian state at a time of our choosing, and when it best serves the objective of peace.\"\n\nIsrael says it has a historical right to the West Bank and opposes an independent Palestinian state, saying it would pose an unacceptable threat.\n\nWhat about Palestinian refugees?\n\nThere are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN as refugees.\n\nThey are descendants of the Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes on land which became Israel in the 1948-49 Middle East war.\n\nMost live in Jordan, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nPalestinians insist on the right of refugees to return but Israel has refused this. It criticises the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations.\n\nWhat is the two-state solution?\n\nThe \"two-state solution\" is an internationally backed formula for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIt proposes an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. It would exist alongside Israel.\n\nIsrael rejects a two-state solution. It says any final settlement must be the result of negotiations with the Palestinians, and statehood should not be a precondition.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority backs a two-state solution but Hamas does not because it is opposed to the existence of Israel.\n\nHamas says that it could accept an interim Palestinian state based on 1967 de facto borders, without officially recognising Israel, if refugees were given the right to return.\n\nEarlier efforts to settle the conflict saw Israel and Palestinian leaders sign a deal called the Oslo Peace Accords, in 1993. This was intended to provide a framework for peace talks. However, talks eventually collapsed with each side blaming the other."

Quantum Computing, meanwhile, saw its shares fall by around 23%, and IonQ (IONQ) shares were down by more than 12%.\n\nThe quantum computing stocks also tanked the previous week after Nvidia\u2019s Huang said useful quantum computers are decades away during the chipmaker\u2019s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\n\n\u201cIf you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIf you said 30, it\u2019s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.\u201d\n\nHuang said he thinks the artificial intelligence chipmaker will play \u201ca significant part\u201d in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting \u201cthere as fast as possible.\u201d\n\nD-Wave chief executive Alan Baratz said in a statement shared with Quartz that Huang \u201chas a misunderstanding of quantum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile he might be right about other quantum companies, he is dead wrong about D-Wave,\u201d Baratz said. \u201cThere is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. D-Wave took a different approach, which has allowed us to become commercial today and likely many years ahead of other quantum computing companies.\u201d\n\nIn December, Alphabet stock climbed more than 4% after it unveiled its latest quantum chip, Willow. Google Quantum AI (GOOGL) announced that its state-of-the-art quantum chip demonstrated \u201ctwo major achievements\u201d in quantum computing, including \u201cexponentially\u201d reducing the rate of errors when adding more qubits \u2014 a challenge that has existed for almost 30 years.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

            "article_content": "Putin is considering taking drastic measures to save the economy\n\nVladimir Putin is reportedly considering proposals to freeze Russian bank accounts and introduce food rationing in an attempt to prevent an economic collapse. Russians have been hit hard by rising interest rates and food inflation that has seen prices for staple items explode. Potato prices rose by almost 95% between November 2023 and 2024, while butter shot up by 36.5%. The steep increase in food has led to a spate of robberies from supermarkets and grocery stores around the country, most notably for butter.\n\nMeanwhile, interest rates stand at a record high of 21%, heaping huge pressure on companies over-leveraged on previously cheap bank loans.\n\nREAD MORE: Russia in flames as Ukraine launches devastating attacks on Putin\n\nRussia is facing a potential banking collapse\n\nThe worsening economic outlook has forced the Kremlin into considering drastic proposals to stem the crisis. Some of the measures up for consideration include preventing Russians withdrawing their deposits from banks and issuing food cards, according to the Telegram Channel General SVR. \"Many members of the Politburo agree that the freeze is necessary, but they are in no hurry to introduce this measure and are trying to postpone the adoption of the final decision as much as possible,\" the channel reported. \"On the other hand, they cannot miss the critical moment when this measure ceases to be effective and the crisis goes according to the worst scenario, the end of which will be the 'collapse of the financial system' of the country. \"We have already reported that the Russian leadership is going to block bank deposits, exchanging deposits for bank shares and prohibiting the sale of these shares for a year. \"Food cards are on the way and a decision on this issue will be made on the weekend.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson declined to identify the channel's sources, citing personal security, but said they had \"complete confidence\" in them. An analysis carried out by a former Morgan Stanley investment banker has highlighted that the Russian economy could face a corporate and banking collapse with its continued military spending. Putin approved a record-breaking defence budget, setting aside 32.5 percent of the government's total spending for 2025, worth US$126 billion. Craig Kennedy said Russia has followed a two-track strategy to fund its war via its defence budget expenditures as well as an off-budget plan of similar size enabled by a law enacted on February 25, 2022, which compels Russian banks to give preferential loans to military-related businesses.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "The Megiddo Mosaic is from the oldest known building constructed for Christian worship.\n\nCourtesy of the Museum of the Bible\n\nA church floor was discovered in Israel in 2004 in the ancient city of Megiddo. It was found a few miles down the road from Tel Megiddo, one of the most famous archaeological sites in the Holy Land, inside a prison.\n\n\u201cIt was in fact directly inside the walls,\u201d said Jeffrey Kloha, former head of curation at the Museum of the Bible.\n\nArchaeology is hard enough under normal conditions. Megiddo Prison, which holds more than 1,000 Palestinians believed to be security threats and has been a source of serious controversy in Israel, made things a lot more complicated.\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nBut in 2024, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) finally excavated the 580-square-foot mosaic, conserved it, and offered it to the Museum of the Bible for its first public appearance in a temporary display in Washington, DC.\n\nIAA experts cut the mosaic into ten pieces. They packed them up and shipped them to America, where the pieces were reassembled at the Bible museum.\n\nThe mosaic is being touted by the museum as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking archaeological discoveries since the Dead Sea Scrolls.\u201d\n\nChristopher Rollston, George Washington University professor of biblical and Near Eastern languages and civilizations, said the display is \u201cstunning.\u201d\n\nRollston is an expert in ancient inscriptions and internationally renowned as a skeptical voice, frequently raising questions and concerns about bold archeological claims. But he has no hesitation endorsing the significance of the Megiddo Mosaic.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective,\u201d Rollston said, \u201cthere\u2019s not a whole lot to quibble with here.\u201d\n\nIsraeli archaeologists say the church floor was built around AD 230. They were able to give a precise date based on coins found during excavation, as well as from the style of mosaic and the type of pottery uncovered at the site.\n\nThis is, to date, one of the oldest-known church buildings and the first to be constructed specifically for the purpose of worship. A century later, after the Roman emperor Constantine legalized Christianity, churches began to proliferate throughout the Mediterranean. Only three churches from before that time have been discovered by archaeologists: a house church in Capernaum, a house church in eastern Syria, and now this structure in Megiddo.\n\nThe mosaic floor appears to have been built for a Roman soldier named Gaianus. A perfectly preserved inscription reads, \u201cGaianus, also called Porphyrius, centurion, our brother, has made the mosaic at his own expense as an act of generosity. Brutius has carried out the work.\u201d\n\nGaianus was previously unknown to historians but now joins Cornelius (Acts 10) and the unnamed centurion of Capernaum (Matt. 8; Luke 7) as one of the first converts to the Christian faith in the Roman army.\n\nA second inscription in the mosaic is even more exciting to scholars of early Christianity. It reads, \u201cAkeptous, the friend of God, has offered the table to God Jesus Christ [for] remembrance.\u201d\n\nThis is the earliest archaeological mention of Jesus Christ and is evidence early Christians thought Jesus was not just a good teacher, but actually God. Some historians had previously argued that the first followers of Christ didn\u2019t believe in the Incarnation and only later came to see Jesus as divine. The inscription shows this early community affirmed Jesus was God.\n\nThe reference to the table also offers additional evidence of the early Christian practice of gathering around Communion.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the way we look at things,\u201d Rollston said, \u201cbut it certainly corroborates some of the things we know from other sources.\u201d\n\nNear the center of the mosaic is a large stone block. The archaeologist\u2019 report on the discovery does not say that it is a Communion table, but Rollston thinks it is probably the one mentioned in the inscription.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to believe it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.\n\nThe floor also has an octagonal medallion with a depiction of two fish. Fish were common Christian symbols. The Greek word for fish, ichthys, was used as an acronym for the phrase Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior, and served to remind Jesus\u2019 followers of his instructions to \u201cfish for people\u201d (Matt. 4:19).\n\nThe church floor has a third inscription that says, \u201cRemember Primilla and Cyriaca and Dorothea, and moreover also Chreste.\u201d No indication is given why they should be remembered. Perhaps these four\u2014all women\u2014were killed for their faith during a period of persecution. At the very least, the inscription testifies to the prominent role of women in the early church.\n\nThe whole mosaic is so well preserved that when people see it, many initially think it\u2019s a replica, said Robert Duke, the new chief curator at the Museum of the Bible.\n\n\u201cThey are stunned when they realize it\u2019s the actual mosaic floor from back in the third century,\u201d said Duke, who previously taught Old Testament at Azusa Pacific University. \u201cPeople were celebrating the Eucharist in this room.\u201d\n\nArchaeologists believe Christians worshiped in the church in Megiddo for about 70 years. Sometime around the year 300, the floor was covered in pottery shards, which helped protect it for the next 1,700 years.\n\nIt is not clear why the church stopped being used. The Roman army base at Megiddo was decommissioned at about that time, so maybe everyone just left. There was also a wave of Roman persecution, so perhaps the believers were no longer able to meet openly in a dedicated worship space.\n\nWhen Israel built a prison in the same spot in the 1970s, no one had any idea that it had once been a church with an amazing floor paid for by a Roman soldier who loved \u201cGod Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nThe Megiddo Mosaic will be on display at the Museum of the Bible through July. After that, the IAA may loan it to other institutions, allowing it to be seen by more people in other parts of the US. It will ultimately return to Israel. Officials are working to move the prison and establish a tourist site for the ancient church.\n\nGordon Govier writes about biblical archaeology for Christianity Today, hosts the archaeology radio program The Book and The Spade, and is the editor of Artifax."

However, this natural marvel owes its unique shape to erosion rather than human or alien intervention.\n\nA Natural Pyramid Among Antarctic Peaks\n\nThe unnamed mountain, standing about 4,150 feet tall, lies in the southern Ellsworth Mountains. Its striking pyramid-like form first gained attention in 2016 when images went viral online. Located near the Patriot Hills, where climate scientists often work, this mountain has likely been known to researchers for years, according to Mauri Pelto, an environmental science professor at Nichols College.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDiscovered during a 1935 flight by American aviator Lincoln Ellsworth, the Ellsworth Mountains are home to jagged peaks and ancient geological history.

Over millions of years, this process widened cracks and broke off large rock sections, sculpting the mountain into its current shape.\n\nWhile three sides eroded uniformly, the fourth side \u2014 the eastern ridge \u2014 developed separately. This process has also shaped other pyramidal peaks, like the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, said Pelto.\n\nRead Also: '1.27 million light-years long': Astronomers spot a new ultra-diffuse galaxy forming in Leo constellation; see image\n\nDebunking Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe mountain's striking appearance has fueled conspiracy theories about ancient civilizations or extraterrestrial influence.

Many items such as safety glass (1903) taken for granted in today\u2019s windscreens but one of earliest uses was in gasmasks, for troops in WWI. Vaseline (1870) an accidental find, when \u2018gunk on pipes\u2019 was used by troops as a staple; to sooth burns, wounds and trench foot.\n\nSimple items, such as matches (1826), are taken for granted. Superseded by lighters, they play a part in history. Even 25 years after the war, men lighting cigarettes would only light one, then another, before putting the match out and starting again. This habit was engrained because during the war a sniper could use a bullet to \u2018home in\u2019 and take out the third light.\n\nCoco-Cola (1826) yet another derivative from \u2018war\u2019 when its American inventor, following his experience in American Civil War, wanted to create an opiate free drink, to alleviate his addiction to morphine. Unfortunately, caffeine and stimulants still included, offended the Temperance Movement insisting it be alcohol free so, changes resulted in a sugar syrup concoction of carbonated water. Dynamite (1847) invented by a lab chemist, very wary of progressing development when conscious it was more powerful than gunpowder, yet more volatile. However not deterred, his colleague, saw the potential in mining, demolition and armament for war. Play-Doh\u2019s inventor nearly went bankrupt, when changes in society changed his customer base.\n\nPre 1942 homes heated with coal, left sooty deposits on walls and this was used as a cleaning product, until post war electric and gas meant soot was less of an issue. Bankruptcy was only avoided because the inventor\u2019s sister took it into a primary school, to use as modelling clay, initially called Rainbow Craft, before developing the product we know today.\n\nAccidents continue; Cornflakes as a healthy veg option, developed when boiled wheat left to go soggy was put in an oven to crisp up. The initial microwave (1967) was 5 ft tall, weighing 750lbs yet; few homes are now without one. Similarly, the most common used antibiotic in the world Penicillin, developed by accident after its inventor left a messy worktop, which became mouldy.\n\nAnother invention, much taken for granted; smoke detectors save millions of lives because, in fires smoke kills. Potato chips unbelievably resulted when a disgruntled customer complained about the thickness of his fries. The annoyed chef sliced potatoes using a mandolin to irritate him but unexpectedly another \u2018product\u2019 became an everyday one. Concluding, Viagra developed medically for Angina; like every other product highlighted, has other uses and made billions of dollars - by accident!\n\nAnne concluded with Chairman\u2019s Cheer and Thought for the Day; \u201cEvery day may not be good but there is something good in every day.\u201d\n\nRetired or Semi-Retired, professional or business ladies meet on the first Thursday each month at Chase Golf Club, 12 noon, to share meal, fellowship and speakers with outings and other activities. New members are welcome: Annual membership \u00a316 and two course lunch \u00a322. Further information contact: Membership Secretary, Barbara on 01889 882166 or Chairman Anne 01922 418037."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."
