(News18 Hindi)\n\nHumankind has long pondered the possibility of extra-terrestrial life. Although no concrete scientific proof of alien life has emerged yet, a Republican Congressman in the US has made a notable claim. During an interview on Wednesday, US Representative Tim Burchett claimed that extra-terrestrials inhabit the ocean\u2019s depths. He alleged that an admiral, who he chose not to name, informed him about an alien craft traveling at remarkable speeds underwater.\n\nCongressman Burchett from Tennessee has been pushing for greater openness concerning UFOs. He is convinced that the US government is withholding information pertaining to extra-terrestrials. Burchett made these statements on a show hosted by former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz.\n\nrelated stories\n\n\u201cThey tell me that something is moving at a speed of hundreds of kilometres per hour underwater. Its size was equal to a football field. This incident was documented. I have an Admiral who told me all this,\" he said.\n\n\u2018Nothing to Fear\u2019\n\nDuring the interview, Gaetz pointed out that most UFO sightings occur above water, asking Burchett if he believed there was any truth to these claims. Burchett responded that anything is possible considering the vastness of the universe. He also expressed confidence in the possibility of underwater bases. Burchett dismissed fears of alien threats, stating, \u201cI am not worried that they will harm us. Because with the capabilities they have, they would have destroyed us long ago.\"\n\nWhat Does the Pentagon Say About Aliens?\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nCurrently, no scientific evidence confirms the existence of extra-terrestrial life. However, the US Congress has seriously considered reports of these mysterious flying objects. Once a subject of ridicule, UFOs have become a serious topic. In March 2020, the US Department of Defence reported no evidence of UFOs, attributing unidentified objects in the sky to balloons, spy planes, and satellites.\n\nIn 2023, a former US Air Force intelligence officer claimed the government possesses alien bodies, a claim the Pentagon denied.\n\nLocation : United States of America (USA)\n\nFirst Published: January 27, 2025, 13:47 IST"

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019d no idea\u201d: The Pink Floyd song David Gilmour wasn\u2019t comfortable with\n\nWhen David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in late 1967, he had a mountain to climb. Not only was he drafted in to help his friends circumvent the astounding collapse in the mental health of their leader, Syd Barrett, but within just a few months, he\u2019d be required to replace his old friend. Gilmour had played in bands before, but supplanting such a revered titan of the psychedelic trend was a different matter entirely.\n\nAfter a period of cutting their teeth at London\u2019s UFO Club, which saw Barrett and the group hone their incongruous psychedelic style, they released their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, in August 1967. Blending Barrett\u2019s take on pop with an improvisational spirit, rock and pioneering use of studio effects, it was profoundly psychedelic but also something else. The record was as if Barrett had opened a tiny door in the back of his mind, allowing the listener to sample his surreal LSD-coated otherworld within. It was like a planet from the hit sci-fi series Star Trek with the surreal features of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland.\n\nDespite such an acclaimed and influential record, Barrett\u2019s mental health would sadly plummet not long after its release, and by April of the following year, the band had ejected him. They simply could not go on with a frontman who was so erratic and inconsistent. They were left to finish their highly-anticipated second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, without him.\n\nNaturally, A Saucerful of Secrets has always been regarded as an oddity in Pink Floyd\u2019s back catalogue, featuring a young group with a new lineup trying to find a way forward after Barrett\u2019s departure. This saw bassist Roger Waters step up as the band\u2019s leader, and each member shared songwriting duties to alleviate the burden.\n\nBecause of this transitional nature, A Saucerful of Secrets has also long been deemed one of the band\u2019s worst efforts. However, it does contain great moments that point to where they would head now that Waters was in control and Gilmour was impressing himself on proceedings.\n\nOne of these is \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019. Written by Waters, it tapped into the oddity of Barrett\u2019s work with Gilmour\u2019s noir-esque guitar line at the start, the over-pronounced English accent, and strange backing vocals. It\u2019s also significant as it saw Gilmour sing the majority of the lead vocals, and the serene moments of release, \u201cMrs Clegg, you must be proud of him\u2026\u201d, sonically evoke the later grandeur of their work on the likes of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nDespite \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019 being a crucial moment for Gilmour and Pink Floyd, speaking to Guitar Heroes in 1983, he explained how uncomfortable the song made him feel at the time. Responding to the suggestion that he was trying to sound like Jimi Hendrix on it, he soberingly conceded that he had no clue what he was doing at the time. He was still forming his now-iconic approach to the six-string\n\nRecalling how uncomfortable working on the song was, he said: \u201cNo, not really. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was trying to play at the time to be quite honest. I\u2019d really no idea. What I was used to playing, the style I had, didn\u2019t fit Pink Floyd at the time, and I didn\u2019t really know quite what to do. Gradually, over the years, my style changed to fit Pink Floyd, and Pink Floyd changed to fit my style.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to characterise his style back then, the frank Gilmour replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think I had one really.\u201d"

The Biden administration has since 2021 widened the scope of bans designed to stop these chips from being exported to China and used to train Chinese firms' AI models.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 used Nvidia's H800 chips for training, spending less than $6 million.\n\nAlthough this detail has since been disputed, the claim that the chips used were less powerful than the most advanced Nvidia products Washington has sought to keep out of China, as well as the relatively cheap training costs, has prompted U.S. tech executives to question the effectiveness of tech export controls.\n\nLittle is known about the company behind DeepSeek, a small Hangzhou-based startup founded in 2023, when search engine giant Baidu released the first Chinese AI large-language model.\n\nSince then, dozens of Chinese tech companies large and small have released their own AI models, but DeepSeek is the first to be praised by the U.S. tech industry as matching or even surpassing the performance of cutting-edge U.S. models.\n\n(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista.

This remarkable achievement has raised eyebrows and stirred up discussions on the effectiveness of US export controls aimed at curbing China\u2019s access to advanced chip technology.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nDeepSeek, a startup based in Hangzhou, China, has garnered significant attention with its AI Assistant powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model. The app, which was released on January 10, has quickly climbed the ranks, outperforming many other open-source models and challenging some of the most advanced closed-source models globally. According to data from app research firm Sensor Tower, DeepSeek\u2019s app has seen rapid traction, topping the US app charts by January 27.\n\nThe AI model, DeepSeek-V3, was reportedly trained using Nvidia\u2019s H800 chips, a type of semiconductor that is less advanced than those targeted by US export restrictions imposed during the Biden administration, which began in 2021. Despite these controls, DeepSeek\u2019s success suggests that China\u2019s AI advancements might be less constrained than previously believed. The model was developed at a reported cost of under $6 million, raising doubts within the US tech community about the efficacy of the export bans in limiting China\u2019s AI progress.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nFounded in 2023, DeepSeek is one of many Chinese tech firms developing AI models, but it has gained unprecedented recognition in the US for its ability to match, or even surpass, the performance of leading US AI models. This rapid success has positioned DeepSeek as a key player in the artificial intelligence landscape, making it a symbol of China\u2019s growing capabilities in the AI field.\n\nDespite its impressive rise, DeepSeek remains an enigmatic company, with limited information available about its operations. However, its recent success has drawn significant attention to the company\u2019s potential and to China\u2019s emerging role as a major AI powerhouse, challenging the traditional dominance of US tech giants like Nvidia, OpenAI, and Google.\n\nThe rapid ascent of DeepSeek in the AI market raises important questions about the future of US-China technological competition and the limitations of US export controls. As DeepSeek continues to develop its AI models and expand its reach, the global AI race is sure to become even more complex and competitive.\n\nALSO READ: DeepSeek AI Disrupts US Tech Stocks, Nvidia Faces $432 Billion Market Cap Loss"

Daksh Malik, a Class 9 student at Shiv Nadar School, has discovered an asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Soon, he will have the rare honour of naming it.\n\nRecognition from NASA\n\nThe asteroid, provisionally named '2023 OG40,' was identified through the International Asteroid Discovery Project (IADP). Organised by STEM and Space and the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC), the project enables students globally to help NASA identify new celestial objects. Malik and his teammates spent 18 months meticulously analysing datasets and tracking celestial objects using specialised software.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAccording to The Print, Malik is the sixth Indian student to discover a named asteroid. While the discovery awaits NASA's official verification\u2014a process expected to take four to five years\u2014Daksh is already brainstorming names, jokingly suggesting \u2018Destroyer of the World\u2019 or the ominous \u2018Countdown.\u2019\n\nA journey of curiosity\n\nMalik\u2019s fascination with space began in childhood, nurtured by documentaries on planets and the solar system. His school\u2019s astronomy club introduced him to the IASC programme in 2022. Participants were tasked with identifying potential asteroids by observing movements and light emissions in celestial objects.\n\n\u201cIt felt like working at NASA,\u201d Malik shared. \u201cThe experience was thrilling, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nDespite achieving this significant milestone, Malik\u2019s passions extend beyond astronomy. He is equally interested in law and plans to pursue a career in the judiciary.\n\nSupport and inspiration\n\nMalik\u2019s mother, Sappna Kapur, said he values the process more than results. \u201cHis dedication to astronomy reflects his curiosity and determination,\u201d she said, recalling the hours he spent observing the night sky through the school\u2019s telescope.\n\nHis mentor, Vinita Sharat, head of STEM at Shiv Nadar School, emphasised the importance of practical learning. \u201cTrue education lies in applying lessons beyond the classroom,\u201d she said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nMalik\u2019s discovery not only highlights his potential but also inspires others to explore science with curiosity and passion."

However, a recent discovery has cast doubt on the origin of one of them. More specifically, we are referring to the ancient Chinese fortification. For a long time, it was thought that the Great Wall was the only human construction visible from space. A theory that has been debunked on more than one occasion\n\nLionel Messi forced to apologize on Chinese social media for Inter Miami PR disaster\n\nWhat we know about the Great Wall is that it was built and rebuilt between the 5th century BC and the 16th century and served to protect against attacks by the Xiongnu nomads from Mongolia and Manchuria. It is impressive: it measures more than 21,000 kilometers, although only 30% of the original fortification remains. In 1987, it was declared a World Heritage Site\n\nDoubts about the true origin of the Great Wall of China\n\nScience and its different branches, with their discoveries, help to understand and try to explain many things that have to do with human beings. Some of its findings also cast doubt on and question theories that have been disseminated and transmitted for many years\n\nAmong them, there is a recent archaeological discovery that has cast doubt on the way the Great Wall was built and the real reason why it was erected. Apparently,the main objective was to protect the Chinese Empire. However, according to an article published in the Cambridge University journal, this was not the case\n\nAs the report states, \"China's long walls and the Eurasian steppe have functioned as defensive structures against aggressive nomadic tribes, or as elements to control the movement of local nomadic groups after imperialist expansion. (...) The wall has numerous ancillary structures that hint at its function.\"\n\nAccording to the article, in addition to its defensive use, the Great Wall also served other possible functions, including helping some shepherds and farmers who occupied these areas in their tasks. In other words, it was a support for livestock farming and the primary sector."

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nPayment trends in Asia are changing how businesses and people transact \u2014 from the digital-first economies of China and Singapore to the quickly changing markets of Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nThis shift is not merely a matter of convenience; it is emblematic of an increasingly complex convergence between state-of-the-art technology, consumer desires for seamlessness, and the region\u2019s particular socio-economic landscape.\n\nEmerging trends such as cross-border payment systems and open banking initiatives are breaking down traditional barriers, fostering greater connectivity and efficiency in Asia\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHowever, the rapid progress comes with challenges. The shift toward digitised payments brings heightened concerns about cybersecurity, fraud, and regulatory compliance. As Asian markets surge, they face the dual challenge of safeguarding digital infrastructure while ensuring financial inclusion and bridging technological gaps between advanced and developing economies.\n\nThis article explores five key trends changing how we pay today while pushing the narrative for a more efficient, powerful financial ecosystem in Asia.\n\n1. China Leads Again in Digital Payment Adoption\n\nDigital payment adoption is soaring across Asia, with CNBC highlighting the region\u2019s leadership in this segment, driven largely by Southeast Asians emerging as the most avid users of digital wallets.\n\nAs of June 2024, China maintains its leadership in digital wallet adoption, with over 88% of mobile internet users\u2014 approximately 969 million individuals \u2014 engaging in mobile payments. Back in 2023, digital wallets accounted for 82% of China\u2019s e-commerce spending and 66% of physical purchases, totalling around US$7.6 trillion in transactions, CNBC reports.\n\nAlipay and WeChat Pay dominate China\u2019s digital payment landscape, making it the largest and most influential wallet market globally, according to Worldpay\u2019s The Global payments Report 2024.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, digital payment transactions are projected to exceed US$1 trillion by 2025. According to a study by Bain & Company, Google, and Temasek, 53% of industry experts believe that consumer tech platforms, rather than pure-play fintechs, are more likely to drive disruption in financial services.\n\nIn 2023, credit card payments comprised 52.2% of all cashless transactions in Japan. However, the country has shown that its consumers\u2019 reliance on credit cards and electronic money has gradually decreased, while QR code and barcode payments have experienced remarkable growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic Times reported that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) facilitated over 15,547 crore transactions worth INR 223 lakh crore (US$258.59 billion) in India from January to November 2024. In 2025, UPI is expected to become an omnipresent network, transforming connected devices into potential payment endpoints through messaging platforms like WhatsApp.\n\n2. Real-Time Payments Bridging Asia Pacific Borders\n\nReal-time and cross-border payments are becoming a reality, thanks to regional collaborations and technological advancements. Project Nexus of Singapore, for example, aims to connect real-time payment systems across the region, further facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. This initiative demonstrates the growing focus on regional collaboration in the payments sector.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate efforts, such as Visa\u2019s initiatives to enable QR code payments across borders, are further driving the adoption of real-time cross-border payments.\n\nReal-time payments are surging across Asia-Pacific, are expected to grow from 49.2 billion in 2022 to 96.2 billion by 2027. Singapore\u2019s PayNow and Thailand\u2019s PromptPay have established a successful cross-border linkage, while Malaysia\u2019s DuitNow and Indonesia\u2019s QRIS integration has been operational for a few years already.\n\nThis trend is driven by a combination of regional cooperation, corporate innovation, and technological advancements, setting the stage for a more interconnected and efficient financial ecosystem in the region.\n\n3. Embedded Finance Hailed as the Future of Fintech\n\nThe embedded payments market is expected to reach a global transaction value of US$2.5 trillion by 2028, according to a LexisNexis study. In Asia, the adoption of embedded finance is creating opportunities across diverse sectors.\n\nChina, a global leader in digital wallet adoption, has its embedded finance market seamlessly integrating payments into consumer apps at scale thanks to its extensive digital wallet adoption. Platforms like WeChat and Alipay allow their users to conduct transactions for everyday purchases, transportation, and even healthcare services effortlessly.\n\nIndia\u2019s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is another backbone of embedded payments. The transformative impact of UPI underscores the potential of integrated financial systems.\n\nWith nearly 300 million individuals and 50 million merchants in India relying on UPI for transactions, it has become the country\u2019s most widely used payment method, the World Economic Forum reports. Its influence is now reaching beyond India\u2019s borders, with countries like Singapore and the UAE adopting the system, marking its growing global presence.\n\nIn Japan, while cash is still widely used, embedded finance is starting to gain momentum and expected to hit US$ 36.29 billion by 2029, according to Business Wire. Rakuten has also introduced its own cryptocurrency wallets and exchange systems there, bringing embedded finance to new levels by allowing Rakuten Cash balance recharges via Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe global embedded finance market is projected to reach US$384.8 billion by 2029, while traditional banks stand to gain $92 billion in additional revenue from SMEs through embedded finance by 2025, LexisNexis also reports.\n\nKey benefits of embedded finance include faster payment processing, improved operational efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction, making it an attractive proposition for financial and non-financial businesses alike.\n\nAs Asia continues to lead global payment trends, embedded finance is unlocking new possibilities for innovation, inclusivity, and growth, positioning the region as a pioneer in shaping the future of financial services.\n\n4. Open Banking APIs Are Shaping the Future of Payments\n\nOpen banking is on the brink of rapid expansion in Southeast Asia, though progress varies across countries. This trend is fostering innovation and competition in the financial services sector.\n\nIn Singapore, the government-backed API Exchange is promoting API standardisation. Indonesia\u2019s Standard National Open API (SNAP) , on the other end, was launched to support the country\u2019s Indonesian Payment System Blueprint (BSPI) 2025 initiative, with the purpose to drive efficiency for bank digital payments.\n\nIn Hong Kong, HSBC introduced its first open banking feature on the local HSBC HK app, enabling its clientele to view account balances from Bank of China Hong Kong and Hang Seng Bank in real time. This was enabled via the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\u2019s Interbank Account Data Sharing (IADS) initiative.\n\nOpen banking APIs has the potential bolster B2B payments in the region. According to PYMNTS, APIs could potentially solving the complexity around account payable, account receivables, approval workflows and more, enabling more efficient and secure transactions between businesses, which is typically just one part of the entire process.\n\nIn the context of B2B payments, APIs allow financial institutions, payment processors, and business software platforms to seamlessly integrate payment capabilities into their existing systems. By simplifying the integration process, it lowers the barriers for businesses to adopt digital B2B payment solutions, enabling smoother transitions and greater accessibility.\n\nThis development could likely to have a significant impact on the overall payments ecosystem in Asia.\n\n5.The Need for Robust Cybersecurity Measures to Combat Financial Crime\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s digital economy is on track to exceed USD 300 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2025, presenting significant financial crime challenges, reports PwC. Non-bank financial service entrants, new to the system, often lack the robust cybersecurity infrastructure necessary to combat sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nThis deficiency is exacerbated by the growing consumer demand for faster payments with minimal checks, increasing vulnerability to financial crimes. The adoption of preventive technologies like biometrics and in-session analytical solutions is essential for comprehensive protection.\n\nMastercard has made efforts underway to phase out passwords with tokenization and biometrics by 2030 while in terms of Asian countries adopting the digital identity, Singapore is a pioneer with Singpass, a Smart Nation initiative.\n\nUsing biometrics, Singpass enables secure and convenient access to 800+ government agencies and businesses and over 2,700 services. Meanwhile, Malaysia is making steady strides with its MyDigital ID initiative, paving the way for advanced digital identity solutions, including eKYC verification in the near future.\n\nNotably, while Singapore and Malaysia rank high globally for cybersecurity based on the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2020, other Southeast Asian nations like Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia are ranked 99th, 131st, and 132nd out of 182 countries, respectively, PwC reports also.\n\nThis disparity suggests a pressing need to enhance cybersecurity across the region. Implementing digital IDs and related authentication mechanisms can play a pivotal role in counteracting criminal activities.\n\nA unified approach against financial crime is essential, and reliance on cross-border digital IDs may be key to eradicating synthetic ID fraud. Increased sharing of tactical information through intergovernmental or public-private partnerships could enable greater financial transparency and build stronger defences against financial crime.\n\nAsia\u2019s Digital Financial Frontier \u2013 Opportunities and Challenges Ahead\n\nAs we look towards 2025 and beyond, it\u2019s clear that Asia\u2019s payment landscape is at the forefront of global financial innovation. The region\u2019s embrace of digital wallets, real-time payments, BNPL services, cryptocurrencies, open banking, and advanced cybersecurity measures is creating a dynamic and interconnected financial ecosystem.\n\nThis transformation is not just about convenience; it\u2019s about financial inclusion, economic growth, and technological leadership.However, with great innovation comes great responsibility. As these trends accelerate, regulators, businesses, and consumers must work together to ensure that this digital financial revolution remains secure, inclusive, and sustainable.\n\nThe challenges of cybersecurity and regulatory compliance loom large, but so do the opportunities for unprecedented financial access and economic empowerment. Asia\u2019s payment trends for 2025 paint a picture of a region that is not just adapting to the future of finance, but actively shaping it.\n\nFrom China\u2019s dominance in digital payments to the rise of cryptocurrency in Vietnam and Indonesia, from the cross-border innovations in Singapore and Thailand to the BNPL boom across Southeast Asia, the region is setting the pace for global fintech innovation.\n\nAs we navigate this rapidly evolving landscape, one thing is certain: the way we think about and use money is changing forever, and Asia is leading the charge. The future of payments is not just digital \u2013 it\u2019s dynamic, diverse, and decidedly Asian.\n\nSource of image: edited from Freepik"

            "article_content": "Agentic artificial intelligence is set to transform business this year, replacing workers as the technology can think and make decisions, offering companies the chance to cut costs\n\nListen to this article\n\nAccording to Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025.\n\nLeading businesses in Thailand have begun to embrace agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to pilot selective tasks, in a bid to explore its benefits.\n\nThe term refers to an AI system with enhanced autonomy, decision-making capabilities and adaptability. Agentic AI systems autonomously plan and take actions to meet user-defined goals, offering the promise of a virtual workforce that can offload and augment human work.\n\nAccording to global research and consultancy Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025 that is poised to drive innovation, offering significant business benefits by providing a virtual workforce of AI agents.\n\nHowever, the implementation of agentic AI also presents challenges, particularly in ensuring that these autonomous systems are aligned with the intentions of both the providers and users.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish robust safeguards and guardrails that guarantee AI's actions remain consistent with the desired outcomes, said Gartner.\n\nThe company predicts by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, enabling 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made autonomously.\n\nFirst in the region\n\n\"In 2025, agentic AI will be a key trend, combining AI and automation,\" said Anothai Wettayakorn, managing director of IBM Thailand.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI marks a significant shift in the future of work, with AI agents autonomously executing tasks, collaborating with human workers, and driving value across businesses, he said.\n\nIn Thailand, IBM successfully completed a pilot initiative using generative AI (GenAI) to automate laboratory orders, enhancing patient diagnosis and improving confidence, quality and speed in treatment.\n\nThis collaboration took place with Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, an affiliate of Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Medicine.\n\nThis was the first agentic AI use in Southeast Asia for healthcare, said Mr Anothai.\n\nAfter an eight-month pilot and an investment of 10 million baht, IBM's agentic AI technology leverages existing automation in the hospital's laboratory and hospital data system to speed up patient services.\n\nThe initiative minimises repetitive tasks for doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij Lojanapiwat, faculty dean at the university.\n\nIBM's client engineering team worked alongside the faculty to build a model using IBM AI platforms to analyse and interpret doctors' notes, recommend treatment pathways, and automatically handle laboratory orders.\n\nAI can suggest pathology laboratory tests based on a patient's medical record and trends, and doctors can then verify the suggestions.\n\nOnce approved by doctors, the AI automates the lab orders and schedules the patient's follow-up appointments, alleviating the workload for both doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij.\n\nThe collaboration complemented the hospital's recent implementation of a fully automated medical laboratory system.\n\nBuilt on transparent, reliable data and global AI governance standards, this initiative was meant to improve service efficiency and support medical decision-making with accurate and comprehensive insights, enhancing treatment quality and speed, according to IBM.\n\nThe project eases high-volume workloads, reducing the time spent in the lab order process and on scheduling patient appointments. As a result, it cuts the time spent by patients in medical check-ups at the hospital by 30-40 minutes, down from the current 150 minutes, he said.\n\nThe hospital has around 1.6 million patients a year. For the project, physicians also help to train the AI system.\n\n\"This milestone highlights our vision to lead in service excellence, treatment and research -- not just in Chiang Mai or Thailand, but across Southeast Asia,\" said Dr Bannakij.\n\nDr Krit Khwanngern, deputy dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, said the system does not store patients' real names, instead anonymising them to protect sensitive data and comply with the Personal Data Protection Act.\n\nIn the future, the hospital will analyse patient medical check-up data and use it to offer preventive healthcare services on a more personalised basis, said Dr Krit.\n\n\"Agentic AI is leveraged with the digital improvements we've invested in over the past few years by integrating different systems from physicians, nurses, pharmacies, and electronic medical records for both inpatient and outpatient care. This provides a strong data infrastructure on the back end, which leads to improved services on the front end,\" he said.\n\n\"We also invested 300 million baht in cybersecurity to ensure strong capabilities to secure sensitive data.\"\n\nThe project was successful because of the ability of the hospital's in-house teams to work together with external tech experts, while its physicians have technical knowledge that can design systems to serve users' needs, said Dr Krit.\n\nThe hospital continues to adopt advanced technologies, he said.\n\nThe faculty piloted IBM's AutoAI to support the development of patient service apps, enabling data scientists to write code more efficiently and reduce development time for future apps that will enhance patient treatment and services, said Dr Krit.\n\nMany executives note that humans will still be required to operate AI in a responsible manner.\n\nAgentic AI in banking\n\n\"2025 will be the year of agentic AI and we've been working on responsible agentic AI since the beginning of this year,\" said Ruangroj Poonpol, chairman of Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG), the technology arm of Kasikornbank.\n\nAgentic AI will be an essential tool for KBTG to accelerate its organisational transformation, he said. An AI agent can perceive, make decisions, take action and achieve goals in its own environment.\n\n\"It's a digital workforce without the need of a vacation, providing even more productivity uplift than before. We need to upskill, reskill, and learn how to use it and when to use it,\" said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nIn 2025, KBTG will focus on fostering collaboration between humans and AI, while ensuring a human-centric approach, he said. With human-AI convergence for value creation, KBTG's performance will be faster and more productive than ever, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nHe said this focus will be driven by a few elements, including the use of new platforms to efficiently manage AI agents, enabling seamless collaboration with human workers.\n\nOne of the platforms is AthenaMind, an internal tool designed as an AI agent creation hub, or \"AI agent factory\", for building AI agents for various applications.\n\nAnother element is an agentic orchestration, involving the design of new operational workflows to enable AI agents and humans to work together more effectively and drive business outcomes.\n\nFor example, KBTG introduced an AI coding assistant to improve software development, reducing software developers' working hours by 20%. So far, more than 500,000 lines of code have been generated using AI.\n\nThe next step is to evolve this AI assistant into a fully functional AI coding agent, capable of independently writing code from start to finish based on clear requirements, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nKBTG equips its employees with the right mindset, skills, and an open work culture to integrate AI into their daily tasks, he said. The company achieved 100% AI literacy, ensuring all employees are knowledgeable and prepared to work alongside AI technology in their roles.\n\nKBTG wants this human-AI convergence project to generate more than 10 billion baht in business impact by 2029, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nRetail uses\n\nAxel Winter, chief executive of Xponential, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform and innovation consultancy, said the opportunities for AI agents are vast in the retail sector.\n\n\"For example, agents could dynamically create promotions based on real-time data such as customer sentiment, inventory levels and sales trends,\" he said.\n\nThey can also generate and deploy marketing campaigns across various channels, which are particularly relevant in the fast-paced Southeast Asian e-commerce landscape.\n\n\"It's important to recognise not all AI technologies being promoted are fully mature, and the field is in constant flux. It is vital to remain flexible, keep a close eye on both established vendors and the open-source community, and be prepared to adapt and innovate rapidly,\" said Mr Winter.\n\nWidespread in 2026\n\nPhiphat Prapapanpong, director of advanced insights at Bluebik Group, a SET-listed tech consulting firm, said the adoption of AI-driven agentic workflows, which leverage GenAI capabilities with business processes, will emerge as a key trend in AI development.\n\n\"This year marks the beginning of the agentic AI era, with large enterprises -- particularly banks, insurance companies and retailers -- starting to pilot its use internally,\" he said.\n\nBy next year, Mr Phiphat said he expects agentic AI to become more widespread and transition into full deployment.\n\nHe said organisations piloting agentic AI aim to enhance employee productivity without additional hiring. For example, procurement processes can use agentic AI to seek better prices and sourcing.\n\nJob losses and opportunities\n\nPanutat Tejasen, a pioneer in AI development, said the adoption of agentic AI is accelerating because it can integrate with business workflows, delivering tangible results for return on investment.\n\nHe said many jobs will be replaced as agentic AI takes over tasks. For example, roles in customer service, procurement and data entry are likely to be automated.\n\n\"You will see machine agents communicating with other machines. A procurement agent, for example, will negotiate with a sales agent, with less human involvement,\" said Mr Panutat.\n\nHe said agentic AI will also open up new opportunities in software development.\n\nThanachart Numnonda, executive director of IMC Institute, a tech research and training firm, said agentic AI is still being used for specific and small-scale tasks.\n\n\"This opens up new opportunities for developers to build agentic AI services tailored for businesses,\" he said.\n\nMr Thanachart said he does not think agentic AI will make the SaaS business obsolete, as it still requires software as its foundation.\n\n\"Humans are still in the loop and work alongside AI,\" he said."

            "article_content": "You may not know it, but right now there\u2019s a huge cosmic rave party happening far, far above our heads. The chief partygoers are known as supermassive black holes. These mysterious objects can have masses several million or billion times that of the sun and are so dense that they warp spacetime around them.\n\nAs far as astronomers know, all galaxies harbour a supermassive black hole at their very centres. In some galaxies, large amounts of interstellar gas are spiralling around the supermassive black hole and getting pulled in beyond the event horizon and essentially onto the black hole. This process creates a huge amount of friction and energy, which can cause the \u201crave\u201d I\u2019m talking about \u2013 releasing huge amounts of light at many different colours and frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nIn some cases, the black hole will even spew jets of plasma, millions of light years across intergalactic space. The plasma gas is so hot that it\u2019s essentially a soup of electrons moving close to the speed of light. These plasma jets glow at radio frequencies, so they can be seen with a radio telescope and are, aptly, named radio galaxies. In a recent episode of the astronomy podcast The Cosmic Savannah, I likened their appearance to two glow sticks (the plasma jets) poking out of a ball of sticky tack (the galaxy). Astronomers hypothesise that the plasma jets keep expanding outwards as time passes, eventually growing so large that they become giant radio galaxies.\n\nBy 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered\n\nMillions of normally sized radio galaxies are known to science. But by 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered. They were considered rare. However, a new generation of radio telescopes, including South Africa\u2019s MeerKAT, have turned this idea on its head: in the past five years about 11 000 giants have been discovered.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s newest giant radio galaxy find is extraordinary. The plasma jets of this cosmic giant span 3.3 million light years from end to end \u2013 over 32 times the size of the Milky Way. I\u2019m one of the lead researchers who made the discovery. We\u2019ve nicknamed it Inkathazo, meaning \u201ctrouble\u201d in isiXhosa and isiZulu. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been a bit troublesome to understand the physics behind what\u2019s going on with Inkathazo.\n\nThis discovery has given us a unique opportunity to study giant radio galaxies. The findings challenge existing models and suggest that we don\u2019t yet understand much of the complicated plasma physics at play in these extreme galaxies.\n\nHere comes \u2018trouble\u2019\n\nThe MeerKAT telescope is in the Karoo, is made up of 64 radio dishes, and is operated and managed by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. It\u2019s a precursor to the Square Kilometre Array, which will, when it commences science operations around 2028, be the world\u2019s largest telescope.\n\nMeerKAT has already been pivotal in uncovering some of the hidden treasures of the southern sky since it was first commissioned in 2018.\n\nThis is the third giant radio galaxy that my collaborators and I have discovered with MeerKAT in a relatively small patch of sky near the equator, around the size of five full moons, that astronomers refer to as the \u201cCosmos field\u201d. We pointed MeerKAT at Cosmos during the early stages of the most advanced surveys of distant galaxies ever conducted: the International Gigahertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (Mightee).\n\nThe Mightee team, a collaboration of astronomers from around the world, and I first published the discovery of the two other giant radio galaxies in Cosmos in 2021.\n\nWe spotted Inkathazo more recently in my own MeerKAT follow-up observations of Cosmos, as well as in the full Mightee survey.\n\nHowever, Inkathazo differs from its cosmic companions in several ways. It doesn\u2019t have the same characteristics as many other giant radio galaxies. For example, the plasma jets have an unusual shape. Rather than extending straight across from end-to-end, one of the jets is bent.\n\nAdditionally, Inkathazo lives at the very centre of a cluster of galaxies, rather than in relative isolation, which should make it difficult for the plasma jets to grow to such enormous sizes. Its location in a cluster raises questions about the role of environmental interactions in the formation and evolution of these giant galaxies.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s exceptional capabilities are helping us to unravel this cosmic conundrum. We\u2019ve created some of the highest-resolution spectral maps ever made for giant radio galaxies. These maps track the age of the plasma across different parts of the galaxy, providing clues about the physical processes at work.\n\nThe results revealed intriguing complexities in Inkathazo\u2019s jets. Some electrons within the plasma jets receive unexpected boosts of energy. We think this may occur when the jets collide with hot gas in the voids between galaxies in a cluster. This gives us hints about what sort of plasma physics might be happening in these extreme parts of the universe that we didn\u2019t previously predict.\n\nA treasure trove\n\nThe fact that we unveiled three giant radio galaxies by pointing MeerKAT at a single patch of sky suggests that there\u2019s likely a huge treasure trove of these cosmic behemoths just waiting to be discovered in the southern sky. The telescope is incredibly powerful and it\u2019s in a perfect location for this kind of research, so it\u2019s ideally poised to uncover and learn more about giant radio galaxies in the years to come.\n\nKathleen Charlton, a master\u2019s student at the University of Cape Town, was the lead author of the research on which this article was based\n\nThe author, Jacinta Delhaize, is a lecturer at the University of Cape Town\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence.

            "article_content": "What does an ideal computer science building at Stanford look like? For Benji Welner \u201927, it looks a lot like the newest addition to Stanford\u2019s campus \u2014 the almost finished Computing and Data Science complex, known as CoDa.\n\nThe building\u2019s designers \u201care doing all sorts of weird things, and they really all work,\u201d said Welner, one of several students to already take advantage of the building\u2019s study space.\n\nBuilt with the goal of catalyzing interdisciplinary work between the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities and Sciences, CoDa has been five years in the making. Architects began working on the project in 2019 and construction took place from 2022 to 2024. CoDa will now house the popular computer science (CS) major, both data science majors \u2014 the B.S. and the B.A. \u2014 and the symbolic systems major, along with research labs and space for collaborative work. Faculty began moving into the building just last week on Jan. 21, and the building is now open to Stanford affiliates.\n\nChris Mentzel M.S. \u201915, the executive director of Stanford Data Science, is hopeful that the design of the building will help foster interdepartmental collaboration. \u201cThe design of the building has people from different departments on every floor. It has a lot of meeting areas and it has a lot of open public spaces,\u201d said Mentzel.\n\nStanford Data Science, not to be confused with the data science program that grants undergraduate degrees, is a research unit under the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. Their mission, according to their website, involves connecting data science discoveries with other labs and institutions on campus to \u201cenable data-driven discovery at scale.\u201d\n\nStanford Data Science previously borrowed space in Wallenberg Hall. It is now one of many programs that will now be housed in the CoDa. Excited to have a home base, Mentzel and the rest of Stanford Data Science have already moved into their offices on the other side of Jane Stanford Way.\n\nMentzel is particularly excited about the central set of red staircases, which resemble a double helix.\n\n\u201cThat stairwell actually is connected to the kitchens and open public seating for everyone on the Stanford campus to come and enjoy on all four floors \u2014 so there\u2019s kind of natural places for people to be and connect, even for people who aren\u2019t occupants of the building,\u201d he said.\n\nThe design process for the CoDa complex was thorough and collaborative, according to Kevin Manalili, Director of Facilities and Planning for the School of Engineering.\n\n\u201cWe involved focus groups of faculty, staff and students to help define the desired look and feel, with a mix of offices, meeting rooms, community spaces and large classrooms,\u201d Manalili said.\n\nManalili acknowledged that the project had its challenges, including being \u201cinterrupted by the pandemic, last-minute vendor changes and supply-chain shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt required lots of time and effort, but we worked extremely well together,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to its interdisciplinary focus, the CoDa complex balances a focus on research with a focus on students. Manalili noted that the garden level on the ground floor will be mostly undergraduate focused, with classrooms, group rooms for TA office hours and flexible indoor and outdoor work spaces. The upper floors will serve as workspaces for the research initiatives housed in the building. Bridging the two, the first floor will house administrative services for many undergraduate majors and a new coffee shop, Voyager Craft Coffee. For Manalili, \u201cCoDa provides much needed collaboration spaces and room for department growth.\u201d\n\nVoyager Craft Coffee is new to Stanford\u2019s campus, although they already have a location at neighboring Santa Clara University. Menu items include traditional drinks and pastries, as well as signature dishes such as avocado hummus toast and a \u201cpull-apart-uffin\u201d monkey bread muffin.\n\nMentzel hopes the coffee shop will be a draw for students and faculty alike.\n\n\u201cYou need good coffee if you\u2019re going to have community, just the fuel that keeps people talking and connected,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to a new coffee spot, students can look forward to comfortable chairs, monitor and video conference capability, natural lighting and a modern feel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an architect or an architecture major,\u201d Welner said, \u201cbut there\u2019s art that is part of the building in a very natural way and that makes each piece playful and entertaining in its own right.\u201d\n\nThough the building is still undergoing final touches, and Voyager coffee will not move in until February, students have already begun taking advantage of the space. Sparsely populated for the time being, students believe the CoDa complex is poised to become a favored study hub.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tons of rooms and I\u2019m really excited for when this eventually becomes popularized. I anticipate spending a lot of time here,\u201d Welner said."

            "article_content": "I\u2019ve been closely following developments in quantum computing as an investor, and it\u2019s clear to me that it is rapidly converging on utility. Last year, Google\u2019s Willow device demonstrated that there is a promising pathway to scaling up to bigger and bigger computers. It showed that errors can be reduced exponentially as the number of quantum bits, or qubits, increases. It also ran a benchmark test in under five minutes that would take one of today\u2019s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years. While too small to be commercially useful with known algorithms, Willow shows that quantum supremacy (executing a task that is effectively impossible for any classical computer to handle in a reasonable amount of time) and fault tolerance (correcting errors faster than they are made) are achievable.\n\nFor example, PsiQuantum, a startup my company is invested in, is set to break ground on two quantum computers that will enter commercial service before the end of this decade. The plan is for each one to be 10 thousand times the size of Willow, big enough to tackle important questions about materials, drugs, and the quantum aspects of nature. These computers will not use GPUs to implement error correction. Rather, they will have custom hardware, operating at speeds that would be impossible with Nvidia hardware.\n\nAt the same time, quantum algorithms are improving far faster than hardware. A recent collaboration between the pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim and PsiQuantum demonstrated a more than 200x improvement in algorithms to simulate important drugs and materials. Phasecraft, another company we have invested in, has improved the simulation performance for a wide variety of crystal materials and has published a quantum-enhanced version of a widely used materials science algorithm that is tantalizingly close to beating all classical implementations on existing hardware.\n\nAdvances like these lead me to believe that useful quantum computing is inevitable and increasingly imminent. And that\u2019s good news, because the hope is that they will be able to perform calculations that no amount of AI or classical computation could ever achieve.\n\nWe should care about the prospect of useful quantum computers because today we don't really know how to do chemistry. We lack knowledge about the mechanisms of action for many of our most important drugs. The catalysts that drive our industries are generally poorly understood, require expensive exotic materials, or both. Despite appearances, we have significant gaps in our agency over the physical world; our achievements belie the fact that we are, in many ways, stumbling around in the dark.\n\nNature operates on the principles of quantum mechanics. Our classical computational methods fail to accurately capture the quantum nature of reality, even though much of our high-performance computing resources are dedicated to this pursuit. Despite all the intellectual and financial capital expended, we still don\u2019t understand why the painkiller acetaminophen works, how type-II superconductors function, or why a simple crystal of iron and nitrogen can produce a magnet with such incredible field strength. We search for compounds in Amazonian tree bark to cure cancer and other maladies, manually rummaging through a pitifully small subset of a design space encompassing 1060 small molecules. It\u2019s more than a little embarrassing."

            "article_content": "With the crypto market in a full bullish rally, 2025 is gearing up to be a great year for the industry. Upcoming regulatory changes in the US promise to drive asset prices much higher.\n\nIn this context, giants like Binance will likely do well, which is great news for BNB token holders. However, one TON-based DeFi token could have even more upside.\n\nBNB Sees Steady Growth Amid Bullish Markets\n\nBNB has been on a steady rise this cycle and throughout the year. Currently trading at $695.90, the token was up 126.53% over the past year. As Binance\u2019s ecosystem token, it benefits from the positive market trends that are increasing the exchange\u2019s profits.\n\nThe main driver for BNB\u2019s rise was always Binance. As a portion of Binance\u2019s revenue goes toward burning BNB, the token naturally does better when these revenues rise. Token burns create scarcity, pushing the token\u2019s price up.\n\nIn addition, BNB has seen some ecosystem developments of its own. For one, the chain launched its own no-code memecoin launchpad. This move sets BNB in competition with Solana, which has dominated meme coins for some time. BNB also recently launched a solution that helps developers create and monetize AI agents.\n\nFor these reasons, traders are mostly bullish. Changelly predicts that BNB could reach a high of $1,020 in 2025 if current market trends continue. At the same time, CoinCodex sees significant upside in the coming weeks, putting BNB between $723.11 and $827.66 by early February this year.\n\nElluminex Set To Transform TON\n\nWhile BNB seems set for a steady increase in 2025, one token will likely outperform it by a large margin. The new entrant into the TON ecosystem Elluminex (ELX) is attracting a lot of attention online. This DeFi hub is promising to fix one of the biggest issues for TON.\n\nElluminex is building a TON-based DeFi platform that would enable users to swap crypto assets across 40 different blockchains. Thanks to its cross-chain bridges, the platform would channel liquidity to TON from most major blockchains.\n\nThis liquidity would reduce slippage on Elluminex, crucial for profitable trading. However, it would also significantly boost TON\u2019s ecosystem, pushing asset prices up and bringing in more traders. For that reason, TON traders believe Elluminex can significantly boost the chain.\n\nIn addition, Elluminex also offers a range of other features, including an AI-powered Portfolio Tracker. This tool will give traders real-time insights into their portfolios and current market conditions. By assessing a trader\u2019s risk tolerance, the AI Portfolio Tracker could make trading more accessible than ever.\n\nJust as PancakeSwap led to a significant rally for BNB, Elluminex may cause TON\u2019s valuation and TVL to skyrocket. Thanks to TON\u2019s strong fundamentals, including a large user base and integration with Telegram, this is a real possibility.\n\nIf Elluminex succeeds in this mission, it will cement itself as the premier DeFi hub on one of the largest blockchains out there. For this reason, market players are predicting strong performance for 2025. Notably, Elluminex is expected to trade between $0.5 and $0.10. With the potential increase from its current price of $0.01, Elluminex is likely to outperform BNB.\n\nFor more information about Elluminex (ELX) visit the links below:\n\nWebsite: https://elluminex.com\n\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/elluminex\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Elluminex\n\nThe subject matter and the content of this article are solely the views of the author.

            "article_content": "We've known about the decline of physical game sales for quite some time, but according to the latest numbers from Circana's Mat Piscatella, this downward trend accelerated in 2024 (thanks, VGC).\n\nSharing the research firm's latest numbers on BlueSky, Piscatella stated that last year's US physical game spending was \"cut in more than half since 2021\", with the 2024 numbers more than 85% lower than the physical spend peak of 2008.\n\nYou can see the decline in action in the following table, showing Circana's physical software spending numbers for the past 25 years:\n\nThe rate of decline in US physical video game software spending accelerated in 2024. Spending on physical video game software in the US has been cut in more than half since 2021 and is now more than 85% below its 2008 peak. We'll see if Switch 2 can help slow/reverse this trend in 2025. \u2014 Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) 2025-01-24T19:24:41.744Z\n\nThe overall downward trend makes a lot of sense. You only need to take one look at the current industry landscape to see digital-only releases, free-to-play titles filled with microtransactions and the rise of console-specific online stores \u2014 none of which were as commonplace in 2008 as they are today. But the drop by \"more than half\" since the pandemic? Sheesh.\n\nOf course, this is an issue for physical sales only. Later in the thread, Piscatella clarified that game spending as a whole continues to grow, and 2024 was the \"second highest annual total ever\" for the region.\n\nThe Circana analyst muses whether Switch 2 will be able to \"slow/reverse this trend in 2025\", but we can't help but feel that it sounds like wishful thinking. Nintendo's physical sales remain pretty strong, but if 'Switch 1' couldn't stop the trend, we doubt its successor will be able to do much to move the needle."

            "article_content": "The Chinese AI lab DeepSeek has rolled out AI models that are a lot cheaper than OpenAI's offerings.\n\nIts emergence spooked tech stocks Monday, with Nvidia down more than 10% premarket.\n\nDeepSeek's open-source models challenge OpenAI's proprietary approach.\n\nThe cost of using AI models has been plunging as competition intensifies \u2014 and Wall Street is spooked about the latest entrant.\n\nHaving a leading AI model is nowhere near as special as it was two years ago. These models are mostly trained on data that's publicly available on the internet, so they're not that much different from one another. Standing out in this crowd and charging premium prices is increasingly difficult.\n\nIn recent weeks, DeepSeek has taken this pricing dynamic to a new level. The Chinese AI lab rolled out models that are as good as, or better than, the best products from OpenAI, the pioneering creator of ChatGPT.\n\nThat's impressive. But what's potentially more disruptive is how cheap DeepSeek's models are.\n\nThat disruption hit the markets Monday. The Dutch chipmaker ASML fell 11% after the opening bell, and Nvidia fell more than 10% premarket. In Japan, Advantest, TOWA Shibaura, and Ibiden were all down at the closing bell.\n\nBernstein tech analysts studied DeepSeek's offerings in recent days and found that the Chinese AI lab was massively undercutting OpenAI on price.\n\n\"DeepSeek's pricing blows away anything from the competition, with the company pricing their models anywhere from 20-40x cheaper than equivalent models from OpenAI,\" the analysts wrote in a note to investors on Sunday.\n\nDeepSeek and OpenAI pricing compared. Bernstein Research\n\nThe chart above shows the cost of \" tokens ,\" which have become the raw material of generative AI. Chatbots and AI models break down words and other inputs into these tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about three-quarters of a word.\n\nWhen AI companies are handling prompts and other model inputs and outputs, they often charge users based on a per-token price. DeepSeek's Reasoner model costs $0.55 for every million tokens inputted. OpenAI's o1 model charges $15 for the same number of tokens, according to Bernstein.\n\nThe Bernstein analysts also noted that DeepSeek's models are open-source, meaning they are available free to anyone who wants to work with them. That's a contrast with OpenAI, which keeps its top models proprietary and closed while charging relatively high prices for the products.\n\n\"The whole thing brings up some very interesting questions about the role and viability of proprietary versus open-source efforts that are probably worth doing more work on,\" the Bernstein analysts wrote.\n\nBut they added, \"The resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown.\"\n\nEdison Lee, an equity research analyst at Jefferies, said it was \"difficult to say what the eventual impact will be, but combining our more cautious cyclical view on the chip sector in any case, it may be prudent to reduce exposure to the digital part of the semiconductor supply chain including semicap equipment stocks like ASML.\"\n\nDeepSeek's newly-released flagship model is now No. 1 on Apple's free apps chart \u2014 just ahead of ChatGPT."

Within weeks she fled to Poland, and then onto the UK.\n\nFinally she found shelter through Brighton's 'Homes for Ukraine' scheme, at first living with a host family, now living independently.\n\n'For me, it's a big, big love for these people and this process,' Yuliia said.\n\n'I'm very thankful, particularly for our host family. But me and my children really thank all the people for their support in our first period in Brighton.'\n\nA local community group, Stand For Ukraine, was also set up in the city during those early days of the war. It's organisers now look to the future of the conflict with a mix of optimism and apprehension.\n\n'It's very tough, very, very tough,' Iryna Olyanovska said. 'After nearly three years of this horrendous, horrendous situation, everybody's tired. However, we're all determined that we need to win.'\n\n'Obviously President Trump has very good intentions and everybody wants this war to stop,' Kira Makohon added. 'But from what we can see from Russian news, from Russian media, there are few signs things are going to stop.'\n\nMore than 300 host families have helped refugees in the city through the Brighton and Hove City Council scheme.\n\nWhile some of those refugees remain, others have returned to a war-torn country who's shattered buildings have become an all too familiar sight.\n\n'If you look at what's happening around the world and at the toxic way refugees and migrants are treated in some areas, I think it is massively important to be compassionate.'\n\n'We are proud to be a city of sanctuary,' Cllr Leslie Pumm said. 'I really, really hope that this war is going to end very soon.'\n\nStand for Ukraine are hosting a jazz evening to raise funds this weekend.\n\nYuliiah is now using her career in the finance sector to help support her countrymen back home. Their futures still entwined, still uncertain.\n\nThe council is searching for more homes to give refugees like her fresh hope."

The worrying part for its US rivals? It claims to have done so without having spent billions on cutting-edge chips. Investor Marc Andreessen hailed it as \u201cone of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs.\u201d\n\nThe revelation is prompting a major rethink about the big boys in AI\u2019s massive spending needs, triggering doubts about the sky-high valuations for companies like Nvidia.

            "source": "IBTimes India",
            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking research article, Sardar Mohammed, a cloud infrastructure expert from the United States, provides comprehensive insights into the transformative evolution of cloud computing architecture and its impact on modern enterprises. His analysis reveals how emerging technologies are reshaping the digital landscape through innovative service models and implementation strategies.\n\nThe Foundation of Modern Cloud\n\nThe cloud infrastructure landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation, with organizations experiencing an average 32% reduction in IT operational costs and a 45% improvement in deployment speed. The integration of hardware resources, software solutions, and sophisticated networking components has created a robust framework that enables seamless delivery of cloud computing services, fundamentally changing how businesses operate in the digital age.\n\nRevolutionary Service Models\n\nCloud infrastructure revolves around three pivotal service models, each addressing unique organizational needs. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources with exceptional flexibility, enabling businesses to scale dynamically. Containers as a Service (CaaS) revolutionizes application deployment through advanced containerization techniques. Platform as a Service (PaaS) delivers comprehensive development environments, empowering enterprises to accelerate innovation while significantly reducing development timelines and operational complexities.\n\nEmerging Technologies Drive Innovation\n\nThe integration of quantum computing with traditional cloud systems represents a revolutionary advancement in digital technology. As the industry prepares for the post-quantum era, providers are pioneering quantum-safe encryption protocols to maintain robust data security. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence has become an integral part of cloud infrastructure, bringing unprecedented capabilities to resource management. Through advanced machine learning algorithms and predictive maintenance systems, AI is transforming how cloud resources are allocated, monitored, and optimized, setting new standards for operational efficiency.\n\nEdge Computing Transformation\n\nEdge computing is revolutionizing network intelligence by integrating AI at the network's periphery. Organizations now process massive IoT data streams in real-time, reducing latency and optimizing bandwidth. Powered by 5G, this technology enables breakthrough applications in autonomous vehicles and augmented reality while enhancing cybersecurity through decentralized computational architectures that distribute and protect network endpoints. This paradigm shift represents a fundamental transformation in how computational resources are deployed, bringing intelligence closer to data sources and dramatically improving real-time processing capabilities.\n\nAutonomous Infrastructure Management\n\nThe rise of autonomous infrastructure management marks a pivotal shift in cloud computing evolution. Advanced AI algorithms now power self-managing systems that transform routine operations, from maintenance tasks to resource scaling, with minimal human oversight. These intelligent systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities in predictive maintenance, automatically identifying and resolving potential issues before they impact performance. The integration of self-healing mechanisms enables cloud infrastructures to maintain optimal health through automated problem detection and resolution.\n\nIndustry-Wide Impact\n\nThe implementation of cloud infrastructure varies significantly across different sectors, each presenting unique challenges and requirements. Healthcare organizations have revolutionized patient care through integrated electronic health records systems, while financial institutions have transformed transaction processing through blockchain integration. Manufacturing has evolved into smart factories through IoT integration, and retail has embraced omnichannel commerce through sophisticated cloud solutions.\n\nFuture Trajectory\n\nAccording to industry forecasts, edge computing integration with traditional cloud infrastructure is expected to grow by 75% by 2025, while AI-driven infrastructure management solutions are projected to become standard in 80% of enterprise cloud deployments. This evolution continues to accelerate, driven by technological innovations and changing business demands.\n\nIn conclusion, the fusion of emerging technologies in cloud infrastructure is creating unprecedented opportunities for digital transformation. As demonstrated in Sardar Mohammed's comprehensive analysis, the symbiotic relationship between quantum computing, AI, and edge computing is not just enhancing system capabilities but revolutionizing how organizations approach their computing needs. This technological convergence promises a future where cloud infrastructure will be more automated, intelligent, and adaptable, fundamentally transforming the digital enterprise landscape."

            "article_content": "Michael McIntyre made a pretty cringe discovery on Michael Sheen's phone as he branded him as 'self-centred'.\n\nHaving pleaded 'don't do that', the star was left red-faced as he was given a right roasting in front of an audience\n\nThe Good Omens actor appeared on the comedian\u2019s Big Show episode on Saturday (25 January) where he was subjected to the infamous \u2018Send to All\u2019 challenge.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd this led to McIntyre calling out a \u2018self-centred' discovery on Sheen\u2019s phone.\n\nAs you\u2019ll probably know, this is a pretty staple feature of the BBC show, when the comic gets a hold of a celebrity guest\u2019s device and sends out a cringey message to all of their contacts live on stage.\n\nOh, and obviously has a bit of a scour through the contents of their phone first - how could he not?\n\nMichael McIntyre found it hilarious (BBC)\n\nAdvert\n\nSo it was pretty understandable when Sheen admitted to having some nerves beforehand as he said: \u201cIt all seemed like a very good idea when I was first asked. Now it seems like a very bad idea.\u201d\n\nThe Welshman watched on from the VIP box in the theatre with partner Anna Lundberg and her mum, Ingrid, as McIntyre took the plunge into his apps.\n\nBoth the live audience and viewers watched as the host uncovered Sheen\u2019s most recent search on IMDb.\n\nAnd turns out, it was himself. The Quiz actor explained: \u201cListen, sometimes...\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cSometimes, I have to look myself up, alright? Because I forget what I've been in.\u201d\n\nHonestly, fair enough - I can\u2019t even remember what I had for tea last night.\n\nHis second most recent search was 'Gavin and Stacey' in a bit of a nod to the actor\u2019s Welsh pride.\n\nThen, McIntyre turned his attention to Sheen\u2019s notes app while asking: \u201cIs notes a bit personal?\u201d The star smiled as he advised him to avoid: \"Don't do that.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nMichael Sheen was roasted (BBC)\n\nBut obviously, this was ignored and the comedian dove straight in as he found an entire page dedicated to the actor\u2019s work history.\n\nThis turned out to be the write-up of a bio for one of his projects and of course, McIntyre found it absolutely hilariously as he joked Sheen was 'self-centred'.\n\nHaving read that out aloud, the presenter carried on with the embarrassment as he turned his attention to the photos app.\n\nAdvert\n\nHere he found plenty of selfies of the 55-year-old, including ones of him in disguise. And there was even a snap of his decapitated head from the infamous The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 scene.\n\nMcIntyre couldn\u2019t help but point out that pretty much all the photos were of Sheen himself as he continued to comically roast him for being a bit self-obsessed."

            "article_content": "You may not know it, but right now there\u2019s a huge cosmic rave party happening far, far above our heads. The chief partygoers are known as supermassive black holes. These mysterious objects can have masses several million or billion times that of the sun and are so dense that they warp spacetime around them.\n\nAs far as astronomers know, all galaxies harbour a supermassive black hole at their very centres. In some galaxies, large amounts of interstellar gas are spiralling around the supermassive black hole and getting pulled in beyond the event horizon and essentially onto the black hole. This process creates a huge amount of friction and energy, which can cause the \u201crave\u201d I\u2019m talking about \u2013 releasing huge amounts of light at many different colours and frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nIn some cases, the black hole will even spew jets of plasma, millions of light years across intergalactic space. The plasma gas is so hot that it\u2019s essentially a soup of electrons moving close to the speed of light. These plasma jets glow at radio frequencies, so they can be seen with a radio telescope and are, aptly, named radio galaxies. In a recent episode of the astronomy podcast The Cosmic Savannah, I likened their appearance to two glow sticks (the plasma jets) poking out of a ball of sticky tack (the galaxy). Astronomers hypothesise that the plasma jets keep expanding outwards as time passes, eventually growing so large that they become giant radio galaxies.\n\nBy 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered\n\nMillions of normally sized radio galaxies are known to science. But by 2020 only about 800 giant radio galaxies had been found, nearly 50 years since they had been initially discovered. They were considered rare. However, a new generation of radio telescopes, including South Africa\u2019s MeerKAT, have turned this idea on its head: in the past five years about 11 000 giants have been discovered.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s newest giant radio galaxy find is extraordinary. The plasma jets of this cosmic giant span 3.3 million light years from end to end \u2013 over 32 times the size of the Milky Way. I\u2019m one of the lead researchers who made the discovery. We\u2019ve nicknamed it Inkathazo, meaning \u201ctrouble\u201d in isiXhosa and isiZulu. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been a bit troublesome to understand the physics behind what\u2019s going on with Inkathazo.\n\nThis discovery has given us a unique opportunity to study giant radio galaxies. The findings challenge existing models and suggest that we don\u2019t yet understand much of the complicated plasma physics at play in these extreme galaxies.\n\nHere comes \u2018trouble\u2019\n\nThe MeerKAT telescope is in the Karoo, is made up of 64 radio dishes, and is operated and managed by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. It\u2019s a precursor to the Square Kilometre Array, which will, when it commences science operations around 2028, be the world\u2019s largest telescope.\n\nMeerKAT has already been pivotal in uncovering some of the hidden treasures of the southern sky since it was first commissioned in 2018.\n\nThis is the third giant radio galaxy that my collaborators and I have discovered with MeerKAT in a relatively small patch of sky near the equator, around the size of five full moons, that astronomers refer to as the \u201cCosmos field\u201d. We pointed MeerKAT at Cosmos during the early stages of the most advanced surveys of distant galaxies ever conducted: the International Gigahertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (Mightee).\n\nThe Mightee team, a collaboration of astronomers from around the world, and I first published the discovery of the two other giant radio galaxies in Cosmos in 2021.\n\nWe spotted Inkathazo more recently in my own MeerKAT follow-up observations of Cosmos, as well as in the full Mightee survey.\n\nHowever, Inkathazo differs from its cosmic companions in several ways. It doesn\u2019t have the same characteristics as many other giant radio galaxies. For example, the plasma jets have an unusual shape. Rather than extending straight across from end-to-end, one of the jets is bent.\n\nAdditionally, Inkathazo lives at the very centre of a cluster of galaxies, rather than in relative isolation, which should make it difficult for the plasma jets to grow to such enormous sizes. Its location in a cluster raises questions about the role of environmental interactions in the formation and evolution of these giant galaxies.\n\nMeerKAT\u2019s exceptional capabilities are helping us to unravel this cosmic conundrum. We\u2019ve created some of the highest-resolution spectral maps ever made for giant radio galaxies. These maps track the age of the plasma across different parts of the galaxy, providing clues about the physical processes at work.\n\nThe results revealed intriguing complexities in Inkathazo\u2019s jets. Some electrons within the plasma jets receive unexpected boosts of energy. We think this may occur when the jets collide with hot gas in the voids between galaxies in a cluster. This gives us hints about what sort of plasma physics might be happening in these extreme parts of the universe that we didn\u2019t previously predict.\n\nA treasure trove\n\nThe fact that we unveiled three giant radio galaxies by pointing MeerKAT at a single patch of sky suggests that there\u2019s likely a huge treasure trove of these cosmic behemoths just waiting to be discovered in the southern sky. The telescope is incredibly powerful and it\u2019s in a perfect location for this kind of research, so it\u2019s ideally poised to uncover and learn more about giant radio galaxies in the years to come.\n\nKathleen Charlton, a master\u2019s student at the University of Cape Town, was the lead author of the research on which this article was based\n\nThe author, Jacinta Delhaize, is a lecturer at the University of Cape Town\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence.

            "article_content": "The research was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (\u211623-71-01047). The research findings have been published in the Physica Scripta.\n\nResearch into quantum physics often requires the use of complex mathematical models to describe open systems. The main problem in describing quantum systems is the solution of nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations, which describe systems with nonlocal interactions. Such equations do not always yield exact solutions, and when they do, they often do not cover the full range of physical situations. Asymptotic methods provide approximate solutions and cannot claim to be absolutely accurate. Nevertheless, asymptotic methods help to describe the system dynamics to a considerable extent.\n\nOur project deals with equations with the so-called non-Hermitean part, i.e., open systems. Real systems are exactly like this, since our world is infinite, i.e. a closed system is always only an approximation on any scale. We use the method of quasi-classical approximation to describe open quantum systems, which is something between classical Newtonian mechanics and quantum mechanics. And, of course, it is only relatively \u2018simplified\u2019, because you still need to be a specialist in the corresponding field of knowledge to understand and make use of it. The challenge of working with this kind of equations is that they do not assume exact solutions except for a very small number of specific cases. Therefore, we have to use asymptotic (approximate) methods, \u2014 says Anton Kulagin, co-author of the study and associate professor at TPU's Division for Electronic Engineering.\n\nTo verify their calculations, the researchers compared the results with already known exact solutions or approximate models, published experimental data, and also used numerical verification methods, although these often do not provide a complete understanding of the physical processes. According to the scientists, analytical and numerical methods that can solve such nonlinear equations are very limited.\n\n\u201cNumerical solutions to equations are like exploring a black box. You define some input data and get the output data. You can only guess what was actually going on inside in terms of the physics of the process. Analytical methods, on the contrary, can explicitly state some physical regularities and explain the underlying processes. However, they are limited in describing quantum systems, especially when it comes to nonlinear nonlocal interactions between components and non-trivial geometry due to the complexity of the resulting mathematical constructions. Our approach seems to be the only possible solution to this class of problems with the same level of generality\u201d, \u2013 adds the scientist.\n\nThe TPU approach can form the basis for understanding the physics of solutions to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and, consequently, the nature of superconducting vortices. In addition, the TPU scientists' research can help describe the dynamics of superfluid gases, which are used to create erasable masks in atom lithography."

            "article_content": "\u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d by Yuval Noah Harari is a sweeping and insightful exploration of our species\u2019 journey from its humble beginnings to the present day.\n\nSapiens explores the rise of Homo sapiens through key revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. This groundbreaking book examines how human history is shaped by \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies \u2013 that enable unparalleled cooperation. Harari investigates the impact of these revolutions on human society, from the dawn of agriculture and the rise of civilizations to the challenges of the modern world, including climate change, technological disruption, and the search for meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution: The book begins by examining the unique cognitive abilities that set Homo sapiens apart from other animals. Around 70,000 years ago, a \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d occurred, leading to the development of advanced language and the ability to create and believe in \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies. These shared fictions, while not objectively real, allow humans to cooperate flexibly on a massive scale, a feat unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This cooperation enabled the development of complex social structures, from small tribes to vast empires.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution: Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. This seemingly revolutionary shift, however, brought about significant drawbacks. Agriculture led to increased inequality, disease, and environmental degradation. Farmers, despite working harder than hunter-gatherers, often had less leisure time and a poorer diet. The domestication of plants and animals also led to the suffering of countless creatures.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution: Beginning in the 16th century, the Scientific Revolution challenged religious dogma and ushered in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Science provided humans with new tools and knowledge, allowing them to manipulate the natural world on an unprecedented scale. This revolution, however, also brought about new challenges, such as climate change, nuclear war, and the potential for technological disruption.\n\nModern Challenges: Harari explores the profound challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. These include climate change, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. He raises critical questions about the meaning of happiness, the future of humanity, and our relationship with technology.\n\nKey Themes:"
