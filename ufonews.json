            "article_content": "New footage of multiple eerie 'triangle' craft flying above New Jersey has only compounded the mystery for locals.\n\nAt least five or possibly six of the unidentified drones were captured in the new, 50-second cell phone video, which one commenter declared was 'the clearest video yet.'\n\nOne drone, heard roaring in the skies as it moved through the darkness, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly and red lights blinking at the tips of its wings and tail.\n\nAnother drone came into frame that resembled a classic 'black triangle' UFO or the triangular TR-3B, which beamed bright white lights from its nose, wingtips and tail.\n\nSince mid-November, a wave of unexplained drone sightings above central Jersey has left both law enforcement and the general public watching the skies, hunting for clues on what these mysterious night flights might be.\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy has attempted to calm residents claiming these true UFOs pose 'no known threat to the public at this time,' but FBI and local police are actively investigating.\n\nConcerns have heightened over the proximity of these drone-like UFOs to President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course, US military research facility Picatinny Arsenal and critical local infrastructure.\n\n'Water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments, and military installations' have all had the UFOs roaming above them in recent weeks, according to the chief of police for the New Jersey borough of Florham Park.\n\n'Their presence appears nefarious in nature,' the police chief added.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' NJ native and TikTok creator @_bucky13 commented under his phone footage of the eerie drones (still image above), captioned 'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.' At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nThe magazine even suggested that this alleged 'black budget' surveillance plane 'may have seen action during Operation Desert Storm.'\n\nAerospace illustrator, Mark McCandlish, who contributed art for a 1991 Popular Mechanics article on the alleged TR-3A 'Black Manta' would go on to claim that the US had covertly reverse engineered a crashed UFO\n\nThe article also described a much largerm even more incredible and 'highly maneuverable' black triangle aircraft \u2014 as big as a B-2 bomber's 150-foot wingspan and capable of turning '90 degrees on its wingtip.'\n\nA decade later at the National Press Club in Washington DC, May 9, 2001, the aerospace illustrator who contributed art for that PopMech article, Mark McCandlish, claimed that US covert anti-gravity propulsion research had actually reverse engineered a crashed UFO.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996.\n\nThe RQ-3 DarkStar was a highly-advanced remotely piloted aircraft intended for stealth reconnaissance, but officially the firm says that Darkstar 'never entered production' due to 'cost and aerodynamic stability problems.'\n\nBut, if the craft really are 'above top secret' American innovations, few other branches of the federal government appear to be in the loop, with many worrying about rival foreign powers like Russia or China being the culprits.\n\nThis past November 22, the FAA banned drone flights over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey until Friday, December 6, as well as above the Picatinny Arsenal Military Base in Rockaway until December 26.\n\nAbove: US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' which flew in 1996. The RQ-3 DarkStar was a highly-advanced, stealthy reconnaissance remotely piloted aircraft that the firm says 'never entered production' due to 'cost and aerodynamic stability problems'\n\n'We look into all reports of unauthorized drone operations,' FAA officials in a statement, 'and investigate when appropriate.'\n\nThe administration warned drone operators that any unmanned flights that endanger aircraft or pedestrians down below could lead to fines up to $75,000 \u2014plus a loss of their drone operators' pilot certificates.\n\nLocal digital news site NJ.com spoke with a spokesman for Picatinny Arsenal, Eric Kowal, who repeated that it is illegal to fly drones over the base without prior authorization. But he does not believe the drones pose an immediate threat.\n\n'From our standpoint we're not alarming our residents and employees,' he said.\n\n'The FBI are the experts on the threat. We don't believe there to be a threat at this juncture.'"

If you own a PC with an NPU (or Neural Engine, in Apple\u2019s parlance), which applications can you use now to see what an AI PC is capable of?\n\nWhat follows are eight AI PC applications that are available to use now on Mac computers with M-series chips or Windows PCs with processors that include an NPU. These range from an AI assistant that can analyze and summarize private documents to applications for live video production, DJing, image editing and audio deepfake detection."

            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch adds or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Lawyer Pierre Dewitte, a privacy advocate whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Nothing is releasing its own Gallery app with Nothing OS 3.0, which has now leaked ahead of its expected December release.\n\nThe Nothing Gallery app features a clean design with basic photo management tools.\n\nAI features are absent from the update and are expected to be added in the future.\n\nNothing was amongst the first few OEMs to jump onto the Android 15 platform update bandwagon with the release of the Nothing OS 3.0 betas for its devices. Nothing is targeting a general release of Nothing OS 3.0 stable for this month, and ahead of the release, we finally have a good look at the new Nothing Gallery app that is expected to arrive along with it.\n\nNothing smartphones so far have relied on Google Photos for photo management, which isn\u2019t a bad choice at all. However, users have long requested a dedicated stock gallery app, which Nothing teased was coming with Nothing OS 3.0. However, as we noted in our Nothing OS 3.0 beta hands-on, the update was missing the Nothing Gallery app. The company shared just a glimpse of the Gallery experience, but the app has now leaked before the public launch. We\u2019ve installed it on our device, and this is what it looks like:\n\nAs you can see, the Nothing Gallery app takes a more simplistic approach to a photo management app. You can choose which folders to show in the Photos view. The Photos view is a giant universal feed of all images on your device, so a filtering option is much appreciated here. You can pinch in and out to change the density of photos on display.\n\nWhen viewing a photo, the image preview bar at the bottom allows you to scroll through other images, which is a nice touch for quickly locating adjacent photos. A persistent toolbar is also present at the bottom, letting you mark an image as Favorite, share it, delete it, and access more menu options with the three-dot menu button. The menu button has further options, which helps avoid cluttering the toolbar with buttons used less often.\n\nWhen viewing videos, the persistent toolbar also gets a play/pause button and a volume control button. There is no visible seekbar, though, but the time played and total duration of the video are visible.\n\nThe Albums view further lets you filter down to a specific folder only. You can also create new folders/albums here. It also has a folder for recently deleted files, allowing you to make mistakes, just in case you accidentally delete something you shouldn\u2019t have. There\u2019s also a Search view that lets you search through all images.\n\nIf the entire UX looks too bright and white to you, then thankfully, there\u2019s a dark theme here, too. However, we could not locate an independent toggle for it, so the theme appears to be entirely dependent on your system theme. We also noticed that the Nothing Gallery app supports XDR/Ultra HDR photos.\n\nYou can get a better look at the app in our experience video below:\n\nCuriously, we could not locate any AI features within the Gallery app. Nothing had mentioned the following in its announcement: Gallery will include in the future: automatic AI image categorisation, \u201cmore natural language search,\u201d and more AI features like AI Upscaling and Super Resolution and AI Image Generation. Given that the Nothing Gallery app is currently in beta, it\u2019s possible that Nothing meant that these features will be present in the future. The company may also make further changes and adjustments to the UX and features since this is not the final release. You can sideload the APK on non-Nothing devices, but the app will not work unless you make further changes, and we do not recommend going down that route.\n\nHow do you like the Nothing Gallery app so far? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com . You can stay anonymous or get credit for the info, it's your choice.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

All the activities and experiments involve either fire or ice.\n\nNews On 6's Alyssa Miller got to try one of the experiments out on the Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages Porch.\n\nWhat We Used: Dry Ice, Warm Water, Bubbles, Clear Tank\n\nHow It Works: Put a piece of dry ice in the tank and blow bubbles into it. Then combine warm water and dry ice. That will turn the solid ice into a gas. Pour the gas into the tank. The bubbles will float, and a cloud will form above a layer of clear gas.\n\nWhat It Teaches: This experiment teaches kids about phase changes, combustion reactions, and gas laws.\n\nDiscovery Lab Director of Education, Chip Lindsey said, \"You get iridescent rainbows on the bubbles, so what causes that? You see that the bubbles begin to float down through the carbon dioxide, what causes that? All of those questions are like an entry point to really talk about basic properties of physics, chemistry, and even biology.\"\n\nHow Can I Learn More?\n\nThe Discovery Lab will be doing these fire and ice experiments and activities daily in its Science Lab. There is also single-day Winter WonderCamps for kids from Pre-K through 6th grade on January 2, 3, and 6. Register for camp at https://www.discoverylab.org/camps."

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.\n\nFeatured Video For You 10 mind-blowing discoveries from the James Webb Telescope"

It also lays out a staged testing strategy that will allow the federal agency to track and monitor the disease.\n\nThe National Milk Testing Strategy, which the new milk testing regimen is called, \u201cis a critical part of our ongoing efforts to protect the health and safety of individuals and communities nationwide,\u201d according to a prepared statement from Xavier Becerra, the U.S. secretary of Human and Health Services.\n\nInitially, the order will only apply to six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Lyle, a spokesman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said the order is incidental, bringing \u201cno changes for California. We are already doing this.\u201d\n\nWhile California, Colorado and Michigan have all reported positive herds, the three others have not. Testing regimens and investigations have already been underway in the infected states \u2014 as well as in Pennsylvania, which in late November, began its own \u201cPrecautionary Bulk Milk Testing at Processing Plants\u201d program.\n\nWhile Oregon has not had a H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows, it has reported the disease in commercial poultry, wild birds and, last month, two pigs.\n\nMississippi has roughly 50 herds statewide, with each farm averaging 149 cows.\n\nThe new milking plan is designed as a step-by-step plan, with the end goal of eradicating the disease from the nation\u2019s herds \u2014 an objective few epidemiologists or virologists think, at this point, is possible.\n\nIn the first stage, testing will occur at all dairy processing facilities within a given state, allowing the federal agency to determine if and where the virus is residing. The next stage will allow the federal agency to drill down deeper by moving the testing to bulk tanks.\n\nIf the virus is found, the third stage goes into action, triggering an even more granular investigation by identifying farms and herds that are positive \u2014 allowing for \u201crapid response measures,\u201d including biosecurity programs such as movement controls and contact tracing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf, however, no virus is found in a state, bulk tank testing frequency will progressively decrease \u2014 going from weekly to monthly to quarterly, assuming the state\u2019s tests remain negative.\n\nFinally, there is the fifth stage, known as \u201cDemonstrating Freedom from H5 in U.S. Dairy Cattle.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when, according to the statement, states can begin more periodic sampling and testing \u201cto illustrate long-term absence from the national herd.\u201d"
