            "article_content": "British UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee\n\nBritish UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee, has asserted that the images of a mysterious orb at Manchester Airport are unequivocally evidence of a UFO. Recently delving into so-called \"drone\" episodes at military installations across the UK, Lee is now scrutinising the curious event at Manchester Airport. The imagery, dating back to June, has sparked a wildfire of speculation on social media platforms like X (once known as Twitter) and Reddit, where it was shared. The footage depicts a round entity captured by an alleged co-pilot on the tarmac, seen either soaring in the sky or \"hovering\" just above ground near another plane. These events trail a spate of similar sightings, specifically several orbs spotted over Washington DC's supposed no-fly zone. The person who released the Manchester sighting description claimed the UAP matched the size of a small vehicle. Intrigued, Mark Lee has flagged this incident as particularly noteworthy. Drawing parallels with historical accounts, he mentioned: \"This blue orb sighting reminds me of UK researcher Timothy Good who wrote about the Australian government capturing an alien sphere in 1957 - it was made of an unknown substance and had no visible means of levitation.\"\n\nWARNING TAKEN FROM TWITTERCAPTION: UAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fansLINK: https://x.com/PNWMPA/status/1861843806074876103/photo/1\n\nLee elaborated that this peculiar object was apprehended at Woomera's Nuclear test facility in Australia and eventually found its way to the Wright Patterson Airforce Base in the USA, reports the Daily Star. Discussing the recent Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) activity he's been investigating, he stated: \"People are assuming that the UAP sightings at military bases in the East of England are Russian drones. But eye witnesses of locals who have seen these UAPs state that they move very slowly and if they are Russian how did they get here - have they flown all this way at such a slow speed\" Mark further revealed that his research for his new film - The Rendelsham UFO - The British Roswell - about an alleged UFO landing at a military base in Suffolk in 1980 (RAF Bentwaters) - has led him to believe that an alien intelligence is constantly monitoring our military bases (particularly those with Nuclear weapons). With global tensions currently high, he believes the alien presence has increased its surveillance using AI drones.\n\nUAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fans\n\nHe said: \"What we found with the Rendelsham UFO - was that an alien presence was monitoring the Nuclear weapons that were being stored at RAF Bentwaters as part of the NATO defence during the Cold War.\" However, a spokesperson from Manchester Airport dismissed any theories of extraterrestrial visitors in this case. He suggested that the most likely explanation is either a weather or helium balloon, and questioned the authenticity of the photograph showing an object hovering above the ground on the airfield. \"We have systems that pick up anything that could be a threat to aviation,\" he said. He stated: \"Anything that gives off a signal we would know about.\" He added that if there was anything on the airfield, as depicted in the photograph, it would be treated as a major incident, and no such disruption-causing event has occurred.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The event, captured in a viral photograph by Air Force veteran and licensed tour guide Dennis Diggins, shows four glowing lights hovering near the Capitol dome's iconic Statue of Freedom.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, a video recorded from another angle appeared to show the lights shifting from a square formation to a single line, maintaining their position over the Capitol. These images and videos have sent social media into a frenzy, with many users expressing fear and curiosity.\n\nThe timing of the sighting has further intensified the speculation, coming just weeks after Congress held hearings about alleged secret government programs involving unidentified spacecraft and non-human intelligence. Some online commentators questioned whether this sighting could be linked to the claims discussed during these hearings.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the lights indicate extraterrestrial activity. Sceptics and experts have offered alternative explanations, pointing to camera lens flares or reflections as the likely cause of the phenomena. John Greenewald Jr., a prominent researcher and UFO investigator, weighed in on the debate, dismissing the sighting as a common optical illusion. \"The lights at the U.S. Capitol have been mistaken for UFOs in camera lenses for decades,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nDespite these reassurances, the incident has reignited interest in UFO phenomena, especially in light of ongoing discussions about transparency in government programs related to unidentified aerial phenomena. The Pentagon, earlier this year, released a report stating it found no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft, but sightings like this continue to capture the public\u2019s imagination.\n\nWhether the lights were a natural optical illusion or something more mysterious, they have certainly sparked a renewed conversation about what lies beyond our understanding\u2014and perhaps, beyond our world."

These vertical columns of light, mistaken for paranormal activity, are actually a natural optical illusion formed by ice crystals reflecting light under specific weather conditions\n\nRecently in Central Alberta, Canada, residents witnessed a beautiful spectacle of light pillars that illuminated the night sky during the winter. These columns of light appear to rise from the ground and stretch up into the dark, creating an ethereal visual spectacle. While many people are led to believe that these columns of light are paranormal, they are, in fact, a natural optical illusion that is created under specific weather conditions.\n\nThe Science Behind Light Pillars\n\nLight pillars are a phenomenon that is formed when the light sources like streetlights or building lights reflect off tiny hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The ice crystals are as small as 0.02 mm in diameter and function like mirrors. As light hits the ice crystals, it is reflected, giving the appearance of vertical columns shooting into the sky. The illusion can be almost magical, with beams of light soaring high above the ground to cast a shimmering glow over the dark sky.\n\nCheck out the visuals here\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada \ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form. For example, these photos were taken at\u2026 pic.twitter.com/F3Rk55UXaV \u2014 Malinda \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea (@TreasChest) November 26, 2024\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada \ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form.

They are not associated with otherworldly or paranormal activity. Generally, the phenomenon is most common in colder climates, especially during the winter months when the temperatures plummet. Ideal conditions for light pillars include temperatures ranging from -10\u00b0C to -40\u00b0C, high humidity, and still air. Under these conditions, ice crystals form and reflect the light, thus creating this fantastic visual effect.\n\nAlberta, along with other cold regions like Russia and parts of Scandinavia, is an ideal location for witnessing this extraordinary natural wonder. While the light pillars may seem to originate directly from the light sources, they are actually an optical illusion, created by the reflection of light off the suspended ice crystals, often located high in the atmosphere.\n\nA Winter Marvel in Alberta\n\nFor those in Alberta, who have to bear the bitter cold, light pillars provide a moment of awe amidst the harsh winter conditions. Despite the freezing temperatures and biting wind-chill, the phenomenon offers a reminder of the mysterious beauty that nature can create. The stunning display transforms the icy winter landscape into a celestial wonder, providing residents and observers with an unforgettable winter experience.\n\nALSO READ: Rare First Edition Of Harry Potter Book \u2013 One Of Only 500 Copies \u2013 Sells For \u20b938 Lakh At UK Auction"

According to experts at Dangerous Roads, the M6 \u201chas been found to be the most haunted road\u201d in the country. Specialists claim road users have previously spotted \u201cRoman soldiers, a distraught woman hitchhiker, ghost cars that look like they\u2019ve just been in a serious collision, and a phantom lorry going the wrong way\u201d. The 230-mile route runs from Rugby in Warwickshire to Gretna in Scotland, with around 17.7 million vehicles using it every day. Along this route, an 18-mile stretch between Junctions 16 and 19 is an ancient hotspot and has previously been dubbed the new \u201cBermuda Triangle\".\n\nMillions of vehicles use the popular route every year\n\nThe site has even been visited by international psychic Mike Brooker, who claimed to be \u201cinvestigating\u201d the area for possible paranormal activity. Mike stressed the number of accidents on the fairly straight stretch of road was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. He admitted history could provide the answers with the route possibly built on a Roman burial site. Mike also theorised that the area could have been the location of a Scottish army slaughter around 200 years ago.\n\nHe previously told Cheshire Live: \u201cI personally know people who have lost their lives and families who have been affected by accidents on this stretch of motorway. \u201cI am investigating this and I need people to give me whatever evidence they have; sightings or experiences or even strange occurrences. \"I am leaning towards the theory that it can be connected to Saxon involvement. There are reports of a Roman burial ground and that there was an historic clash between Scottish and English armies. There are so many variables and possibilities.\u201d\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The third floor is not yet open, but we hope to open it in 2025. There\u2019s also a barn, print shop and two log cabins on this property and the Waynesburg and Washington Railroad\u2019s locomotive is a popular stop too,\u201d said Executive Director Matthew Cumberledge.\n\nGCHS has held events throughout the years, bringing visitors in from Greene County and surrounding areas for speaking engagements, car shows and a festival, but said Cumberledge, in 2025, they are planning to reinvent themselves.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t quite know what it will look like yet, but I think the event schedule will change quite a bit. We hope to offer a summer reenactment weekend and a paranormal haunted history event to name a few,\u201d Cumberledge said. \u201cOne thing that will remain is the annual Harvest Festival in October. That will be our huge celebration for 100 years.\u201d\n\nFor many years, the museum has rented the grounds for private paranormal investigations, and it\u2019s not uncommon for staff and guests to walk away with a story or two about unexplained footsteps, sounds, smells and full-bodied apparitions.\n\nYouTube has plenty of documented experiences there, and the museum is prepared to offer a spooky event next fall.\n\nAside from planning new events, the museum leaves staff and volunteers with quite a list to accomplish.\n\nNot only do they hope to open the third floor to guests, the volunteers at GCHS are always working on the preservation and upkeep of the property, built between 1857 and 1887.\n\nMost recently, they\u2019ve been restoring each of the 150 windows in the museum, bringing them to safe and operational standards. Cumberledge said the final 20 windows should be complete this winter.\n\n\u201cThe income we generate from the events and tours allows us to keep the building maintained, and it\u2019s a big task,\u201d Cumberledge said. \u201cNonprofits are hurting financially right now, and we\u2019re all struggling to make ends meet, but we\u2019re being creative and any donations are a huge help.\u201d\n\nThey plan to launch a volunteer recruitment campaign this winter, in search of those interested in serving as tour guides, event hosts and more.\n\nWatch their Facebook and website at https://greenecountyhistory.org/ for more information.\n\n\u201cWe want people to learn about our local history, the almshouse, and the people that lived here. It develops a closer bond and appreciation for the community we all live in,\u201d Cumberledge said."

The discovery, announced on Thursday in a paper in the journal Science, is direct evidence that different kinds of human relatives, with distinct anatomies and gaits, inhabited the same place at the same time, the paper\u2019s authors say.\n\nIt also raises questions about the extent of the species\u2019 interactions with each other.\n\n\u201cThey might have walked by one another,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, an evolutionary anthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh who led the study. \u201cThey might have looked up in the distance and seen another member of a closely related species, occupying the same landscape.\u201d\n\nBased on skeletal remains found in the region, Dr. Hatala\u2019s team attributed the footprints to Paranthropus boisei and Homo erectus, two types of hominins, the group consisting of our human lineage and closely related species. Paranthropus boisei had smaller brains along with wide, flat faces and massive teeth and chewing muscles; Homo erectus more closely resembled modern human proportions and are thought to be our direct ancestors."

            "article_content": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key tool in scientific discovery, opening up new avenues for research and accelerating the pace of innovation. Among the various AI technologies, Graph AI and Generative AI are particularly useful for their potential to transform how scientists approach complex problems. Individually, each of these technologies has already made significant contributions across diverse fields such as drug discovery, material science, and genomics. But when combined, they create an even more powerful tool for solving some of science\u2019s most challenging questions. This article explores how these technologies work and combined to drive scientific discoveries.\n\nWhat Are Graph AI and Generative AI?\n\nLet\u2019s start by breaking down these two technologies.\n\nGraph AI: The Power of Connections\n\nGraph AI works with data represented as networks, or graphs. Think of nodes as entities\u2014like molecules or proteins\u2014and edges as the relationships between them, such as interactions or similarities. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a subset of AI models that excel at understanding these complex relationships. This makes it possible to spot patterns and gain deep insights.\n\nGraph AI is already being used in:\n\nDrug discovery: Modeling molecule interactions to predict therapeutic potential.\n\nModeling molecule interactions to predict therapeutic potential. Protein folding: Decoding the complex shapes of proteins, a long-standing challenge.\n\nDecoding the complex shapes of proteins, a long-standing challenge. Genomics: Mapping how genes and proteins relate to diseases to uncover genetic insights.\n\nGenerative AI: Creative Problem-Solving\n\nGenerative AI models, like large language models (LLMs) or diffusion models, can create entirely new data including text, images, or even chemical compounds. They learn patterns from existing data and use that knowledge to generate novel solutions.\n\nKey applications include:\n\nDesigning new molecules for drugs that researchers might not have thought of.\n\nfor drugs that researchers might not have thought of. Simulating biological systems to better understand diseases or ecosystems.\n\nto better understand diseases or ecosystems. Suggesting fresh hypotheses based on existing research.\n\nWhy Combine These Two?\n\nGraph AI is great at understanding connections, while Generative AI focuses on generating new ideas. Together, they offer powerful tools for addressing scientific challenges more effectively. Here are a few examples of their combined impact.\n\n1. Speeding Up Drug Discovery\n\nDeveloping new medicines can take years and cost billions of dollars. Traditionally, researchers test countless molecules to find the right one, which is both time-consuming and expensive. Graph AI helps by modeling molecule interactions, narrowing down potential candidates based on how they compare to existing drugs.\n\nGenerative AI boosts this process by creating entirely new molecules designed to specific needs, like binding to a target protein or minimizing side effects. Graph AI can then analyze these new molecules, predicting how effective and safe they might be.\n\nFor example, in 2020, researchers used these technologies together to identify a drug candidate for treating fibrosis. The process took just 46 days\u2014a huge improvement over the years it usually takes.\n\n2. Solving Protein Folding\n\nProteins are the building blocks of life, but understanding how they fold and interact remains one of the hardest scientific challenges. Graph AI can model proteins as graphs, mapping atoms as nodes and bonds as edges, to analyze how they fold and interact.\n\nGenerative AI can build on this by suggesting new protein structures that might have useful features, like the ability to treat diseases. A breakthrough came with DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold used this approach to solve many protein-folding problems. Now, the combination of Graph AI and Generative AI is helping researchers design proteins for targeted therapies.\n\n3. Advancing Materials Science\n\nMaterials science looks for new materials with specific properties, like stronger metals or better batteries. Graph AI helps model how atoms in a material interact and predicts how small changes can improve its properties.\n\nGenerative AI takes things further by suggesting completely new materials. These might have unique properties, like better heat resistance or improved energy efficiency. Together, these technologies are helping scientists create materials for next-generation technologies, such as efficient solar panels and high-capacity batteries.\n\n4. Uncovering Genomic Insights\n\nIn genomics, understanding how genes, proteins, and diseases are connected is a big challenge. Graph AI maps these complex networks, helping researchers uncover relationships and identify targets for therapy.\n\nGenerative AI can then suggest new genetic sequences or ways to modify genes to treat diseases. For example, it can propose RNA sequences for gene therapies or predict how genetic changes might affect a disease. Combining these tools speeds up discoveries, bringing us closer to cures for complex diseases like cancer and genetic disorders.\n\n5. Knowledge Discovery from Scientific Research\n\nA recent study by Markus J. Buehler demonstrates how a combination of Graph AI and Generative AI can discover knowledge from scientific research. They used these methods to analyze over 1,000 papers on biological materials. By building a knowledge graph of concepts like material properties and relationships, they uncovered surprising connections. For instance, they found structural similarities between Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony and certain biological materials.\n\nThis combination then helps them to create a new material\u2014a mycelium-based composite modeled after Kandinsky\u2019s artwork. This material combined strength, porosity, and chemical functionality, showing how AI can spark innovations across disciplines.\n\nChallenges and What\u2019s Next\n\nDespite their potential, Graph AI and Generative AI have challenges. Both need high-quality data, which can be hard to find in areas like genomics. Training these models also requires a lot of computing power. However, as AI tools improve and data becomes more accessible, these technologies will only get better. We can expect them to drive breakthroughs across numerous scientific disciplines.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe combination of Graph AI and Generative AI is already changing the way scientists approach their work. From speeding up drug discovery to designing new materials and unlocking the mysteries of genomics, these technologies are enabling faster, more creative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in science. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more breakthroughs, making it an exciting time for researchers and innovators alike. The fusion of these two AI technologies is just the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery."

Bonus bets can be split into multiple wagers. \u2696\ufe0f FanDuel legal states AZ, CO, CT, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, MS (retail), NC, NJ, NY, NV, OH, PA, TN, VA, VT, WA, WV, WY and Washington, D.C. \u2705 Last verified Nov. 28, 2024\n\nFanDuel promo code: How to claim your bonuses\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook delivers an awesome two-part bonus that gives long after it is claimed.\n\nFirst, all new users will receive a free three-month trial of NBA League Pass, which allows customers to watch all out-of-market NBA games.\n\nSecond, all new users who win their first bet of at least $5 can claim an extra $150 sportsbook bonus.\n\nHere are the steps required to claim this offer:\n\nClick on our FanDuel promo code to access the registration page and press \u201cJoin Now.\u201d Add your information to the required fields. If you register using our link, no promo code is necessary. Make your first deposit using one of the banking options given. Place your first wager of at least $5.\n\nIf your wager wins, you\u2019ll receive the $150 bonus in a lump sum. You can use the bonus all at once or divide it into increments.

Yes, you have to win to get $150 in bonus bets, but you don\u2019t have to win a toss-up wager.\n\nInstead, you could wager on a moneyline or an alternate point spread.\n\nFor instance, Dallas is favored by 3.5 points over the Giants. Don\u2019t bet on the Cowboys at -3.5. Bet on the Cowboys\u2019 moneyline at -215 odds. You won\u2019t win as much with your $5 wager, but that\u2019s not the biggest goal with this welcome offer. You just want to win any bet to get the $150 in bonus bets.\n\nFanDuel even offers alternate point spreads with extremely short odds. You could wager on the Cowboys +10.5 at -1600 odds. Surely the Giants cannot beat Dallas by more than 10 points, right? At FanDuel, you can go as high as Cowboys +22.5.\n\nNothing in sports betting is guaranteed but this is a great strategy for a one-time situation like this."

With seven apps falling under the VPN category, this year\u2019s trends underline an important shift toward privacy-focused and secure connectivity solutions.\n\nThe surge in VPN downloads reflects a growing demand for tools that offer security and privacy, especially in regions such as Russia, Ukraine, and South Korea, where users seek reliable and secure access to the internet.\n\nHamachi led as the most downloaded security app, with 748,102 downloads, a 7.9% increase from 2023.
