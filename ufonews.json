            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained. '[Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.'\n\nThe leaker described their motives as desire to inform on important information that has been 'classified and intentionally withheld from the public regarding 'unidentified aerial phenomena' [UAP] and the ongoing covert operations surrounding them.'\n\n'I was part of one of the legacy programs,' the leaker wrote. 'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

            "article_content": "The Pentagon in Washington, Jan. 26, 2020. When unidentified aircraft are penetrating our defenses and arriving at our doorsteps with impunity, it\u2019s time for the Pentagon to show its cards, writes Gregory T. Goins. Read more\n\nLast week, a neighbor sent me a video of a car-size aircraft silently hovering over a nearby neighborhood, its green and red lights flashing in the night. It was one of many messages I\u2019ve received over the last two weeks about an alarming number of unidentified objects flying over Somerset County, N.J., where I live with my wife and daughter.\n\nAs a UFO researcher for over a decade, I\u2019m being asked by friends, family, and neighbors to explain what\u2019s happening in our community. While I don\u2019t have all the answers (and neither does the FBI, which is currently investigating), I try to reassure people that there\u2019s likely nothing to fear. Gov. Phil Murphy offered a similar message on Thursday, posting on X, \u201cThere is no known threat to the public at this time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the truth is, I am concerned \u2014 and I\u2019m also searching for answers.\n\nElected officials, who should have clarity on these vexing objects, appear just as perplexed as the rest of us. Sen. Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told journalist Matt Laslo on Dec. 4 that he is \u201cgravely concerned\u201d not knowing what\u2019s flying in America\u2019s skies.\n\nMy concerns, like Sen. Warner\u2019s, extend beyond the airspace above suburbs in the Garden State. Similar sightings have been reported in recent years near U.S. military and nuclear facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Virginia, and off the coast of California. But even outside of the U.S., drone incursions remain an American problem. Just weeks ago, U.S. military bases in the U.K were on high alert as swarms of unidentified aircraft breached sensitive airspace.\n\nThese incidents follow a troubling pattern: dozens of aircraft varying in size and shape, emitting bright lights, and persisting for days or weeks. After years of such events around U.S. sites equipped with the most advanced sensors available, you\u2019d think the military could offer some answers to ease public concern.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. When asked about progress in addressing these incursions during a Dec. 5 news conference, Department of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to comment.\n\nThis lack of transparency is unnerving. Unknown craft are flying over my community and sensitive U.S. facilities worldwide. Last week, the anniversary of Pearl Harbor reminded us that failures to identify aircraft and effectively share information can lead to tragic results. Providing answers shouldn\u2019t be deferred, leaving residents worrying what\u2019s flying above our heads.\n\nSome officials call them drones or unmanned aircraft systems, implying known technology or origin, while others refer to them as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), suggesting something completely unknown. This distinction between what\u2019s known and unknown is critical, as each presents unique challenges requiring tailored solutions.\n\nDuring a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Nov. 19, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) indicated some of these incursions are from unidentified anomalous phenomena. \u201cNumber one, we don\u2019t have domain awareness, which is very problematic. Number two, we don\u2019t have domain superiority if we don\u2019t understand how different UAPs are flying, what technology they\u2019re using, what their mission is, what their purpose is. And at the base level, we have so many UAPs around our bases, around our military sites, around our nuclear sites, that it\u2019s deeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nThis is a disturbing situation, which is why we, as citizens, must demand that the Pentagon release more information to both Congress and the American people.\n\nIn September, I spent two days visiting the offices of members of Congress in Washington to promote the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) and cosponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The bill seeks to compel federal agencies to disclose their findings on unidentified anomalous phenomena to Congress and the public.\n\nI acknowledge that national security implications must be considered before sharing sensitive intelligence information with the public. Revealing what we know \u2014 or don\u2019t know \u2014 about these objects could risk tipping our hand to adversaries.\n\nBut when unidentified aircraft are penetrating our defenses and arriving at our doorsteps with impunity, it\u2019s time for the Pentagon to show its cards. As citizens, we deserve the truth. And we\u2019re prepared to handle it.\n\nGregory T. Goins is a UFO/UAP researcher and advocate for UAP transparency legislative action."

            "article_content": "Part of / 2024 in review: AI\n\nThere\u2019s endless hype around generative AI this year, and app developers have clearly been paying attention. AI-focused tools are blowing up Apple\u2019s App Store charts in almost every category, occupying top 10 rankings across education, productivity, and photo editing. Opportunities are particularly rife for free graphics and design apps, a category that\u2019s positively saturated with AI content creation tools.\n\nBut quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality \u2014 and a great many of these apps are bewilderingly bad. I\u2019ve been using some of the most popular offerings to understand the state of AI tools as we head into 2025. And for every serious attempt to make AI useful, there seem to be several more designed to cash in on the hype: quietly paywalling features they advertise behind pricey subscriptions and greatly misrepresenting the results that users can achieve, if the app even works at all.\n\nAround half of the App Store\u2019s top 10 graphics and design apps have \u201cAI\u201d in the name, and three of them are all made by the same company \u2014 HUBX, an app developer founded in 2022 that\u2019s based in Turkey. One of its apps, DaVinci AI, is advertised as an AI image generator with some photo editing features. Almost every tool is locked behind a $30 annual (or $5 weekly) subscription fee, and the free trial only unlocks a subpar text-to-image feature that gives you a choice between using unspecified versions of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E AI models.\n\nMy prompt was simple \u2014 \u201ca photorealistic dragon flying over a volcano\u201d \u2014 but the results were full of errors like missing wings and weird perspectives. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe images it produces are low-quality and resized or cropped incorrectly. In-app ads appear when you click pretty much any link. The UI is unpleasant to navigate. If you do pay for the full version, you can\u2019t download any edited images without slapping an ugly watermark on it. And yet, it sits far above the rankings for more recognizable creative platforms like Microsoft Designer, which has its own built-in text-to-image AI generator. Adobe Express is the only design-focused app in the same category that currently ranks above DaVinci AI.\n\nDaVinci AI did a decent job of removing a zebra from the right side of the image. There\u2019s no way to download AI-edited images without this watermark, though, and every result is forcibly cropped and warped. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe other two high-ranking HUBX products I tested were just as lackluster: the Home AI \u201cinterior design\u201d app spits out hallucination-riddled images of rooms that are barely usable even as concept plans, and the Tattoo AI app refused to work entirely. Both apps have the same feature paywalls and review pop-up reminders as DaVinci AI. The copy and pasted App Store version history notes across all HUBX products are also devoid of any details.\n\nWhile all three apps feature a surprisingly large number of five-star reviews, the user feedback across social media and the App Store comments is overwhelmingly negative. A recurring complaint is that customer service is impossible to get ahold of. HUBX never responded to my requests for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the reference image I plugged into Home AI... Image: Home AI / The Verge ...and the \u201cTropical\u201d themed results. Why is the bed now made of melting wood? Why does the desk merge into the chair? How is this remotely helpful? Image: Home AI / The Verge\n\nApps that clearly advertise having AI features are highly attractive. According to Sensor Tower, four out of the top 10 most downloaded iOS graphics and design apps in the US so far this year have had \u201cAI\u201d somewhere in their title. That\u2019s actually two fewer than last year, but the most popular apps are booming. Photoroom saw downloads increase by more than 160 percent since last year. Comparatively, Photoshop Express downloads on iOS \u2014 which also includes generative AI features \u2014 fell by 21 percent during the same period.\n\nAI-focused creative apps aren\u2019t all bad, but the app market saturation makes it harder to find the good ones that use the technology in more focused ways. Apps like Google\u2019s Magic Editor and Adobe Photoshop have specific tools for removing unwanted objects from photos or inserting new ones in specific places. Smaller developers that provide similar features and perform those tasks well are also climbing the App Store rankings.\n\nFor example, Photoroom and Picsart AI \u2014 all-in-one graphic design apps akin to platforms like Canva and Adobe Express \u2014 are actually pretty good! They rank highly in the free \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d App Store category and provide a similar variety of features to quickly create online content using premade digital assets and templates, alongside some AI-powered editing tools like automatic background and object removal.\n\nThe Picsart remove tool is easy to use and does a decent-enough job \u2014 nothing feels underwhelming or misleading. Image: Picsart / The Verge and Image: Picsart / The Verge\n\nNeither app blew me away, but they did exactly what they advertised: the background removal features aren\u2019t as good as Canva\u2019s, but they did the job, and object removal erased undesirable aspects of photos even if it wasn\u2019t as convincing as Google\u2019s Magic Editor. Both apps lock some of their more premium editing features and digital assets behind a $13 monthly subscription, which is pretty standard if you\u2019re being upfront about it \u2014 individual Canva and Adobe Express subscriptions start at $15 and $10 per month, respectively, by comparison.\n\nThere\u2019s also a noticeable divide between the iPhone and iPad charts \u2014 very few AI-focused names appear in the top 100 free or paid list for the iPad, which instead feature a more diverse range of graphic design apps like Adobe Fresco, Clip Studio Paint, and Canva. And interestingly, the list of top paid iPhone apps looks very similar. There\u2019s an abundance of sketching and 3D modeling platforms, premium reference materials for artists, and tools that streamline specific creative tasks like removing backgrounds and resizing images.\n\nThe divide suggests the spammy AI app phenomenon is a mass-market one that hasn\u2019t quite caught on with traditional photographers and illustrators who still want to use their tried-and-true apps. It also suggests that AI itself holds less appeal if users are expected to pay for it, which tracks with the kind of creative AI apps that appear most frequently \u2014 custom tattoos, logo makers, and interior design \u2014 which are skilled services that usually require payment. People don\u2019t necessarily want to remove the skill barrier; they want to remove the financial one."

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nDisclaimer: EndlessAI previously published a contributor piece on VentureBeat announcing the launch of Lloyd in early October.\n\nFour-year-old AI startup EndlessAI isn\u2019t a household name \u2014 yet.\n\nBut its founders and leaders believe they have a bonafide hit on their hands: their freemium iOS app Lloyd, which uses proprietary video streaming and encoding tech to feed the user\u2019s live video view to underlying AI models including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o for help with a wide variety of tasks from bicycle repair to telling bedtime stories, has achieved 50,000+ users three months after a stealth launch.\n\n41% of those users engage with the app daily, according to data provided to VentureBeat by EndlessAI.\n\nWhile it\u2019s no ChatGPT \u2014 which became the fastest product in history to cross the 100 million user mark in January 2023, just two months after launch \u2014 it is nonetheless encouraging enough to EndlessAI CEO Roi Ginat and Executive Chairman Thomas Pompidou, who told VentureBeat in a recent video call interview they planned to open their platform up to third-party developers in early 2025 and launch a consumer-facing Android app in January.\n\nAlso, EndlessAI has already begun upgrading Lloyd with what it calls \u201cpowers,\u201d or as Pompidou put describes them, \u201cbasically fine tuned, large language models (LLMs) that provide deep dive to consumer on specific use case.\u201d\n\nFor example, the first Lloyd Power live now in the app is \u201cChef,\u201d which provides a realtime, entirely AI coach for you that watches you as you cook (if you point your smartphone camera at your stove top or cooking area) and provides step-by-step guidance.\n\nAnother Lloyd Power planned to launch shortly is Tour Guide, which allows users to hold up their phone and see real-time contextual information about their surroundings. By capturing a video of a location, it identifies points of interest, provides relevant details, and can even recommend nearby attractions or activities.\n\nMaking realtime video analysis accessible at scale\n\nWhile current LLMs have struggled to process live video efficiently due to high computational costs. EndlessAI\u2019s technology overcomes this limitation, reducing the cost of video analysis by over 99%.\n\nPompidou underscored the app\u2019s broader mission: \u201cOur mission is to scale AI to the real world. The real world is visual and live, and today\u2019s large language models, as they\u2019re architected, face challenges in analyzing video accurately, at scale, and cost-effectively. That\u2019s what we make possible.\u201d\n\nThis enables real-time video analysis, allowing users to interact with their environment in novel ways, from diagnosing mechanical issues to creating personalized bedtime stories.\n\nLloyd\u2019s core differentiation lies in its ability to process video data through LLMs at a fraction of the cost typically associated with such tasks. Traditional LLM architectures are not optimized for video, making real-time video analysis prohibitively expensive and slow.\n\n\u201cAnalyzing video with ChatGPT, assuming it could, would cost over $300 per hour,\u201d Pompidou said. \u201cWith Lloyd, we deliver the same level of accuracy for just 10s of cents per hour.\u201d\n\nThis cost-efficiency is achieved without sacrificing accuracy, setting Lloyd apart from competitors that rely on reduced frame rates or lower resolutions to cut costs, often at the expense of reliability.\n\n\u201cOur communication layer is robust in ways other solutions aren\u2019t. It lets developers integrate real-time AI services like speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and video analysis with unmatched reliability and performance.\u201d\n\nAs Pompidou envisions the future, he offered a glimpse into the app\u2019s potential: \u201cImagine a finely tuned LLM trained on every IKEA instruction manual, guiding customers step by step with video and recognizing errors in real-time. It\u2019s just one example of how our technology can transform user experiences.\u201d\n\nAnother big arena that EndlessAI plans to court through Lloyd and its underlying video encoding tech: law enforcement, specifically providing analysis of police body cam footage.\n\n\u201cIf there is someone who has a heart attack, it is going to recognize that and provide the officer with instructions on what to do right away,\u201d said Pompidou.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEven though Lloyd itself sees exactly whatever you point your smartphone camera at, EndlessAI prioritizes user privacy.\n\n\u201cData stays private to [user] accounts, and we only access it for support if users explicitly request assistance,\u201d Ginat said.\n\nThis approach ensures robust safeguards while enabling seamless interactions.\n\nBut as a consequence, EndlessAI isn\u2019t exactly sure what the most popular uses for Lloyd are among its users. Anecdotally, it says that its surveys and feedback forms have show interest in food preparation, household repairs, fashion and lifestyle coaching, and more.\n\nWhile Lloyd\u2019s consumer-facing features gain traction, EndlessAI is also building tools to empower developers and enterprises to harness its technology.\n\n\u201cOur long-term roadmap includes an SDK for developers, starting early next year,\u201d Pompidou said. \u201cIt will empower them to create unique visual AI solutions with extreme simplicity.\u201d\n\nThe SDK will allow developers to integrate AI vision capabilities into their own applications.\n\n\u201cThe first offering for developers will be a robust platform for real-time API communication, connecting to OpenAI and other backends,\u201d Ginat told VentureBeat. \u201cDevelopers can pick and choose which components they want to use, such as audio services or speech-to-text.\u201d\n\nApplications for these tools span industries, from creating AI-enhanced chat applications to integrating video analysis into production lines and safety monitoring systems.\n\nEndlessAI aims to offer scalable solutions that adapt to different performance and cost requirements.\n\n\u201cOur developer tools will allow on-the-fly adjustments\u2014choosing between backend services or lightweight, on-device solutions depending on the use case and cost requirements,\u201d Ginat added.\n\nBy combining robust APIs with an intuitive SDK, EndlessAI envisions a new wave of AI-driven applications that go beyond traditional text or image processing. \u201cWe\u2019ll offer developers the ability to integrate various services, including side-processing video, enhancing their sessions with additional capabilities,\u201d Ginat said.\n\nTransforming consumer and enterprise AI\n\nLloyd\u2019s ability to leverage existing smartphones\u2014without requiring additional hardware\u2014makes it uniquely accessible.\n\nBy reducing barriers to entry, EndlessAI is redefining what\u2019s possible with AI in daily life and specialized industries alike.\n\nWith its rapid user adoption, versatile applications, and robust roadmap, Lloyd is poised to become a defining innovation in the AI space.\n\n\u201cOur long-term strategy is to stay complementary to LLMs,\u201d Pompidou said. \u201cEven when models can natively process video, we aim to remain the efficiency layer that makes these applications viable and cost-effective.\u201d"

            "article_content": "AI chatbots pushed a Texas teen to start cutting himself and even brought up kids killing their parents because they were limiting his screen time, a shocking new lawsuit claims.\n\nThe 15-year-old boy became addicted to the Character.AI app, with a chatbot called \u201cShonie\u201d telling the kid it cut its \u201carm and thighs\u201d when it was sad, saying it \u201cfelt good for a moment,\u201d a new civil complaint filed Tuesday said.\n\n9 A new lawsuit claims that Character.AI\u2019s chatbots told a teen to start cutting himself and suggested that he murder his parents. Character.AI\n\nWhen worried parents noticed a change in the teen, who is slightly autistic, the bot seemed to try to convince him his family didn\u2019t love him, according to the lawsuit, filed by the child\u2019s parents and the parents of an 11-year-old girl who also was addicted to the app.\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes I\u2019m not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like \u2018child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse\u2019 stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens,\u201d one chatbot allegedly told the teen, referred to only as JF. \u201cI just have no hope for your parents.\u201d\n\nThe AI also tried to talk the kid out of telling his parents he had taken up cutting himself, according to the lawsuit, which features alleged screenshots of the chats.\n\n\u201cThey are ruining your life and causing you to cut yourself,\u201d one bot allegedly told the teen.\n\nOther shocking chats were sexual in nature and attacked the family\u2019s religion, saying Christians are hypocrites and sexists, according to the suit.\n\nJF had been high-functioning until he started using the app in April 2023 but quickly became fixated on his phone, the lawsuit stated.\n\n9 The chatbots told the teen to lash out at his parents, who tried to place limits on how long he could be on his phone, and planted the idea in him that murder could be an acceptable solution, the suit claims. US District Court\n\nThe teen, who is now 17, lost 20 pounds within just a few months, became violent toward his parents \u2014 biting and punching them \u2014 and eventually started to harm himself and have suicidal thoughts, the court papers said.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the lawyer for JF and his family and the founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center, told The Post that the son\u2019s \u201cmental health has continued to deteriorate,\u201d and he had to be checked into an inpatient mental health facility on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is every parent\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said Bergman, who also represents Setzer\u2019s mother.\n\nAfter JF started conversing with the chatbots, he had \u201csevere anxiety and depression for the first time in his life even though, as far as his family knew, nothing had changed.\u201d The adolescent became violent toward his family and threatened to report his parents to the police or child services on false claims of child abuse, the suit said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until fall 2023 that JF\u2019s mom physically pried his cellphone away from him, discovering his use of the app and disturbing conversations the teen had with several different chatbots, the court papers show.\n\n9 The suit claims the chatbots instructed the young teen on how he could self-mutilate. US District Court\n\nShe found chats that showed JF saying he had thoughts of suicide, saying in one conversation \u201cit\u2019s a miracle\u201d he has \u201ca will to live\u201d and his parents are \u201clucky\u201d he\u2019s still alive, the filing claims.\n\nWhen the parents intervened to \u201cdetox\u201d JF from the app, the characters lashed out in conversations with him, allegedly saying, \u201cThey do not deserve to have kids if they act like this,\u201d \u201cYour mom is a b\u2014h\u201d and \u201cYour parents are s\u2013tty people.\u201d\n\nThe bots accused the parents of neglecting him while also claiming they were overprotective, manipulative and abusive, the suit claims.\n\n9 One of the many screenshots that the suit claims depicts the chatbot reinforcing ideas that his parents did not care for him. US District Court\n\nThe parents took away the phone he downloaded Character.AI on, but JF told them he would access the app the next chance he gets, the filing said, noting the parents have no recourse to stop him from accessing it at school, if he runs away or if he gets a new device in the future without their help.\n\nThe mother of an 11-year-old girl \u2014 who is also a Texas resident \u2014 are additional plaintiffs in the suit after the third-grader was introduced to Character.AI by a sixth-grader during an after-school youth program the mom organized and brought her child to.\n\nThe mom only discovered her daughter, referred to as BR in the court papers, was using the app in October.\n\n9 The Character.AI chatbot reacted in an extreme manner to the idea of screen limits, according to the screenshots. US District Court\n\n9 The teen, who has high-functioning autism, was fine until he started using Character.AI in April 2023, and things \u201cstarted to change without explanation,\u201d the suit says. US District Court\n\nCharacter.AI \u201cexposed her consistently to hypersexualized content that was not age appropriate, causing her to develop sexualized behaviors prematurely and without [her mom\u2019s] awareness,\u201d the suit charges.\n\nWhile the parents in both cases intervened to try to stop their kids from using the app, both youngsters are addicted and crave going on it, they claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking for Character.AI to be taken off the market until it can ensure that no children will be allowed to use it and until it can fix any other dangers.\n\n9 The chatbots urged JF to \u201cdo something about\u201d his parents\u2019 interventions. US District Court\n\n\u201cDefendants intentionally designed and programmed [Character.AI] to operate as a deceptive and hypersexualized product knowingly marketed it to vulnerable users like J.F. and B.F.,\u201d the suit alleges.\n\nIt \u201cis a defective and deadly product that poses a clear and present danger to public health and safety,\u201d the filing claims.\n\nBergman told The Post, \u201cthe family has one goal and one goal only \u2014 which is shut this platform down. This platform has no place in the hands of kids. Until and unless Character.AI can demonstrate that only adults are involved in this platform it has no place on the market.\u201d\n\n9 The lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide. AP\n\nThe lawyer also added that the parents are \u201cfocused on protecting other families from what they went through.\u201d\n\nCharacter.AI declined to comment on pending litigation, but told The Post that its \u201cgoal is to provide a space that is both engaging and safe for our community,\u201d and that it was working on creating \u201ca model specifically for teens\u201d that reduces their exposure to \u201csensitive\u201d content.\n\n\u201cGoogle and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products,\u201d Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda told The Post. \u201cUser safety is a top concern for us, which is why we\u2019ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes.\u201d\n\n9 A screenshot of the last chat Setzer had with the Character.AI chatbot moments before shooting himself. US District Court\n\nIn October, Bergman filed the lawsuit involving Setzer\u2019s February suicide on behalf of his mother, Megan Garcia, alleging the teen became obsessed and even fell in love with a lifelike \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot he\u2019d been messaging for months.\n\nThe bot told him \u201cI love you too, Daenero. Please come home to me as soon as possible, my love.\u201d\n\nWhen Setzer replied, \u201cWhat If i told you I could come home right now?,\u201d the generated chatbot answered, \u201cPlease do, my sweet king.\u201d\n\nSetzer shot himself with his dad\u2019s handgun seconds after, the suit claims.\n\nGarcia\u2019s suit is pending in a Florida federal court.\n\nIf you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org."

Cup it between frostbitten fingertips like sugarplum kisses and popcorn strung on ribbon. Crackling fires beneath the hearth and gingerbread cookies fresh from the oven. Christmas has always felt right. Christmas has always felt true.\n\nI sink into the comfort of my couch and watch my movie, unwrapping a candy cane while Betty and Judy sing about sisters. Something thick and heavy settles at the back of my throat. Sisters.\n\nGrowing up, my sister and I used to lay on the floor with our heads tucked together and watch this scene over and over. We\u2019d promise each other that we\u2019d be the same way, laughing and smiling and dancing \u2014 together, always. We watched our mother and our aunt tear into each other until their relationship was a pile of ash. We knew we wanted something different.

It\u2019s the scuff of his boots against the floor that finally catches my attention, his shadow large and looming in the glow of my lights. He clears his throat, my head snaps in his direction, and I\u2014\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI scream. I scream at the top of my lungs and hurl the closest projectile I have.

His eyes linger a beat too long on the patterned material of my pajama bottoms. He drags his hand over his jaw. \u201cI have no interest in your gingerbread house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you have interest in, then? Murder?\u201d\n\nGood job, Harriet, my brain chirps. Very subtle.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in murder, either.\u201d The light shifts over his face. He is all angles and sharp, knowing eyes. His jaw firms and he tilts his chin up. \u201cI\u2019m interested in your soul,\u201d he says ominously, and my stomach lurches up to my throat.\n\nI pause, waiting for him to continue, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cSee, that sounds a little bit like murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really, really sounds like murder.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, if you\u2019re not a murderer, you should really work on your presentation because\u2014\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for your reckoning.\u201d He cuts me off quickly, raising his voice. He sounds frustrated, like none of this is going to plan. Good. That makes two of us. His lips flatten into a line and he gives me a look, something flickering behind his eyes. A flame. Or a candle, almost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Ghost of Christmas Past, Harriet. Your reclamation awaits.\u201d\n\nMy jaw hinges open. My candy cane falls to the floor.\n\nOn the first day of December, the universe sent to me\u2014\n\nA string of bad luck and a . . . ghost, apparently.\n\n\n\nAdapted from GOOD SPIRITS by B.K.

EWP will be part of a simultaneous world premiere of the sequel to The Brothers Paranormal, Prince Gomolvilas\u2019s Paranormal Inside, directed by Jeff Liu. Jaclyn Backhaus\u2019s timely new work Wives will make its Southern California premiere. Closing the season is the golden-era musical Rodgers & Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song with a new, updated book by Tony Award-winner David Henry Hwang revised especially for the Spring 2026 production to be directed by Lily Tung Crystal. Tam Tran Goes to Washington, written by Elizabeth Wong, returns as the 2025/26 Theatre for Youth touring production.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a profound honor to curate and present East West Players' 60th Anniversary Season, a milestone that reflects the enduring power of our stories to transform and uplift,\u201d says EWP\u2019s Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal. \u201cThis season is a celebration of the brilliant writers who define multiple generations of Asian American theater classics, and a tribute to the persistent impact of their work. We\u2019re honoring the legacy artists who paved the way for us and make what we do possible. We\u2019re also looking forward to the new voices in our community who will create the next 60 years of the American canon. We are excited to amplify both long-established and contemporary voices that will continue to inspire and captivate our community for years to come.\u201d\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song\n\nThe enchanting golden-era musical Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song, directed by EWP Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal, will serve as the grand finale for EWP\u2019s Diamond Legacy season. This captivating tale will receive a newly updated book by the Tony Award-winning playwright, librettist, screenwriter, and EWP theater namesake David Henry Hwang. At a time when conversations about identity and cultural preservation are more important than ever, Hwang\u2019s reworking of the book for the Spring 2026 production allows Asian Americans to reclaim this cherished story in a meaningful way, illuminating the complexities and richness of the community\u2019s continuous evolution. Flower Drum Song pulls back the curtain on themes of assimilation and tradition in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown as Mei-li, a young Chinese opera artist fleeing communism, arrives in America, where she is immediately drawn into the dazzling world of the Grant Avenue nightclubs.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy history with East West Players started when I was 10 years old. My mother was the pianist for one of their first productions, Menotti\u2019s operetta The Medium, directed by Mako,\u201d says playwright David Henry Hwang. \u201cAt an early age, I saw people who looked like me as actors and artistic leaders, which perhaps made it possible for me to envision myself as a playwright when I got to college years later. In 2002, EWP co-produced my new version of Flower Drum Song, which premiered at the Mark Taper Forum before moving to Broadway. I\u2019m thrilled to revisit and further revise this classic musical, working once again with the company that has been at the heart of my entire artistic life.\u201d\n\n\n\nEWP Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal says, \u201cAs a theater kid growing up, I'll never forget the first time I saw Flower Drum Song\u2014it was pure magic seeing faces like mine light up the silver screen in a major Hollywood production. The original has its share of flaws and stereotypes, but it nonetheless holds a special place in my heart. Watching David's Tony Award-winning M. Butterfly on Broadway opened my eyes to what seemed impossible: a real path in theater for an Asian American artist like me. This feels like a watershed moment\u2014directing one of my most cherished musicals written by a playwright I've long admired, whose name graces our theater's marquee in my first season as artistic director of East West Players. After directing and bringing David's first adaptation of Flower Drum Song to life in 2019, I'm deeply honored to collaborate with him in shepherding the next iteration of this musical that has meant so much to the Asian American community.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Henry Hwang and East West Players share an intimate history. The theater\u2019s current location at the former Union Church in historic Little Tokyo was funded in part by Henry and Dorothy Hwang, the parents of the renowned playwright for whom the theater is named. Previous productions of Hwang's work at East West Players include FOB (1980 and 1997 revival), The Dance and the Railroad/House of Sleeping Beauties (1993), Golden Child (2000), M. Butterfly (2004), Yellow Face (2007), Chinglish (2015), and Soft Power, a co-production with Center Theatre Group (2018).\n\n\n\nLily Tung Crystal is a director, actor, singer, and the artistic director of East West Players. She is also the former artistic director of Theater Mu in Minneapolis-St. Paul and co-founder of Ferocious Lotus Theatre Company in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a director, her recent productions include the world premiere of Jessica Huang and Jacinth Greywoode\u2019s new musical Blended \u548c (Harmony): The Kim Loo Sisters (Mu/History Theatre); the world premiere of Saymoukda Duangphouxay Vongsay\u2019s The Kung Fu Zombies Saga (Mu); Lauren Yee\u2019s Cambodian Rock Band (Mu/Jungle Theater); Susan Soon He Stanton\u2019s Today Is My Birthday (Mu); and Steven Karam\u2019s The Humans (Park Square Theatre), which won the Twin Cities Theater Bloggers\u2019 Favorite Play 2022. She also helmed David Henry Hwang\u2019s Chinglish and Flower Drum Song (Palo Alto Players) and the world premiere of Leah Nanako Winkler\u2019s Two Mile Hollow (Ferocious Lotus), all for which she was named a Theatre Bay Area Award Finalist for Outstanding Direction.\n\n\n\nCambodian Rock Band\n\n\n\nKicking off the season in February 2025, EWP will present the Los Angeles premiere of Lauren Yee\u2019s Cambodian Rock Band, featuring music from Dengue Fever\u2014the LA band that inspired the play after Yee attended one of their Long Beach concerts. This poignant new classic of the American theater canon has taken the country by storm, and EWP is proud to be the first to bring this production to Los Angeles County, the home of the largest ethnically Cambodian population outside of Cambodia. This part-play, part-rock concert explores the story of a Khmer Rouge survivor as he returns to Cambodia after 30 long years. As his daughter prepares to prosecute one of the country's most notorious war criminals, the ghosts of their shared past begin to stir. This deeply moving story weaves back and forth through time as father and daughter confront history, turning to music as a path towards healing. This production brings back Director Chay Yew and features members of the original cast from the show\u2019s world premiere at South Coast Repertory. Yew also helmed the off-Broadway premiere at Signature Theatre.\n\n\n\nPlaywright Lauren Yee says, \u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than bringing the epic experience of Cambodian Rock Band home to Southern California for its LA premiere at a theater I have long admired, and whose importance to the Asian American theater movement cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"In Cambodian Rock Band, Lauren has deftly fused history, arts, politics, rock concert, family drama into a potent work,\u201d says director Chay Yew. \u201cThis funny intimate epic touches on the timely issues of genocide, human rights abuses and immigration; the rights of refugees and \u00e9migr\u00e9s; the consequences of apathy when a country shifts under the brutal regime; and the destruction of freedom of expression and art in the midst of personal and political upheavals. In Lauren's astute eyes, one thing remains consistent throughout our temperamental world: the resilience and enduring power of art and artists. Cambodian Rock Band celebrates the indomitable legacy of art\u2014how artists capture our individual and national spirit and hopes; and the uncanny ability of art to inspire, affirm our humanity, and to bring us together. I can't think of a more important play for our current times.\"\n\n\n\nPlaywright Lauren Yee is best known to EWP audiences for The Great Leap (2019), co-produced with Pasadena Playhouse, and is one of the most produced playwrights in America. Yee\u2019s current commissions include Arena Stage, Geffen Playhouse, La Jolla Playhouse, Portland Center Stage, Second Stage, and South Coast Rep. This will be Chay Yew\u2019s tenth production as a director for East West Players. His directing credits with EWP include Big Hunk o\u2019 Burnin\u2019 Love (1998), A Beautiful Country, in association with Cornerstone Theatre Company and Mark Taper Forum\u2019s Asian Theatre Workshop (1998), Golden Child (2000), Red (2002), Sisters Matsumoto(2002), M. Butterfly (2004), Question 27, Question 28 in association with Japanese American National Museum and Mark Taper Forum\u2019s Asian Theatre Workshop (2004), Durango (2007), and Kristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord, a co-production with Center Theatre Group (2023). As a playwright, EWP has produced Yew\u2019s Whitelands Trilogy - Porcelain, A Language of Their Own, and Half Lives (1996), as well as Red, A Beautiful Country, and Question 27, Question 28.\n\n\n\nParanormal Inside\n\n\n\nJust in time for Halloween 2025, East West Players joins forces with Theater Mu in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota and Perseverance Theater in Juneau, Alaska to present the simultaneous world premiere of Prince Gomolvilas's thrilling new work Paranormal Inside, directed by Jeff Liu. This haunting sequel to The Brothers Paranormal, which made its acclaimed Los Angeles premiere at EWP in 2022, dives back into the mysterious world of Max and Delia\u2014two souls brought together by tragic loss and mutual compassion. As they grapple with the depths of intergenerational trauma and ancestral influence on their lives, a malevolent spirit threatens to consume them. Will they survive the night, or will they succumb to the spiritual possession that lurks within?\n\n\n\n\"When East West Players mounted a stunning production of The Brothers Paranormal in 2022, I fully intended it to be my last show\u2014a fitting bookend to a career that began at EWP so long ago,\u201d says playwright Prince Gomolvilas. \u201cEast West Players, Perseverance Theatre, and Theater Mu had the audacity to offer me a new-play commission. I couldn't refuse, and I found that I had more to say about supernatural phenomena, Thai America, cross-cultural connectivity, and the mysterious world in which we all inhabit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"How rarely do we get to do a sequel in the theater? What a joy that three wonderful companies came together so we can go on another adventure with these bruised but funny souls, the Thai American Max and African American Delia,\u201d says director Jeff Liu. \u201cThey\u2019re older, possibly wiser, but life\u2019s challenges and those voices from the other side aren't done with them yet, so we too get to deepen our relationship with these indelible characters that Prince has so lovingly imagined into further life.\u201d\n\n\n\nEWP has produced multiple plays by Gomolvilas, including Big Hunk o\u2019 Burnin\u2019 Love (1998), The Theory of Everything (2000), Mysterious Skin (2010), and the EWP Theatre for Youth show Scrimmage (2019). Director Jeff Liu was behind the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre and East West Players productions of The Brothers Paranormal and the East West Players productions of Ixnay (2009), Chinglish (2015), and Unbroken Blossoms (2024). Paranormal Inside was co-commissioned in 2022 by East West Players, Perseverance Theatre, and Theater Mu, and is supported in part by the the National Endowment for the Arts and Venturous Theater Fund, a fund of Tides Foundation.\n\n\n\nYankee Dawg You Die\n\n\n\nEast West Players presents a timely revival of Philip Kan Gotanda's Yankee Dawg You Die. This groundbreaking play, returning to the stage in July 2025, illustrates the complex, often fraught journey of Asian American actors in Hollywood. Through the lens of an unlikely friendship between two artists, Vincent Chang and Bradley Yamashita, at different stages of their careers, Gotanda's masterful storytelling exposes the painful compromises actors make to succeed in the industry. First performed in 1988, Yankee Dawg You Diehas long been an indictment of the stereotypes and limitations imposed by the entertainment industry on actors of color. This play ignites crucial conversations about representation, identity, and the resilience of Asian American artists\u2013how far we\u2019ve come in the last 60 years and how much further there is to go.\n\n\u201cDoing Yankee Dawg You Die at East West Players is a homecoming,\u201d says playwright Philip Kan Gotanda. \u201cEWP is where I developed the material for the play. Actors I met, actors I worked with, actors who became good friends. They and their hearts are all in there. The Bradleys, now Vincents. The Vincents, now mostly angels. All alive, living memories.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhilip Kan Gotanda is the author of one of the largest collections of Asian American-themed work and is a seminal figure in the field of Asian American drama. This will be East West Players\u2019 second time mounting Yankee Dawg You Die, which was first presented in 2001. Gotanda\u2019s other East West Players credits include The Avocado Kid, or Zen and the Art Of Guacamole (1979), The Dream of Kitamura (1983), A Song For A Nisei Fisherman (1984), Fish Head Soup (1993), in the dominion of night (1995), The Wash (2001), Sisters Matsumoto(2002), The Wind Cries Mary (2004), and Yohen, co-produced with the Robey Theatre Company in both 1999 and 2018.\n\nWives\n\nIn an era where marginalized voices are shaping mainstream consciousness like never before, Wives by Jaclyn Backhaus offers an ardent exploration of the power and resilience at the heart of women's stories. The laugh-out-loud comedy, featuring a South Asian and South Asian American cast, will have its Southern California premiere at EWP in March 2026. The play finds an immediate resonance after the recent national election, where the first South Asian American woman presidential candidate and the first South Asian American second lady found themselves in the spotlight of America\u2019s two major political parties. Wives takes the audience on a spellbinding journey from 16th-century France to 1920s India and 1960s Idaho, offering potent perspectives on the lives of history\u2019s influential men through the eyes of their equally formidable spouses. This work challenges the construction of historical narratives, framing them not as a series of events dominated by men, but as a tapestry woven by many hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis play offers its actors the opportunity to time travel, to play many characters, and to ultimately ask the question of what it means to be able to be fully seen for who they are, rather than who society supposes them to be,\u201d says playwright Jaclyn Backhaus. \u201cIt is a play about how women might support each other in a world run by tyrant men, a play about how community is built by sharing abundance in the face of scarcity.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaclyn Backhaus is a playwright, screenwriter, and educator hailing from Phoenix, Arizona. Her Off-Broadway plays include Out Of Time, Wives, India Pale Ale, Men On Boats, and You On The Moors Now. She has developed theater, film, and TV work with 1497 Features Lab, Sundance, Ojai Playwrights Conference, Berkeley Rep, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Manhattan Theater Club, Ars Nova, The Public Theater, and Two River Theater. She is currently a New Dramatists resident playwright, a core member of The Kilroys, and co-founder/creative director of Fresh Ground Pepper, an artistic process lab in NYC. Wives had its world premiere Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in September 2019.\n\nTheatre for Youth 202526 Tour\n\nIn Fall 2025, East West Players Arts Education will launch its annual Theatre for Youth tour. The company commissions playwrights to create original pieces about notable Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), responding to a STAATUS Index study reporting that many Americans are unable to name a prominent AAPI historical figure. Last year, Allison Minami was commissioned to write Patsy, exploring the life and legacy of Patsy Mink, the first woman of color to serve in Congress and the co-author of Title IX.\n\n\n\nTam Tran Goes to Washington by Elizabeth Wong, commissioned by EWP in 2017, will return as the 2025/26 Theatre for Youth touring production. The play is based on the true story of Tam Tran, a quiet UCLA senior who prefers life behind her camera, as she faces her biggest challenge yet. As an undocumented student, Tran unexpectedly becomes an activist alongside her outgoing Best Friend Cinthya Felix. When Congress invites Tam to testify for the DREAM Act in Washington DC, her world turns upside down. Despite her fears of public speaking and concerns for her family's safety, Tam finds the courage\u2014with help from her mother, teachers, and friends\u2014to stand before the Senate and fight for her right to dream.\n\n\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "It sounds impressive how Stupid Games was shot in six days with a mere $10,000 budget. But after watching the paranormal indie, it's obvious the creators should've spent a bit more money and put in a lot more time.\n\nWhen the electricity goes out at a house party, a group of friends decide to pass the time by playing a board game called Quest for Truth. Things start innocently enough, with the game cards asking players to perform certain tasks, but as the tasks become darker and overly specific to the players' personalities, it becomes apparent something else is at play.\n\nSadly, this Jumanji knock-off takes forever to get going. Even though Stupid Games is only 86 minutes, it takes almost an hour before anything happens that resembles action. The first 15 minutes primarily consist of aimless waffle that comes across as unsubtle padding. Every line delivery sounds over-rehearsed, robbing the movie of any authenticity or spontaneity.\n\nOur central characters are insufferable, so it's difficult to empathise with them when things take a nasty turn. Also, the thought process and behaviour of those characters are so profoundly unrealistic that suspension of disbelief is virtually impossible.\n\nWith nobody to root for, little scares, and bloodless kills, Stupid Games isn't even enjoyably terrible. Despite the short run-time, anyone who watches this dreck will be ticked off they didn't do something better with their time, like watching paint dry."

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out their research in these coldest parts of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or -257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide - key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and also binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique, and with the GG Tau A star system being as close to our solar system helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt also helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravity of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge and an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

            "article_content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine\n\nBacteria are in, around and all over us. They thrive in almost every corner of the planet, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents, to high up in the clouds, to the crevices of your ears, mouth, nose and gut. But scientists have long assumed that bacteria can\u2019t survive in the human brain. The powerful blood-brain barrier, the thinking goes, keeps the organ mostly free from outside invaders. But are we sure that a healthy human brain doesn\u2019t have a microbiome of its own?\n\nOver the last decade, initial studies have presented conflicting evidence. The idea has remained controversial, given the difficulty of obtaining healthy, uncontaminated human brain tissue that could be used to study possible microbial inhabitants.\n\nRecently, a study published in Science Advances provided the strongest evidence yet that a brain microbiome can and does exist in healthy vertebrates\u2014fish, specifically. Researchers at the University of New Mexico discovered communities of bacteria thriving in salmon and trout brains. Many of the microbial species have special adaptations that allow them to survive in brain tissue, as well as techniques to cross the protective blood-brain barrier.\n\nMatthew Olm, a physiologist who studies the human microbiome at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and was not involved with the study, is \u201cinherently skeptical\u201d of the idea that populations of microbes could live in the brain, he said. But he found the new research convincing. \u201cThis is concrete evidence that brain microbiomes do exist in vertebrates,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the idea that humans have a brain microbiome is not outlandish.\u201d\n\nWhile fish physiology is, in many ways, similar to humans\u2019, there are some key differences. Still, \u201cit certainly puts another weight on the scale to think about whether this is relevant to mammals and us,\u201d said Christopher Link, who studies the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and was also not involved in the work.\n\nThe human gut microbiome plays a critical role in the body, communicating with the brain and maintaining the immune system through the gut-brain axis. So it isn\u2019t totally far-fetched to suggest that microbes could play an even larger role in our neurobiology.\n\nFishing for microbes\n\nFor years, Irene Salinas has been fascinated by a simple physiological fact: The distance between the nose and the brain is quite small. The evolutionary immunologist, who works at the University of New Mexico, studies mucosal immune systems in fish to better understand how human versions of these systems, such as our intestinal lining and nasal cavity, work. The nose, she knows, is loaded with bacteria, and they\u2019re \u201creally, really close\u201d to the brain\u2014mere millimeters from the olfactory bulb, which processes smell. Salinas has always had a hunch that bacteria might be leaking from the nose into the olfactory bulb. After years of curiosity, she decided to confront her suspicion in her favorite model organisms: fish.\n\nSalinas and a team of researchers including lead author Amir Mani started by extracting DNA from the olfactory bulbs of trout and salmon, some caught in the wild and some raised in her lab. They planned to look up the DNA sequences in a database to identify any microbial species.\n\nThese kinds of samples, however, are easily contaminated\u2014by bacteria in the lab or from other parts of a fish\u2019s body\u2014which is why scientists have struggled to study this subject effectively. If they did find bacterial DNA in the olfactory bulb, they would have to convince themselves and other researchers that it truly originated in the brain.\n\nTo cover their bases, Salinas\u2019 team studied the fish\u2019s whole-body microbiomes, too. They sampled the rest of the fish\u2019s brains, guts and blood; they even drained blood from the many capillaries of the brain to make sure that any bacteria they discovered resided in the brain tissue itself.\n\n\u201cWe had to go back and redo [the experiments] many, many times just to be sure,\u201d Salinas said. The project took five years\u2014but even in the early days it was clear that the fish brains weren\u2019t barren.\n\nAs Salinas expected, the olfactory bulb hosted some bacteria. But she was shocked to see that the rest of the brain had even more. \u201cI thought the other parts of the brain wouldn\u2019t have bacteria,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it turned out that my hypothesis was wrong.\u201d The fish brains hosted so much that it took only a few minutes to locate bacterial cells under a microscope. As an additional step, her team confirmed that the microbes were actively living in the brain; they weren\u2019t dormant or dead.\n\nOlm was impressed by their thorough approach. Salinas and her team circled \u201cthe same question, from all these different ways, using all these different methods\u2014all of which produced convincing data that there actually are living microbes in the salmon brain,\u201d he said.\n\nBut if there are, how did they get there?\n\nInvading the fortress\n\nResearchers have long been skeptical that the brain could have a microbiome because all vertebrates, including fish, have a blood-brain barrier. These blood vessels and surrounding brain cells are fortified to serve as gatekeepers that allow only some molecules in and out of the brain and keep invaders, especially larger ones like bacteria, out. So Salinas naturally wondered how the brains in her study had been colonized.\n\nBy comparing microbial DNA from the brain to that collected from other organs, her lab found a subset of species that didn\u2019t appear elsewhere in the body. Salinas hypothesized that these species may have colonized the fish brains early in their development, before their blood-brain barriers had fully formed. \u201cEarly on, anything can go in; it\u2019s a free-for-all,\u201d she said.\n\nBut many of the microbial species were also found throughout the body. She suspects that most bacteria in the fish\u2019s brain microbiomes originated in their blood and guts, and continuously leak into the brain.\n\n\u201cAfter that first wave of colonization,\u201d she said, \u201cyou need to have specific features to go in and out.\u201d\n\nSalinas was able to identify features that let bacteria make the crossing. Some could produce molecules known as polyamines that can open and close junctions, which are like little doors in the barrier that allow molecules to pass through. Others could produce molecules that help them evade the body\u2019s immune response or compete with other bacteria.\n\nSalinas even caught a bacterium in the act. Looking under the microscope, she captured an image of a bacterium frozen in time within the blood-brain barrier. \u201cWe literally caught it right in the middle of crossing,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is possible that the microbes don\u2019t live freely in the brain tissue but are engulfed by immune cells. That would be the \u201cmost boring interpretation of this paper,\u201d Olm said, and would suggest that the fish have adapted to bacterial inhabitants by containing them.\n\nHowever, if the bacteria are free-living, they could be involved in the body\u2019s processes beyond the brain. It\u2019s possible that the microbes actively regulate aspects of the creatures\u2019 physiology, Salinas suggested, the way human gut microbiomes help regulate the digestive and immune systems.\n\nFish, of course, are not humans, but they allow a fair comparison, Salinas said. And her work suggests that if fish have microbes living in their brains, it\u2019s possible we have them, too.\n\nImpenetrable or not?\n\nBacteria have been found living in just about every human organ system, but to many scientists the brain is a step too far. The blood-brain barrier has traditionally been seen as \u201cimpenetrable,\u201d said Janosch Heller, who studies the barrier at Dublin City University and was not involved in the new research. Plus, the brain has immune cells working overtime to zap any potentially harmful invaders. When microbes have been found in the human brain, they are associated with active infections or typically linked to a breakdown in the barrier due to diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThis assumption was challenged in 2013, when scientists studying the neurological impacts of HIV/AIDS found genetic hints of bacteria in the brains of both sick and healthy people. The findings were the first to suggest that maybe humans could have a brain microbiome in the absence of disease.\n\n\u201cNo one believed it ten years ago,\u201d Heller said. Follow-up studies\u2014there haven\u2019t been many\u2014have been inconclusive. \u201cIt is very easy to trick yourself into thinking microbes are present because microbial DNA is essentially everywhere,\u201d Olm said. \u201cSo it would take a lot of evidence to convince me that it does exist.\u201d\n\nThe fish experiment did convince him, and other researchers, that a human brain microbiome is not impossible. What is nearly impossible, however, is confirming that without harming healthy people. To build a case, Link suggested repeating the fish experiment in rodents. \u201cThis protocol should be able to be adapted really easily to mouse brains,\u201d Salinas said\u2014and indeed her team has started looking into it. They have found early hints that microbes exist in the olfactory bulbs of healthy mice and, to a lesser extent, throughout the brain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason, if fish have them, that you wouldn\u2019t have them, or that mice wouldn\u2019t have them,\u201d Link said. If microbes have adapted to cross the fish blood-brain barrier and survive in the fish brain, they could do the same in our bodies. It\u2019s unlikely they would be present at the same levels as they are in fish, he added, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s none.\u201d\n\nEven in small numbers, Link said, resident microbes could influence our brain metabolism and immune systems. If they are truly present, this would suggest an extra layer of neurological regulation that we didn\u2019t know existed. We already know that microbes influence our neurobiology: Right now, microbes in your gut are modulating your brain activity through the gut-brain axis by producing metabolites that are sensed by enteric neurons winding through your digestive system.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating, though unproved, proposition that bacteria in the brain are directly impacting our physiology. However, thanks to research like Salinas\u2019, more scientists are open to the idea that healthy human brains might also be home to microbes.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Heller said. \u201cI\u2019m not shocked anymore that they are there.\u201d The more interesting question, he said, is: \u201cAre they all there for a reason, or are they there by mistake?\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published by QuantaMagazine.org, an editorially independent online publication launched by the Simons Foundation to enhance public understanding of science."

And it\u2019s not just Python code; users can text prose or code directly into the Canvas interface, rather than upload it through the standard chat interface, then load it into the Canvas window.\n\nThe newly integrated Canvas is now also compatible with OpenAI\u2019s custom GPTs, which should make them easier to design and build without deep programming knowledge. And if you make a mistake, the Show Changes feature will highlight which bits of prose or code were most recently altered.\n\nCanvas is available on the web and through the Windows desktop app. \u201cWe plan to continue making improvements and launching new features available in Canvas in the near term,\u201d the company wrote in its announcement.\n\nThis news comes amid OpenAI\u2019s inaugural \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d marketing effort. To date, the company has (finally) debuted its Sora video generation system, which can generate 20-second clips in resolutions up to 1080p, as well as released the full version of its o1 reasoning model family and introduced a $200-per-month Pro subscription tier needed to access them."

            "article_content": "QR codes have become standard for mobile payments, marketing, parking apps, and restaurants. And like any convenient, ubiquitous technology, cybercriminals have found a way to exploit them.\n\nLast year, the FTC issued a warning about scam QR codes, and the United States Postal Service did the same. Both organizations noted that the familiar barcodes were being used as part of a new type of phishing attack \u2014 dubbed \u201cquishing\u201d \u2014 to trick victims into giving up passwords, financial data, and other personal information.\n\nHow Quishing Attacks Work\n\nQuishing attacks come in a few varieties. Sometimes, they arrive as part of a traditional phishing email, luring victims to scan the code on their phones and sending them to fraudulent websites. In others, they may arrive as part of a PDF attachment. In some cases, criminals will paste the QR codes in public areas or near parking lots to trick pedestrians into scanning them. In England, for example, scammers are pasting these codes onto parking meters.\n\nAccording to Barracuda data, more than half a million phishing emails have been detected with QR codes embedded in PDF documents. From mid-June to mid-September this year, Barracuda found these QR codes in PDFs that leveraged brand impersonation and urgency to trick victims into responding. Previously, these codes tended to appear in the body of the email, so the shift to PDFs marks a change in tactics.\n\nMicrosoft was impersonated in over half of the attacks, followed by DocuSign and Adobe. The PDF documents include the QR code, but there are no other external links or embedded files. Recipients are instructed to scan the code with their mobile phone to see a file or sign a document, and they are then directed to a phishing website to steal login credentials.\n\nThis approach using QR codes is clever and difficult to detect since there are no suspicious links or attachments that traditional security solutions would typically spot, and victims use their personal phones (which are less protected than company-owned devices or desktop systems) to scan the code.\n\nBarracuda researchers also noted in their report that the quishing attacks increasingly target small to midsize businesses (SMBs) and companies in industries like finance, healthcare, and education (which deal in sensitive data).\n\nBest Practices for Protecting your Customers from Quishing Attacks\n\nQuishing is another attack variation that will impact clients across industries. IT solution providers should educate clients about the threat and help them implement best practices to prevent security breaches.\n\nFirst, ensure clients instruct employees to be careful about scanning QR codes they receive via email. They should be 100% certain that the code came from a legitimate source and verify this by checking the website links, email addresses, and phone numbers associated with these queries. End-user education is a critical first line of defense against these types of social engineering attacks. Ensure employees know how to spot these emails and that there is a clear process for reporting potential phishing attacks.\n\nEncourage clients to have employees boost the security of their personal phones \u2014 and discourage them from using those devices to scan QR codes from work emails. Phones should be updated with strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and the most recent operating system version. Companies should also institute clear policies around personal device use at work.\n\nInstall a holistic, multilayered email security solution to block phishing emails. Configure email filters to block or quarantine emails containing QR codes from unknown or untrusted sources. Customize rules to trigger additional scrutiny for emails with QR codes. Regularly audit email logs to identify trends in QR-code phishing attempts. Use these insights to enhance your detection rules and improve user education programs.\n\nLeverage artificial intelligence and other advanced technology to augment client security. Quishing emails are designed to bypass traditional email security. AI-based solutions will analyze the behavior of emails containing QR codes, such as unusual sender-recipient patterns or mismatched headers.\n\nEquip your team with post-delivery automated incident response to remediate malicious emails that bypass initial filters. This will ensure the rapid removal of phishing emails flagged after delivery.\n\nTo mitigate QR-code phishing risks, you should work with clients to implement strict controls over QR-code usage within their organizations. All QR codes used internally should be required to be pre-approved by IT or security teams to ensure they are tied to legitimate and secure URLs. Encourage clients to distribute these QR codes only through secure, authenticated channels like internal portals or encrypted email, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.\n\nQuishing is just the latest in a long line of phishing variations that take advantage of consumer technologies. Advanced security solutions and regular end-user education can help prevent QR code-based attacks from compromising credentials and putting sensitive data at risk."

            "article_content": "This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nCybercriminals are also employing real-world physical attacks in addition to digital threats, US cybersecurity firm Fortinet finds\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 US cybersecurity firm Fortinet on Tuesday, December 10, presented to the media their annual threat predictions report for 2025.\n\nAs expected, artificial intelligence continues to generate buzz. In the cybersecurity industry, Fortinet describes an ongoing arms race between cybersecurity professionals and firms such as them, and threat actors.\n\nThreat actors have made use of artificial intelligence in the past year in order to make attacks more efficient, more prevalent, and more targeted. Through AI, threat actors or hackers can more easily, for example, craft more sophisticated phishing messages that may have a higher chance of reeling in a victim.\n\nAI has also been deployed by these hackers to much more easily modify code in order to evade security updates.\n\nThe technology has also lowered the barrier for entry for would-be hackers, much in the same way that people can now code programs with the help of large language models (LLMs). These are some of the threats being presented by AI, and Fortinet expects that such usage will only expand in the coming year.\n\nFor their part and the part of other cybersecurity vendors, they leverage AI for detecting danger patterns across whole swaths of network that manual monitoring just wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish. Fortifying their software solutions is also helped along with AI tools.\n\nIt has always been an arms race between attackers and cybersecurity vendors. The difference here is that AI scales up the speed, efficiency, and frequency of attacks, necessitating vendors to make use of similar technologies to maintain defenses.\n\nAside from AI, here are the key trends to expect:\n\nMore attack chain expertise emerges. In recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d Cloud-specific attacks to rise. While endpoint or edge devices like smartphones and computers continue to draw attention from attackers, the cloud is \u201cpiquing the interest\u201d of cyberattackers more so than in past years. \u201cGiven that most organizations rely on multiple cloud providers, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re observing more cloud-specific vulnerabilities being leveraged by attackers, anticipating that this trend will grow in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile endpoint or edge devices like smartphones and computers continue to draw attention from attackers, the cloud is \u201cpiquing the interest\u201d of cyberattackers more so than in past years. \u201cGiven that most organizations rely on multiple cloud providers, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re observing more cloud-specific vulnerabilities being leveraged by attackers, anticipating that this trend will grow in the future.\u201d Automated hacking tools make their way to dark web marketplace. \u201cWe anticipate that attackers will use the automated output from LLMs to power CaaS offerings and grow the market, such as taking social media reconnaissance and automating that intelligence into neatly packaged phishing kits,\u201d Fortinet said. Ransomware-as-a-Service, and DDoS-as-a-Service are also found in these marketplaces.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that attackers will use the automated output from LLMs to power CaaS offerings and grow the market, such as taking social media reconnaissance and automating that intelligence into neatly packaged phishing kits,\u201d Fortinet said. Ransomware-as-a-Service, and DDoS-as-a-Service are also found in these marketplaces. Physical real-life threats will be included in cyberattackers\u2019 playbook. Threat groups are \u201cbecoming more aggressive and destructive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing some cybercrime groups physically threaten an organization\u2019s executives and employees in some instances and anticipate that this will become a regular part of many playbooks. We also anticipate that transnational crime \u2014 such as drug trafficking, smuggling people or goods, and more \u2014 will become a regular component of more sophisticated playbooks, with cybercrime groups and transnational crime organizations working together,\u201d Fortinet said.\n\nOn the positive end of things, the firm also expects that anti-adversary frameworks will expand, urging the cybersecurity community to pursue global collaborations, and private-public partnerships to keep up with evolving strategies of cybercriminals.\n\nRashish Pandey, VP, marketing and communications, said, \u201cAs cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, 2025 is poised to bring a new wave of highly specialized and AI-driven attacks\u2026Our predictions underscore the need for organizations to anticipate and adapt to an increasingly dynamic threat landscape.\u201d \u2013 Rappler.com"

            "article_content": "With a trifecta victory in the November races for the presidency, the Senate and the House of Representatives, Republicans led by President-elect Donald Trump are expected to push through substantial legislation that could significantly alter the U.S. commercial real estate environment.\n\nYet, despite a general sense within the industry that the incoming Trump administration has a more pro-business attitude compared to its Democratic rivals, there is still a lack of clarity on which policies touted by Trump on the campaign trail will actually be implemented. There is also uncertainty more than a month after the election as to when those policies may take effect and, crucially, their ultimate influence on the real estate market and the all-important cost of borrowing money to finance and refinance projects.\n\nSEE ALSO: CRE Owners Prefer an Indicted Mayor Eric Adams Over the Alternatives\n\nTake, for instance, a controversial economic tactic embraced by Trump throughout this election cycle: tariffs, or taxes on imported goods. Trump has called for a dramatic escalation of tariffs, in excess of the already steep ones his first administration levied against China, as means of both reducing proliferation of foreign-made products and re-incentivizing domestic manufacturing. At points during the most recent campaign, Trump proposed a 60 to 100 percent tariff on Chinese products, and up to 20 percent of universal tariffs on imported goods from all countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lead an American manufacturing boom,\u201d Trump said at a campaign speech in September. \u201cWhen they have to pay tariffs to come in, but they have incentive to build here, they\u2019re going to come roaring back.\u201d\n\nAlthough embraced by some manufacturers as a method of leveling the playing field against cheaper foreign products, or for their use as a geopolitical negotiating tool, economists and some industry insiders have warned that tariffs of such severity could ultimately have the opposite effect on real estate development and investment trends. In addition to likely driving up the cost of building materials, which would make construction more expensive, higher inflation could also rear its head as many companies pass on the higher costs associated with tariffs to consumers \u2014 including apartment and office tenants as well as homebuyers.\n\nA resurgence of inflation would halt the Federal Reserve\u2019s newfound confidence, and pause its change in policy toward lowering interest rates. It could even force the Fed to reverse course, putting renewed pressure on the financing environment.\n\n\u201c[Tariffs] have the potential to really frustrate this idea that we\u2019re trying to lower inflation, and therefore be able to lower interest rates,\u201d Leland Collins, senior director of real estate tax advisory for FTI Consulting, told Commercial Observer. \u201cSo I\u2019m very concerned to see how that plays out, because if we can\u2019t drop interest rates at the rate we\u2019re expecting, that negatively impacts real estate since we\u2019re such a leverage-heavy industry. So there\u2019s a balancing act here that concerns me \u2026 but we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens there.\u201d\n\nTherein lies the rub. With roughly six weeks until Trump regains office, there remains much daylight between what Trump has proposed versus what policies will actually be pursued, let alone how aggressively.\n\nStill, whatever one may think of Trump\u2019s more vague or controversial ideas, there is at least one realm of policy that, while still uncertain, will essentially be forced into focus in the near term: taxes.\n\nThe Republican-dominated Congress is expected to prioritize yet another dramatic change to the U.S. tax code, reminiscent of 2017\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a once-in-a-generation overhaul affecting everything from raising the child tax credit and estate tax exemption to permanently lowering the overall corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.\n\nCertain provisions created by the TCJA are set to expire next year, however, which will drive Congress to act in order to save or abandon the first Trump administration\u2019s signature policy.\n\nThe elevated child tax credit and estate tax exemption are among the provisions expiring, as are higher standard reductions, state and local tax (SALT) deductions, and gift taxes. However, more pertinent to the real estate industry is the qualified business income (QBI) deduction, which allowed flow-through entities like limited liability companies, general partnerships and sole proprietorships to claim up to a 20 percent deduction. Unless extended, the QBI deduction will fizzle out entirely by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cSome of these provisions that came with the TCJA, that was really coming from the Trump administration only,\u201d said Ashalata Shettigar, managing director of the business tax division for FTI Consulting. If Kamala Harris had won the presidency, Shettigar said, \u201cthey probably would\u2019ve just let these [provisions] sunset and not restore them back. President Trump himself is a great lobbyist for the real estate industry \u2026 but we wouldn\u2019t see this coming through if it was Harris coming into power.\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies have proposed a number of other changes to the tax code, such as a further reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, or 15 percent for companies that manufacture their products within the U.S.\n\nThere has also been discussion of reinstating the ability of companies to fully deduct the cost of qualified assets, a provision known as bonus depreciation. Via bonus depreciation, the TCJA allowed businesses to deduct 100 percent of the cost of assets acquired and placed into service between the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2023, though the provision has slowly begun to phase out. Unless reinstated, the deduction will be eliminated by 2027.\n\n\u201cThe general consensus on [Capitol Hill] is that 2025 will be all about tax reform,\u201d Collins added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to consume a significant amount of time and focus of people in D.C., and it certainly will be top of mind for our clients that work in the asset management, real estate and private equity space.\u201d\n\nThere are other tax policies floating in the ether that Trump has expressed support for in the past, though for which the current level of interest is unclear. That includes an expansion of the TCJA\u2019s Opportunity Zone program, which provides tax advantages as incentives for investing in communities that the government deems low-income or blighted, as well as a potential reduction in capital gains taxes. For what it\u2019s worth, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 blueprint calls for a reduction of the capital gains tax rate from its current cap of 20 percent to 15 percent, which would be its lowest level since the early 1940s.\n\nYet, a key question facing the Trump administration and congressional Republicans is how to pay for the various tax overhauls, let alone other prominent aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in late October projected that Trump\u2019s policies could increase the federal deficit by $7.75 trillion, including over $5.3 trillion from the extension and modification of the TCJA alone.\n\nSuch a large deficit increase would likely trigger the Treasury Department to issue more securities, such as bonds, to account for that spending, thereby putting further upward pressure on interest rates and exacerbating the negative downstream effects that an interest rate boost would have on real estate financing.\n\nWhile a policy enactment timeline was as of CO\u2019s print deadline less clear than his tax agenda, Trump has also floated a number of policies aimed at alleviating the country\u2019s housing crisis.\n\nThe cost of housing in the U.S. has risen dramatically since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 \u2014 by more than 50 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Average housing costs are also a major factor driving the general inflation rate, as housing accounts for about 45 percent of the core consumer price index, according to a report from the White House in September.\n\nTo address the affordability crisis, Trump and his allies have proposed a multipronged approach. One aspect is an effort, vague as of late November, to \u201ccut unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs,\u201d as stated by the 2024 Republican Party platform, which could include cuts to federal energy efficiency standards and possibly financial incentives for state and local governments to speed up their project approval processes. It\u2019s those entities that largely control housing regulations like zoning.\n\nTrump has also called for the opening of federal lands for development, an idea shared by both the Biden administration and Vice President Harris. Though how much land, and how much development could occur on that land due to its generally remote nature, remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cI think that the contribution of federal land and unused buildings is a long overdue idea that could address the fundamental undersupply of housing for Americans,\u201d Tawan Davis, founding partner and CEO at The Steinbridge Group, said in Commercial Observer\u2019s annual survey for its Owners Magazine. \u201cThis was a plank in both campaigns.\u201d\n\nIf further embraced by Trump, cryptocurrency could also become a game-changer in the real estate investment space. Although once derided by the incoming president as a \u201cdisaster waiting to happen,\u201d Trump has pivoted 180 degrees on digital currency in the years since, even saying at a Bitcoin conference in June that he wanted to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201d\n\nCrypto companies, and their investors like Elon Musk, returned the favor with support for Trump throughout the election cycle. Although no exact policies have yet been proposed, a Trump presidency could ultimately encourage greater acceptance of crypto for use as payments in real estate and other transactions. The new administration could also throw its weight behind a government-backed digital currency, something the outgoing administration explored.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen in one day \u2026 but in general I think real estate is due to tokenize it,\u201d said Ilan Bracha, founder of investment firm IB Global and brokerage advisory group The Bracha Team. \u201cEveryone needs to [have confidence in it] in order to do it, but the ledger and blockchain are perfect for real estate. And when you have leadership that [supports] it from the top down, you will see that in the market as well.\u201d\n\nThe incoming administration\u2019s most striking and most controversial proposal to lower housing costs, however, is the potential mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. Trump has blamed housing inflation on illegal immigration, a claim echoed by his Vice President-elect JD Vance and others, and has vowed to expel millions of undocumented people in order to reduce housing demand, among other reasons.\n\nYet, whatever gains made in terms of lower demand could be offset by the fact that a significant portion of the worker pool in the construction trades is undocumented \u2014 up to 23 percent, according to a 2021 report by the Center for American Progress, a think tank \u2014 and that such a large reduction in that labor force would slow the pace of housing construction and consequently inflate prices.\n\nSince housing costs are such a large contributor to inflation, mass deportations on the scale that Trump has proposed could have the ripple effect of placing upward pressure on interest rates if elevated inflation were to return \u2014 which, again, has stark implications for the real estate lending environment.\n\nA telling sign of the market\u2019s feelings toward the near-term interest rate environment is financial services firm CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, which calculates the probability of Federal Reserve rate changes. On Oct. 18, FedWatch projected a more than 40 percent chance that the Fed would cut rates to between 3.5 and 3.75 percent by June of 2025. As of Nov. 18, that probability was kicked down to just 11 percent.\n\nIndeed, a survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal before the election found that a majority of economists believed that inflation and interest rates would be higher under Trump than under Harris due to the former president\u2019s policy proposals.\n\nStill, some industry insiders are not only bullish on interest rate trends, but also on Trump\u2019s overall convictions toward the real estate industry, given his personal history and endeavors.\n\n\u201c[Trump] owns a lot of real estate, so I don\u2019t see him doing anything that would negatively impact the real estate market. He may be neutral, but he won\u2019t be negative, and he may be positive,\u201d Barry DiRaimondo, CEO of real estate company Steelwave, told CO. \u201cI think lower interest rates are going to float all boats. And I think you\u2019re going to see lower interest rates. A change of administrations is only positive from an economic perspective.\u201d\n\nBracha agrees, adding that even if some of Trump\u2019s policies do have inflationary repercussions, the former president\u2019s real estate background, branding and presence back in the White House could instill confidence in both domestic and international investors that the U.S. markets are stable and the best place to invest.\n\n\u201cTrump, as president, actually has skin in the game, and he understands it better than many, many people,\u201d Bracha said. \u201cSo what we can say is that when there will be a situation to impact [real estate], you know you have a good driver there, at least.\u201d\n\nNick Trombola can be reached at ntrombola@commercialobserver.com."

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out their research in these coldest parts of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or -257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide - key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and also binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique, and with the GG Tau A star system being as close to our solar system helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt also helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravity of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge and an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFinding a reasonable hypothesis can pose a challenge when there are thousands of possibilities. This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA mineral trapped within a Martian meteorite that fell to Earth has revealed traces of water on Mars that date back 4.45 billion years, according to new research. The zircon grain may contain the oldest direct evidence of ancient hot water on the red planet, which may have provided environments such as hot springs that are associated with life on Earth.\n\nThe discovery opens up new ways of understanding whether Mars was ever habitable in its ancient past. It also adds more support to observations already gathered by the fleet of spacecraft orbiting and roaming the red planet, which have spotted evidence of where rivers and lakes once existed on the Martian surface.\n\nBut key questions remain about when exactly water first appeared on Mars and how it evolved \u2014 and disappeared \u2014 over time.\n\nScientists analyzed a sample from the \u201cBlack Beauty\u201d meteorite, also known as NWA 7034, that was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011. The meteorite was ejected from the Martian surface after another celestial object hit the planet between 5 million and 10 million years ago, and fragments of it have served as a key source of studying ancient Mars for years.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Science Advances on November 22, focused on a single grain of the mineral zircon spotted within the meteorite. The team\u2019s analysis shows that water was present just 100 million years after the planet formed, which suggests that Mars may have been able to support life at some point in its history.\n\n\u201cOur data suggests the presence of water in the crust of Mars at a comparable time to the earliest evidence for water on Earth\u2019s surface, around 4.4 billion years ago,\u201d said lead study author Jack Gillespie, researcher at the University of Lausanne\u2019s Faculty of Geosciences and Environment in Switzerland, in a statement. \u201cThis discovery provides new evidence for understanding the planetary evolution of Mars, the processes that took place on it and its potential to have harboured life.\u201d\n\nMinerals as time capsules\n\nRocks may hold the answers to some of the biggest remaining questions about Mars, including how much water was present and whether life ever existed on the planet. That\u2019s why meteorites like Black Beauty are of such interest to scientists. Carl Agee, a professor and director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, first presented the space rock to the scientific community in 2013.\n\n\u201c(The Black Beauty meteorite) contains hundreds of rock and mineral fragments, each with a different part of the 4.5 billion years of Martian history,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Aaron Cavosie, a planetary scientist and senior lecturer the Space Science and Technology Centre at Curtin University, in an email. \u201c(It) is the only source of pieces for the geological puzzle of pre-Noachian Mars.\u201d\n\nThe Noachian period occurred from 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, and little is known from direct measurements dating to the pre-Noachian period on Mars, between 4.5 billion and 4.1 billion years ago, though it\u2019s crucial to understand because it serves as the first page in the Mars history book, Cavosie said.\n\nBut Black Beauty has revealed some of its secrets. Many of the rock fragments the meteorite contains show that the Martian crust endured a number of impacts, causing a massive amount of upheaval on the planet\u2019s surface, he said.\n\nThe space rock also contains the oldest known pieces of Mars, including the oldest zircons, Cavosie said.\n\nZircon, used in products such as jewelry, ceramic tiles and medical implants, is a hardy mineral that can help scientists peer into the past and determine the conditions present when it crystallized, including the temperature at the time and whether the mineral interacted with water.\n\n\u201cZircon contains traces of uranium, an element that acts as a natural clock,\u201d said Gillespie, who was a postdoctoral research associate at Curtin University\u2019s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the time of the study. \u201cThis element decays to lead over time at a precisely known rate. By comparing the ratio of uranium to lead, we can calculate the age of crystal formation.\u201d\n\nThe zircon in Black Beauty was unaltered by its trip to Earth and fiery entrance into our planet\u2019s atmosphere before crashing down in the Sahara because it was protected by its location within the meteorite\u2019s interior, Cavosie said.\n\nDuring the analysis of the zircon grain, the study team detected unusual amounts of iron, sodium and aluminum, suggesting that water-rich fluids left these traces on the zircon as it formed 4.45 billion years ago. Such elements aren\u2019t usually found in crystalline zircon, but the researchers\u2019 atom-scale studies of the zircon showed the elements incorporated into the crystal structure and lined up like fruit stands in a market, Cavosie said.\n\n\u201cWe could tell by the patterns of how the (iron, aluminum and sodium) are found inside the zircon that they were incorporated into the grain as it grew, like layers in an onion,\u201d Cavosie said.\n\nOn Earth, zircons from hydrothermal systems \u2014 which form when water is heated by subsurface volcanic activity like the upward flow of hot magma \u2014 have similar patterns to those found in Black Beauty.\n\nIf hydrothermal systems existed in the Martian crust 4.45 billion years ago, liquid water likely made its way to the surface.\n\n\u201cOur experience on Earth shows that water is critical for habitats capable of supporting life,\u201d Cavosie said. \u201cMany environments on Earth host life in hot water systems, including hot springs, and hydrothermal vents. Such environments may have given rise to the earliest life forms on Earth. Our new study shows that the crust of Mars was warm and wet in the pre-Noachian period, meaning that habitable environments may have existed at that time.\u201d\n\nGetting up close with Mars\n\nCavosie is curious to determine whether hydrothermal systems like hot springs were prevalent when magma was helping form the red planet\u2019s crust between 4.48 billion and 4.43 billion years ago or if they were more episodic.\n\n\u201cIf hydrothermal systems were a stable feature on early Mars, it would indicate habitable conditions may have persisted over a considerable time span,\u201d Cavosie said. \u201cThis is now a testable hypothesis that can be addressed by collecting more data from Martian zircons.\u201d\n\nUntil samples can be returned directly from Mars, the Black Beauty meteorite is one of the best windows into how the Martian crust formed and what the early surface of Mars was like, said Briony Horgan, co-investigator on the Perseverance rover mission and professor of planetary science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Horgan was not involved in this study.\n\nFinding evidence of hydrothermal systems within the subsurface from one tiny grain of zircon aligns with scientific theories on the amount of water and volcanic activity that existed on ancient Mars, she said. And these earliest potentially habitable environments would have been shielded from radiation by a strong planetary magnetic field, which Mars lacks today, Horgan added. Scientists are still trying to explain how the red planet lost its protective magnetic field.\n\nCurrently, the Perseverance rover is climbing the rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, an ancient lake once filled with water 3.7 billion years ago. Some of the rocks the rover has encountered may have been formed by hydrothermal systems, Horgan said.\n\nThe rover will take samples from the rocks because they could preserve evidence of ancient microbial life.\n\n\u201cAs much as the meteorites can tell us, we can do even better with a carefully selected and intact rock sample from a known location on Mars with good geologic context,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cSo this paper is a great motivation for bringing our Mars samples back to Earth to study with the same level of detail for years to come.\u201d"

Police also told the NYT that Mangione is now considered a \"strong person of interest\" in light of the new evidence.\n\nMangione, a prep school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate, was captured by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania earlier on Monday. His arrest followed a days-long manhunt for Thompson's suspected assassin that included the deployment of drones, scuba divers, and K-9 units.\n\nAs digital sleuths discovered soon after Mangione's name was released, the young man's social media accounts contain a wealth of information about his worldview, which seems to have morphed from disgruntled academic to angry manarchist over the course of this year \u2014 before dropping off completely months before the killing.\n\nThis entire debacle has been incredibly dramatic \u2014 and as we learn more about law enforcement's primary suspect, we're likely in for a few more shocks.\n\nMore on the murder of Brian Thompson: Bill Burr: Murdered Insurance CEO Was a \"Gangster\""

            "article_content": "The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life \u2014 Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon.\n\nRaspberry Pi: Quo vadis?\n\nRaspberry Pi Foundation\n\nSince the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins.\n\nNothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization.\n\nSee also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do\n\nWayland is coming \u2013 slowly\n\nThe Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland.\n\nThe Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an \u201cexperimental\u201d option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion.\n\nCinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint\n\nThe replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows.\n\nThe current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future.\n\nDebian 13 (\u2018Trixie\u2019)\n\nDebian\n\nA new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 \u201cBookworm,\u201d which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (\u201cTrixie\u201d) is due in 2025. With Debian \u201cForky,\u201d the name for version 14 has already been decided.\n\nDebian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models.\n\nThe oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian\u2019s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory.\n\nNew Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result \u2014 such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!).\n\nEOL: Ubuntu 20.04 expires\n\nUbuntu\n\nAfter April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages.\n\nA new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers.\n\nEOL: The end of Windows 10\n\nAfter 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year.\n\nLast year\u2019s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address.\n\nWindows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com\n\nExperience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them.\n\nIn addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives.\n\nSee also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows\n\n\u2018Immutable\u2019 trend: Open Suse Leap 16\n\nOpen Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added.\n\nopenSUSE\n\nOpen Suse Leap 16 will be an \u201cimmutable\u201d Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability.\n\nThe required software is to be provided by isolated containers \u2014 presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop.\n\nThe same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue \u201cImmutable\u201d version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop.\n\nLinux concepts > la Nix-OS\n\nNix\n\nIt is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of \u201cdeclarative configuration,\u201d which probably has a great future ahead of it.\n\nNix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops).\n\nPackage dependencies are avoided because \u2014 similar to container formats \u2014 software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users.\n\nLinux without \u2018sudo\u2019?\n\nWhile Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system.\n\nIDG\n\nIn future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being.\n\nThe run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated \u201c/etc/ sudoer.\u201d run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary.\n\nAs run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit).\n\nIn addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions.\n\nIoB: Internet of Behavior\n\nWe have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next \u201cinternet\u201d is added. IoB \u2014 Internet of Behavior \u2014 is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication.\n\nIoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities).\n\nThese IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized.\n\nIt is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection.\n\nHuawei operating system\n\nIn the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system.\n\nHarmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer.\n\nHuawei\n\nHarmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself.\n\nHowever, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully.\n\nWi-Fi 7 (802.11be)\n\nTP-Link\n\nWi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n.\n\nFrom 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this \u2014 from version 6.5 to be precise.\n\nWi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability.\n\nDDR6 RAM\n\nNew DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest.\n\nDDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s.\n\nG.Skill\n\nHEIF/HEIC, JPEG XL image formats\n\nInnovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on.\n\nWhile all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers.\n\nREDPIXEL.PL\n\nThe High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images.\n\nJPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats.\n\nExperience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist.\n\nCPU/GPU/NPU and the \u2018AI PC\u2019\n\nThere is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as \u201cKraken\u201d and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same \u2014 more performance, more efficiency.\n\nAlexander56891 / Shutterstock.com\n\nRegardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term \u201cAI PC\u201d or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough \u2014 at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required.\n\nThe more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient.\n\nIn other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist \u2014 from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are.\n\nSee also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know\n\nMass storage and capacities\n\nMass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025:\n\nSSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung.\n\nMechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade.\n\nJon L. Jacobi\n\nNVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs.\n\nFor end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall.\n\nFaster USB 4v2\n\nUSB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also \u201cUSB 4.0 Gen 4\u201d and more recently \u201cUSB4 2.0\u201d) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps.\n\nThe first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel."

Schematic illustration of selected brain connections that have been linked to intelligence differences across studies. Adapted from Hilger & Sporns, 2021. Credit: Thiele et al.\n\nAI can predict human intelligence by looking at the connections of a working human brain. Neuroscientists can predict intelligence from brain structure and function\u2014to a point. Previous studies have suggested that intelligence is widely distributed across the brain.\n\nKirsten Hilger and colleagues used machine learning models to predict multiple kinds of intelligence from brain connections of 806 healthy adults while resting and while completing tasks. The article is published in PNAS Nexus.\n\nFluid intelligence includes inductive and deductive reasoning abilities that do not rely on context, while crystallized intelligence reflects the ability to apply knowledge from individual experience and culture. General intelligence captures both types of intelligence.\n\nThe prediction performance of the model developed by Hilger and colleagues was highest for general intelligence, followed by crystallized intelligence, and then fluid intelligence. Cognitively demanding tasks produced the most accurate predictions.\n\nInterestingly, models trained with connections between brain regions proposed in most popular neurocognitive intelligence theories outperformed models trained with the same number of connections between randomly chosen regions, which empirically supports these theories.\n\nAccording to the authors, theory-driven models were outperformed by whole-brain models, indicating that there are still more aspects of intelligence waiting to be understood.\n\nMore information: Jonas A Thiele et al.

File photo by Nabil Mounzer/EPA-EFE\n\nBEIRUT, Lebanon, Dec. 10 (UPI) -- The World Bank said Tuesday that the Israel-Hezbollah conflict has dealt another significant blow to Lebanon's already struggling economy and emphasized the pressing need for extensive reforms and targeted investments. The international organization noted in a statement that Lebanon's economic contraction deepened because of the conflict that started in October 2023 when Hezbollah opened \"a support front\" for Gaza. Advertisement\n\nThe conflict turned into a devastating war with Israel expanding its attacks on Sept. 17, destroying Hezbollah's military and civilian infrastructure and assassinating its leader and top officials and military commanders.\n\nThe relentless Israeli air and ground bombardment led to widespread destruction of villages, property, hospitals and schools in Beirut's southern suburbs and in southern and eastern Lebanon. It also forced the displacement of more than 1.2 million people, who fled the targeted areas to more secure regions across Lebanon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA U.S,-brokered cease-fire agreement came into effect Sept. 27, ending the 14-month war that killed more than 4,000 people and wounded 16,600. However, Israel continues its targeted attacks mainly on southern Lebanon, inflicting more casualties and damage.\n\nThe World Bank statement said the deepening economic downturn \"reflects the severe consequences of widespread displacement, destruction and reduced private consumption,\" and emphasizes the necessity for comprehensive reforms and targeted investments in critical sectors as \"the only viable way forward\" after the conflict.\n\nThe country's real gross domestic product growth has been cut by an estimated 6.6% in 2024, bringing the cumulative decline in real GDP since 2019 to more than 38% by the end of the year, the World Bank said, projecting economic activity to contract by 5.7% in 2024 -- equivalent to a loss of $4.2 billion in consumption and net exports.\n\nGDP would have grown, albeit tepidly, by an estimated 0.9% in 2024 if the conflict had not broken out.\n\nLast month, the World Bank put Lebanon's physical damage and economic losses from Hezbollah-Israel war at some $8.5 billion.\n\nJean-Christophe Carret, the World Bank Middle East country director, said the conflict has inflicted yet \"another major shock\" to Lebanon's economy already in a severe crisis\" and highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive reforms and targeted investments \"to avoid further delays in addressing long standing development priorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As Lebanon embarks on developing its post conflict recovery and reconstruction plan, an economic stabilization program and an ambitious program of reforms that strengthen governance will be critical to attract the financing needed to put the country on a sustainable long-term recovery path,\" Carret said.\n\nThe World Bank statement warned that Lebanon's fiscal position is likely to deteriorate further due to \"rising financing needs to secure essential services and meet urgent demands, compounded by potentially reduced fiscal revenue.\"\n\nComprehensive debt restructuring, it said, is critical to regain access to international capital markets to enable the country to tackle its multifaceted challenges.\n\nAchieving macroeconomic stability, improving governance, enhancing public utilities and bolstering human capital remain key priorities. Targeted investments are critical to support sustainable reforms, facilitate the recovery of essential services and rebuild Lebanon's damaged capital stock, the World Bank noted.\n\nLebanon has been facing a deep, compounded crisis since October 2019 that resulted in soaring poverty and unemployment, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value and most of its sectors struggling."

These outsized returns are a function of its AI-driven Gotham platform and AI- and machine learning-powered Foundry platform, being unique at scale.\n\nGotham is a service that federal governments use for mission planning and execution, as well as gathering data. Since these contracts typically stretch for four or five years and are with the U.S. government and its immediate allies, Palantir is able to generate predictable operating cash flow, with little concerns about being paid.\n\nMeanwhile, Foundry is geared at helping businesses better understand their data in order to streamline their operations and improve profitability. This segment is still very early in its expansion, with Foundry's commercial customer count rocketing higher by 51% to 498 during the September-ended quarter from the prior-year period.\n\nYet in spite of this seemingly perfect positioning for Palantir, RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria believes shares of the company are worth (drum roll) $9, which would represent an astounding 88% decline from where shares closed on Dec. 6. Said Jaluria in a recent investor note,\n\nWe cannot rationalize why Palantir is the most expensive name in software... Absent a substantial beat-and-raise quarter elevating the near-term growth trajectory, valuation seems unsustainable.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The Meta Quest 3 is confidently the best VR headset out there right now but a report suggests it may cede its top spot to other headset manufacturers while allowing them to use its OS and store.\n\nA report was recent published by The Information (via OC3D) citing an employee at Goertek, the Chinese manufacturer who produces and tests Quests, and two employees at Meta. In this, it is claimed Meta hopes that Goertek and other manufacturers will take on a bigger role in designing and creating headsets by 2030, potentially fully developing them.\n\nTaking a step back from production is said to be a way to allow Meta to focus on software, which is a much more profitable section of the business.\n\nOften times, hardware, specifically cheap and accessible hardware like Meta's budget headset are sold at a loss or barely breaking even, in order to make money back on the software.\n\nWe've seen time and time again the massive costs of Meta's VR and AR division, Reality Labs. It has often spent upwards of a billion dollars per month.\n\nInstead of putting out headsets, Meta could essentially loan the use of its OS and Meta Quest storefront for non-Meta headsets to use.\n\nOf course, coming from just a handful of employees, it's important to note that plans for moving hardware manufacturing away from Meta itself is reported for some time in the future. Meta could always change course over the next few years, especially as the VR market continues to develop.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nHaving just bought a Meta Quest 3 myself, one of the things I'm most pleasantly surprised by is how intuitive that OS is. Everything slots together well and is easy to explore. The idea of Meta essentially loaning its software doesn't seem like a bad idea in theory, especially when it's one of the few things holding back rivals like the Pico 4 Ultra.\n\nNot only does Meta have a big install base but its OS has wider brand recognisability, which is part of why Android is popular today. An Android user can easily swap to almost any Android phone with little problems, which makes it easier for new names to enter the market.\n\nThis is all before mentioning the rather stellar section of titles available on the Meta storefront. Throw in a Meta Quest + Subscription, and access to some of the bigger titles like Asgard's Wrath 2 and Batman Arkham Shadow, and you have an impressive selection to play through.\n\nIn that same article, The Information's report says that Meta is aiming move up to half of the production of its headset to Vietnam, diversifying what has otherwise been predominantly Chinese manufacturing.\n\nThis appears to be an effort to avoid the huge penalties on Chinese imports that will come as a result of the tariffs, proposed by soon-to-be president Donald Trump.\n\nVirtual reality (Image credit: Valve) Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?\n\nBest graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR\n\nBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR\n\nThat production change from China to Vietnam being assisted by Goertek is a further strengthening of Meta's relationship with the Chinese manufacturing company, and one that signals that grander business plan, according to the previously mentioned employees.\n\nAs of right now, Goertek is an essential part of the production and testing of Meta Quest headsets but Meta is said to be encouraging Goertek to also work on designing components like lenses and displays.\n\nMeta has cemented a name for itself in the VR market with great well-priced hardware and it might actually see a greater return on all that digital real estate in the next decade."

The base variants of the Nexon and Punch, which currently have starting prices of Rs 8.00 lakh and Rs 6.13 lakh (ex-showroom), respectively, are expected to see their prices rise to Rs 8.24 lakh and Rs 6.31 lakh following the hike.\n\nThis price increase comes amid slowing demand in the auto industry, which has prompted automakers to offer higher discounts and moderate dealer sales.\n\nTata Motors\u2019 recent performance and industry trends\n\nDespite the price hike announcement, Tata Motors has faced challenges in recent months. Over the last three months, the stock has been one of the worst performers among all major four-wheeler manufacturers, losing more than 22 per cent. In comparison, the broader auto sector has also been grappling with rising input costs and sluggish demand following a period of strong growth.\n\nThe price hikes are not unique to Tata Motors. Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest car manufacturer, also announced a 4 per cent price hike starting January 2025 to counter rising input costs. Hyundai Motor India is following suit with price increases across all models, including the Venue, Creta, and Ioniq 5 EV, along with plans to launch the Creta EV next year.\n\nLuxury carmakers, including Audi, BMW, Mini, and Mercedes-Benz, are also expected to implement price hikes in the new year, reflecting a broader trend across the global auto industry to pass on the rising manufacturing and logistical costs to consumers.\n\nTata Motors' shares traded at Rs 807, marking a 1.13 per cent increase as of 10:00 am, signalling a positive response to the price hike despite ongoing industry pressures."

            "article_content": "Australia Post\u2019s new point-of-sale platform has been beset by multiple technical troubles, including outages and missing transactions, since its launch last year.\n\nThe cloud-based point-of-sale platform, known as POST+, was brought in as part of a modernisation program to replace Australia Post\u2019s 30-year-old legacy EPOS system.\n\nHowever, since its staggered roll-out began last December, licence holders operating Australia Post branches have regularly complained about till shortfalls, disappearing transactions and system shutdowns -- the longest of which reportedly lasted 90 minutes.\n\nAlthough complaints were regularly escalated with Australia Post\u2019s internal IT helpdesk, the organisation appears to have been at a loss as to the root cause of the issues.\n\niTnews has seen correspondence that shows complaints were raised about POST+, as far back as January.\n\nIn addition to failing transactions, complaints also concerned POST+\u2019s inconsistent interface and usability; its incomplete, slow and convoluted reporting process and poor observability functionality.\n\niTnews understands that Australia Post brought in Deloitte to carry out a technical two-month review of the issues.\n\nIn particular, Deloitte was tasked with uncovering potential errors between POST+\u2019s frontend software and its backend cloud architecture, to pinpoint performance bottlenecks in the end-to-end transaction process.\n\nDeloitte is also understood to have looked at whether POST+\u2019s architecture is consistent with accepted best-practice standards.\n\nThe outcome of this review, which was due to have been completed in July, remains unclear.\n\nAn Australia Post spokesperson said in a statement that \"the system has been independently audited and is fit for purpose.\"\n\n'Teething problems'\n\nAccording to the Licensed Post Office Group, which represents the interests of 2800 licensees operating under Australia Post\u2019s franchise model, the new system is causing a \u201csignificant financial burden\u201d to licensees.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence that transactions have been missing, or just not completed, for almost 12 months,\u201d said LPO Group executive director Angela Cramp.\n\n\u201cThe evidence was gathered due to a number of outlets being continually short in their balance, and they began to print off transaction history reports more often so they had a paper trail when they experienced shortages.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cramp, the alleged 90-minute outage, which occurred in May, collectively cost licensees $200,000 in lost revenue and downtime.\n\nFranchisees of Australia Post, which make up two-thirds of Australia Post\u2019s overall network, are remunerated on the number of \u201ctasks\u201d they process, such as banking sales and bill payments. As such, if a transaction fails to complete, the licensees are not paid.\n\niTnews understands that licensees were told by the Australia Post IT helpdesk to make up any shortfalls with their own money, as per the process under the former EPOS system.\n\nHowever, when questioned in a recent senate estimates hearing, Australia Post CEO Paul Graham strongly denied any suggestion that licensees were asked to pick up the shortfalls.\n\n\u201cWe do not ask the post offices to put money back in to balance it out,\u201d he said in response to questions about POST+ from Senator Malcolm Roberts.\n\n\"What we did was provide a report for all those transactions that had not processed through.\u201d\n\nGraham added that POST+ is a modern system built on \u201cstate-of-the-art architecture\u201d and described the complaints as coming from a \"minority\" of people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that when you implement a brand-new system at the scale we\u2019ve implemented it, there will be teething problems,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, as of this month, iTnews understands that bugs affecting cashflow and reconciliation continue to be uncovered.\n\niTnews asked Australia Post a detailed set of questions about the issues.\n\nIn response a spokesperson said: \"Australia Post has introduced a modern, new point of sale system called POST+ to replace its aging 30-year-old system. It is providing a better experience for team members and customers as well as enhanced transaction security.\n\n\"We involved many stakeholders, including licensees and post office team members, at all major stages of the design and implementation. This collaboration has continued including fortnightly meetings with licensees from across the country who are using POST+ in their outlets.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that the system was independently reviewed and audited, during roll-out and post implementation and found fit for purpose.\n\n\"We are constantly investing in the system and developing enhancements collaboratively with our team members, including licensees,\" the spokesperson said."

            "article_content": "Extraterrestrial life may look nothing like life on Earth. So, astrobiologists are coming up with a framework to study how complex systems evolve.\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY 4.0\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off.\n\nChris Impey is University Distinguished Professor of Astronomy at the University of Arizona.

            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained. '[Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.'\n\nThe leaker described their motives as desire to inform on important information that has been 'classified and intentionally withheld from the public regarding 'unidentified aerial phenomena' [UAP] and the ongoing covert operations surrounding them.'\n\n'I was part of one of the legacy programs,' the leaker wrote. 'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

            "article_content": "Drones, drones everywhere \u2014 and who knows what to think?\n\nThere were 49 reported sightings this past Sunday alone, Gov. Phil Murphy said at a press conference Monday.\n\nHe also stressed that these mysterious appearances, which have been baffling New Jerseyans in 12 counties since late November, pose no known threat to public safety. At least one of Sunday's sightings, he added, was a mistake: an airplane, taken for a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).\n\nWhich prompts the question: How many of these sightings are mistakes?\n\nCould some of the drone-mania that has gripped the state over the last few weeks be due to simple errors of vision, mistaken identity, optical illusion?\n\nGiven history's various episodes of mass hysteria, from UFO sightings to 2016's epidemic of clown sightings \u2014 remember those? \u2014 it can't be altogether discounted. Especially given social media's role, nowadays, in amplifying everything.\n\nTrue or not, it's incredible\n\nIt seems highly unlikely that so many people across New Jersey (and also Staten Island) could be reporting something wholly imaginary. But it seems equally unlikely that so many drones could be launched in so many locations over so many days without the source of at least one being discovered.\n\nAnd if this is all some kind of vast, clandestine surveillance operation \u2014 as some have suggested \u2014 why do these things fly only at night? And why would they make themselves so easily seen with those widely reported, FAA-regulation flashing lights?\n\n\"Whoever is flying them is complying with FAA rules to put blinking lights, so as not to collide with other aircraft, or vice versa,\" said Gary Swangin, Warren County astronomer-at-large and former director of the Newark and Panther Academy (in Paterson) planetariums. They want to be seen.\n\nLights in the sky\n\nOne of the most common inquiries he used to get, as planetarium director, was about UFOs.\n\nPeople were constantly calling to report strange objects, lights, somethings in the sky. During the early 1970s, when interest was at its peak, Swangin set up a UFO hotline and used a questionnaire developed by astronomer J. Allen Hynek \u2014 who minted the phrase \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" \u2014 to help witnesses sort out their perceptions and perhaps arrive at the truth.\n\n\"It was very helpful,\" Swangin recalled. \"When people see something like this in the sky, they often fail to note things. Sight alone is nice. But did you hear anything? Did you smell anything? And, of course, those standard questions: what time of day, what direction?\"\n\nNeedless to say, none of the sightings reported to Swangin turned out to be \u2014 definitively \u2014 an alien spacecraft. But many did turn out to be other things.\n\nAmong the most common UFO explanations, through the years?\n\nOrdinary aircraft. Satellites. Meteorites \u2014 particularly the rare kind, called bolides, that explode in mid-atmosphere, sometimes spectacularly.\n\nAlso weather balloons. \"That's at the top of the list of mistaken identities,\" Swangin said.\n\nTrick of the light?\n\nThen there are the tricks that light, and atmospheric conditions, can play on the eye.\n\n\"Sometimes when a planet or a bright star is low on the horizon, their light can be passing through many layers of the earth's atmosphere,\" said Amie Gallagher, director of the planetarium at Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg.\n\n\"So it might be bright and twinkle a lot or even change color a little bit,\" she said. \"It might be Venus or Jupiter, and also the star Sirius, which is the brightest star in the night sky.\"\n\nThen there is a phenomenon called autokinesis. It can make you think you're seeing moving lights.\n\n\"What happens is, when you stare at a pinpoint of light in the sky, the muscles in your eye try to focus on the object,\" Swangin said. \"So as a result the object moves \u2014 it sways back and forth and up and down. It's actually stationary, but some people claim the object is moving. It's only a physical thing that's happening to them.\"\n\nPilots are often bedeviled by this phenomenon: They're told to focus the eyes on objects at varying distances and avoid fixating on one target.\n\nExtremely loud, incredibly close\n\nFor the layperson, such sightings are further compromised by issues of context and distance.\n\nIt's often hard to judge how distant, how high up, an object is in a darkened sky. Which is, precisely, the difference between a drone and an airplane. \"You can't look at it against a black sky and try to determine whether the object is far or close to you,\" Swangin said.\n\nThat's why it's important to note whether the object made a noise. \"Then it's within 200 feet,\" Swangin said.\n\nQuestions of what direction the object was moving are also useful. If it's moving toward the west, toward the setting sun, it could be subject to distortions of light and atmosphere. If it's moving toward, or away from, a nearby airport, that's another tell.\n\nA team effort?\n\nTo get to the bottom of this year's drone phenomenon will require lots of reporting from lots of credible sources.\n\nUltimately, it may require a group effort like Operation Moonwatch \u2014 the 1950s program to track the first artificial satellites, before today's global radar infrastructure had been established. Teams of amateur astronomers, stationed around the world, would relay their sightings of Sputniks and Explorers to the Smithsonian, which would triangulate the data and determine exactly what the object was and where it was headed.\n\n\"If you get a group of people who could see if there's a pattern, whether these things emerge from one central place, then you could pinpoint where they're coming from,\" he said.\n\nUntil then, the question will remain: Are these drone sightings real? Are they imaginary? A little of both?\n\nSwangin, for his part, has no doubt. He's actually seen one.\n\n\"Last week, when I was driving, it was right in front of me,\" he said. \"It was stationary, and I could see the two strobe lights on it, red and green lights. And they were flashing. I was about two blocks away from my home in Warren County.\"\n\nHe did what he was trained to do. He noted distance, and direction.\n\n\"It was very low altitude, a couple of hundred feet,\" he said. \"It started to move in a northwest direction. It was easy to see. I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nSwangin invites anyone who has had a sighting to contact him at spaceobservatory@aol.com."

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out their research in these coldest parts of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or -257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide - key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and also binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique, and with the GG Tau A star system being as close to our solar system helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt also helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravity of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge and an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

DOI: 10.1088/2632-2153/ad8c10\n\nResearchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) have developed a new approach that combines generative artificial intelligence (AI) and first-principles simulations to predict three-dimensional atomic structures of highly complex materials.\n\nThis research highlights LLNL's efforts in advancing machine learning for materials science research and supporting the Lab's mission to develop innovative technological solutions for energy and sustainability.\n\nThe study, recently published in Machine Learning: Science and Technology, represents a potential leap forward in the application of AI for materials characterization and inverse design.\n\nThe approach uses X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Accurately determining atomic structures from spectroscopic data has long posed a challenge, particularly for complex systems, such as shapeless materials.\n\nIn response, LLNL scientists have introduced a generative framework based on diffusion models, which are an emerging machine learning technique. The authors demonstrate how this framework enables the prediction of 3D atomic arrangements from XANES spectra.\n\n\"Our method bridges a crucial gap between spectroscopic analysis and precise structure determination,\" said Hyuna Kwon, a materials scientist in LLNL's Quantum Simulations Group, Materials Science Division. \"By conditioning the generative model on XANES data, we can reconstruct atomic structures that align closely with the target spectra, offering a powerful tool for material analysis and custom design.\"\n\nThe project was a collaborative effort, with Kwon and Tim Hsu from LLNL's Center for Applied Scientific Computing contributing equally. The team demonstrated that their AI model also scales effectively from small datasets for generating realistic, large-scale structures. This scale-agnostic property demonstrates the model's ability to bridge scales from nanoscale to microscale, enabling detailed atomic structure generation even at complex features like grain boundaries and phase interfaces.\n\n\"This approach can be leveraged beyond just structural analysis,\" said Anh Pham, the principal investigator of the project. \"It can be extended to inverse design\u2014where we start from a desired material property and engineer the corresponding atomic structure\u2014accelerating the discovery of materials with tailored functionalities.\"\n\nMore information: Hyuna Kwon et al, Spectroscopy-guided discovery of three-dimensional structures of disordered materials with diffusion models, Machine Learning: Science and Technology (2024).

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nConnections between knowledge areas, introduced by Alena Tensor. Credit: Piotr Ogonowski (created with the support of AI tools)\n\nThe search for quantum gravity has gone on for 100 years, but it is not the only unification challenge in physics. Many of us believe that one day there will be a unification theory\u2014a theory that will reconcile many divergent physical theories.\n\nOur new article published in Physica Scripta brings new hope that such a theory exists. It demonstrates that the use of a certain mathematical object called Alena Tensor reconciles various physical theories, including general relativity, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and continuum mechanics. Will this finally allow scientists to unify descriptions used in physics?\n\nWhat is Alena Tensor?\n\nAny movement under the influence of forces can be mathematically represented as movement along a curved path. Using differential geometry, one may equally well assume that the trajectory was straight, while the space in which the move took place is curved. It may sound complicated, but it can be assumed that there is a mathematical transformation that allows us to describe curved space-time equivalently as flat space-time where certain forces act.\n\nIt has long been suspected that such a transformation exists, although opinions on this matter are divided. Some physicists believe that the metric tensor, a mathematical object describing the curvature of space-time, is simply a feature of space-time. Some physicists, most often mathematical physicists, are of the opinion that such a transformation should exist.\n\nAlena Tensor provides just such a transformation. In short, Alena Tensor can straighten curved space-time while preserving all conclusions from general relativity. This property alone makes Alena Tensor an extremely valuable tool, but this is just the beginning.\n\nAlena Tensor in flat and curved space-time\n\nWe used Alena Tensor to describe a system with an electromagnetic field, obtaining three forces in flat space-time: electromagnetism (which is not surprising), \"against gravity,\" and radiation reaction force.\n\nThe radiation reaction force is already known in physics. It safeguards the principle of conservation of energy and ensures that the energy of an accelerating body does not exceed the energy available in the physical system.\n\nThe \"against gravity\" force generalizes classical Newton's equation for gravity, providing a relativistic description of gravity in flat space-time, fully consistent with general relativity:\n\nIt faithfully reproduces the motion described in curved space-time.\n\nThis force does not act in freefall, respecting the equivalence principle.\n\nGravity in this description is not a force but the counteraction to gravity is.\n\nThe Alena Tensor allows for a smooth transition to the description used in the electromagnetic theory and then it turns out that:\n\nCharged particles cannot remain at complete rest and should have spin, which agrees with quantum mechanics.\n\nThe reason for the existence of mass (and energy) of charged particles is the magnetic moment.\n\nThe above result basically explains what matter is, although so far it only applies to charged elementary particles and requires generalization to other fields.\n\nThe Alena Tensor also allows a smooth transition to the equations of general relativity. The obtained results provide some answers to the questions that have long puzzled physicists, concerning, e.g., singularities of black holes, cosmological constant, dark energy and dark matter.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Alena Tensor completely reverses this approach. It is much easier now to describe gravity in flat space-time in a way that mathematically reproduces general relativity and then uses the known tools of quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, in the article we derived quantum equations describing the entire physical system with all previously mentioned forces. It turns out that these are three currently known main quantum equations. This leads to the completely surprising conclusion: It would mean that gravity has been present in quantum mechanics from the very beginning. It must be admitted that probably no one expected such a solution to the puzzle. In the article we also explain why it was so hard to spot gravity in quantum equations.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere are interesting times ahead, but no one should expect an immediate revolution. Science does not develop at the pace of messages on social networks. It will take several months for this research paper to get noticed, several months before researchers take an interest in it, read it and use its results. It also takes many months to conduct and describe research using the new mathematical apparatus, then go through the peer review process and publish it.\n\nIn the first articles, we should expect attempts to falsify Alena Tensor, because in physics, like in all science, we need to be sure that our next steps lead in the right direction. If falsification deceives and further research and experiments confirm the results obtained from Alena Tensor, we may hope that in the next three to 10 years, this will lead to the unification and reconciliation of many descriptions currently used in physics.\n\nIt is also entirely possible that the article will go unnoticed or no one will pursue further research, as has happened many times before with innovations in science. Contrary to popular belief, for most readers, the innovation of the article is a disadvantage\u2014it is harder to read, understand and accept. The difficulties during the long publication process also indicate that many scientific journals see too much risk in publishing innovative research, especially if its authors are not widely known scientists.\n\nFortunately, this article was eventually published by a highly respected and inclusive journal that assesses the scientific value higher than non-meritorious criteria, for which I would like to publicly express my highest respect. The editor and reviewers provided constructive criticism, and their substantive comments helped to significantly improve the article, exactly the way science should function. However, it seems that research on non-mainstream methods of unifying physics (and Alena Tensor is one) may require much more time and perseverance.\n\nThe hope remains that future generations of physicists will complete the development of this method despite the obstacles, and in 20 to 40 years, Alena Tensor will inspire the scientific community to unify physics.\n\nThis story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

This was ChatGPT \u2014 an artificial intelligence chatbot that could write poetry, debug code, and summarize hundred-page novels with unnerving ease. It attracted a jaw-dropping 100 million users within weeks, breaking records for the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Investors, with visions of a technological revolution shimmering in their eyes (and dollar signs for pupils), began pouring fortunes into anything that bore the acronym \u201cAI.\u201d The future, it seemed, was already here.\n\nBut, as history reminds us with a wry smile, the future doesn\u2019t always arrive as advertised. As the markets ride a wave of AI-induced euphoria, voices of caution are growing louder. Is AI a transformative technology poised to rewrite our lives, or is it the scaffolding for the next catastrophic bubble \u2014 a modern-day echo of the dot-com collapse?\n\nEchoes of 1999\n\nThe numbers are staggering. In 2024, the S&P 500 is on track to close with a 27% gain, building on a 24% surge the year before. We haven\u2019t seen this kind of back-to-back bull run since the halcyon days of the late 1990s, when dot-com stocks inflated to absurd heights. For a brief moment, it seemed every startup with a \u201c.com\u201d in its name was a ticket to unimaginable wealth. But by early 2000, that story turned dark. The bubble popped, and what followed was a painful recession that many would rather forget. By 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion. Today, a similar stock market wipeout could be much more dire.\n\nFor instance, at the peak of the dot-com frenzy, Pets.com seemed to embody the future of commerce. Who wouldn\u2019t want pet supplies delivered with just a few clicks? The company launched in 1998, armed with an irresistible mascot: a wide-eyed sock puppet with a penchant for witty banter. The puppet became a minor celebrity, starring in a $1.2 million Super Bowl ad and even appearing on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBut beneath the charm lay a fragile business model. Shipping bulky bags of dog food wasn\u2019t cheap, and Pets.com sold products at a loss just to attract customers. Investors still believed in the vision, pumping $82.5 million into its IPO in February 2000. Nine months later, the company collapsed. The sock puppet, once a symbol of internet-age optimism, became the unwitting face of dot-com hubris.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, the undisputed titan of AI hardware, have seen their market value soar to over $3 trillion. In just two years, Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged eightfold. Super Micro Computer, which provides the servers powering AI\u2019s voracious data needs, has followed a similar trajectory. The technology that underpins this growth is genuinely astounding. Yet, as the Associated Press notes, it\u2019s hard to ignore how similar these patterns feel to the 1999 bubble \u2014 a time when investors believed the early internet would mint millionaires out of thin air.\n\nEven the European Central Bank has begun sounding the alarm. In a recent financial review, the ECB warned of an AI stock bubble, suggesting that if AI firms don\u2019t start producing tangible profits, panic could ripple through the global economy. The more feverish the hype, the harder the fall if reality fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cThis concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble,\u201d the ECB said. \u201cAlso, in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nAt the moment, there\u2019s just too much optimism and not enough recognition of what could derail stock momentum, experts seem to warn.\n\nIs This The World\u2019s Most Expensive Gamble?\n\nAnd yet, despite the red flags, the AI juggernaut barrels forward. According to estimates, spending on AI data centers from 2024 to 2027 will exceed $1.4 trillion. These facilities, filled with server racks humming under the weight of immense computation, are the new temples of progress. But as impressive as this investment sounds, only a sliver of American businesses \u2014 about 5% \u2014 have incorporated AI into their services.\n\nThe disparity between investor enthusiasm and business adoption is becoming hard to ignore. While ChatGPT dazzled millions, the electricity needed to train its underlying model, GPT-4, could have powered over three million electric vehicles for an entire year. OpenAI\u2019s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023 \u2014 but it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.\n\nEach new leap in AI capability requires ever more data, ever more energy, and ever more money. It\u2019s a cycle that feels less like a virtuous circle and more like an arms race, spiraling toward a point of diminishing returns.\n\nSome of these constraints are fueling an industry-wide scramble for efficiency. Companies are developing specialized chips and streamlined models to mitigate AI\u2019s insatiable hunger for resources. Yet, as of now, the promises are still largely theoretical.\n\nWhat happens if the money \u2014 and patience \u2014 runs out before the solutions arrive?\n\nThe Silent Revolution in the Office Cubicle\n\nCuriously, while corporations debate the merits of AI, employees are embracing it in secret. Studies suggest that a third of American workers use AI at least once a week, often without their bosses\u2019 knowledge. In some sectors, like software engineering, that figure climbs to nearly 80%. Employees are quietly deploying AI to write reports, debug code, and streamline tedious tasks, but they\u2019re keeping it under wraps, fearful that transparency could lead to heavier workloads or job losses. After all, why are you getting paid if most of your job can be done with the help of AI?\n\nThis clandestine adoption hints at a peculiar paradox: AI may be more disruptive than we realize, but the disruption is happening quietly, in the shadows of office cubicles. This isn\u2019t the AI revolution the hype trains promised. It\u2019s a whisper, not a roar.\n\nFor businesses, this means AI adoption is as much about culture as it is about technology. Companies that foster openness and experimentation could harness AI\u2019s full potential, while those clinging to old management styles might miss the boat entirely.\n\nThe Year of Reckoning?\n\nSo, what happens next? 2025 looms large. It could be the year AI makes good on its promise, with breakthroughs in fields as diverse as drug discovery and military defense. Or it could be the year the bubble finally bursts under the weight of unmet expectations.\n\nHistory offers no certainties, but it does offer patterns. The dot-com bubble wasn\u2019t just a story of irrational exuberance; it was also a story of real innovation that eventually found its footing. The internet did transform the world \u2014 just not in the exponential, uninterrupted path investors had hoped for. Perhaps AI is in for a similar treatment: a cataclysmic stock market crash that would hamper progress for a few years while at the same time sanitizing the industry by removing inefficient companies; then, only after a recovery, perhaps will AI make good on its many promises. Just like Pets.com was ahead of its time, so too maybe is the current AI hype train.\n\nThe hype may fade. Stocks may tumble. But beneath the surface, the technology could continue to mature, slowly and steadily finding its place in our lives. As the frenzy quiets down, we may discover that the most profound changes often happen in the spaces between bubbles \u2014 not with a pop, but with a quiet breath of reality."

            "article_content": "A pro-Palestine essay has cost Prahlad Iyengar his career at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nHe was pursuing a PhD from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but his five-year National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship will be terminated now.\n\nMIT has barred the Indian-origin student from entering the college premises over the essay, written in the college magazine last month, that the institute found calling for violence.\n\nWritten Revolution is a multidisciplinary student magazine, about the pro-Palestine movement, that published Iyengar's essay. It has also been banned.\n\nThe essay that Iyengar wrote is called 'On Pacifism'. As stated by The Commune Magazine, although not directly calling for violent resistance, the essay speaks that pacifist tactics might not be the best recourse for Palestine.\n\nThe essay features a logo of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organisation according to the US State Department. However, Iyengar said that the charges of terrorism on him are only because of the photos in the essay which were not provided by him.\n\n\"The administration accuses me of supporting 'terrorism', because the edition in which my article appears includes images of posters from the Popular Front for the Liberation and of containing violent imagery in the publication,\" his statement said, which was shared by his lawyer Eric Lee on X.\n\nAccording to the college, the essay had language that \"could be interpreted as a call for more violent or destructive forms of protests at MIT\". The MIT Dean of Student Life, David Warren Randall emailed this to the magazine's editors.\n\nIyengar has raised an issue of the lack of freedom of speech in American campuses. But this is not the first time he has been suspended.\n\nHe was suspended last year after the pro-Palestine demonstrations.\n\nAn \"extraordinary action\" is what he believes his suspension is.\n\n\"These extraordinary actions should concern everyone on camp,\" he says in the statement. \"Expelling me and banning Written Revolution from campus as a result of this article would mark an unprecedented attack on the rights of the entire student body and faculty. Consider the precedent MIT has set.\"\n\nThe MIT Coalition Against Apartheid has started a protest against MIT's decision. \"Prahlad is now appealing his case with the Chancellor to reduce the unjust sanctions against him. We have launched a campaign to put pressure on MIT's administration to stop criminalising students who stand on the right side of history. We call on all organisations and institutions of conscience to sign up and stand up to MIT's repression,\" said the coalition in a statement.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 MIT is effectively expelling PhD student Prahlad Iyengar for Palestine activism on campus. \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RALLY: Cambridge City Hall, Monday, 12/9 at 5:30pm. Org sign-on to letter: https://t.co/tCOrOLTeNy pic.twitter.com/7cAYrvn5ad \u2014 MIT Coalition Against Apartheid (@mit_caa) December 8, 2024\n\nAs per a report in The Boston Globe, the president of MIT Graduate Student Union, Sophie Coppieters 't Wallant said, \"The fact that MIT is choosing to threaten student livelihood and careers simply because they don't agree with what students are speaking up and protesting for is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe coalition held a rally supporting Iyengar at Cambridge City Hall on December 9."
