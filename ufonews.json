His new book \u2014 \u201cImminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt For UFOs\u201d \u2014 goes even deeper.\n\n\u201cIt had to be reviewed by the Pentagon, which took almost a year,\u201d said the 52-year-old of the book\u2019s publishing process.\u201d\n\nThe same Times article states how Department of Defense spokeswoman, Sue Gough, has confirmed that the program is still continuing its review of historical UFO records but \u201chas not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession of reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Duolingo, primarily known for its language-learning app, is expanding into the hardware space with an electronic piano for those taking its music course. The company is also rolling out OpenAI-powered video calls to all iOS Duolingo Max subscribers and is adding more game-like \"adventures\" with new virtual settings to explore.\n\nDuolingo is launching its e-piano with Loog, a musical instrument manufacturer that produces keyboards and guitars for kids. It will cost $249 and can be purchased on Duolingo's website.\n\nThe learning company is also now launching its Video Calls feature, which was beta-tested this year with some paying Duolingo Max users. Video Calls consist of a chat with the 2D Duolingo character \"Lily,\" who has purple hair and a big personality. These conversations can be about just about anything and don't follow any strict lesson plan. Instead, they're a chance for language learners to have spontaneous conversations in real-time to improve their language production and listening skills.\n\nLily is essentially a fine-tuned version of ChatGPT. The chats use OpenAI's tech to power these conversations in English, French, or Spanish. Lily can remember what you've said before, as well, so you shouldn't have to repeat yourself too much when you reunite. She should be able to remember what you've said for the past few sessions, according to Zan Gilani, product manager at Duolingo.\n\n\"We tried a bunch of things in the past,\" Gilani tells PCMag in an interview. \"With large language models, we can finally give you an experience where you can simulate a real-world conversation and actually get better because it's ultimately a muscle that you have to train.\"\n\nIf you want to talk to Lily, you can. (Credit: Duolingo)\n\nWhile she's just a 2D, AI-powered character, Lily does show some basic visemes\u2014or mouth shapes\u2014to roughly match the words she's saying at any given time. It won't feel quite like a conversation with a real human, but it's certainly better than nothing for those looking for more real-time practice. Because Duolingo has modified its own GPT, it may feel a bit different than just talking on your own with OpenAI's chatbot.\n\n\"If she can understand what you are trying to say, she is going to roll with the punches,\" Gilani says of AI-powered Lily. \"If we start to correct your mistakes too much in real-time, that part of your brain that is correcting yourself\u2014that monitoring part\u2014starts to get really active. And it takes away from just the active communication.\"\n\nDuolingo's also adding more content in case you've gotten bored with its gamified, incremental learning model where you can earn XP and climb its leaderboard. Its \"Adventures\" are basically top-down, 2D room-like environments with interactive characters. These new settings include existing Duolingo characters, like Oscar and Lily, who will help train you up for real-world situations like ordering coffee at a cafe or getting your passport checked while traveling.\n\nDuolingo's Adventures (Credit: Duolingo)\n\n\"We have some experiences which are a bit more game-like and entertaining in that way, and some which are more directly learning-oriented. But overall, we always think there is a way to do both,\" Gilani says. \"And they don't have to contradict each other.\""

For instance, we recently happened upon a free AI web app called AirFry.AI that does one thing really well.\n\nAs the name suggests, this free tool is an AI assistant that helps you cook food in your air fryer. While air fryers are popular in part because they are so easy to use, they can require some trial and error when it comes to cooking times and temperatures for food. As such, you might end up scouring the web to find out how long to cook fries or chicken wings, and if you\u2019ve ever visited a recipe site, you know how far you have to scroll for the information you need.\n\nAirFry.AI is a useful and free AI tool. Image source: AirFry.AI\n\nAirFry.AI removes all of the hassle and tells you precisely what you need to know. Input the food you\u2019re trying to cook, choose between \u00b0C and \u00b0F, and click the \u201cAir Fry\u201d button. When I searched for \u201cfrozen tater tots,\u201d this was the answer: \u201cCook frozen tater tots in an air fryer at 400\u00b0F for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cooking. Enjoy your crispy tater tots!\u201d\n\nNo long-winded videos or lengthy stories about the author\u2019s great-great-grandmother\u2019s original tater tots from the 1800s. Just a simple, precise answer.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nYou can also click on the toggle at the top of the page to switch to recipes. These responses are often longer and more detailed, providing a list of ingredients and a numbered set of instructions. When I searched for \u201cgarlic chicken wings,\u201d AirFry.AI told me how much of each spice to include as well as instructions for mixing, marinating, preheating, and cooking.\n\nObviously, you could use ChatGPT or any other generative AI chatbot for similar purposes, but having it all set up ahead of time makes it less overwhelming."

My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris about what we can look out for around the house that could mean we\u2019re the subject of a \u2018classic haunting\u2019.\n\nBarri Ghai and Jayne Harris on Help! My House is Haunted (Discovery+)\n\nTemperature Changes\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai explains this is a \u2018common\u2019 sign or symptom of a haunting.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cPeople have inexplicable cold spots around their home, regardless of how much heating is on or whether doors and windows are closed,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe Unexplained\n\nHistorian and psychologist Harris advises keeping an ear and an eye out for the little unexplained things in your home.\n\nTypically, we all know which floorboards or steps in our home creek when we step on them, so if you hear that squeak while you\u2019re not there, \u2018you know that is unexplained, you know there\u2019s something there\u2019.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cGo with your gut instinct,\u201d she says. \u201cLook out for the little things. Often people will find things go missing or things move, and they will find them in places where they know they\u2019ve looked.\u201d\n\nGhai says to watch out for temperature changes (Discovery+)\n\nThe Feeling of Being Watched\n\n\u201cSometimes people walk around their own homes,\u201d Ghai says. \u201cEven though it\u2019s their stuff, they feel like they\u2019re trespassing. And then they feel that they have eyes on them.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nIn this case, he says to trust yourself because \u2018the human body is the best paranormal detector\u2019.\n\nCorner of the Eye Spots\n\nSimilarly, Harris says while we are \u2018very perceptive\u2019, we\u2019ll often just \u2018try and explain things away\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re sat watching the TV one night, and you think you've just seen someone walk past the door, a lot of people would just be like \u2018it\u2019s nothing\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut if it happens again on a separate occasion, it could be something.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cTrust yourself, trust your instincts. You know your house, you know when things don't feel quite right.\u201d\n\nHarris advises to try and be logical (Discovery+)\n\nAnomalous Sounds\n\nGhai says this one crops \u2018up time and time again\u2019 in cases he sees where people hear everything from \u2018whispering and chatting to actual spoken words\u2019.\n\n\u201cOr in the more sinister cases, someone whose voice is familiar to you,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s that mimicking sound - so your mum calling your name, but your mum's not there.\n\n\u201cThat kind of thing that happens a lot.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s a haunting\n\nWhile all of these can be classed as key signs of a haunting by the pros, obviously, you do need to rationalise as Harris says you shouldn\u2019t just \u2018assume\u2019 that\u2019s what it means.\n\n\u201cCheck for the logical things,\u201d she advises, urging to double check that windows are closed and the radiator\u2019s working if you get those cold spots.\n\n\u201cBecause it's only when you rule out all of those logical explanations that you're left with potentially a paranormal case,\u201d Harris adds.\n\nBut she does warn that once you\u2019re properly suspicious there is something in your house you should get \u2018professional advice\u2019.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and communicate with whatever you think might be there if you're not experienced in doing it, because it can make things worse,\u201d she warns.\n\nSpooky.\n\nSeries six of Help! My House is Haunted airs on Really, Fridays at 9pm. It\u2019s also available to stream on Discovery+."

I was also present when this particular participant suddenly spoke in English and introduced himself as \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 and told us \u2018his\u2019 story,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the truth of this story and the existence of \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 cannot be verified, the old uncompleted mansion\u2019s environment alone is enough to send shivers down the spine of faint-hearted visitors.\n\nThe construction of Kellie\u2019s Castle, also known as Kellas House, started in 1915, initiated by its owner (William Kellie Smith), a civil engineer from Scotland who came to Malaya to venture into the rubber planting and tin-mining industries.\n\nHowever, Smith died of pneumonia in 1926. At that time, the construction of the mansion had only reached 70 percent completion.\n\nFollowing his demise, the construction work was suspended and the property was eventually sold to a British company Harrisons and Crosfield. It was subsequently abandoned and years later, it became a historical site.\n\nKellie\u2019s Castle manager Hakim Muhaimin shows the laundry room where \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 once worked in. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nDark tourism material\n\nThe spooky atmosphere of Kellie\u2019s Castle \u2013 sprawled over a 2.8-hectare (seven-acre) site \u2013 combined with the eerie sightings and paranormal encounters reported by visitors, make it an ideal destination for dark tourism, a tourism subsector that is gaining increasing attention globally and is expected to continue growing over the next 10 years.\n\nAccording to projections by Future Market Insights, the global dark tourism market is expected to be valued at US$31.89 billion (RM148.68 billion) by the end of this year.\n\nIt also forecasts the market will swell to US$40.82 billion (RM190.32 billion) by 2034. Zamari, who is also Perak Bumiputera Tourism Operators Association president, recognises Kellie\u2019s Castle\u2019s potential for dark tourism-themed activities, stressing the subsector has the potential to invigorate the nation\u2019s tourism industry.\n\nHe said dark tourism is a unique attraction for tourists, adding that although it has already been introduced in this country, it has however not been widely developed by the tourism industry due to certain constraints involving society and the beliefs of local communities.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over the management of Kellie\u2019s Castle in 2013, we thought about what actions or steps could be taken to elevate this location as a tourist attraction because at first glance, there was nothing much there except an old building.\n\n\u201cI then considered what strengths Kellie\u2019s Castle had that could be marketed for tourism purposes. If I focused on its history, not many people would be interested. In terms of the building itself, it mostly appeals to photography and architecture enthusiasts. Ultimately, the idea of dark tourism emerged,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he added, promoting a certain building or place as a dark tourism site is not easy. He believed that in order to offer an authentic paranormal experience at a dark tourism site, supernatural entities must truly exist and originate from the location concerned, not summoned or artificially created.\n\nNight tours\n\nHence, to market Kellie\u2019s Castle as a dark tourism destination, the management had to confirm the \u201cexistence\u201d of paranormal elements.\n\nWith this in mind, Zamari collaborated with a local media outlet in 2015 and \u201cwe successfully detected and documented the presence of an entity (inside Kellie\u2019s Castle), supported by a video recording\u201d.\n\nFollowing this, the management introduced night-time tours of the property on Fridays and Saturdays in the month of October every year.\n\n\u201cWhat we do during the tour (from 8 pm to 11.30 pm) is bring visitors in groups of eight to 16 and guide them through the castle while providing some explanations.\n\n\u201cThen, we leave two people at each specific location such as the wine cellar, laundry room, bedrooms and other areas without flashlights for 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d he said, adding some of the participants reported being \u201cdisturbed\u2019 by mysterious touches, embraces, whispers in their ears and sudden gusts of wind.\n\nZamari stressed he is not in the business of \u201cselling ghosts\u201d but rather offering visitors a unique experience of visiting a site associated with paranormal activity.\n\nHe added that efforts to market Kellie\u2019s Castle as a dark tourism product are being made to further boost the number of visitors to the mansion.\n\nWith its easy accessibility, the Kellie\u2019s Castle ruins in Perak is a popular haunt for thrill seekers and those looking for charming Instagrammable background to their OOTD. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nTourist attraction\n\nZamari, meanwhile, said the tales of paranormal activities at Kellie\u2019s Castle have even impressed the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), which also acknowledged the building\u2019s easy accessibility and the thrilling yet safe ghost-hunting tours offered by its management.\n\nHe said in 2020, PATA \u2013 which has its headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand \u2013 invited them to share their dark tourism experience involving Kellie\u2019s Castle through a virtual meeting attended by 400 delegates.\n\n\u201cAll of them were very excited to hear our stories and experiences in managing dark tourism. They asked many questions and expressed a strong interest in participating in such dark tourism explorations themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nTourism Malaysia has listed Kellie\u2019s Castle as one of the country\u2019s top two horror tourism destinations, alongside the Penang War Museum.\n\nKellie\u2019s Castle manager Hakim Muhaimin said the property is categorised as one of the five most haunted locations in Malaysia by international paranormal researchers and United States-based tourism portals.\n\nHe also said the night tours of the mansion were discontinued during and following the COVID-19 pandemic and plans are afoot to reintroduce them soon.\n\n\u201cBut this time, we plan to offer two types of dark tourism activities \u2013 night tours and sleeping in the castle.\n\n\u201cFor the sleepover in the castle, we will provide the participants with sleeping bags and other equipment,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said dark tourism involving Kellie\u2019s Castle has the potential to succeed due to the high demand for it particularly the \u2018Sleeping in the Castle\u2019 activity for which \u201cwe have already received inquiries from Singaporeans\u201d.\n\nHe also hoped the authorities would increase the number of dark tourism locations in the country to support the growth of the tourism industry and suggested that this subsector be widely promoted during Visit Malaysia Year 2025.\n\nAccording to the 2023 Tourism Malaysia Report, the country earned over RM71.3 billion from the arrival of 20.14 million tourists last year, while Vietnam\u2019s media organisation Vnexpress International ranked Malaysia as the most-visited country in Southeast Asia in 2023. \u2014 Bernama"

This lightning bolt of discovery comes in the form of a new analysis of various mineralogy maps of the Moon, which indicate there could be loads of water and hydroxyl all over the surface of Earth\u2019s little satellite.\n\nThis discovery has huge implications for future space endeavors for our lunar body, too. See, hydroxyl is a molecule made up of both hydrogen and oxygen, and according to the latest analysis, it can be found in multiple locations all across the lunar latitudes.\n\nThis means that astronauts may not be tied to visiting the lunar south pole on future missions to acquire water. Instead, they may be able to find water everywhere on the Moon. That\u2019s very surprising and exciting because, for the most part, the lunar surface is devoid of moisture.\n\nImage source: helen_f / Adobe\n\nThere aren\u2019t any beautiful lakes, rivers, or even puddles on the Moon. Past studies have shown that water could be hidden deep underground on the Moon or even in larger lunar craters\u2014places never touched by direct light and the heat of the sun.\n\nTech.

The researchers also found that the amount of water signature found in pyroxene\u2014a type of igneous rock found on the Moon\u2014can change depending on the angle at which sunlight hits it.\n\nThat is, of course, exceptionally interesting, and raises more questions about the Moon and how much water-rich material is found on the surface and even deeper. Additionally, researchers are trying to understand the lunar swirls and exactly what causes them. Perhaps future expeditions to the Moon\u2014like the upcoming Artemis missions\u2014could provide us with more in-depth insights."

        "article_content": "A new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters reveals that scientists have identified a greater number of black holes in the early universe than previously thought, shedding light on the formation of these cosmic giants shortly after the Big Bang.\n\nThe research, led by astronomers from Stockholm University, utilised NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to survey faint galaxies that existed when the universe was only a few percent of its current age.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlack holes are known to play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, yet their origins remain a mystery.\n\nThe study's co-author, Alice Young, a PhD student at Stockholm University, noted that many of these early black holes appear to be more massive than expected for such an early time in cosmic history.\n\nThis suggests they either formed with significant mass or grew rapidly through accretion of surrounding material.\n\nTo investigate black hole formation mechanisms, the research team re-photographed initial observations taken by Hubble several years earlier. They measured variations in galaxy brightness\u2014indicators of black hole presence\u2014resulting in the identification of more black holes than previous methods had revealed. This is a new image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nThe findings indicate that some black holes likely formed from the collapse of massive, pristine stars during the first billion years after the Big Bang. These early stars were unique, as later generations became enriched with elements from previous stellar explosions.\n\nOther potential formation scenarios include collapsing gas clouds and mergers of stars within massive clusters. Additionally, primordial black holes may have formed through speculative mechanisms in the universe's infancy.\n\nMatthew Hayes, lead author and astronomer at Stockholm University, emphasized that understanding how early black holes formed is essential for piecing together the puzzle of galaxy evolution.\n\nWith this new data, researchers can refine models of how galaxies and their central black holes evolve together.\n\nIn tandem with these findings, astronomers are using the James Webb Space Telescope to further explore galactic black holes formed soon after the Big Bang, aiming to uncover their masses and locations in the early universe.\n\nThis ongoing research is pivotal for unraveling the mysteries surrounding black hole formation and their influence on galaxy development.\n\nPublished By: Sibu Kumar Tripathi Published On: Sep 23, 2024"

In the first eight months of 2022, the US saw 15.47 billion visitors to piracy websites .\n\nIn the first eight months of 2022, the . In 2023, software piracy was a major contributor to revenue loss for 40% of software suppliers \u2013 up from just 17% the year before.\n\nIn 2023, software piracy was \u2013 up from just 17% the year before. In 2023, as many as 33% of IT companies reported losing 6\u201310% of their revenue to software piracy, and 8% even said that the loss exceeded 30%.\n\nIllegal Software Downloads Statistics\n\nTo kick things off, we\u2019ll take a look at the numbers and figures on illegally downloaded software over the last few years.\n\nHow Much Software is Pirated\n\nOverall, software was the second-most-pirated type of media in 2023, after TV shows, making up 26.2% of the pirated items on the web that year.\n\nAnd although in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic (2017 specifically), the level of software piracy dropped from 39% to 37%, the pandemic years saw it go up again by 20-30%.\n\nMuso reports that in 2023, there have been 15.2 billion visits to software piracy websites worldwide. That figure is a 14.1% YoY increase from 8.75 billion visitors registered in the first eight months of 2022.\n\nThese eight months showed a 10% increase in software piracy compared to 2021.\n\nFrom January 2017 until November 2023, there were approximately 84.77 billion visits to software piracy websites. That\u2019s like every person on Earth visiting software piracy sites 10 times on average over this period.\n\nBSA tells us that almost 37% of all software on users\u2019 PCs is pirated. The market value of this unlicensed software is $46.3 billion.\n\nWhat Software is Pirated & How\n\nAs the following chart shows, mobile software was the most commonly pirated software in 2023, accounting for 36% of all illegal software downloads.\n\nIt was closely followed by desktop software at 30%. Moreover, it\u2019s estimated that as much as 37% of software worldwide is unlicensed.\n\nIn terms of how the software has been pirated, the 2021 Muso report states that 73.5% of it was illegally downloaded from the web and the rest from torrenting sites.\n\nThe data tells us that 100% of all illegally downloaded software was pirated through web downloads in 2022 and 2023.\n\nMost of the traffic (61.5%) was direct in 2022, but in 2023, 42% of it was via search engines when people looked for software piracy.\n\nSoftware Piracy Statistics by Region\n\nSoftware piracy is prevalent in many regions around the world. However, certain regions suffer more from it than others.\n\nAs this chart shows, piracy is particularly prevalent in China, Russia, the US, and India. Ukraine and Italy were also among the top 10 countries for piracy.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the biggest regions in the world for more details on software piracy.\n\nEMEA\n\nEurope may have robust anti-piracy laws, such as the EU Copyright Directive and the CPDA in the UK. But it nonetheless is home to significant software piracy.\n\nFor instance, the UK is among the top 20 countries for using pirated software.\n\nIn 2021, there were approximately 2.7 million British infringers of software copyrights, as you\u2019ll see in the chart below. Moreover, as many as 38% of surveyed Brits had pirated software in 2022.\n\nThe post-pandemic spike in piracy is likely due to the increasingly high cost of living in the UK.\n\nOther countries in the region have similar problems. For example, Russia accounted for over 8.5% of all software piracy worldwide in 2023.\n\nThis isn\u2019t surprising, given the international sanctions and software companies pulling out of the region due to the geopolitical situation.\n\nUkraine and Italy take the seventh and ninth spots among the top 20 countries that use pirated software.\n\nIran is another country in the EMEA region that\u2019s subject to sanctions that restrict the use of certain software, so it\u2019s not surprising that Iran ranked eighth.\n\nThe Americas\n\nIn the Americas, the US, Brazil, and Mexico are leaders in illegal software downloads, ranking among the top 20 countries for software piracy.\n\nThe US ranked third in the world in 2023 for software piracy, and this is actually an improvement. One year prior, the US was top of the list for the highest rates of software piracy.\n\nIn the first eight months of 2022 alone, the US had seen 15.47 billion visitors to piracy websites.\n\nAs for the previous years, as you can see from the graph above, the US and Brazil had relatively small shares of visitors to software piracy sites.\n\nThe largest shares in that time period (2020\u20132021) were held by Russia (7.2% to 8.02%) and China (see below).\n\nAPAC\n\nAccording to BSA, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region has the highest rate of software piracy in the world \u2013 61%. Given the number of APAC countries in the top 20 countries for software piracy, this isn\u2019t surprising.\n\nTake China, for example. In 2021, China had the highest number of visitors to software piracy websites in the world. In Q3 of 2021 alone, China had 467 million people visiting software piracy websites.\n\nThe figure made up 14.6% of all software privacy site visitors in the world that quarter (3.2 billion).\n\nHowever, in 2022, India shortly overtook China, becoming the third country for piracy rates, after the USA and Russia.\n\nHowever, according to Revenera, as of 2023, the PRC (excluding Hong Kong) is once again the leader in software piracy worldwide.\n\nOther APAC countries in the top 20 are Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, and Australia. Regarding Australia in particular, BSA reports that 20% of Aussies use pirated software.\n\nImpact of Software Piracy on the Market\n\nIn 2023, software piracy was a major cause of revenue loss for 40% of software suppliers \u2013 up from just 17% the year before.\n\nThis significant increase is a testament to the huge adverse impact of software piracy on the market. In 2023, as many as 33% of IT companies reported losing 6\u201310% of their revenue to software piracy.\n\n8% even said that the loss exceeded 30% of revenue. Moreover, 15% of companies don\u2019t even know how much they\u2019re losing to piracy.\n\nIn addition to financial impacts, software piracy can adversely impact a brand\u2019s reputation. In many cases, pirated software isn\u2019t subject to quality control and can have a negative impact on user experience.\n\nMoreover, in 2022, as many as 50% of people who downloaded pirated content, including software, reported malware infecting their devices.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that software is a type of creative work, and pirating it is just as harmful to creators as pirating music or books.\n\nIn practice, this erosion of IP stifles programmers\u2019 creativity and harms their competitive advantage and revenue.\n\nAddressing Software Piracy\n\nThe issue of software privacy is complex, and combating it requires a multifaceted approach. The stakeholders involved are legislators, technical experts, and educators, to name a few.\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll go over the building blocks of combating software piracy, including legislative and technical measures.\n\nLaws & Regulations\n\nSeveral international laws, such as the Berne Convention and the TRIPS agreement, standardize protection against any sort of piracy, including software.\n\nMany countries have adopted their own laws on a local level, such as the Digital Economy Act in the UK.\n\nHowever, the enforcement of such laws, on both a local and global scale, depends on the police\u2019s capacity and international cooperation.\n\nIn addition to the legislation, there are a lot of case law and lawsuits illustrating the impact of software piracy. For instance:\n\nBITMANAGEMENT SOFTWARE GMBH vs. The United States (2016\u20132022), which saw the US Navy pay out almost $155,000 for the illegal use of 3D modeling software.\n\nBITMANAGEMENT SOFTWARE GMBH vs. The United States (2016\u20132022), which saw the US Navy pay out almost $155,000 for the illegal use of 3D modeling software. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot vs. J. Doe (2022\u2013 present), where developers sued Microsoft and OpenAI for allegedly pirating the developers\u2019 software to train AI systems. The case is still undecided.\n\nThese cases, as well as others, prove the adverse economic impact of software piracy. However, they also evidence the fact that the existing piracy protections aren\u2019t always sufficient.\n\nFor instance, the German software company that sued the US Navy in the 2016 case received much less than the original $155.4 million in damages it claimed.\n\nAnd a month ago, the judge in the Copilot case partially dismissed some piracy claims.\n\nTechnical Measures\n\nDigital Rights Management (DRM) tools represent an important technical measure against software piracy. Such solutions are already widely used by creators and companies to protect their IP, such as software.\n\nFor software products, DRMs can range from license activation keys and cloud verification to digital watermarking and geographical restrictions.\n\nPopular business software subscription models like SaaS are also a type of DRM in a way, as they allow users to subscribe to the software rather than own a copy of it.\n\nSuch DRM methods can be effective. But they can also be frustrating for consumers, as they\u2019re often seen as limiting fair use.\n\nWhat Does the Future of Software Piracy Look Like?\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear what will await the murky digital landscape of software piracy. Based on current trends and how rapidly piracy methods are evolving, we believe the issue will only persist.\n\nBefore new laws and anti-piracy protections catch up, we might see a few new privacy developments.\n\nNew Methods of Piracy\n\nWith the advancements and developments of DRMs like SaaS, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that software piracy methods will also advance beyond what we know today.\n\nAnd while AI can help combat these threats, we should also consider how it can assist malicious actors with new piracy approaches, such as reverse engineering.\n\nFor instance, given that SaaS is hosted on the cloud, pirates may target that infrastructure in the future to access the platforms.\n\nAchieving that would require employing social engineering and phishing to steal credentials \u2013 two tactics prevalent in cybercrime today.\n\nNew Types of Piracy\n\nIn addition to new methods of piracy, the prevalence of SaaS and other subscription models might also encourage the development of new types of piracy.\n\nIt\u2019s true that cloud-based SaaS deployment makes it challenging to download and distribute copies like traditional software pirates usually do.\n\nHowever, the shift to a subscription model can cause increased instances of unauthorized account sharing and the rise of illegal monetization of subscription credentials.\n\nTo address this potential issue, companies might have to invest in more sophisticated DRM systems. For example, they can be powered by blockchain technologies.\n\nSuch technologies would help track the usage of SaaS licenses and curb unauthorized use.\n\nEnforcement Challenges\n\nEarlier, we touched upon the challenges of international cooperation in software piracy law enforcement.\n\nThe global nature of the Internet and the cloud, economic disparities, and international sanctions worsen these challenges.\n\nFor instance, although many SaaS companies have left Russia, their software is still available thanks to the country\u2019s relaxed piracy laws.\n\nIt\u2019s, therefore, challenging for companies like Microsoft to enforce licensing restrictions in such sanctioned regions.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nSoftware piracy is a complex issue that remains prevalent today. In this guide, we reviewed the software piracy statistics around the world in recent years.\n\nWe saw that the APAC region takes the crown for software piracy, but Russia and the US aren\u2019t far behind. We also saw that software piracy adversely impacts the software market and the tech industry as a whole.\n\nAnd yet, addressing software piracy remains a significant challenge, not least due to tech advancements and ever-evolving piracy methods. Enforcement of piracy and copyright laws is also difficult in many jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, technological advancements can also help hinder malicious actors. The key is to employ them smartly and have robust enforcement frameworks in place.\n\nSources"
