Donald Trump says. Shoot first and ask questions later. Speculation is for suckers.\n\n\u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country,\u201d the president-elect posted on Truth Social. \u201cCan this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThe government says not to worry. Which, of course, is what worries people the most.\n\nUntil most recently, the official response has been sketchy, sluggish and anything but helpful or reassuring.\n\nAs of last week, thankfully, the feds finally were providing a coherent reaction.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, The Associated Press reports, the Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flights in 30 areas in New York and 22 in New Jersey, through mid-January. FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials say their agencies are looking into the sightings but have seen little evidence to suggest safety or security threats.\n\nWhat most people are seeing, officials say, are law-abiding, garden-variety drones. Or airplanes. Or helicopters. Or stars.\n\nThese are plausible answers. But many Americans remain unconvinced.\n\nThere are, of course, lots of precedents for our tin-hat predilections. \u201cYes, they can control the weather,\u201d a member of Congress posted on X only weeks ago, presumably about members of the other party. A vaccine denier may soon head the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Then there was a spate of clown sightings in 2016. (You can look it up.)\n\nBut the most famous was the \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d a 1938 radio drama about a Martian invasion based on H.G. Wells\u2019 science fiction novel that some Americans mistook as the real thing.\n\nIt all sounds like an episode of the \u201cX-Files,\u201d the popular old Fox series in which a pair of mismatched FBI agents delved weekly (9 Eastern, 8 Central Time) into monsters, aliens and labyrinthine conspiracies.\n\nSpecial agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder were an odd coupling of \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you\u201d-ism versus \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me-\u201d-ism. Mulder was the true believer, Scully the skeptic.\n\nI\u2019m more Scully than Mulder.\n\nI live in a neighborhood near enough to PTI Airport and far enough from city lights that the night sky is often vast and dark enough to reveal twinkling stars and a constant array of air traffic, some of it close and bright enough to resemble gliding Christmas trees.\n\nOccasionally, an aircraft headed for PTI will appear to be a UFO, sitting silent and still in the heavens. But it\u2019s always an illusion, a plane approaching head-on that only appears to be hovering until it turns toward the runway and you can hear the roar of its engines.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve hoped for a UFO sighting, just for the thrill of it. But I\u2019ve yet to see even one.\n\nAs for the mass hysteria over drones, it\u2019s another sign to me of the blessings of not living in a war-torn place like Gaza or Ukraine, where drones are ubiquitous and deadly, armed with missiles, bombs and bullets.\n\nSo, for now, at least, I\u2019m not buying the Drone Conspiracy.\n\nIn the end, maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. (Scully was in the \u201cX-Files.\u201d The aliens turned out to be real, as did many of the monsters of the week.)\n\nOn a more serious note, the ebbing faith in government and other institutions (insurance companies, media, big business, schools and universities) is for real and it is disturbing and unhealthy.\n\nWhen the center does not hold, things fall apart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a lot scarier than blinking lights in the night."

The orbs, described as spherical and roughly three feet in diameter, zipped by his aircraft at an estimated distance of only 20 feet.\n\n\"It could've been a bad result if they had actually hit me,\" Chiao told NewsNation. \"It happened so quick, there wasn't even a chance to get scared.\"\n\nDespite their proximity, the objects were not detected on radar or by the FAA-required transponders visible on Chiao's cockpit display. Air traffic control did not alert him to any nearby aircraft, adding to the enigma.\n\n\"I don't know what it was,\" Chiao admitted, describing the sighting as both \"mysterious\" and \"disconcerting.\"\n\nGovernment transparency and the drone mystery\n\nChiao's encounter comes amid a surge of drone and UFO sightings across the United States, many near sensitive military installations and urban centers. These incidents have sparked widespread concern and speculation about their origins, with theories ranging from foreign espionage to top-secret military programs to extraterrestrial activity.\n\nChiao leans toward the explanation that the orbs may be advanced military drones, but he remains cautious.\n\n\"At first blush, to me, it seems like some kind of a military program, our military,\" he said. \"And if it's not that, then it gets a little more scary.\"\n\nIn the past month, reports of drone and UFO activity have increased dramatically, particularly in the northeastern United States. New Jersey, for example, has seen a flurry of sightings, including reports of SUV-sized drones hovering near residential areas.\n\nBelleville Mayor Michael Melham, a vocal critic of the federal government's handling of the issue, recently expressed frustration after attending a \"mayors-only\" briefing on the topic.\n\n\"The mayors are livid,\" journalist Michael Shellenberger reported, citing one mayor's account of automobile-sized drones hovering near his home."

            "article_content": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has predicted a future that could significantly transform the software industry. He envisions AI agents replacing traditional applications and SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms. This shift, driven by the rapid evolution of AI, would eliminate conventional user interfaces and static business logic, fundamentally changing how businesses and individuals interact with technology. Nadella\u2019s vision emphasizes the potential of AI to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and redefine software\u2019s role in daily life.\n\nImagine no longer dealing with clunky software interfaces or spending hours learning another application. Instead, you could simply instruct an intelligent agent to complete tasks seamlessly and efficiently. According to Satya Nadella, this future is closer than we think. He predicts a significant transformation in the software industry, where AI-driven agents directly interact with data, bypassing traditional apps and platforms. This innovative approach promises to alter how we engage with technology fundamentally.\n\nHow AI Agents Could Replace Applications\n\nWhat would this mean for the tools we rely on, the developers who create them, and the businesses that depend on them? The implications are substantial, influencing software design and business operations. While such a transformation might seem overwhelming, it offers the promise of a simpler, more intuitive way of working. In this guide by Matthew Berman, provide more insight into Nadella\u2019s vision, explore the impact of AI agents, and consider what this shift could mean for the future of technology\u2014and for those who use it.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicts AI agents will replace traditional software and SaaS platforms, eliminating the need for static user interfaces and workflows.\n\nAI agents dynamically interact with databases to execute tasks, offering greater flexibility and simplifying user interactions without relying on predefined application layers.\n\nThe rise of AI agents could disrupt SaaS models and redefine developers\u2019 roles, shifting focus from building static applications to training AI models and optimizing database interactions.\n\nAI agents will transform backend systems by seamlessly interacting with multiple databases, allowing businesses to optimize infrastructure and streamline operations without being tied to specific technology stacks.\n\nMicrosoft is leading this AI-driven shift with tools like Copilot and AI-native applications, aiming to enhance productivity and position itself at the forefront of this industry transformation.\n\nAI agents are central to this anticipated transformation. Unlike traditional software, which relies on fixed user interfaces and predefined workflows, AI agents operate dynamically. These agents interact directly with databases to execute tasks, bypassing the need for application layers and offering a more seamless user experience.\n\nFor example:\n\nInstead of navigating a complex CRM system, you could simply instruct an AI agent to retrieve customer data, analyze trends, or generate reports in real time.\n\nAI agents adapt to specific needs without requiring extensive reprogramming, offering greater flexibility compared to traditional software.\n\nBy removing rigid structures and static workflows, AI agents promise a more intuitive and efficient way to handle tasks. This dynamic approach could significantly reduce the learning curve for users, making technology more accessible and user-friendly.\n\nImplications for SaaS Platforms and Developers\n\nThe rise of AI agents could disrupt the SaaS model, which currently dominates the software industry. SaaS applications typically act as user-friendly layers over databases, offering predefined functionality. However, AI agents can autonomously perform these tasks, potentially rendering traditional SaaS platforms less relevant.\n\nFor developers, this shift will redefine their roles and responsibilities:\n\nInstead of building static applications, developers may focus on training AI models to handle complex tasks and optimizing database interactions for efficiency.\n\nRepetitive coding tasks could be managed by AI-driven code generation tools, freeing developers to concentrate on higher-level problem-solving and innovation.\n\nThis evolution could lead to a more dynamic and creative development process. Developers will need to adapt by acquiring skills in AI training, data management, and system optimization, making sure they remain relevant in an AI-driven landscape.\n\nAgents Will Replace ALL Software\n\nHere are additional guides from our expansive article library that you may find useful on AI agents.\n\nThe Changing Role of Databases and Backend Systems\n\nAs AI agents become more prevalent, the role of databases and backend systems will also evolve. These agents will seamlessly interact with multiple databases, selecting the most efficient options for specific tasks. This decoupling of software from backend systems allows businesses to prioritize performance, scalability, and flexibility without being tied to a single technology stack.\n\nFor instance:\n\nAn AI agent could retrieve customer data from one database, process it using another, and generate actionable insights\u2014all without relying on a dedicated application to mediate these interactions.\n\nThis approach enables businesses to optimize their infrastructure, reduce costs, and streamline operations. By using AI agents, companies can focus on achieving their strategic goals without being constrained by traditional software limitations.\n\nAI-Driven Business Logic and Operational Efficiency\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of this shift is the integration of business logic directly into AI agents. Tasks that traditionally required separate tools or applications\u2014such as generating reports, sending emails, or conducting data analysis\u2014can now be handled autonomously by AI.\n\nConsider this scenario:\n\nYou instruct an AI agent to analyze sales data and generate a Python script for deeper insights.\n\nInstead of relying on tools like Excel or specialized software, the agent performs these tasks independently, delivering results faster and with fewer resources.\n\nBy embedding business logic into AI agents, companies can streamline workflows, reduce reliance on traditional software, and enhance operational efficiency. This integration could also lead to cost savings, as businesses no longer need to invest in multiple software solutions to perform routine tasks.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Strategy for an AI-Driven Future\n\nMicrosoft is positioning itself as a leader in this transformation, using its existing tools and expertise to drive the adoption of AI agents. The company\u2019s tools, such as Copilot, integrated into applications like Excel and Word, exemplify its vision for AI-native business solutions. These agents automate repetitive tasks, provide intelligent recommendations, and enhance productivity, showcasing the potential of AI to transform everyday workflows.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft is investing heavily in the development of AI-native applications that fully use this technology. By embedding AI into its core offerings, the company aims to stay ahead in an industry poised for disruption. This strategy not only reinforces Microsoft\u2019s commitment to innovation but also positions it as a key player in shaping the future of software.\n\nBroader Implications for Businesses and Consumers\n\nThe impact of AI agents will extend far beyond enterprise software, influencing both businesses and consumers in profound ways. For consumers, this shift could mean fewer standalone applications and more integrated, task-oriented solutions. Interacting with data will become more intuitive, as traditional interfaces give way to conversational and adaptive AI agents capable of understanding and responding to user needs in real time.\n\nFor businesses, adapting to this new paradigm will be critical. Companies that embrace AI-driven tools will gain a competitive edge, using the efficiency and flexibility of AI agents to streamline operations and enhance decision-making. Conversely, those that resist this change risk falling behind in an increasingly dynamic and technology-driven market.\n\nThe ability to effectively integrate AI agents into existing workflows could become a key determinant of success. Businesses will need to invest in training, infrastructure, and strategic planning to fully capitalize on the opportunities presented by this transformation.\n\nA New Era for Software\n\nSatya Nadella\u2019s prediction signals a fundamental restructuring of the software industry. By replacing traditional applications with AI agents, both businesses and consumers stand to benefit from more efficient, flexible, and intuitive technology. This transformation will redefine roles, disrupt existing models, and open new avenues for innovation. As AI agents become the norm, the software landscape will undergo a profound evolution, ushering in a new era of technological advancement and opportunity.\n\nMedia Credit: Matthew Berman\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "What's one way to charge more than $1,000 for a laptop in this day and age? Slap an \"AI\" sticker on it. Acer is not the only offender\u2014looking at you, Microsoft, forcing your Copilot key onto keyboards\u2014but the company has enthusiastically boarded the bandwagon with the Swift 14 AI AMD (starts at $1,199.99; $1,299.99 as tested), a notebook with a squiggly symbol on the touchpad that lights up when you use an AI app. Artificial hoopla aside, the Swift is a capable ultraportable laptop. However, it fails to unseat the Editors' Choice-award-winning Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406), which isn't as fast but has a superior screen and costs hundreds less.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Covering All the CPU Bases\n\nThe Swift 14 AI AMD\u2014you'll find Intel and Arm versions, too\u2014starts at $1,199.99 with 16GB of RAM, which is on sale for $999 at the time of publishing. However, this test unit (model SF14-61T-R3U1) doubles the memory for an extra $100. It also carries a 10-core AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor with Radeon 880M integrated graphics, a 1TB NVMe solid-state drive, and a 14-inch, 1,920-by-1,200-pixel IPS touch screen.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe system's web page on Acer.com trumpets two non-touch display options with higher 3K resolution\u2014one IPS with a 120Hz refresh rate and one OLED with 90Hz\u2014but Acer disappointingly confirms they're not available in the U.S.\n\nOn the positive side, the Swift lands right on our ultraportable weight line at 3.0 pounds, compared with 3.47 pounds for the HP OmniBook Ultra 14. Measuring 0.74 by 12.3 by 8.8 inches, it's a fraction trimmer than that laptop as well. Its anodized aluminum chassis has passed MIL-STD 810H tests for sturdiness, but you'll still feel a bit of flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nSlim bezels surround the screen, which opens 180 degrees and has a top lip to ease one-handed opening. The 1440p webcam centered above has a sliding privacy shutter and IR face recognition, joining a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button to give you two ways to skip passwords with Windows Hello.\n\nThe laptop's left side holds two USB4 Type-C ports, either suitable for the AC adapter, along with an always-on USB 3.2 Type-A port and an HDMI monitor port. Another USB-A port joins an audio jack at the right. Along with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth, this is a satisfactory array of connections. However, I would be happier with USB-C ports on both sides (so the AC adapter cord can't interfere with external mouse users) and an option for mobile broadband.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nUsing the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Ai-Yi-Yi, It's AI\n\nAlong with the usual shortcuts for screen brightness, audio volume, and airplane mode, the top row has a key to launch AcerSense, a utility that combines system info and updates, diagnostics, power/cooling settings, and three Windows Store apps. These are LiveArt, which creates AI-filtered stickers from your photos; AlterView, which provides adjustable animated wallpapers; and GIMP, the robust but less consumer-friendly rival to Adobe Photoshop.\n\nA feature called Acer User Sensing taps the IR webcam to log you in when you approach and dim the screen or lock the system when you move away, as well as nagging you to take regular screen breaks and not get too close to the display. Acer QuickPanel pops up during video calls to provide AI-enhanced PurifiedView image and PurifiedVoice audio enhancements.

The Dell XPS 14 and Asus Zenbook S 14 have Intel Core Ultra 7 power. So does our test unit's more costly cousin, the Acer Swift X 14, whose Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 instead of integrated graphics makes it the champion of our GPU benchmarks.

It's certainly suitable for content creation as well as routine productivity.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe challenge laptops' graphics with a quartet of animations or gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite. Wild Life (1440p) and Wild Life Extreme (4K) use the Vulkan graphics API to measure GPU speeds. Steel Nomad's regular and Light subtests focus on APIs more commonly used for game development, like Metal and DirectX 12, to assess gaming geometry and particle effects.

Most ultraportables are fine for solitaire games and video streaming, not playing the latest fast-twitch titles.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation\u2014what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show\u2014and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe Acer AI AMD did about as well as an IPS- rather than OLED-screened slimline can in these tests, combining lengthy battery life and screen brightness with decent color reproduction. However, I still wish Acer would sell the 3K OLED display as an option here in the States.\n\nVerdict: Embrace the Hype?\n\nWe have a perhaps stereotypical view of most Acer customers as non-tech-expert consumers rather than power users, so we're not surprised the Swift 14 AI AMD does everything but put a cereal- or detergent-style \"Now with AI!\" decal on the box. Those looking inside the box, however, will find exceptional processing power and webcam quality. The stiff, flat keyboard dampens the experience, and other 14-inch ultraportables, like the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch, include prettier OLED screens, but this Acer should satisfy many.\n\nAcer Swift 14 AI AMD 3.5 See It $999.99 at Amazon Starts at $1,199.99 Pros Near-workstation-class CPU performance\n\nGenerous 32GB of RAM\n\nBright and colorful touch screen Cons Disappointing keyboard\n\nUpgraded displays not for U.S.\n\nLow-impact AI apps\n\nNo WWAN option or flash-card slot View More The Bottom Line An AMD Ryzen AI 9 chip gives Acer's latest Swift 14 ultraportable laptop impressive performance, but we wish the company had sanded off one or two rough edges."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nWhat's one way to charge more than $1,000 for a laptop in this day and age? Slap an \"AI\" sticker on it. Acer is not the only offender\u2014looking at you, Microsoft, forcing your Copilot key onto keyboards\u2014but the company has enthusiastically boarded the bandwagon with the Swift 14 AI AMD (starts at $1,199.99; $1,299.99 as tested), a notebook with a squiggly symbol on the touchpad that lights up when you use an AI app. Artificial hoopla aside, the Swift is a capable ultraportable laptop. However, it fails to unseat the Editors' Choice-award-winning Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406), which isn't as fast but has a superior screen and costs hundreds less.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Covering All the CPU Bases\n\nThe Swift 14 AI AMD\u2014you'll find Intel and Arm versions, too\u2014starts at $1,199.99 with 16GB of RAM, which is on sale for $999 at the time of publishing. However, this test unit (model SF14-61T-R3U1) doubles the memory for an extra $100. It also carries a 10-core AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor with Radeon 880M integrated graphics, a 1TB NVMe solid-state drive, and a 14-inch, 1,920-by-1,200-pixel IPS touch screen.\n\nThe system's web page on Acer.com trumpets two non-touch display options with higher 3K resolution\u2014one IPS with a 120Hz refresh rate and one OLED with 90Hz\u2014but Acer disappointingly confirms they're not available in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the positive side, the Swift lands right on our ultraportable weight line at 3.0 pounds, compared with 3.47 pounds for the HP OmniBook Ultra 14. Measuring 0.74 by 12.3 by 8.8 inches, it's a fraction trimmer than that laptop as well. Its anodized aluminum chassis has passed MIL-STD 810H tests for sturdiness, but you'll still feel a bit of flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck.\n\nSlim bezels surround the screen, which opens 180 degrees and has a top lip to ease one-handed opening. The 1440p webcam centered above has a sliding privacy shutter and IR face recognition, joining a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button to give you two ways to skip passwords with Windows Hello.\n\nThe laptop's left side holds two USB4 Type-C ports, either suitable for the AC adapter, along with an always-on USB 3.2 Type-A port and an HDMI monitor port. Another USB-A port joins an audio jack at the right. Along with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth, this is a satisfactory array of connections. However, I would be happier with USB-C ports on both sides (so the AC adapter cord can't interfere with external mouse users) and an option for mobile broadband.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Ai-Yi-Yi, It's AI\n\nAlong with the usual shortcuts for screen brightness, audio volume, and airplane mode, the top row has a key to launch AcerSense, a utility that combines system info and updates, diagnostics, power/cooling settings, and three Windows Store apps. These are LiveArt, which creates AI-filtered stickers from your photos; AlterView, which provides adjustable animated wallpapers; and GIMP, the robust but less consumer-friendly rival to Adobe Photoshop.\n\nA feature called Acer User Sensing taps the IR webcam to log you in when you approach and dim the screen or lock the system when you move away, as well as nagging you to take regular screen breaks and not get too close to the display. Acer QuickPanel pops up during video calls to provide AI-enhanced PurifiedView image and PurifiedVoice audio enhancements. And as always with Acer PCs, you'll see a few bloatware ads for things like the Forge of Empires game.\n\nPurifiedView mostly duplicates Windows Camera's recently added auto framing, background blur, and video fine-tuning for the webcam.

            "article_content": "by Jayantha Perera\n\nI retired from ADB in April 2011. ADB appointed me as a staff consultant without waiting for the mandatory \u2018cooling off\u2019 12-month period expired. A memo signed by the President, a Vice President, and two Directors Generals of ADB stated why I should be re-recruited immediately. It stated, \u201cMr. Perera\u2019s experience as a senior and highly respected member of ADB as a safeguard specialist makes him ideal for this position \u2026 He is a well-respected ADB staff and was one of ADB\u2019s leading experts in the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s development issues; he was the only international staff member at ADB who had technical knowledge and expertise in all three safeguard areas\u2026\u2026..\u201d\n\nOne of my major assignments as a consultant was to conduct training in 10 Pacific countries for senior government officials on how to address social and environmental issues to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy standards. Fiji, Samoa, Pohnpei, Tonga, Cook Islands and Marshall Islands were among the countries chosen. Each country offered its rich culture, natural beauty, and the opportunity to meet people with vivid personalities and experience paranormal encounters. Pohnpei, an island state in the Pacific, etched a dazzling world I will never forget.\n\nPohnpei and three island states form the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the western Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei is the largest island in FSM, with a land area of 335 sq. kilometres. The other three states are Yap, Chuuk, and Kosrae. Pohnpei State also owns several small islands in the vast Pacific Ocean.\n\nPohnpei means \u2018stone altar.\u2019 Presumably, it refers to a large stone platform on the island. The island\u2019s population is about 37,000. Its terrain is mountainous and jungle-covered. It is one of the wettest places on Earth, with an annual rainfall exceeding 7,600 mm. A circular, tarred, narrow road connects dispersed towns. Access to the interior, especially to hilly areas, is challenging.\n\nThe people are proud of their history and boast about Nan Madol, an ancient city-kingdom. Its civilisation flourished for 700 years, from the 10th century to the 17th century. Its downfall began with the arrival of Spanish sailors in the early 19th century, followed by whalers, traders, missionaries, educators, and colonisers. After the Spaniards, the Germans occupied it. During the Second World War, the Japanese captured it, and the USA took it from the Japanese in the late 1940s.\n\nLocals suffered severely when colonisers plundered their treasures and destroyed cultural artefacts. Spaniards brought cholera and smallpox to Pohnpei, nearly annihilating the local population. The Japanese not only looted local treasures but also enslaved people. During the Second World War, Japanese warlords used local slaves to move heavy cannons to strategic mountaintops. Most of the workers died because of starvation and illnesses.\n\nIn 1986, Pohnpei became an independent state within FSM. The five traditional small kingdoms on the island constitute independent Pohnpei, and the Pohnpei State Council represents them. Kolonia is the capital of Pohnpei State, and Palikir is the capital of FSM. The two cities are adjacent to each other. The local kingdoms occasionally clash with the State Council on matters of development. About 10 years ago, for example, the State Council tried establishing a casino complex in the territory of a traditional kingdom. Its king opposed the proposal and took his protest to an international forum for arbitration.\n\nEnglish is the official language, and people consider themselves non-immigrant citizens of the United States. In other words, the USA guarantees they can become US citizens whenever they want. The currency in the country is the US dollar. Postage is paid in US$, and postal stamps are US postal stamps. A taxi charges one dollar to travel within Kolonia.\n\nFortunately, I got a seat on United Airlines from Honolulu to Kolonia. The Filipino hotel manager told me to wait a few hours before occupying my room. When I asked him why, he said hotel guests who had left in the morning might return if their flight was cancelled. The hotel\u2019s policy is to accommodate such stranded travellers on a priority basis in the rooms they had occupied earlier.\n\nI was tired, hungry, and sleepy. The manager gave me a hot tuna sandwich and coffee at the restaurant. He told me he could give me a room with a door facing the jungle behind the hotel. I feared small insects and reptiles might creep into my room after sunset. The incessant rain added a gloomy atmosphere to my fear. I could hear water gushing down a drain. Rainwater trickled down from the eves of the roof, flooding the narrow corridor in front of the room and making it slippery.\n\nI moved into the room and slept several hours. When I woke up, it was dark and still raining. I did not know how to go to the restaurant. There was no telephone in my room. I was nervous about going to the bathroom. When I opened the tap in the bathroom, it took about five minutes to see clear water. I was reluctant to pull the shower curtain. When I pulled it, a six-legged, black, long, gecko-like creature was in the bathtub. The bathtub was cracked and dirty and covered with dead leaves. The room\u2019s light bulb was weak, and the bathroom was not lit up to see what else was waiting there to meet me. I regretted my decision to occupy an outer room.\n\nThe manager came to take me to dinner. He had a strong flashlight and a large umbrella. I asked him about possibly moving to a room inside the hotel. But by then, the hotel was fully occupied. The manager told a Filipina woman to clean my room again and to keep a heater in it. I insisted that the bedsheets and pillows should also be changed. When I returned to my room after supper, it looked neat and smelled good. The gecko-like creatures had disappeared.\n\nI had a free weekend in Pohnpei before leaving for Honolulu. The hotel manager suggested I hire his four-wheel drive Jeep and travel around the island. He charged me $100 for the trip, which included a driver-cum-guide, a lunch box, snacks, and soft drinks. He advised me to carry one-dollar bills with me to pay local taxes. I changed a 50-dollar note for one-dollar and five-dollar bills. The bills were dirty and discoloured; some were as hard as cardboard.\n\nThe Jeep was a rickety old van without a spare wheel. It spluttered dark, unburned diesel, and its engine noise was unbearable. Roger, the jeep driver, was a local young man with long hair and a ferocious-looking black beard. He carried a big, heavy knife. The hotel manager handed him food boxes and an umbrella.\n\nI thought Roger might sacrifice me to a native god by cutting my neck at a remote place. I had read on Google about human sacrifices to gods on the island. I wished I had invited another hotel guest to accompany me, but it was too late. Roger promised to show me places that foreign visitors rarely visit. His offer made me more nervous. I told him that I should return to the hotel before 5 p.m.\n\nRoger drove the old Jeep with care. He stopped the Jeep in front of churches to talk to his friends who came for the Sunday mass. Sometimes, he offered them a ride in the Jeep without asking me. At a church, at least 10 people entered the Jeep, and two sat next to me in the front seat, pushing me onto the gear shift. They were fat people dressed in large white shirts and baggy blue jeans. They had unshaven faces and unwashed mouths. They spoke English. They invited me to visit their church and to join them for a communal lunch. I politely declined the offer by saying I was on a tight travel programme and should return to Kolonia early.\n\nLater, I visited a small Christian church. The church had a neat front yard, and a local artist had painted beautiful murals of the genesis and the crucifixion. I could see some well-thumbed prayer books and hymn books on a small table covered with an embroidered white tablecloth. The small board on the table invited donations. One could donate money by dropping dollar bills or cents into a small glass box, which a small padlock secured.\n\nSeveral people were in the church, wearing their Sunday best. Men wore European clothes, and women wore long white dresses with beautiful shoes. Some of them had heavy makeup. All adult women wore head covers. Many devotees, especially the women, carried rosaries in their hands.\n\nPeople sat in circles by the road and ate from large metal pots. Roger explained that Christians do not work on Sundays except for attending mid-morning service. They cook on Saturday and partook of it on Sunday after the church service. Pork was the main dish. Raw tuna fish competed with fried pork to be the best food item. Someone told me they had learned how to raise pigs and cook pork dishes from Filipino friends whose ancestors came with the Spaniards as cooks and servants.\n\nSuddenly, Roger drove off the main road, saying he wanted to show me the statue of Henry Nanpie. The figure was about 100 metres from a protestant church and was on an elevated stone dais. I thought it was built of steel with a hollow interior. Henry was in an elite tailcoat with a walking stick in his right hand. Roger told me that Henry had lived in Pohnpei in the late 19th century and early 20th century. He was the son of a local army commander. His mother was an English woman \u2013 the daughter of an English beachcomber.\n\nHenry inherited lots of land from his powerful father. Then, he wanted to acquire land from another local kingdom. Henry visited the kingdom\u2019s palace carrying a loaded gun and a bag of goodies. He took the weapon to kill the king and the goodies to bribe palace servants to get their allegiance. When he saw the king in an inner palace chamber, he tried to kill the king. But his gun misfired. Then Henry aimed the weapon at a flowerpot and pulled the trigger. The bullet went through the flowerpot and damaged the wall behind it.\n\nHenry cunningly claimed that he had supernatural powers and could stop a gun from firing a bullet. He explained to the king that before he aimed the weapon at the king, he had \u201ccharmed\u201d the gun. Because of the charm, the gun misfired. After removing the charm from the gun, a bullet fired from it smashed the flowerpot. The king was amazed and convinced himself of Henry\u2019s supernatural powers. The king asked him to be the kingdom\u2019s protector offering him a mansion and a vast stretch of land.\n\nHenry opened a large supply shop to supply food, water, oil, and labour to whaling ships in the Pacific. He used his new wealth to add more land to his estate. In Pohnpei, he established protestant groups and spread Western cultural practices and beliefs among the locals through them. Even today, local people consider him a semi-god who brought wealth and salvation to them and connected them with the outside world. Roger sang a folk song about Henry, which depicted Henry as a local god. A copper plaque beside his statue indicates that he still has admirers to spread, invent and reinvent myths about him.\n\nRoger was hurrying me to go to the ruined capital of Nan Madol Kingdom. He told me that the kingdom was on the banks of a large lagoon connected to the eastern shoreline. It was the only ancient city ever built atop a coral reef. In 2016, the UN declared it a World Heritage Site. We drove on a narrow gravel road and parked the Jeep. From there, we walked about two kilometres to Nan Madol. We walked through private lands, and landowners charged a fee for crossing their land. Some landlords collected a dollar or two, but one landlord demanded seven dollars.\n\nWe entered a rocky trail from the last property. The land rapidly became marshy, and we walked on an elevated narrow bund. Both sides of the bund were inundated, and walking on it was risky. Henry dexterously cut down weeds and plants that obstructed the path. He wanted me to follow him closely but did not say why. The thought that he might sacrifice me to a local god began looming in my mind. I did not look around as I wanted to keep my eyes on him and the bund. He walked fast, brandishing his knife as if in a frenzy.\n\nThe narrow bund that stretched through a grotesque jungle of mangroves looked never-ending. I thought that spirits were watching and following me. I tried to avoid looking at large trees because I thought they were beckoning me. Some tree trunks, I thought, turned into hobgoblins. I remembered reading how funny elves resort to mischievous acts towards human beings who encroach on their territories.\n\nSuddenly, I felt some invisible force pulling me back. I could not see Roger. I thought that I got lost among the mangroves forever. I saw the shallow water in marshy fields swelling to engulf me. I stopped walking. I thought how silly I was to think about bizarre things. Then Roger returned and asked me whether I had seen anything or anybody. I told him that some trees had tried to talk to me and were making faces at me. He said that many visitors had similar supernatural encounters. Roger explained that Pohnpiens treated the ruins at Nan Madol as sacred. They also knew various spirits haunt the place. The spirits came out at night, but a few hovered around during the daytime to harass visitors. Roger gave me several small, polished stones connected in a string. It reminded me of the rosaries that churchgoers had in their hands. He said that the string would fend off evil spirits. I then remembered my grandmother, who gave me my first rosary when I was seven, advising me to carry it with me to protect myself from evil forces.\n\nWe arrived at a stagnant shallow canal from where we could see the temple entrance. To reach the temple, we crossed a shallow canal. There were several decayed logs in the canal, and we had to push them aside to cross it. About 50 metres from the canal were the elegant stone walls three to five metres high. Just under a stone arch was a conduit from a table-flat wall top where, presumably, human sacrifices were conducted. According to Roger, the blood of those victims trickled down from the wall top to the main entrance through the conduit, where priests performed rituals to appease gods. Many city outer walls remain intact, although mangroves have engulfed them.\n\nLocal people believe twin brothers, who were sorcerers, built Nan Madol. They came to Pohnpei from another island in a large canoe to build an altar where they could perform ancestor worship. The legend is that the two brothers levitated large stones with the help of a flying dragon and built the entire city in three years. They transported basalt columns from a faraway island. Most of the columns are now under shallow water in the lagoon.\n\nThe temple consists of about 90 rectangular islets linked by narrow channels. Each islet had a coral-filled platform. Nan Madol means \u201cwithin the intervals,\u201d and the \u201cintervals\u201d are the complex canal grid. It is unclear who lived on islets, but locals believe priests who performed rituals at the altar lived in single-house units built on islets.\n\nThere were reserved locations among the islets for priests to feed turtle innards to a sacred eel who lived in a deep well. After feeding the eel, priests shared the rest of the turtle as a sacrament. To this day, eels are considered holy and are never killed or eaten.\n\nThe main enclosure is a large stone chamber with hundreds of human bones. About 15 years ago, several German archaeologists dusted and rearranged the bones to examine their age. That night, one archaeologist died in his hotel room in Kolonia, and the other fell gravely ill. Roger said his ancestors were unhappy when foreigners excavated and labelled their bones. They, as spirits, protect the monuments and punish anyone who disturbs them.\n\nRoger\u2019s father and two uncles had seen several light beams starting from the temple\u2019s main altar late one night. The light beams travelled across the sea to faraway islands and large stars. When I asked Roger if he would camp at Nan Madol after sunset to watch the light beams, he said he would not risk meeting his ancestors! He advised me not to talk about them as they were holy spirits with enormous powers and could harm us in their domain.\n\nWe spent two hours walking around the temple. The shallow sea and the lagoon behind the ruins were very picturesque. We tried to count the heaps of basalt rafts submerged in the lagoon. When we decided to leave Nan Madol, I felt I could not move. I was unsure whether the feeling came from my fear of hobgoblins or the perplexity in my mind. I told Roger to walk with me to the Jeep. He walked ahead of me, occasionally checking whether I was following him. I tried to walk fast without looking at the trees I had seen earlier. I felt a powerful, unseen force pulling me backwards. I imagined a tree with strange roots moving towards me. The gushing winds created a bizarre atmosphere. I felt I had not left the ruins, so I called Roger and asked him to walk with me. We plodded to the Jeep from the ruins. He reassured me that the spirits would not follow us. I was glad to leave Phonpei the following day."

            "article_content": "When Camarria Williams, 13, stumbled upon goose poop in a neighborhood park, she enthusiastically scooped some up. She and six other students were looking for bacteria samples. \u201cMy mom feeds animals, and I know birds eat everything and anything,\u201d said Camarria, an eighth-grade student at William H. Brown STEM Magnet School in Chicago. \u201cI knew there must be in bacteria in it.\u201d\n\nAfter collecting their samples, students in the Chicago Antibiotic Discovery Lab, a STEM outreach program, were taught how to isolate bacteria and program a robot to catalogue it and track antimicrobial activity. Camarria learned, with university researchers\u2019 help, that her goose poop contained a cancer-fighting compound. She was stunned and delighted.\n\n\u201cI like discovering new things,\u201d she said.\n\nThe program \u2014 run by Brian Murphy, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago \u2014 partners with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago. Its goal is to give underserved middle and high school students experiences in biomedical sciences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premise of our 14-week program is to teach students how many medicines \u2014 in this case, antibiotics \u2014 are discovered,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cThe students analyze their own data and then make decisions in the very initial stages of this drug discovery process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect these experiences to careers in STEM,\u201d he added. \u201cI thought if we actually involve students in our own research that we do in the lab, we could show them there\u2019s a pathway to careers in the biomedical sciences, and maybe even start a pipeline from middle school to high schools to their local universities.\u201d\n\nFor Camarria, signing up for the program was a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked science and found it interesting, like how you can mix chemicals to make something,\u201d she said.\n\nShe did not anticipate, however, that her involvement in the program would result in her and university researchers\u2019 uncovering a novel compound with cancer-fighting capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did something, and it worked,\u201d Camarria said. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d\n\nCamarria collected the goose droppings at Garfield Park Lagoon, while other students collected samples such as lake water, leaves, bugs, dirt and flowers.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun to be able to go out, put on the gloves and do the science myself,\u201d said Camarria.\n\nWhile Camarria\u2019s sample did contain a bacterium with antibiotic activity, that wasn\u2019t the key takeaway of her discovery. The goose poop contained a novel compound, which university researchers investigated and found had cancer-fighting properties, specifically for ovarian and skin cancer.\n\n\u201cWe tested the compound against a panel of pathogens and a few cancer cell lines,\u201d said Jin Yi \u201cJeanie\u201d Tan, a graduate student in Murphy\u2019s lab who helps run the outreach program. \u201cAlthough this compound did not exhibit significant antibiotic activity, it did show cytotoxic activity in ovarian and melanoma cancer cell lines.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamarria was thrilled to learn her sample was even more promising than she originally thought.\n\n\u201cMy mom, auntie and grandma have all had cancer, so it makes me happy that something I found could help,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me want to discover more things out there.\u201d\n\nThe findings were published in the American Chemical Society\u2019s Omega Journal in October, and Camarria is named as a co-author.\n\n\u201cNow people will know me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll know that I am a smart kid and I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\nCamarria\u2019s discovery \u201ccaptures the whole essence of the program and what we set out to do, to give our youth an opportunity to really get experience with science and show them that their commitment and willingness to participate can lead to something,\u201d said Jonathon Rodriguez, a technology program manager at the Boys & Girls Club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the finding is exciting, Murphy said, it\u2019s unlikely that it will become a drug.\n\n\u201cVery, very few natural compounds that are discovered ever make it into the clinic as drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, \u201ccompounds like this allow us to understand how cancer works a little better, and that allows other groups of scientists to develop better drugs,\u201d Murphy explained, adding that he and other researchers may continue studying Camarria\u2019s novel compound.\n\nMurphy said the finding highlights the importance of accessible STEM programs for young people.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is show young students that there are a lot of real-world applications of science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to light a spark inside of them, get them to care about their education, and maybe even be the launching point for the next generation of biomedical researchers.\u201d\n\nCamarria is already looking forward to her future career."

            "article_content": "(ID 328527023 \u00a9 Dmitry Buksha | Dreamstime.com)\n\nStudy reveals extraordinary self-healing potential in advanced heart failure patients\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 For decades, medical science has insisted that the human heart cannot repair itself in any meaningful way. This dogma, as fundamental to cardiology as a heartbeat itself, is now being challenged by game-changing research that reveals our hearts may possess an extraordinary power of regeneration\u2014provided they\u2019re given the right conditions to heal.\n\nThe study, published in Circulation, offers potential new directions for treating heart failure, a condition that affects nearly 7 million U.S. adults and accounts for 14% of deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTraditionally, the medical community has viewed the human heart as having minimal regenerative capabilities. Unlike skeletal muscles that can heal after injury, cardiac muscle tissue has been thought to have very limited repair capacity.\n\n\u201cWhen a heart muscle is injured, it doesn\u2019t grow back. We have nothing to reverse heart muscle loss,\u201d says Dr. Hesham Sadek, director of the Sarver Heart Center at the University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson, in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s long believed that human heart muscle cells weren\u2019t capable of regeneration, but a new study shows the \u201cstrongest evidence\u201d yet, researchers say. (\u00a9 appledesign \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nHowever, this new research, conducted by an international team of scientists, demonstrates that hearts supported by mechanical assist devices can achieve cellular renewal rates significantly higher than previously observed. The study examined tissue samples from 52 patients with advanced heart failure, including 28 who received left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) \u2013 mechanical pumps surgically implanted to help weakened hearts pump blood more effectively.\n\nThe research methodology centered on an innovative approach to tracking cell renewal. Using a technique that measures carbon-14 levels in cellular DNA \u2013 taking advantage of elevated atmospheric levels from Cold War nuclear testing \u2013 researchers could effectively date when cardiac cells were created. This method provided unprecedented insight into the heart\u2019s regenerative processes.\n\nThe findings revealed a stark contrast between different patient groups. In healthy hearts, cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) naturally renew at approximately 0.5% per year. However, in failing hearts, this renewal rate drops dramatically \u2013 to 0.03% in cases of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (heart failure not caused by blocked arteries) and 0.01% in ischemic cardiomyopathy (heart failure from blocked arteries).\n\nCardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocyte, under a microscope. (Credit: Trevor Atkeson and Madhavi Pandya, Garvan Institute)\n\nThe most significant finding emerged from patients who responded positively to LVAD support. These \u201cresponders,\u201d who showed improved cardiac function, demonstrated cardiomyocyte renewal rates more than six times higher than those seen in healthy hearts. This observation provides what Dr. Sadek calls \u201cthe strongest evidence we have, so far, that human heart muscle cells can actually regenerate.\u201d\n\nThe study builds upon previous research, including Dr. Sadek\u2019s 2011 publication in Science showing that heart muscle cells actively divide during fetal development but cease shortly after birth to focus solely on pumping blood. His 2014 research provided initial evidence of cell division in artificial heart patients, laying the groundwork for the current study.\n\nThe mechanism behind this increased regeneration may be linked to the unique way LVADs support heart function. These devices effectively provide cardiac muscle with periods of reduced workload by assisting with blood pumping, potentially creating conditions that enable regeneration. This observation aligns with established knowledge about how other tissues in the body heal and regenerate when given adequate rest.\n\nScientists now hope to figure out why some patients are capable of having the advanced regenerative response and others aren\u2019t. (\u00a9 LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nThe research team found that in failing hearts, most cellular DNA synthesis is directed toward making existing cells larger or more complex through processes called polyploidization and multinucleation, rather than creating new cells. However, in LVAD patients who showed improvement, a significant portion of DNA synthesis was dedicated to generating entirely new cardiac muscle cells \u2013 a more beneficial form of cardiac adaptation.\n\nApproximately 25% of LVAD patients demonstrate this enhanced regenerative response, raising important questions about why some patients respond while others do not. Understanding these differences could be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches. \u201cThe exciting part now is to determine how we can make everyone a responder,\u201d says Sadek.\n\nThe implications of this research are particularly promising because LVADs are already an established treatment option. As Dr. Sadek points out, \u201cThe beauty of this is that a mechanical heart is not a therapy we hope to deliver to our patients in the future \u2013 these devices are tried and true, and we\u2019ve been using them for years.\u201d"

            "article_content": "On Friday, Conservation International published the discovery of 27 new animal species in Peru's Amazon rainforest, including an 'amphibious mouse' and a spiny mouse. The expedition, conducted over 38 days in 2022 in the Alto Mayo region, documented more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants.\n\nThe team of 13 scientists, local technicians, and members of Indigenous groups, including the Awaj\u00fan people, ventured into the Alto Mayo landscape, which spans the Andes mountains to the Amazon River and includes the Alto Mayo Protected Forest. They uncovered four new mammals, eight fish species, three amphibians, and ten butterfly species that were previously unknown to science.\n\nAmong the extraordinary new species discovered is an amphibious mouse with partially webbed feet that feeds on aquatic insects. Trond Larsen, Senior Director at Conservation International, described finding the mouse as \"shocking and exciting,\" noting that it was found only in a unique piece of forest threatened by agriculture, suggesting it may not live anywhere else. \"Amphibious rodents are almost mythical to mammal experts,\" Larsen said, according to Clar\u00edn.\n\nAnother remarkable find was a spiny mouse with stiff guard hairs that function similarly to hedgehog spines. The expedition also uncovered a blob-headed fish, a type of armored catfish with an enlarged, blob-like head. Scientists are still uncertain about the function of this peculiar feature. \"The blob-headed fish has an incredibly bizarre head that looks almost like a giant swollen nose,\" Larsen told CNN.\n\nThe team discovered a dwarf squirrel measuring just 14 centimeters long, around half the length of an average gray squirrel. Larsen described the squirrel as \"adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast.\" He added, \"It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.\"\n\nA new species of tree-climbing salamander was also found, abundant but only in a small patch of unique white sand. The researchers documented 955 different plant species and recorded more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants during the expedition. This included 536 bird species, with 26 classified as threatened, such as the speckle-chested piculet and the long-whiskered owlet.\n\nDespite significant human influence, the Alto Mayo region revealed unexpected high levels of biodiversity. \"We were very surprised to find such high biodiversity in a landscape with so much human influence,\" Larsen stated, according to The Straits Times. The Alto Mayo landscape is a densely populated area, home to 280,000 people, facing pressures from deforestation and agricultural expansion.\n\nThe expedition highlighted the urgent need for conservation efforts in the region. \"Unless steps are taken now to safeguard these sites and help restore parts of the landscape, there's a strong chance they won't persist in the long term,\" Larsen said, emphasizing the threats posed by habitat loss and human activity.\n\nThe involvement of the Awaj\u00fan people was integral to the success of the expedition. \"It was really fantastic to work so closely with the Awaj\u00fan people,\" Larsen expressed, as reported by GreekReporter.com. \"They have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with.\" The Indigenous communities provided valuable insights that helped researchers identify and understand the species they discovered.\n\nAmong the recorded species, at least 49 are considered at risk of extinction, including the yellow-tailed woolly monkey and the tree monkey. The findings underscore the importance of protecting areas like Alto Mayo to preserve the rich biodiversity that exists there. Stay updated with the latest news!

Naming these new species will require further research, as many are extremely rare and difficult to collect.\n\nThe article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system."

            "article_content": "PhonlamaiPhoto/Getty Images\n\nIn the first article of this two-part analysis, we looked at who owns the code created by AI chatbots like ChatGPT and explored the legal implications of using AI-generated code.\n\nPart I: Who owns the code? If ChatGPT's AI helps write your app, does it still belong to you?\n\nNow, we'll discuss issues of liability and exposure.\n\nFunctional liability\n\nTo frame this discussion, I turn to attorney and long-time Internet Press Guild member Richard Santalesa. With his tech journalism background, Santalesa understands this stuff from both a legal and a tech perspective. (He's a founding member of the SmartEdgeLaw Group.)\n\n\"Until cases grind through the courts to definitively answer this question, the legal implications of AI-generated code are the same as with human-created code,\" he advises.\n\nKeep in mind, he continues, that code generated by humans is far from error-free. There will never be a service level agreement warranting that code is perfect or that users will have uninterrupted use of the services.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT and the new AI are wreaking havoc on cybersecurity in exciting and frightening ways\n\nSantalesa also points out that it's rare for all parts of a software to be entirely home-grown. \"Most coders use SDKs and code libraries that they have not personally vetted or analyzed, but rely upon nonetheless,\" he says. \"I think AI-generated code -- for the time being -- will be in the same bucket as to legal implications.\"\n\nSend in the trolls\n\nSean O'Brien, a lecturer in cybersecurity at Yale Law School and founder of the Yale Privacy Lab, points out a risk for developers that's undeniably worrisome:\n\nThe chances that AI prompts might output proprietary code are very high, if we're talking about tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot, which have been trained on a massive trove of code of both the open source and proprietary variety.\n\nWe don't know exactly what code was used to train the chatbots. This means we don't know if segments of code output from ChatGPT and other similar tools are generated by the AI or merely echoed from code it ingested as part of the training process.\n\nAlso: 5 ways to explore the use of generative AI at work\n\nIf you're a developer, it's time to brace yourself. Here's O'Brien's prediction:\n\nI believe there will soon be an entire sub-industry of trolling that mirrors patent trolls, but this time surrounding AI-generated works. As more authors use AI-powered tools to ship code under proprietary licenses, a feedback loop is created. There will be software ecosystems polluted with proprietary code that are the subject of cease-and-desist claims by enterprising firms.\n\nAs soon as O'Brien mentioned the troll factor, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. This is going to get very, very messy.\n\nCanadian attorney Robert Piasentin, a partner in the technology group at Canadian business law firm McMillan LLP, also points out that chatbots could have been trained on open-source work and legitimate sources, alongside copyrighted work. All of that training data might include flawed or biased data (or algorithms) as well as corporate proprietary data.\n\nAlso: AI scholar Gary Marcus makes a strong case for an AI regulatory agency\n\nPiasentin explains: \"If the AI draws on incorrect, deficient or biased information, the output of the AI tool may give rise to various potential claims, depending on the nature of the potential damage or harm that the output may have caused (whether directly or indirectly).\"\n\nHere's another thought: Some will attempt to corrupt the training corpora (the sources of knowledge that AIs use to provide their results). One of the things humans do is find ways to game the system. So not only will there be armies of legal trolls trying to find folks to sue, but there will be hackers, criminals, rogue nation states, high school students, and crackpots -- all attempting to feed erroneous data into every AI they can find, either for the lulz or for much more nefarious reasons.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn't dwell too much on the dark side.\n\nWho is at fault?\n\nNone of the lawyers, though, discussed who is at fault if the code generated by an AI results in some catastrophic outcome.\n\nFor example: The company delivering a product shares some responsibility for, say, choosing a library that has known deficiencies. If a product ships using a library that has known exploits and that product causes an incident that results in tangible harm, who owns that failure? The product maker, the library coder, or the company that chose the product?\n\nUsually, it's all three.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT's latest challenger: The Supreme Court\n\nNow add AI code into the mix. Clearly, most of the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the coder who chooses to use code generated by an AI. After all, it's common knowledge that the code may not work and needs to be thoroughly tested.\n\nIn a comprehensive lawsuit, will claimants also go after the companies that produce the AIs and even the organizations from which content was taken to train those AIs (even if done without permission)?\n\nAs every attorney has told me, there is very little case law thus far. We won't really know the answers until something goes wrong, parties wind up in court, and it's adjudicated thoroughly.\n\nWe're in uncharted waters here. My best advice, for now, is to test your code thoroughly. Test, test, and then test some more.\n\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Its goal is to give underserved middle and high school students experiences in biomedical sciences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premise of our 14-week program is to teach students how many medicines \u2014 in this case, antibiotics \u2014 are discovered,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cThe students analyze their own data and then make decisions in the very initial stages of this drug discovery process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect these experiences to careers in STEM,\u201d he added. \u201cI thought if we actually involve students in our own research that we do in the lab, we could show them there\u2019s a pathway to careers in the biomedical sciences, and maybe even start a pipeline from middle school to high schools to their local universities.\u201d\n\nFor Camarria, signing up for the program was a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked science and found it interesting, like how you can mix chemicals to make something,\u201d she said.\n\nShe did not anticipate, however, that her involvement in the program would result in her and university researchers\u2019 uncovering a novel compound with cancer-fighting capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did something, and it worked,\u201d Camarria said. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d\n\nCamarria collected the goose droppings at Garfield Park Lagoon, while other students collected samples such as lake water, leaves, bugs, dirt and flowers.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun to be able to go out, put on the gloves and do the science myself,\u201d said Camarria.\n\nWhile Camarria\u2019s sample did contain a bacterium with antibiotic activity, that wasn\u2019t the key takeaway of her discovery. The goose poop contained a novel compound, which university researchers investigated and found had cancer-fighting properties, specifically for ovarian and skin cancer.\n\n\u201cWe tested the compound against a panel of pathogens and a few cancer cell lines,\u201d said Jin Yi \u201cJeanie\u201d Tan, a graduate student in Murphy\u2019s lab who helps run the outreach program. \u201cAlthough this compound did not exhibit significant antibiotic activity, it did show cytotoxic activity in ovarian and melanoma cancer cell lines.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamarria was thrilled to learn her sample was even more promising than she originally thought.\n\n\u201cMy mom, auntie and grandma have all had cancer, so it makes me happy that something I found could help,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me want to discover more things out there.\u201d\n\nThe findings were published in the American Chemical Society\u2019s Omega Journal in October, and Camarria is named as a co-author.\n\n\u201cNow people will know me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll know that I am a smart kid and I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\nCamarria\u2019s discovery \u201ccaptures the whole essence of the program and what we set out to do, to give our youth an opportunity to really get experience with science and show them that their commitment and willingness to participate can lead to something,\u201d said Jonathon Rodriguez, a technology program manager at the Boys & Girls Club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the finding is exciting, Murphy said, it\u2019s unlikely that it will become a drug.\n\n\u201cVery, very few natural compounds that are discovered ever make it into the clinic as drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, \u201ccompounds like this allow us to understand how cancer works a little better, and that allows other groups of scientists to develop better drugs,\u201d Murphy explained, adding that he and other researchers may continue studying Camarria\u2019s novel compound.\n\nMurphy said the finding highlights the importance of accessible STEM programs for young people.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is show young students that there are a lot of real-world applications of science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to light a spark inside of them, get them to care about their education, and maybe even be the launching point for the next generation of biomedical researchers.\u201d\n\nCamarria is already looking forward to her future career."

            "article_content": "Yeah! Science! Scientists at the CERN Large Hadron Collider \u2013 the most powerful particle accelerator ever built \u2013 have detected the heaviest form of antimatter observed. This discovery is as important as CERN's previous breakthroughs, like the Higgs Boson particle, B-meson decay, and hypernuclei.\n\nScientists from the ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at CERN's Large Hadron Collider reported evidence of a new antimatter particle called antihyperhelium-4, essentially the \"evil twin\" of another weird particle called hyperhelium-4. This incredibly exotic form of matter contains two antiprotons, an antineutron, and an unstable particle called an antilambda comprised of subatomic quarks.\n\nThis discovery is important because it allowed physicists to study the extreme conditions of the cosmos when it was less than a second old. It also gives us insights into one of our biggest mysteries: the baryon asymmetry problem.\n\nWhen the universe burst into existence during the Big Bang, matter and antimatter should have existed in equal amounts. Since the opposing pairs always annihilate each other, all matter and antimatter should have converted into pure energy. Somehow, we ended up with a universe dominated by regular matter, with just a tiny bit of antimatter surviving. Studying hyperhelium and its antimatter twin could help unlock this puzzle.\n\nThe discovery of antihyperhelium-4 resulted from a collision experiment performed with the LHC in 2018. It slammed together lead ions at stupendous speeds, recreating the hyper-hot conditions of the newborn universe. Researchers then used a cutting-edge machine learning model to study the data from the collision. The analysis spotted the signature of antihyperhelium-4 particles as they decayed into other particles.\n\nAlso spotted was the lighter antihyperhydrogen-4. The researchers precisely measured the masses of these two particles and were able to match the data with the most current physics theories. The experiment's results confirm that matter and antimatter are created in equal portions. So, what tipped the balance if the universe started with level proportions?\n\nPhysicists are still without adequate answers. However, the LHC receives occasional upgrades, like the one that installed supersized magnets for sharper beams earlier this month. Who knows what new antimatter extremes may emerge next?"

You don\u2019t even have to bet on the Vols\u2019 point spread (+7.5) with -110 odds.\n\nIf you think Ohio State will win, you don\u2019t have to wager on the Buckeyes to win by eight points (and covering the 7.5-point spread). You could bet on the Buckeyes on the moneyline (-280 odds). If you want something safer, there are more options at FanDuel. The sportsbook offers alternate point spreads and totals.\n\nYou can wager on Tennessee +33.5 or Ohio State +18.5. The over/under is 46.5 points, but FanDuel offers a total as low as 17.5 points so you could bet Over on that. You can go as high as 76.5 points for the total and bet Under. You won\u2019t get much of a profit on your $5 wager if you bet one of those extremes, but that isn\u2019t important. You just want to win so you can grab your $150 welcome bonus."

            "article_content": "In the wake of canceling its hyped car project, a hard setback with an iPhone subscription service, and delays with AI feature rollout, it seems Apple has found a new sweet spot for product development in the smart home segment. According to Bloomberg, the company is working on a smart doorbell with Face ID authentication support.\n\nApple is already rumored to be working on an iPad-like smart home device that will serve as a home hub for other connected devices, as well. Now, the folks over at Cupertino are eyeing a niche that will integrate well within the homeKit portfolio.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBloomberg\u2019s report describes it as a \u201csmart doorbell with advanced facial recognition that wirelessly connects to a deadbolt lock.\u201d The concept is pretty straightforward. Apple aims to bring its fast and reliable biometric authentication convenience to a doorbell.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nAt the moment, the segment is dominated by the likes of Amazon, Google, Eufy, and Logitech. The Nest Doorbell and Amazon Blink, in particular, often find their way at the top of the recommendation list for buyers. It\u2019s, therefore, no surprise why Apple would want to flex its way into the fray, especially when it has the tech stack, talent, and supply chain at its disposal.\n\nNow, the Face ID-ready doorbell project is in the early stages of development, which means its market arrival is neither close, nor certain. According to report which cites internal sources, enthusiasts should \u201cnot to expect anything to come to market before the end of next year at the soonest.\u201d\n\nThere is another probability. Instead of developing a hardware product of its own, Apple could very well outsource it to a third-party partner like Logitech or Belkin. That wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Take for example the Vision Pro, which sells a head strap for the headset, straight from Apple\u2019s online store.\n\nThe upcoming device could be yet another host for the company\u2019s in-house combined chip for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which is reportedly making a debut in 2025 with the refreshed HomePod Mini and Apple TV models. The chip is apparently code-named Proxima and will reportedly be made by long-time partner TSMC.\n\nNow, a smart doorbell sounds like an obvious step in the right direction, and could stand out with its facial recognition perk. Notably, the company already has the infrastructure ready (and rapidly developing it with upcoming products) with a software stack in HomeKit that has already been embraced by various brands.\n\nIn addition to it, the upcoming home hub device that borrows from the iPad aesthetics, will also run a software that will connect with a whole bunch of other devices. It will also tap into the FaceTime system for video conferencing. It won\u2019t be surprising to see it play nice with the upcoming smart doorbell camera via its video relay lane.\n\nThere are, however, a handful of concerns with the doorbell endeavor. Chief among them are chances of failure, especially when it comes the possibility of an intruder somehow making it past the guardrails. The recent cases of abuse involving the AirTag tracker by bad actors is an example of one such scenario.\n\nApple has traditionally played it safe when it comes to user privacy and safety, and has tried to skirt past such controversies to the best of its capabilities. So, there is high chance that the company takes its own sweet time bringing the smart doorbell to the market, or simply decides to offload the whole premise to other brands while milking royalty."

            "article_content": "OpenAI announced on Friday that it was testing two new reasoning AI models, called O3 and O3 small, as part of an increasing battle with competitors like Google to develop more intelligent models that can solve challenging issues.\n\nTakeAway Points:\n\nOpenAI said on Friday it was testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini, in a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models capable of tackling complex problems.\n\nBitcoin fell sharply on Friday amid broader caution in risky assets.\n\nBitcoin traded at around $92,808.07 at 6:57 a.m. ET on Friday, down around 9% from 24 hours before, where it was priced above $102,000, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nThe cryptocurrency hit an all-time high above $108,000 just this week, but has since sold off aggressively.\n\nOpenAI reveals \u201co3\u201d reasoning AI models that are now undergoing testing\n\nCEO Sam Altman said the AI startup plans to launch o3 mini by the end of January and full o3 after that, as more robust large language models could outperform existing models and attract new investments and users.\n\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI released o1 AI models in September designed to spend more time processing queries to solve hard problems.\n\nThe o1 models are capable of reasoning through complex tasks and can solve more challenging problems than previous models in science, coding, and math, the AI firm said in a blog post.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new o3 and o3 mini models, which are in internal safety testing currently, will be more powerful than its previously launched o1 models, the company said.\n\nThe GenAI pioneer said it was opening up an application process for external researchers to test o3 models ahead of the public release, which will close on Jan. 10.\n\nOpenAI had triggered an AI arms race after it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The growing popularity of the company and new product launches helped OpenAI in closing a $6.6 billion funding round in October.\n\nRival Alphabet\u2019s Google released the second generation of its AI model Gemini earlier in December, as the search giant aims to reclaim the lead in the AI technology race.\n\nBitcoin trades around $97,000, recovering from earlier losses\n\nBitcoin hovered around the $97,000 mark on Friday, recovering from earlier losses amid broader investor caution toward risky assets.\n\nBitcoin dipped below the $93,000 mark earlier in the day before trading above that price in volatile trade.\n\nThe digital asset was last trading at $96,597.36, according to Coin Metrics, hovering near the level attained about 24 hours ago. The cryptocurrency hit an all-time high above $108,000 just this week, but has since sold off aggressively.\n\nThe Federal Reserve rattled markets in recent days as it signalled fewer interest rate cuts next year. Equity markets took a hit, filtering through to crypto assets.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has more than doubled this year, supported by several factors, including the launch of spot exchange-traded funds and the U.S. presidential election win of Donald Trump. He has pledged pro-crypto policies and his victory at the polls helped propel bitcoin to its latest record high.\n\nWith some markets on edge due to the Fed, some of the steam has come out of assets that have seen big gains this year.\n\nTesla, which has been another big beneficiary of Trump\u2019s win, continued its postelection slide with shares falling on Friday in premarket trade. Other big names, such as Nvidia, were also lower during the session.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fall also dragged down other cryptocurrencies. Ether was trading around 3,446.15."

            "article_content": "In 2025 we will see AI and machine learning leveraged to make real progress in understanding animal communication, answering a question that has puzzled humans as long as we have existed: \u201cWhat are animals saying to each other?\u201d The recent Coller-Dolittle Prize, offering cash prizes up to half-a-million dollars for scientists who \u201ccrack the code\u201d is an indication of a bullish confidence that recent technological developments in machine learning and large language models (LLMs) are placing this goal within our grasp.\n\nMany research groups have been working for years on algorithms to make sense of animal sounds. Project Ceti, for example, has been decoding the click trains of sperm whales and the songs of humpbacks. These modern machine learning tools require extremely large amounts of data, and up until now, such quantities of high-quality and well-annotated data have been lacking.\n\nConsider LLMs such as ChatGPT that have training data available to them that includes the entirety of text available on the internet. Such information on animal communication hasn't been accessible in the past. It\u2019s not just that human data corpora are many orders of magnitude larger than the kind of data we have access to for animals in the wild: More than 500 GB of words were used to train GPT-3, compared to just more than 8,000 \u201ccodas\u201d (or vocalizations) for Project Ceti\u2019s recent analysis of sperm whale communication.\n\nAdditionally, when working with human language, we already know what is being said. We even know what constitutes a \u201cword,\u201d which is a huge advantage over interpreting animal communication, where scientists rarely know whether a particular wolf howl, for instance, means something different from another wolf howl, or even whether the wolves consider a howl as somehow analogous to a \u201cword\u201d in human language.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing.\n\nNonetheless, 2025 will bring new advances, both in the quantity of animal communication data available to scientists, and in the types and power of AI algorithms that can be applied to those data. Automated recording of animal sounds has been placed in easy reach of every scientific research group, with low-cost recording devices such as AudioMoth exploding in popularity.\n\nMassive datasets are now coming online, as recorders can be left in the field, listening to the calls of gibbons in the jungle or birds in the forest, 24/7, across long periods of time. There were occasions when such massive datasets were impossible to manage manually. Now, new automatic detection algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can race through thousands of hours of recordings, picking out the animal sounds and clustering them into different types, according to their natural acoustic characteristics.\n\nOnce those large animal datasets are available, new analytical algorithms become a possibility, such as using deep neural networks to find hidden structure in sequences of animal vocalizations, which may be analogous to the meaningful structure in human language.\n\nHowever, the fundamental question that remains unclear is, what exactly are we hoping to do with these animal sounds? Some organizations, such as Interspecies.io, set its goal quite clearly as, \u201cto transduce signals from one species into coherent signals for another.\u201d In other words, to translate animal communication into human language. Yet most scientists agree that non-human animals do not have an actual language of their own\u2014at least not in the way that we humans have language.\n\nThe Coller Dolittle Prize is a little more sophisticated, looking for a way \u201cto communicate with or decipher an organism\u2019s communication.\u201d Deciphering is a slightly less ambitious goal than translating, considering the possibility that animals may not, in fact, have a language that can be translated. Today we don\u2019t know just how much information, or how little, animals convey between themselves. In 2025, humanity will have the potential to leapfrog our understanding of not just how much animals say but also what exactly they are saying to each other."

Israel was involved in four conflicts in the region, including with Hamas in Gaza and Iran. Peace remained elusive in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine that began over two years back read more\n\nA displaced Palestinian woman, Makram Hamdouna, carries a water container outside her shelter, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip December 19, 2024. Reuters\n\n2024 was a year of war. The wider conflict in West Asia and Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine made headlines throughout the year. Data by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) shows that an estimated 233,000 people were killed in conflicts this year.\n\nIsrael\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed a year in October. The Jewish state reached a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah in Lebanon to end 13 months of fighting. Israeli strikes are pounding against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTensions mounted between Iran and Israel, with both sides launching tit-for-tat attacks. The shadow war between the two countries has burst into the open since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel last October.\n\nAfter 13 years of civil war, Syria saw the fall of its dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Since his ouster, Israel has launched a bombing campaign on the West Asian country.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine entered its 1,000th day on November 24 this year. Even after over two years, there is no end in sight to the conflict.\n\nIn our yearly wrap, here is a look at the conflicts around the world.\n\n1. Israel was engaged in four wars in West Asia this year. On October 7, 2024, Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed one year. It was on this day last year that the Palestinian militant group\u2019s surprise attack on the Jewish nation changed West Asia and the world. We explain how Hamas\u2019 attack was a turning point in the region.\n\nThousands have died in Israel and Gaza since the war began last year. Many hostages taken by Hamas fighters last October remain captive in Gaza. Israel\u2019s relentless strikes on the narrow enclave have taken a mental toll on innocent civilians, especially children. We take a look at how the conflict has affected children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael achieved its biggest victory in the war by killing its enemy no 1, Yahya Sinwar. Israel had accused Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 attack. Here\u2019s what we know about the man dubbed \u201cbutcher of Khan Younis\u201d.\n\n2. West Asia inched closer to a wider war in the region as Israel and Iran carried out tit-for-tat missile strikes. In October, Israel launched three waves of overnight strikes on Iran in retaliation to Tehran launching at least 180 missiles into Israel earlier that month.\n\nIran had said its attack against Israel was in response to the assassination of the Lebanese group Hezbollah\u2019s leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut, and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there is a lull in tensions now, we explore who has the bigger and better military.\n\n3. Israel intensified attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon, with the group blaming the West Asian country for exploding pager and walkie-talkie attacks that killed or wounded thousands of its members.\n\nSmoke rises following an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in Beirut, Lebanon, November 26, 2024. File Photo/AP\n\nIn November, the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement, ending monthslong conflict that has taken the lives of over 3,700 people. The deal brokered by the United States calls for a 60-day halt in fighting. However, within a week of the fragile truce, there were mutual accusations of violations. Will the ceasefire hold? We explain in this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, a part of Iran\u2019s so-called Axis of Resistance, have been targeting commercial and military ships linked to Israel and its allies in the Red Sea since Israel launched its war against Hamas last October.\n\nThis year, Israel escalated attacks against the rebel group, with the Houthis claiming to target the Jewish country with drones and ballistic missiles. Find out about this rebel group in Yemen in this report.\n\n5. After 13 years of civil war, Syrian rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in just a matter of a few days. With Assad fleeing to Russia, the horrors of his regime are coming to light. Since his ouster, families have been desperately searching for their loved ones who went missing after being detained by the secret police.

While there's no direct connection to Jesus, it represents the type of vessel he and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, would have used. This provides valuable insight into the fishing industry and maritime life in Galilee during that period.\n\nDiscovered in 1986 on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, this fishing boat dates back to roughly the time of Jesus.

This offers a tangible connection to the physical environment where Jesus walked and preached. The Madaba Map: While dating to several centuries after Jesus's life (6th century AD), the Madaba Map, a mosaic discovered in Jordan, provides the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It offers a valuable visual representation of the region's geography during the Byzantine period and helps us understand the landscape and urban layout of cities like Jerusalem during the Roman and Byzantine eras."

Donald Trump says. Shoot first and ask questions later. Speculation is for suckers.\n\n\u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country,\u201d the president-elect posted on Truth Social. \u201cCan this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThe government says not to worry. Which, of course, is what worries people the most.\n\nUntil most recently, the official response has been sketchy, sluggish and anything but helpful or reassuring.\n\nAs of last week, thankfully, the feds finally were providing a coherent reaction.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, The Associated Press reports, the Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flights in 30 areas in New York and 22 in New Jersey, through mid-January. FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials say their agencies are looking into the sightings but have seen little evidence to suggest safety or security threats.\n\nWhat most people are seeing, officials say, are law-abiding, garden-variety drones. Or airplanes. Or helicopters. Or stars.\n\nThese are plausible answers. But many Americans remain unconvinced.\n\nThere are, of course, lots of precedents for our tin-hat predilections. \u201cYes, they can control the weather,\u201d a member of Congress posted on X only weeks ago, presumably about members of the other party. A vaccine denier may soon head the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Then there was a spate of clown sightings in 2016. (You can look it up.)\n\nBut the most famous was the \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d a 1938 radio drama about a Martian invasion based on H.G. Wells\u2019 science fiction novel that some Americans mistook as the real thing.\n\nIt all sounds like an episode of the \u201cX-Files,\u201d the popular old Fox series in which a pair of mismatched FBI agents delved weekly (9 Eastern, 8 Central Time) into monsters, aliens and labyrinthine conspiracies.\n\nSpecial agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder were an odd coupling of \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you\u201d-ism versus \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me-\u201d-ism. Mulder was the true believer, Scully the skeptic.\n\nI\u2019m more Scully than Mulder.\n\nI live in a neighborhood near enough to PTI Airport and far enough from city lights that the night sky is often vast and dark enough to reveal twinkling stars and a constant array of air traffic, some of it close and bright enough to resemble gliding Christmas trees.\n\nOccasionally, an aircraft headed for PTI will appear to be a UFO, sitting silent and still in the heavens. But it\u2019s always an illusion, a plane approaching head-on that only appears to be hovering until it turns toward the runway and you can hear the roar of its engines.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve hoped for a UFO sighting, just for the thrill of it. But I\u2019ve yet to see even one.\n\nAs for the mass hysteria over drones, it\u2019s another sign to me of the blessings of not living in a war-torn place like Gaza or Ukraine, where drones are ubiquitous and deadly, armed with missiles, bombs and bullets.\n\nSo, for now, at least, I\u2019m not buying the Drone Conspiracy.\n\nIn the end, maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. (Scully was in the \u201cX-Files.\u201d The aliens turned out to be real, as did many of the monsters of the week.)\n\nOn a more serious note, the ebbing faith in government and other institutions (insurance companies, media, big business, schools and universities) is for real and it is disturbing and unhealthy.\n\nWhen the center does not hold, things fall apart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a lot scarier than blinking lights in the night."
