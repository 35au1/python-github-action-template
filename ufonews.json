        "article_content": "An alleged USAF intelligence insider has gone public with what he says is a 70-year history of the pentagon's negotiations with non-human intelligence \u2013 and says that a huge escalation is imminent\n\nOne of the most dramatic events in the history of mankind is set to take place in the coming months, according to claims from a UFO whistleblower. Charles McNeal alleges that he was recruited into a top-secret US Air Force intelligence unit tasked with maintaining a 70-year truce between the American government and an alien civilisation.\n\nThis truce agreement, McNeal claims (without any proof of his credentials) on his YouTube channel, is set to come to an end at the end of September 2024. He claims that a planned series of events, including the partial \u2013 or possibly total \u2013 destruction of the state of Israel, a brief global conflict and a staged alien invasion using reverse-engineered UFO technology will soon follow.\n\nOne of the first parts of this overarching plan, according to McNeal, will be the announcement of an alliance between the US and Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government.\n\nImage: Getty Images/Stocktrek Images) Getty Images/Stocktrek Images)\n\nMcNeal alleges that a slow drip feed of information, through both news outlets and fictional accounts of extraterrestrial contact through films and TV, has been part of a campaign to prepare the global population for the shock of encountering an alien species. \u201cThis is known as the Public Acclimation Program,\u201d he bizarrely says. \u201cFor decades you have been force-fed fictionalised version of the truth via TV, movies and books.\u201d\n\nHe outlines the entire shocking scheme on his \u201cAcclimate Now\u201d website, including an orchestrated third world war, the main purpose of which will be to intimidate the public while culling vast numbers of the civilian population. This war, he claims, will be interrupted by an \u201calien invasion\u201d that has been in the planning for decades.\n\nMany of the \u201calien craft\u201d on view during this phase, he claims, will in reality be a secret USAF development that he calls the TR3-B Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV).\n\nImage: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut soon, McNeal says, we willed be introduced to a variety of real aliens, including cybernetically enhanced humanoids from a planet in the Rigel star system: \u201cType A-C have a grey or greyish pigmentation that can come off a bit chalky sometimes,\" he says. \"They have four fingers with little suction cups on the ends of each finger and some have webbing in between their fingers and toes. Type D have a brownish pigmentation and five fingers and five toes.\n\n\u201cThis species started off fully biological until they ventured out into the cosmos and came into contact with what they now answer to, something called \"The Keeper\". They now worship technology and started to incorporate mechanics into their biological makeup thousands of years ago.\u201d\n\nHe further alleges that, following initial contact with these beings in the late 1940s, the US government has since had dealings with a number of different alien species over the years, and that news of all of these extraterrestrial civilisations will be made public in the coming few years.\n\nImage: US Navy/Youtube) US Navy/Youtube)\n\nBut even the public revelation of these alien visitors, he says, will not contain the whole truth:\u201dUnfortunately,\u201d McNeal says, \u201ceven the disclosure process is not planned to be 100% honest or transparent. It is only being used as tool for a very dangerous plan to bring the world together.\u201d\n\nMcNeal alleges that one of the core aims of this bizarre conspiracy is to establish a so-called \u201cNew World Order\u201d global government, under US control, to then establish a planet-wide alliance with these extraterrestrial visitors.\n\nBarring a few short videos of the alleged USAF \u201cAlien Reproduction Vehicle,\u201d McNeal has produced no hard evidence to support his claims. But, if his suggestion that the global realignment is set to begin at the end of September, we won\u2019t have long to wait to discover whether there is any truth to his allegations."

        "article_content": "When a Long Island-based UFO enthusiast named John Ford suspected that the government might be concealing information regarding a UFO crash landing, he resorted to some extreme lengths to ensure that the alleged truth about the existence of aliens prevailed. The chairman of LIUFON is the focus of the episode titled \u2018Lights Over Long Island\u2019 of Hulu\u2019s \u2018Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal.\u2019 It also features interviews with his associates, generating several questions regarding his well-being and current whereabouts.\n\nJohn Ford is Accused of Plotting to Murder Three Government Officials\n\nA big believer in UFOs, John Ford founded the Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON) in order to conduct studies related to the unknown and prove the existence of aliens through research and evidence. He and other members of LIUFON believed that a UFO had crash-landed in South Haven Park near the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the government officials were hiding them in the laboratory. When his research was constantly interrupted by the actions of the government, he reportedly devised a plan to kill three representatives \u2014 Anthony Gazzola, a leader of the Conservative Party in Brookhaven; John Powell, the chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee; and Fred Towle, a Suffolk legislator.\n\nHis plan involved putting radium in each of their car seats and mixing radioactive metal into their toothpaste, leading to them contracting fatal diseases. Not only that, reports suggested that he also had plans to set fire to the Suffolk Republican headquarters and promote Conservative Party politicians. When law enforcement learned about this conspiracy, they arrested John Ford in June 1996 and charged with three counts of second-degree criminal solicitation, three counts of second-degree conspiracy to commit murder, and one count of illegal possession of radioactive materials.\n\nUpon searching his property, they reportedly discovered five lead canisters containing the radioactive element radium, hand grenades, a mine detector, militia literature, ammunition, and around 50 handguns and rifles. Deeming him delusional, and thus, unfit for trial in 1997, John J. Ford was instead sent to the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, New York. About three years after his arrest, in 1999, the accused pleaded not responsible by reason of insanity.\n\nJohn Ford Seemingly Remains Admitted to a Mental Institution\n\nIn 2019, the retired court security officer from Bellport, John Ford, won a transfer order that allowed him to be released from a secure psychiatric hospital and admitted to a less restrictive one. Supreme Court Justice Elaine Zaritsky Slobod was of the opinion that John was not a danger to himself or anyone around him despite still being mentally ill. Along with her, his attorneys \u2014 Steven Metcalf II and Nanette Ida Metcalf \u2014 also spoke for their client, claiming that his mental health might improve if he is allowed to be in a less restrictive environment.\n\nIn Nanette\u2019s opinion, the significance of the conspiracy charges against him was the only reason John was kept confined in a mental institution for so many years. However, in 2019, she claimed that the Chairman of the Long Island UFO Network was \u201cvery competent, capable, calm.\u201d Around Christmas day in 2022, he was in good health and getting ready to return to court, fighting for his unsupervised privileges within the following few months.\n\nRead More: Tobias Wayland: Where is the Paranormal Investigator Now?"

        "article_content": "Deepak Chopra, the world-renowned author and health and wellness expert, has teamed with AI firm ElevenLabs to add his pipes to the company\u2019s roster of notable voices available for audio streaming of books, articles and other written materials.\n\nChopra\u2019s voice pact with ElevenLabs stemmed from the \u201cDigital Deepak\u201d chatbot app that he launched with the company in June. The bot is trained in Chopak\u2019s more than 90 books and numerous public appearances in order to allow people to ask him specific questions and get responses delivered back in Chopra\u2019s synthetic voice.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nLondon-based ElevenLabs has been getting attention in the entertainment industry for its work to partner with the estates of celebrities such as Judy Garland, Laurence Olivier, James Dean and Burt Reynolds to allow users to stream books, articles and other texts as read in the voices of iconic stars. ElevenLabs\u2019 deal with Chopra comes the same day that the industry-leading, Microsoft-backed OpenAI platform rolled out a host of new voices and features to its Advanced Voice Mode service.\n\nChopra\u2019s latest pact with ElevenLabs adds his distinctive voice to the roster that users can choose from when streaming audio spoken-word content. ElevenLabs has made a major effort to underscore that it has worked with estates to reach license agreements offering appropriate compensation. The company also emphasizes that its vault of celebrity voices is only available for audio streaming of written material. ElevenLabs users are not able to use those voices to create new works.\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce my partnership with ElevenLabs. Listening can help cultivate emotional\n\nnurturing and engagement. This is no different in the age of AI, it is only more important,\u201d Chopra said.\n\n\u201cI have always written to connect with people, and now I can connect on a deeper level with a global audience as I make my teachings available for everyone in my own voice.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 outreach to the industry is an counteract the pervasive fear in Hollywood, particularly in the creative community, that AI tools will eventually pinch employment for actors, writers, directors, producers and below the line talent.\n\n\u201cAt ElevenLabs, we\u2019re committed to preserving and celebrating cultural legacies while pushing the boundaries of technology,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships for ElevenLabs. \u201cBy bringing voices like Deepak Chopra to our platform, we\u2019re not just enhancing our app \u2013 we\u2019re creating new ways for people to connect with the most influential figures and their work.\u201d\n\nMayim Bialik, actor and neuroscientist who is friendly with Chopra and closely following the growth of AI in content, added her thumbs-up for the ElevenLabs model. Actors in particular are focused in establishing the principle of compensation and consent when AI tools are employed to create new works from older material. AI concerns were at the heart of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s long strike last year and they are the key sticking point in the union\u2019s current strike against top video game publishers.\n\n\u201cDeepak has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to the mind-body connection and the significance of understanding ourselves, so it\u2019s no surprise to see him finding creative ways to leverage the latest and best in AI technology with ElevenLabs in a safe and responsible way,\u201d Bialik said. \u201cBeing able to access his content in his calm and soothing voice is a big win for his fans around\n\nthe world.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 latest deal also comes on the heels of AI legislation being signed in to law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom. With SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher at his side, Newsom on Sept. 17 signed two bills, championed by the union, that mandates that AI and tech firms receive the consent of performers if their likeness is to be used in AI-generated new material.\n\nElevenLabs sees the California legislation as a step in the right direction to establishing guardrails around a powerful new high-tech tool that has enormous potential to revolutionize productivity and the way we live and learn, but it also comes with enormous repercussions for copyright violations and misinformation concerns. Blank told Variety he sees such legislation at the state and federal level as essential to nurturing AI business opportunities in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe welcome \u2014 and we believe the whole industry should welcome \u2014 government efforts to hold accountable bad actors who create digital replicas of someone without their consent,\u201d Blank told Variety. \u201cRecognizing that there should be accountability for abuse of technology is an important part of making technology safer while still allowing progress to thrive.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

While air fryers are popular in part because they are so easy to use, they can require some trial and error when it comes to cooking times and temperatures for food.

        "article_content": "Two genres mesh together in a uniquely grounded way for chilling new show Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal. The Hulu series digs into eight true crime cases containing elements of the paranormal world. The deep dive into these chilling stories is told through first-hand accounts from those who worked on the cases and family members of the deceased.\n\nMany of these cases have already made headlines, but have never been explored in this depth. Among those investigated are lizard people possibly motivating a Nashville bomber, a six-year-old\u2019s disappearance in the Smoky Mountains after being snatched by an ape-like beast, and the body of a Jersey teen found near the site of rumored witch activity.\n\nThe project comes from Duplass Brothers Productions and Number 18, the same creative team behind Sasquatch. Here executive producer Joshua Rof\u00e9 and producer Mark Duplass (The Morning Show) preview what\u2019s to come and how it may make you think twice about what you believe as myth or truth.\n\nWhat was the process like of deciding what cases you wanted to explore?\n\nJoshua Rof\u00e9: There were so many stories and cases we looked at. We wanted to make sure they can be first and foremost grounded in a certain amount of humanity. That was the bar we set for ourselves. Can we tell just human stories minus a genre element if you will and have it feel like a real documentary? If the answer was yes, then we moved over to another category, which was teh genre element of it. The paranormal, the cryptic. Is this satisfying if we set a high bar on that front also? Every story went through these two filters. Often we would find ourselves settling on a story and a lot of them falling by the wayside. Eventually, we got to these eight. It was a great team working for months and months and really just going through that process asking ourselves the same unpleasant questions over and over because we knew we were constantly going to be dismissing stories that might have something really compelling one way or another.\n\n\n\nMark Duplass: We were fortunate that with Sasquatch made we had a similar team before this. That tackled the human element and genre element together. It was similar here in terms of what we were chasing.\n\nAre there any of these stories that went in a different direction than you were expecting?\n\nMark Duplass: They all were in some way, but what was fascinating for me who is not a lifelong conspiracy theorist. Although I did come with this with such a fascination. It\u2019s that honoring someone\u2019s truth and where they\u2019re at that is so critical for a show like this. When someone sets a bomb off and harms another human being because they believe they were called to do it. That is their truth. Approaching them and being able to honor that truth for what it is was kind of the most critical element to getting these stories right. It\u2019s delicate and sensitive. Having directors who were tied to these communities so they could tell these stories with authority. Our showrunner Allie [Alexandra Orton] just researched this thing for so long. That was really one of the most important parts.\n\nWhat do you think this show does for the families of the victims like the murder of Navajo woman Sarah Saginston for example?\n\nJoshua Rof\u00e9: It\u2019s tough to answer that question, but what we hope is for the first time in a really long time the truth will be presented. Which is that Sarah and her family deserve so much better at every single turn. To follow the horrific tragedy with injustice is so painful. I hope what we\u2019re able to do is put on display what went wrong and how. You never know how someone is going to react and what they\u2019re going to get out of it or not. I believe we put the truth forward, and the truth is they never received justice in any way. And quite frankly, that is unacceptable.\n\nOut There: Crimes of the Paranormal, series premiere, September 24, Hulu"

        "article_content": "Most scientists can never receive a Nobel Prize, arguably the most prestigious award in science. Only physicists, chemists, and specialists in physiology or medicine are eligible for the honor\u2014which comes with a gold medal, a diploma and currently up to 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1.07 million).\n\nMultimillionaire Alfred Nobel established the prize pot\u2014and those categories\u2014in 1895 via his last will and testament. He decreed:\n\n[My capital] is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. The interest is to be divided into five equal parts and distributed as follows: one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nThat seems straightforward. The first awards in the science categories were presented in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen (physics), Jacobus H. van \u2019t Hoff (chemistry) and Emil von Behring (physiology or medicine).\n\nBut the inaugural prizes in chemistry and physics honored work that traced further back in time than \u201cduring the preceding year\u201d\u2014one was connected to research that started in the 1870s and the other to research from 1895. Indeed, Scientific American calculated that between 1901 and 2023, the time between key research dates and a Nobel nod averaged 20 years across categories. And in 1902 joint winners began popping up, with Hendrik A. Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman sharing the physics prize for their work on magnetism and radiation.\n\nThat broadening of the award eligibility from Nobel\u2019s will is thanks to statutes instituted by the Nobel Foundation and his heirs in 1898. Specifically:\n\nThe provision in the will that the annual award of prizes shall be intended for works \u2018during the preceding year\u2019 should be understood in the sense that the awards shall be made for the most recent achievements in the fields of culture referred to in the will and for older works only if their significance has not become apparent until recently\u2026. A prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize. If a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.\n\nThe timing statute is relatively clear. Simply put, award-worthy research doesn\u2019t have to be limited to the year preceding the award. But the joint winner statute is more complicated. What does it mean?\n\nFor the science categories of physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine, up to three recipients\u2014also known as laureates\u2014can be awarded in any given year. Here\u2019s the breakdown from 1901 through 2023.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nBut joint laureates aren\u2019t always direct collaborators. For example, James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo were awarded the 2018 prize in physiology or medicine for their research on proteins that inhibit our immune system and the way those proteins could be manipulated to fight cancer. Both contributed crucial findings to the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, but they worked in parallel\u2014in different labs with a focus on different mechanisms.\n\nMany joint laureates aren\u2019t even contemporaries. For example, the 1986 prize in physics went to Ernst Ruska, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer to celebrate work completed 48 years apart. Ruska developed the first electron microscope in 1933, and Binnig and Rohrer developed the scanning tunneling microscope together in 1981.\n\nAnd although each recipient is awarded their own personalized gold medal and diploma, the prize pot of money isn\u2019t necessarily evenly distributed amongst joint laureates. This can all get a little confusing\u2014unless you shift focus from the people conducting the research to the work being celebrated.\n\nPer the statute, \u201cA prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize.\u201d Note the emphasis on \u201cworks.\u201d At its core, the research is being celebrated, not the researcher. Further, the statute says that \u201cif a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.\u201d\n\nOverall, there are five possible scenarios:\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nHere\u2019s how it played out in 2020. The prize in physics was awarded to Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez. Penrose was celebrated, as the Nobel Foundation states, \u201cfor the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity,\u201d a contribution pinned largely to an article published in 1965 in which he established the physical foundations of black holes. Genzel and Ghez were both celebrated \u201cfor the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy\u201d\u2014work done some 25 years later in parallel, with separate teams.\n\nOne half of the prize money was awarded to Penrose, and the other half was split between Genzel and Ghez.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nInterestingly, the statute doesn\u2019t strictly follow the language in Nobel\u2019s will. He centered the influential \u201cperson,\u201d not the \u201cwork.\u201d Even now, almost 123 years after the first ceremony, that tension doesn\u2019t feel resolved. The awards committee calls out and popularizes up to three people each year in each category and hands each of those scientists a check. Yet the awards are pinned to works, in a world in which the work being recognized is increasingly the result of many collaborators. This conflation of headlining scientist and work done by many is at the heart of many Nobel Prize critiques (although there are also other facets worthy of criticism, including a stunning and problematic lack of diversity among the laureates).\n\nAs Caroline Wagner, a scholar of science and technology with a focus on international collaboration, wrote in 2017:\n\nWhile practitioners have expanded the way contributions are credited, awards like the Nobel Prizes haven\u2019t caught up. The little bit of science history taught in school still focuses on individual contributors such as Marie Curie and Albert Einstein. Harder to explain or visualize are the cross-disciplinary collaborations that constitute most of science today.... The Nobel Prize, developed to recognize 19th-century creativity, may no longer reflect the true contributions within 21st-century science.\n\nAnd yet many people\u2014myself included\u2014are still charmed by the thought of a scientist getting caught off guard by that Nobel announcement phone call and having their routine day transformed into a spectacular one. And there\u2019s something lovely about the science communication flurry that follows, providing us all an excuse to revisit impactful research together."

This ancient seed , found between the West Bank and Israel, dates back to a time between 993 AD and 1202 and is believed to be part of a now-extinct lineage of trees mentioned in the Bible.According to reports, after taking 14 years to grow, Sheba has shown incredible medicinal potential, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties . Scientists believe the tree may be linked to the biblical \"tsori\" balm, renowned for its healing powers, and could provide valuable insights into historical remedies.With its ties to the family of myrrh and frankincense, this ancient tree offers a unique opportunity to explore both its historical significance and potential modern medical benefits.The seed was uncovered in a cave located within the Dead Sea-Jordan Rift Valley, an area known for hosting around 14.5% of its flora, with origins in the Sudanian and Sudano-Zambezian regions. This ecological zone indicates that the Commiphora species , to which the seed likely belongs, may have migrated from Africa and adapted to the region's unique climate.Phytochemical analysis of the seedling's leaves and resin revealed an absence of aromatic compounds traditionally linked to healing. However, the plant was rich in medicinal substances. This aligns with biblical references to \"tsori,\" a balm associated with healing properties. Notably, scientists identified pentacyclic triterpenoids, compounds found in other Commiphora species, which are known for their medicinal value, potentially offering therapeutic benefits, including anti-cancer properties.One of the most intriguing aspects of Sheba is its potential medicinal value. Researchers believe the tree could be the source of \"tsori,\" a balm mentioned in the Bible for its healing properties. This resin, thought to possess significant medicinal potential, has long been a part of historical and biblical accounts.The tree's close relation to the Commiphora species, which produces fragrant resins, further links it to the famous \"Balm of Gilead,\" a biblical perfume known for its therapeutic effects. Chemical analyses of Sheba\u2019s leaves have revealed compounds with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, as well as antioxidant and skin-smoothing benefits.According to a study reported in The Economic Times, the ancient tree might hold promise in cancer treatment due to its unique properties, offering a significant opportunity for medical breakthroughs in modern research .Scientists have performed DNA, chemical, and radiocarbon analyses, confirming Sheba\u2019s relation to the family of myrrh and frankincense, both iconic biblical compounds. Despite this, the tree has not yet flowered or produced reproductive material, which limits further study on its full characteristics.The revival of Sheba raises questions about whether other ancient species might be resurrected through similar methods. While the exact species remains uncertain, researchers hope to continue exploring its lineage and uncovering its secrets.This ancient discovery offers not only a glimpse into the past but also a potential key to unlocking future medicinal breakthroughs."

        "article_content": "The world of technology has always been dynamic and rapidly evolving, but in recent years, a powerful movement has emerged \u2014 one that puts the ability to innovate directly in the hands of individuals without requiring a technical background. This movement is known as \u201cno-code,\u201d and it is transforming how we build software, websites, and even entire businesses.\n\nNo-code tools are a game changer for women in tech, particularly those who may not have formal coding experience. This is where Women of NoCode comes in as a LinkedIn group dedicated to supporting, mentoring, and empowering women in tech through no-code solutions.\n\nThe Inspiration Behind Women of NoCode\n\nWhen creating Women of NoCode, the goal was to build a supportive and empowering community where women could gain confidence in using no-code tools to achieve their goals. The group was born to democratize access to tech innovation and provide an inclusive space where women could learn, collaborate, and elevate each other. The inspiration for the group stemmed from witnessing firsthand how no-code platforms were breaking down barriers that had historically kept women \u2014 and many others \u2014 from entering tech.\n\nTrending Peacock Spider Dances Its Way Into Our Arachnophobic Hearts\n\nThe tech industry is often dominated by people with formal coding skills, which can be intimidating to those without a programming background, but no-code solutions have changed that dynamic. These platforms allow users to build and automate processes without writing a single line of code, meaning someone with an idea can bring it to life, whether creating a mobile app, automating workflows, or developing a new website without extensive technical expertise.\n\nWomen of NoCode was created to connect women with the resources, knowledge, and community to use these tools confidently. By leveraging no-code solutions, women can bring their innovative ideas to life and challenge the notion that tech innovation is reserved for coders.\n\nSupporting Women in Tech Through Resources and Networking\n\nOne of the key pillars of the Women of NoCode group is the support it provides to women in tech through a variety of resources and networking opportunities. From curated content to expert-led discussions, the group offers a wealth of information on how to navigate the no-code landscape. Women who are just starting their tech journey and seasoned professionals alike can all find something of value in the group.\n\nNetworking plays a vital role in advancing one\u2019s career, and Women of NoCode fosters this through a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation. The group offers a platform where women can collaborate on projects, seek advice, and exchange best practices. Whether through virtual meetups, webinars, or simply engaging with posts on the LinkedIn group, members have countless opportunities to grow their network and gain insights from others in the field.\n\nWhat makes Women of NoCode unique is that it is not just a space to talk about tools and platforms but a space to celebrate women\u2019s achievements in tech. Every success story shared within the group serves as a reminder of what women are capable of when given the right tools and opportunities. These stories help inspire others, fostering a ripple effect of empowerment across the community.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the no-code movement is how it democratizes access to tech. In the past, building a software application or automating business processes required either hiring a developer or learning to code \u2014 both of which are traditionally costly and time-consuming. No-code platforms have changed that, making it possible for anyone, regardless of their background, to become a creator in the tech space.\n\nFor women, this is particularly empowering.

No-code platforms offer a way to bridge this gap by enabling women to acquire tech skills without writing code or requiring programming skills.\n\nThrough Women of NoCode, women are discovering how to leverage no-code tools to solve real-world problems, launch new businesses, and innovate within their existing roles. The accessibility of these tools means that more women can enter the tech industry, contribute to digital transformation, and bring important and unique perspectives to the table.\n\nNo-code solutions also help to level the playing field for entrepreneurs. With the rise of tech startups and the increasing demand for digital transformation, no-code platforms are giving women the ability to build, test, and launch products quickly, opening more doors for women entrepreneurs who may have previously faced challenges securing technical talent or funding. By removing these barriers, no-code empowers more women to become tech leaders and innovators.\n\nJoin The Movement\n\nThe Women of NoCode LinkedIn group is a movement that encourages women to take control of their tech journeys, embrace innovation, and break down barriers that may have held them back. In this group, members are given access to free training, learning how to use no-code tools effectively while building the confidence to lead in an industry that is constantly evolving.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman in tech, a woman in business, and a woman with a great idea for the next great company \u2014 or even just someone curious about the possibilities of no-code \u2014 joining Women of NoCode will connect you with a thriving community of innovators, problem solvers, and leaders. The future of tech is inclusive, and no-code is helping to make that a reality. Being a part of this group will help you stay at the forefront of tech innovation and contribute to a growing ecosystem of empowered women ready to change the world."

But to understand the various forms, you should first know the difference between horizontal and vertical SaaS. Vertical SaaS: Applications are typically geared more toward a specific business sector or type of organization. Its features are fine-tuned to meet the needs of those industries and tend to be more customizable and attuned to the unique needs of the market it is servicing. A SaaS application that manages patient appointments would be an example of a vertical SaaS used by businesses in the healthcare industry. Horizontal SaaS: Applications can be used by companies across multiple industries, as their capabilities are applicable across many business settings. For example, SaaS solutions that manage customer relationships or provide team productivity tools would be considered horizontal SaaS applications.\n\nStrengthen your SaaS knowledge with our in-depth 10-page PDF.

        "article_content": "As the reliance on open source software continues to grow, it will be critical to implement strategies that maximize its positive benefits while minimizing its risks.\n\nOpen source software (OSS) is a cornerstone of innovation and software creation acceleration and is paramount to the architecture and engineering strategy of competitive software organizations. Leveraging the collective intelligence of a global community, open source offers unparalleled flexibility, cost-effectiveness and rapid development lifecycles.\n\nHistorically, many organizations were hesitant to embrace open source due to concerns about stability, supportability and security, but as confidence in OSS grew, adoption became increasingly mainstream. Now, as much as 90% of the components in enterprise software are open source.\n\nOSS has democratized access to cutting-edge technologies, fostered a culture of collaboration and empowered businesses to prioritize innovation. By tapping into the vast pool of open source components available, software developers can accelerate product development, minimize time-to-market and drive innovation at scale.\n\nAs the reliance on OSS continues to grow, it will be critical to implement strategies that maximize its positive benefits while minimizing its risks.\n\nDriving Efficiency in Development\n\nEfficiency is the basis for successful software development, and open source can play a pivotal role in optimizing productivity, scalability and resource utilization. However, effective dependency management is key to making this a reality.\n\nEarly dependency management relied on Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify and catalog dependencies and their known vulnerabilities, which was a time-consuming process that required a lot of manual supervision. Not only was this process tedious and prone to errors, but it left developers feeling frustrated, and impacted the organization\u2019s ability to innovation and profit.\n\nNow, dependency management has evolved into something development teams can rely on to work smarter and more effectively. Modern tools not only notify developers of new versions and automatically apply patches or resolve conflicts, they also provide sophisticated analytics to help developers make informed decisions. Instead of spending time manually managing dependencies, developers can use their time to produce higher-quality software with fewer disruptions.\n\nMitigating Common Risks\n\nWhile open source offers numerous benefits, it also introduces unique challenges and risks that need to be proactively addressed. Considering breaches cost businesses nearly $4.5 million per incident, one of the most pressing concerns is security vulnerabilities. To mitigate the potential risk of vulnerabilities, organizations must adopt a pragmatic, scalable and holistic approach to security.\n\nAn easy way to do this is with SBOMs. An SBOM, or a software bill of materials, provides a comprehensive list of all the components and dependencies in software. By analyzing the SBOM, developers can easily determine which parts of their software might be affected by a newly discovered vulnerability and quickly apply the appropriate patches or updates needed.\n\nSecurity aside, another common risk associated with open source is license compliance. Organizations must be aware of the licenses associated with their open source software to ensure they remain fully compliant. Failure to meet license compliance standards can result in all of an organization\u2019s intellectual property being entered into the public domain, causing potentially irreparable damage.\n\nThe enforcement of open source licenses has become more prevalent in recent years, with some high-profile cases attracting attention. To navigate this complex landscape, organizations must maintain a clear understanding of licensing obligations, conduct thorough due diligence when integrating third-party components and implement robust license management practices to ensure compliance throughout the software development lifecycle as the scale of development efforts continues to grow.\n\nReducing Technical Debt\n\nEvery company today has accrued some form of technical debt, or tech debt, which is a lot like financial debt \u2013 organizations acquire an asset now and promise to pay for it later. Left unchecked, technical debt can impede productivity and erode long-term business outcomes like customer satisfaction, renewals and revenue. Managing, or even eliminating, tech debt before it accumulates is critical to innovation \u2013 and ignoring it can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nPaying down technical debt requires two things, consistency and prioritization. First, organizations should opt for fewer high-quality suppliers with well-maintained open source projects because they have greater reliability and stability, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs or issues into their own codebase that rack up tech debt. In terms of transparency, organizations must have complete visibility into their software infrastructure. This is another area where SBOMs are key. With an SBOM, developers have full visibility into every element of their software, which reduces the risk of using outdated or vulnerable components that contribute to technical debt.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that open source software offers unparalleled opportunities for innovation, collaboration and growth within the software development ecosystem. However, reaping the full benefits of open source requires a strategic approach to efficiency optimization, risk management and technical debt reduction. By proactively addressing security vulnerabilities, ensuring license compliance and leveraging open source best practices, organizations can harness the power of open source to drive innovation and deliver world-class software solutions that meet the evolving needs of users and stakeholders alike."
