        "article_content": "UFO 50 \u2013 one of the best games of the year (Mossmouth)\n\nA reader explains why he thinks everyone should play indie compilation UFO 50 and why no-one will agree on which are its best games.\n\nUFO 50 was created by Derek Yu (creator of Spelunky), his childhood friend Jon Perry, and a load of other extremely talented game developers. The game was announced in 2017 and finally came out last month and I am pleased to say the wait was more than worth it.\n\nUFO 50 is a collection of 50 complete 8-bit style games (not mini-games) created by the fictional company UFOSoft, with many lasting several hours. As of the time of writing, I have spent around 27 hours on the game and have completed six games and have 100% on no games. There\u2019s so much to explore and I imagine I will be playing this game for many more months (years?) to come. Here\u2019s some of my personal favourites.\n\nParty House\n\nYou\u2019re having a house party and need to invite guests but you want to make sure they\u2019re worth it, whether they bring more cash in or make your party more popular. You also need to make sure the party doesn\u2019t get too rowdy or someone will call the cops! This is one of the most simple games in the collection but it\u2019s also one of the best.\n\nMost time will be spent in the \u2018shop\u2019 section deciding which guests you would like to add to your roster, all of who cost popularity to add. Some earn popularity, some earn cash, and some have special abilities. As you use your cash to expand the house, the game really shines. Using your abilities, you\u2019ll find yourself booting, swapping and predicting guests, while watching those numbers tick up ever so satisfyingly.\n\nOnce you get popular enough, you can start to add star characters to your roster. You have 25 days and 25 parties to get four-star characters at one time to throw the ultimate party. With five scenarios to pick from, each with different characters and a random scenario mode, it\u2019s easy to sink several hours into this one.\n\nParty House is a lot of people\u2019s favourite (Mossmouth)\n\nCamouflage\n\nOut of the many puzzle games in the collection, this one is my favourite. You play as a chameleon who uses the power of camouflage to escape from the various predators in each level. Unlike most games in this collection, Camouflage is very forgiving, enabling you to go back to your previous square when you die.\n\nThe game starts out with stationary enemies but later introduces enemies that patrol around the level, making for some frantic puzzle solving. The puzzles aren\u2019t too difficult but they sure do make you feel smart.\n\nBushido Ball\n\nImagine a samurai-themed fighting game but it\u2019s really just Pong. There are six playable characters each with unique abilities and stats. Each player can roll, slash the ball or do their special when they have enough power. The aim is to beat all the other characters to win the tournament.\n\nWith a full run taking less than 20 minutes, Bushido Ball had me constantly thinking \u2018Just one more go\u2019 until I had spent over two hours in the game and finally beat the tournament.\n\nQuibble Race\n\nThis is the strangest game in the collection and I love it. The aim is to make the most money by betting on Quibble races, by whatever means necessary. This involves bribing characters to break quibble\u2019s legs, drug them or even poison them \u2013 yes, you can play as a quibble murderer.\n\nYou can also sponsor quibbles, which will give you more money when they win, encouraging you to go for the underdogs which makes for some of the most entertaining races. Watching these quibbles constantly fall over and banging the table as your prize quibble falls over and dies is one of the most entertaining experiences gaming has to offer, especially in three-player co-op.\n\nDevilition\n\nDevils have invaded the town and it\u2019s your job to stop them! In each of the 10 rounds, you must use your randomly-assigned characters (and cannons) to create a chain reaction on a 10\u00d710 board that will kill all of the devils. However, you must avoid killing the villagers, as if there are more devils than villagers at the end of the round then you lose! Once you have placed all of the characters, you may detonate one of them and begin the chain reaction. Watching as your creation destroys everything in sight is immensely satisfying.\n\nThere\u2019re many more games in the collection I would have loved to talk about but the best thing I can say is just go play UFO 50 for yourself. What\u2019s so magical about the game is that everyone has a completely different experience and everyone\u2019s top five will be vastly different. By the time I reach 50 hours, this list will probably have changed entirely \u2013 there\u2019s still 15 games I haven\u2019t got round to at all!\n\nBy reader Daniel T.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like Bushido Ball there\u2019s 49 other games to try (Mossmouth)\n\nThe reader\u2019s features do not necessarily represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.

(Getty Stock Images)\n\nUnlike claims of alien sightings from pseudoscientists and UFO hunters, the latest claims come from someone Professor Simon Holland, an academic and popular scientist who has worked directly alongside the likes of NASA and the BBC.\n\nRevealing the news during an interview with The Mirror, Holland explained that there are two groups of astronomers currently racing to publish their alien findings.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"We have found a non-human extraterrestrial intelligence in our galaxy, and people don't know about it,\" he said.\n\nHolland didn't give too many details about the discovery away, however, he claimed the information was passed along to him via a contact at Breakthrough Listen, a private scientific research institute founded by Yuri Milner.\n\nThe update has been shared by popular science educator Professor Simon Holland (Ian Waldie/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, don't unfurl your 'Welcome Aliens' banner and scrunch the tin foil on your hat just yet, as there's still much research which needs to be gathered before anyone can 100 percent confirm the existence of aliens.\n\nAdvert\n\nResearch currently stems back to a 'non-human technological signature' radiowave, known as BLC-1, picked up by Australia's Parkes telescope back in 2019.\n\nInitial research suggested the signal wasn't extraterrestrial in nature, however, Holland has since added that Oxfordshire-based Breakthrough Listen is now looking to gather more evidence.\n\nRegardless of further evidence uncovered, Holland was keen to stress that the signals weren't a natural phenomenon.\n\n\"It\u2019s a single point source,\" he added. \"The signal, instead of being the giant buzz of everything in the universe that we hear through all radio telescopes, was a narrow electromagnetic spectrum.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever the team could be beaten to publishing by a Chinese agency (Qu Honglun/China News Service/VCG)\n\nHowever, the team is supposedly not alone in their research, with Holland adding that Breakthrough Listen are currently in a race with the Chinese space agency who are researching the same radio signals.\n\n\"This is breaking news, as of yesterday, but the Chinese might be pipping them to the post, with their, FAST [Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope] program. It's the largest telescope in the world since Arecibo,\" he said.\n\nSo how long can we expect to wait before hearing the information from this report?\n\nAdvert\n\nHolland went on to add that he believes the findings will be published - either by Breakthrough Listen or the Chinese team - within the next month of so.\n\nLADbible has contacted Breakthrough Listen for comment."

        "article_content": "Horror films have produced some of the most iconic figures in pop culture.\n\nBut not all scary movies are completely fictional; some are actually based on real life.\n\n\"The Conjuring\" was based on the real-life Perron family in Rhode Island.\n\nHorror movies are reliably successful at the box office. They often have relatively low budgets, produce large returns at the box office, and can produce IP that will lead to sequels and spin-offs for years to come. Plus, when Halloween rolls around, costumes and masks provide another bump to a studio's bottom line.\n\nBut creating a completely original, compelling, and terrifying horror story can be challenging. That's why some of the most iconic and successful scary movies are based on things that actually happened in the real world.\n\nFor example, \"The Conjuring\" franchise is based on the case files of real paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. In total, the films have made almost $2.4 billion at the box office.\n\nThese are the real stories and crimes that influenced some of the most classic horror films of all time, including \"The Exorcist,\" \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" and \"Jaws.\"\n\n\"The Conjuring\" is about the Perron family and the traumatic experiences they're having in their new Rhode Island home.\n\nPatrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren. Warner Bros.\n\nThe Perrons (husband Roger, wife Carolyn, and their five daughters) moved into what was known as the Old Arnold Estate in 1971, The Providence Journal reported.\n\nAlmost immediately, the family reported paranormal activity, such as floating or moving furniture, doors opening and closing, disembodied sounds, and even being pushed, pulled, and hurt by unseen spirits.\n\nUpon calling in paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, they found that the property was haunted by various ghosts, but that one particularly malevolent spirit called Bathsheba was preying on them. Bathsheba, who lived on the property in the 1800s, had been a suspected Satanist and was charged with the violent murder of her first child.\n\nHowever, while \"The Conjuring\" ends with the family moving out of their home, they actually remained in the \"haunted\" house for another nine years, leaving in 1980.\n\nThe home sold in 2022 for $1.5 million. The new owner almost immediately said she had experienced \"paranormal activity.\"\n\n\"The Conjuring 2\" is about a girl being possessed by a demon in London.\n\nVera Farmiga reprised her role as Lorraine Warren for the sequel. New Line Cinema\n\nThe Hodgson family reported experiencing unusual phenomena in their London home in August 1977, such as furniture flying through the air, and objects hurling toward witnesses, The Daily Mail reported.\n\nMost famously, however, Janet, one of three Hodgson children, claimed she was being possessed by a man named Bill Wilkins \u2014 it was later confirmed that a man by that name did, in fact, live in the house and died there of a brain hemorrhage, People reported.\n\nWhile Janet later said that around \"2%\" of the haunting was made up, she maintains that the Enfield Poltergeist was real.\n\nYou can listen to audio of her while she was claims she was possessed to make up your own mind.\n\nThe third film is \"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,\" which is about the real trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson.\n\n\"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.\" Warner Bros.\n\nIn the third \"Conjuring\" film, Ed and Lorraine are tasked with helping a young man, Arne, who murdered his landlord after getting possessed by a demon, which Ed witnessed. In his trial, the Warrens supported Arne using the defense of demonic possession, a first in the United States.\n\nThis is based on the real case of 19-year-old Johnson, who really did murder his landlord in 1981 and subsequently claimed he was innocent because he'd been possessed, as reported at the time by The New York Times.\n\nJohnson (and the Warrens) claimed that a demon was exorcised from the body of 11-year-old David Glatzel and then moved to Johnson. His girlfriend claimed she heard Johnson challenge the demon itself to leave Glatzel and possess him instead.\n\nA few weeks after Johnson's encounter with Warrens and the Glatzels, he stabbed his landlord to death, and then claimed he had no memory of the crime and was possessed.\n\nIn reality, this defense was rejected, his lawyers then pivoted toward the self-defense strategy, and he was convicted of manslaughter. He served five years in prison.\n\n\"Annabelle,\" \"Annabelle: Creation,\" and \"Annabelle Comes Home\" tell the story of an evil doll that terrorizes her owner.\n\nThe theatrical version of Annabelle. New Line Cinema\n\nAnnabelle is a doll believed to be imbued with an evil spirit. While the real-life Raggedy Ann doll (which can be viewed at the Warrens' Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut) is much less creepy-looking than her movie counterpart, she is said to have terrorized her owner.\n\nAccording to The New Haven Register, the story of the doll begins in 1970, when a nurse received it as a birthday gift from her mother. She soon began to notice that the doll would change positions by itself. She then started finding creepy notes with messages like \"Help me\" written on them. And she claimed she once found the doll leaking blood.\n\nOnce again, the Warrens were contacted for help. According to them, the doll wasn't possessed, but it was being manipulated by a spirit. They cleansed the home and took the doll to their museum, where it remains to this day.\n\n\"The Amityville Horror\" connects the murders of the DeFeo family with a demonic presence in the house.\n\nThe real \"Amityville Horror\" home on Long Island. Paul Hawthorne/Getty Images\n\nOn November 13, 1974, at 3:15 a.m., Ronald DeFeo Jr. stole his father's shotgun and murdered his family in their home in Amityville, New York, claiming that voices in the house made him do it, according to PIX11.\n\nHe was later convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. He died in 2021.\n\nA year after the murders, in 1975, the Lutz family moved into the home and claimed to experience paranormal activity almost immediately, per ABC News.\n\nGeorge \u2014 the patriarch of the Lutz family \u2014 claimed to wake up frequently at 3:15 a.m. (the time of the murders) and hear gunshots. His daughter Missy gained an imaginary friend Jodie, which was also the name of a DeFeo daughter. Missy says she did not know anything about the murders at the time.\n\nThe Lutz family fled their home only 28 days after moving in, sparking one of the greatest debates in paranormal history: Is the Amityville home haunted?\n\n\"The Haunting in Connecticut\" is about a family who move into a former funeral home, which turns out to be haunted.\n\nThe film was released in 2009. Lionsgate\n\n\"The Haunting in Connecticut\" is based on the plight of the Snedeker family. Their name was changed to Campbell in the movie.\n\nNBC Connecticut reported the Snedekers moved into a new home in the '80s to be closer to the University of Connecticut's hospital, since their son Phillip was undergoing treatment for cancer. The family soon realized that the house they had moved into used to be a funeral home.\n\nAccording to his mother, Carmen, Phillip quickly became withdrawn and angry and started seeing a ghostly man who would tell him to lash out.\n\nHe was later committed due to a schizophrenia diagnosis. But after Phillip left, things reportedly got a lot worse for the rest of the family.\n\nThey eventually called in a priest \u2014 as well as the Warrens \u2014 to perform an exorcism.\n\n\"Veronica\" is about a Spanish teenager who used an Ouija board to contact a dead loved one with disastrous consequences.\n\nThe film was released on Netflix. Sony Pictures\n\nThe film is based on a real Spanish teenager whose death was never solved, as Business Insider previously wrote.\n\nIn 1992, a student named Estefania Gutierrez performed a \"makeshift s\u00e9ance\" at her high school. A few months later, she died in the hospital after experiencing seizures and claiming to see shadowy figures.\n\nThe story gets even stranger: A year after Gutierrez died, her parents called the police because they were experiencing paranormal activity, similar to the shadowy figures their daughter had reported.\n\nThe police were skeptical until they, too, heard disembodied noises. According to Newsweek, the official report called the home \"a situation of mystery and rarity.\"\n\n\"The Strangers\" is a terrifying look into the mindset of monsters who commit crimes just because they can.\n\nA sequel was released in March 2018. Rogue Pictures\n\nThe poster for \"The Strangers\" claims that the film was \"inspired by true events,\" though it's more of an amalgam of a few terrifying true tales.\n\nDirector Bryan Bertino said he drew his main inspiration from an experience from his childhood, according to the film's production notes.\n\n\"As a kid, I lived in a house on a street in the middle of nowhere. One night, while our parents were out, somebody knocked on the front door and my little sister answered it. At the door were some people asking for somebody that didn't live there. We later found out that these people were knocking on doors in the area and, if no one was home, breaking into the houses,\" said Bertino.\n\nFans of the film have also compared it to the Manson murders and the unsolved murders of the Sharp family, known as the Keddie Cabin Murders.\n\n\"The Exorcist,\" one of the most beloved horror films of all time, is about a preteen girl who becomes possessed by a demon.\n\n\"The Exorcist.\" Warner Bros.\n\n\"The Exorcist,\" is based on the story of a 13-year-old boy known as Roland Doe, who began exhibiting strange behavior in 1949, according to The New York Post. His family reported furniture moving on its own, scratches all over Doe's body, and loud, disembodied voices.\n\nAfter a cross-country move and no change in Doe's strange behavior, his family enlisted the help of the Catholic church. One of the priests involved in the Doe case, Father Raymond Bishop, kept a diary, per The Daily Mail.\n\nOne of his entries stated, \"At midnight, the Fathers planned to give (Roland) Holy Communion, but Satan would have no part of it. Even while the institution of the Blessed Sacrament was explained, his body was badly scratched and branded. The word 'HELLO' was printed on his chest and thigh.\"\n\nEventually, after multiple attempts, the \"demon\" was exorcised, and Doe returned to normal. He never spoke of the incident publicly.\n\nHis real identity was revealed by The Skeptical Inquirer in 2021: Ronald E. Hunkeler. Hunkeler died in 2020 at the age of 86. Before that, he'd been an engineer at NASA and, according to The New York Post, was always afraid his colleagues would find out about his past.\n\n\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" is also about a girl possessed by a demon.\n\n\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\" Sony Pictures Releasing\n\nThe story of Anneliese Michel, a young German woman \u2014 renamed Emily Rose in the film \u2014 is tragic.\n\nWhen Michel was a teenager, she experienced the first symptoms of her alleged possession. She was diagnosed with epilepsy, and given medication to help treat the disease, according to The Washington Post.\n\nBut the meds didn't help. Michel continued to have seizures, and she began to claim she was having visions and hearing voices telling her she was a sinner. She became depressed and turned to religion: At her peak, she was genuflecting (kneeling) 600 times a day, eventually rupturing her knee ligaments.\n\nBy the time Michel was 23, she had been treated with dozens of different medications (nothing helped), and had undergone 67 exorcisms in 10 months, the Post reported.\n\nShe eventually stopped eating and died of starvation in 1976. She weighed 68 pounds.\n\nHer parents and two of her priests were later found guilty of negligent homicide for allowing her to starve, per the German outlet DW.\n\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" is about a group of hitchhikers who pick the wrong family to catch a ride from \u2014 they end up being cannibals.\n\nLeatherface. Bryanston Distributing\n\nThe main villain of \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" is Leatherface, who was based on real-life killer Ed Gein.\n\nGein, who grew up in La Crosse, Wisconsin, in the early 1900s, was obsessed with his mother; he rarely interacted with anyone besides her, and when she died, he spiraled, per Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nKnown as \"the Butcher of Plainfield,\" he is suspected to have killed several victims, but, more disturbingly, he took to robbing the graves of recently buried women.\n\nHe used their body parts to create something like a woman suit that he wore, pretending to be his mother, according to the book \"Deviant.\" He also had lamps, belts, and bowls made out of human body parts.\n\nGein's story also partly inspired \"Psycho\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\n\"Poltergeist\" tells the story of a family who buys a haunted house built on top of a Native American burial ground.\n\nThe terrifying clown doll from \"Poltergeist.\" MGM/UA Entertainment Company\n\nThe plot of 1982 classic \"Poltergeist\" was based on the Hermann family of Long Island, New York, who claimed to be haunted by a poltergeist that made objects fly through their home, according to Life Magazine.\n\nThe Hermann family eventually moved away, but they maintained the house was haunted.\n\n\"When a Stranger Calls\" is about a babysitter who's being terrorized by a mysterious caller inside the house with her.\n\nCamila Belle in \"When a Stranger Calls.\" Screen Gems\n\nThe film is based on the real unsolved murder of 13-year-old Janett Christman in 1950.\n\nAs the Columbia Daily Tribune wrote, Christman was babysitting 3-year-old Greg Romack when she called the Columbia Police Department and told them to \"come quick,\" but she hung up before the police could trace her call.\n\nWhen the Romacks returned home, they discovered Christman's body in a pool of blood. She had been raped and strangled with a cord. The police eventually ruled that it had been an \"inside job\" \u2014 the killer knew the house and its layout well.\n\n\"Dead Ringers\" explores the mysterious deaths of a pair of co-dependent twin brothers.\n\nJeremy Irons played both twins. Twentieth Century Fox\n\nThe Marcus twins shared a gynecology practice, an apartment in New York City, a house in the Hamptons \u2014 and eventually their deaths.\n\nApparently, 45-year-old Stewart and Cyril Marcus were addicted to barbiturates; when their decomposing bodies were found, their mysterious deaths were first ruled as being caused by an overdose, then by withdrawal (they may have been attempting to wean themselves off the drugs), The New York Times wrote.\n\nThe medical examiner told The New York Times that Cyril outlived his brother by a couple of days, and continued to live in the apartment before eventually dying himself.\n\nThe film received a TV reboot on Prime Video in 2023, starring Rachel Weisz.\n\n\"Jaws\" is the story of a small beachside town that's being terrorized by a vengeful shark.\n\nThey needed a bigger boat. Jaws/IMDB\n\nThe terrifying tale of the most famous great white shark ever is based upon a string of shark attacks on the Jersey Shore in 1916.\n\nAccording to Smithsonian Magazine, 25-year-old Charles Vansant bled to death from a bite in Beach Haven, New Jersey. Five days later \u2014 and 45 miles north \u2014 a bellhop from Spring Lake also bled to death from a shark bite.\n\nThe story only gets more terrifying. The same shark then swam 30 miles north and 10 miles inland, killing both a boy and a man trying to save the boy in a creek, NJ.com wrote.\n\nFinally, the fifth victim was attacked 30 minutes later in the same creek \u2014 he survived.\n\nAccording to NJ.com, George Burgess, an ichthyologist (a scientist who concentrates on the study of fish), called it the \"most unique set of shark attacks that have ever occurred. \"\n\n\"The Girl Next Door\" is about a boy who tries to save his neighbor from her twisted adopted family.\n\n\"The Girl Next Door.\" Modern Distributors\n\nThe murder of Sylvia Likens is known as the \"worst crime in Indiana history,\" the Indy Star reported. Likens was just 16 when she was found dead in the basement of her temporary home.\n\nHer carnival-worker parents left Sylvia and her sister in the care of Gertrude Baniszewski, a mother of seven, paying Baniszewski by the week.\n\nThree months later, on October 26, 1965, police found Sylvia's emaciated corpse, apparently covered in hundreds of wounds, Indianapolis Monthly wrote. Baniszewski \u2014 with the help of some of her children and a few neighborhood kids \u2014 had tortured the girl to death.\n\nBaniszewski was sentenced to 21 years in prison, but she was eventually released on parole. The rest of the children who were involved served between two and seven years.\n\n\"The Possession\" is the tale of a family being tortured by a demon inside a dybbuk box.\n\nBefore killing zombies on \"The Walking Dead,\" Jeffrey Dean Morgan starred in this horror flick. Lionsgate\n\nJames Haxton posted the real dybbuk box on eBay with a chilling description of events that befell him after he bought it at an estate sale, wrote My San Antonio.\n\nHe claimed that he bought the box for his mom's birthday and that she almost instantaneously had a stroke upon receiving it, Riverfront Times reported.\n\nHe also claimed that the final straw that inspired him to get rid of the box was when his sister, brother, and brother's wife all stayed over, and each one reported having the same exact nightmare, according to a reposting of the original eBay listing.\n\nYou might be wondering what exactly a dybbuk is. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, it's a \"disembodied human spirit that, because of former sins, wanders restlessly until it finds a haven in the body of a living person\" that originated in Jewish folklore.\n\n\"The Rite\" is based upon the life of a real priest, Father Gary Thomas, and his time at the Vatican while training to become an exorcist.\n\nAnthony Hopkins in \"The Rite.\" Warner Bros.\n\n\"The Rite\" is based on the life of Father Gary Thomas, a priest who is one of 14 Vatican-certified exorcists who works in the US, the Los Angeles Times reported. Thomas told the Times he's exorcised the demons from five people, and that he receives multiple requests for exorcisms daily.\n\nFather Thomas trained for three months in Rome to become a certified exorcist, completing his training in 2005, The Telegraph wrote.\n\nSimilarly, the 2023 film \"The Pope's Exorcist\" is based on the life of real-life priest Father Gabriele Amorth.\n\nRussell Crowe as Father Gabriele Amorth in \"The Pope's Exorcist.\" Jonathan Hession/Sony Pictures via AP\n\nRussell Crowe played Amorth in the 2023 film \"The Pope's Exorcist,\" which was based on Amorth's memoirs, \"An Exorcist Tells His Story\" and \"An Exorcist: More Stories.\"\n\nSmithsonian Magazine wrote that Amorth said he'd performed over 100,000 exorcisms before his death in 2016. He was still performing them that year \u2014 and he even let \"The Exorcist\" director William Friedkin observe one.\n\nFriedkin, who died just a few months after the film's release, wrote about the experience in Vanity Fair. \"Out of a hundred people who seek my help,\" Amorth told Friedkin, \"one or two at the most may be possessed.\"\n\n\"Wolf Creek\" is about three backpackers in the Australian Outback who unknowingly hitch a ride from a sadistic murderer.\n\n\"Wolf Creek\" is an Australian film. Dimension Films\n\nThe horrifying tale of the backpackers in \"Wolf Creek\" is based on a real string of murders in Australia's Belanglo State Forest in the '90s at the hands of Ivan Milat, aka \"the Backpacker Killer.\"\n\nMilat maintained that he was innocent until his death in 2019, The Daily Mail wrote, but was convicted for torturing and killing at least seven people, all backpackers and hitchhikers. Some think that he killed even more.\n\n\"Eaten Alive\" is about the owner of a Texas hotel who feeds people to his pet crocodile.\n\n\"Eaten Alive\" had the same director as \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\" Motion Picture Marketing (MPM)\n\nEccentric bootlegger Joe Ball owned a Texas bar called the Sociable Inn in the early 1900s. He also kept multiple alligators in an enclosure near the saloon.\n\nA known ladies' man, Ball had relations with various waitresses, bartenders, and hostesses \u2014 three of whom went missing. Turns out, Ball had murdered two of them, reported Texas Monthly.\n\nMany believe he then fed them to his pet alligators, though there was never any evidence \u2014 his keeping them as pets was enough to cause concern and create rumors.\n\nWhen the police came around for questioning in 1938, however, he shot himself in the heart, the San Antonio Express-News wrote.\n\n\"Open Water\" tells the harrowing tale of a couple fighting to stay alive after their boat leaves them behind in the middle of the ocean.\n\nA bit more realistic than the shark from \"Jaws.\" Lions Gate Films\n\nTom and Eileen Lonergan were scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia in 1998 when they were left behind by their boat after someone messed up the head count. They were never heard from again, The Independent wrote.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the diving company didn't even realize they were missing until two days later, when their passports and other personal effects were found on the boat.\n\nMonths after their disappearance, Tom's dive slate was found 100 miles north of their original disappearance. He had written \"We have been abandoned\" by the diving company, adding \"Help!\"\n\nTheir dive jackets and one of Eileen's fins eventually washed ashore, but there were no signs of a shark attack or any other violent activity.\n\nSome believe they were eaten by sharks, while others maintain that it was a murder-suicide pact.\n\nTheir bodies were never found.\n\n\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\" is best known for bringing Freddy Krueger, a serial killer who murders people in their dreams, into the mainstream.\n\nNo, Freddy's not the real part. New Line Cinema\n\nThe idea for this iconic franchise came from a Los Angeles Times article that Wes Craven, the film's writer and director, read about a boy who was too terrified to sleep after surviving the Killing Fields in Cambodia.\n\nHere's what Craven said to Vulture about his inspiration: \"He told his parents he was afraid that if he slept, the thing chasing him would get him, so he tried to stay awake for days at a time.\"\n\nCraven continued, \"When he finally fell asleep, his parents thought this crisis was over. Then they heard screams in the middle of the night. By the time they got to him, he was dead. He died in the middle of a nightmare. Here was a youngster having a vision of a horror that everyone older was denying. That became the central line of 'Nightmare on Elm Street.'\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "The Nobel Committee announced on October 7 that the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology would be shared by Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun \u201cfor the discovery of microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation,\u201d thereby unlocking a secret on how different types of cells develop.\n\nWhat is microRNA?\n\nThe human body is probably the most complex puzzle that humans are still trying to make sense of. Every time there is a better understanding and a piece slides into place with a resounding click, then it is an occasion for celebration. For a Nobel Prize too perhaps. This year\u2019s awardees of the Nobel Prize for Medicine \u2014 Ambros and Ruvkun \u2014 did slide in a couple of pieces into the right slots in the massive puzzle that suddenly opened our eyes to understanding how different cell types develop.\n\nEditorial | Regulation role: On the 2024 Medicine Nobel\n\nConsider this: Every cell in the body contains the same chromosome, so every cell contains exactly the same set of genes and presumably, the same instructions. But different cell types have different, unique characteristics. It confounded the imagination until Ambros and Ruvkun came along. Their discovery offered a plausible explanation for the conundrum. The piece of the puzzle was called microRNA, a new class of tiny RNA molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation. As the Nobel announcement statement said, their groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation essential for multicellular organisms, including humans.\n\nIt is now known that the human genome codes for over one thousand microRNAs. Genetic information flows from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), via a process called transcription, and then on to the cell for production of protein. There, mRNAs are translated so that proteins are made according to the genetic instructions stored in DNA.\n\nThe key is in the precise regulation of gene activity so that only the correct set of genes is active in each specific cell type. Additionally, gene activity must be continually fine-tuned to adapt cellular functions to changing conditions in our bodies and environment. If gene regulation goes awry, it can lead to serious diseases. Therefore, understanding the regulation of gene activity has been an important goal for many decades.\n\nWhat is the work that led to the Nobel prize?\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun, both American biologists, were together in their post-doctoral period at the H. Robert Horovitz lab in the 1980s, and their interest in cell development probably had its spark there. \u201cIt was the moment,\u201d Ruvkun said later, \u201cwhen recombinant DNA was just starting to take off and it was obvious that it was a revolution and I wanted to be part of that.\u201d As they say, great achievements have humble beginnings, and this duo started appropriately enough with a humble 1 mm long roundworm. This creature was not an odd choice though: it possessed many specialised types of cells, such as nerve and muscle cells, making it a convenient model to study a complex genetic regulation process across species, one that was conserved throughout evolution.\n\nAfter that, both scientists branched off on their own, though they remained focused on the same theme, obsessively, as great scientists are wont to, but exchanging data with each other, a task assigned great value in the modern scientific world.\n\nThe study of mutant strains that disrupt cellular processes offers great insights into gene function, and Ambros and Ruvkun took this path. They studied two mutant strains of worms, lin-4, and lin-14, that displayed defects in the timing of activation of genetic programmes during development.\n\nAfter his post-doctoral research, Ambros analysed the lin-4 mutant in his laboratory. He managed to clone the gene which revealed that the lin-4 gene produced an unusually short RNA molecule that lacked a code for protein production. This suggested that the small RNA from lin-4 was responsible for inhibiting lin-14.\n\nConcurrently, Ruvkun investigated the regulation of the lin-14 gene at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Ruvkun showed that the inhibition occurred at a later stage in the process of gene expression, through the shutdown of protein production. Experiments also revealed a segment in lin-14 mRNA necessary for its inhibition by lin-4. There were therefore complementary sequences in lin-4 and lin-14 mRNA, and the former binds to such sequences in the latter, blocking protein production in lin-14.\n\nThe two laureates compared their findings, which resulted in a breakthrough discovery. A new principle of gene regulation, mediated by a previously unknown type of RNA, microRNA, had been discovered. The results were published in 1993 in two articles in the journal Cell. Incidentally, Ambros\u2019 wife Rosalind Lee was his colleague and the first author of the Cell paper cited by the Nobel Committee. As Iorio and Croce wrote in their paper Causes and consequences of microRNA dysregulation, in the Cancer Journal, \u201cmicroRNAs represent indeed an entire novel level of gene regulation that forced scientists to revise and somehow reorganise their view of the molecular biology.\u201d\n\nWhile these results were met with initial silence from the scientific community, perception changed and euphoria took over, after Ruvkun\u2019s research group published their discovery of another microRNA encoded by the let-7 gene, seven years later. This gene was highly conserved and present throughout the animal kingdom, unlike lin-4. Over the following years, different microRNAs were identified. As a result of this work, researchers are today aware of the presence of more than 1,000 genes for different microRNAs and that gene regulation for microRNA is present in all multicellular organisms.\n\nWhat are the applications for the future?\n\nAs Iorio and Croce list, since the first discovery, there have been remarkable advances in the understanding of microRNA biology. These include the identification of hundreds of microRNA genes; the dissection of microRNA biogenesis pathways; the identification of numerous microRNA targets and the establishment of principles of target regulation; and more importantly, there have been vigorous studies of their biological functions in physiological and pathological conditions.\n\nResearchers found that a single microRNA can regulate the expression of many different genes, and conversely, a single gene can be regulated by multiple microRNAs, thereby coordinating and fine-tuning entire networks of genes. Extensive research has also yielded knowledge that cells and tissues do not develop normally without microRNAs. Abnormal regulation by microRNA can contribute to cancer, and mutations in genes coding for microRNAs have been found in humans, causing conditions such as congenital hearing loss, eye and skeletal disorders. Mutations in one of the proteins required for microRNA production result in the DICER1 syndrome, a rare but severe syndrome linked to cancer in various organs and tissues.\n\nThe Nobel Prize 2024: An interactive guide"
