            "article_content": "We need less uproar over everyday drones and more critical attention about ones near airports and other restricted airspace\n\nDecember\u2019s spate of drone sightings seen in New Jersey and spreading nationwide, sure looks familiar. As does its associated media frenzy\u2014culminating in memes and conspiracy theories about so-called \u201cmystery drones.\u201d The episode bears an eerie resemblance to the UFO phenomenon, or the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) one, that spiked in recent years and has led to significant congressional attention and legislation.\n\nIn a way, this is progress. The reason this outbreak looks so familiar is that such drone sightings would previously have been identified as UAP ones. It\u2019s only after years of concerted efforts in education, and transparency by U.S. Department of Defense officials, that UAP sightings have rightfully evolved into common drone identification. That is not to say that the drone sightings are any less of a concern, but fortunately, we can address them without the contagion of the UFO community and the conspiracies associated with it.\n\nUnfortunately, our response has been no less irrational.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nA New Jersey state assemblyman has accused federal officials of \u201clying to us\u201d about drones on CNN. The president-elect suggested we \u201cshoot them down!!!\u201d which is almost (but only almost, sadly) needless to say, a bad idea. So is wasting resources to investigate nonsensical notions of advanced technology related to Iran or, again, aliens. Calls for shooting objects down not only have obvious safety issues but fail to recall that Congress and the White House limited such strikes over U.S. territory after the incidents involving the Chinese high-altitude balloon and other balloons, based on concerns about civilian safety.\n\nThere are a couple of things we need to make clear about the drone sightings. First, many of the sightings remain mistaken interpretations of manned aircraft or satellites such as Starlink ones. The real drone sightings fall into two classes: those that are in restricted airspace, and those that are in legal airspace. Restricted airspace surrounds airports as well as national security areas such as Air Force and Navy bases. Most sightings reported fall within the latter category and have been assessed as having no immediate national security or flight safety risk, although the public finds them annoying.\n\nOne fact that many people tend to overlook, or at least don\u2019t readily rationalize, is that these drones have lights on them. That lights are present on various flying objects including drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) is a fact I often referred to in my last job, heading a Pentagon office investigating UAP sightings. Lights on a drone are for collision avoidance. They are a safety feature. Flying drones with lights ensures they can be seen; if they were meant to be unnoticed, the operators would turn off or disable the lights. In September 2023, the FAA changed the rules to allow drones to fly at night this way, and this is likely a contributing factor to the increase in sightings. The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.\n\nCongressional officials and that unfortunate source of information, social media, continue to make unfounded claims of drone technologies far ahead of U.S. capabilities. The most recent example being the assertion that drones flew from an Iranian mother ship off the coast of the U.S. and demonstrated seven or eight hours of battery life. That fantastic assertion requires there to be evidence that the drones originated from an Iranian ship and were tracked continuously to the U.S. cities. There are no such tracks. The more rational explanation is that they originated near the place of the sighting, that is from domestic operators.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean some drone operations aren\u2019t ill-intentioned.\n\nSeveral hypotheses (apart from mistaken identity) might explain these drones in legal airspace. They might be academic, professional or hobbyist domestic operators exploring a new technology. YouTube overflows with drone footage from amateur photographers all over the world. Flying in urban settings, in legal airspace, for photography or maybe even some research such as high resolution thermal or pollution measurements is very plausible. Or they are commercial. Increased commercial activity is unavoidable as industry advances drone technology for delivery, remote sensing and communications.\n\nMore concerning, operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace. Whether foreign or domestic bad actors, they could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is. That information on reactions and response could readily feed back to some sort of attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.\n\nFinally, the operators could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic. It could be for personal gain (such as claiming they have the anti-UAV solution to sell), or perhaps advertising something resembling another History Channel series on aliens.\n\nMuch like the UAP problem, there is little evidence to support, or rule out, any of these hypotheses. Like UAP, the drones don\u2019t likely all have the same explanation. That makes it hard from a national security perspective to distinguish when a sighting is benign versus potentially nefarious. Lest we forget the lessons of the ongoing war on Ukraine, we don\u2019t want to be caught in an intelligence or technical surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, the sightings that are clearly in restricted airspace usually have more obvious intentions. These can range from benign to nefarious, but generally center around seeing things that are normally not allowed. Whether this is military aircraft, commercial airports or operations, these clearly identified drones and balloons with payloads pose not only a security risk but also a flight safety risk. It would only take one small quad copter to get sucked into a commercial jet engine to end in tragedy.\n\nThe proliferation of drone technology, in its commercial, recreational, scientific and military uses, is clearly disrupting the world around us. Our legislation and regulation have created an environment that allows for legal drone usage. It should come as no surprise then that drones are in the air and increasing. Yet here we are, once again with more extraordinary claims, public demands for transparency, baseless accusations of hiding the truth, and congressional calls for more legislation over a mystery in the sky, instead of a rational scientific approach to the investigation. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "A US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed his own late night encounter with a UFO, that lit up his campsite and 'made absolutely no noise.'\n\nThe event came less than a month before a more senior ex-Pentagon counter-intel official, Luis Elizondo, testified before Congress accusing government actors of secretly working to 'hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.'\n\nThe October 21, 2024 campsite UFO, according to the military witness who requested anonymity, hovered as close as 100 yards above him along the treeline: 'The entire area lit up brighter than the brightest full moon I\u2019ve ever seen,' he reported.\n\n'I knew it wasn\u2019t the moon because I had already located the moon prior,' the trained observer noted of this 20\u201330 foot UFO. '[The moon] was a dimly lit waning gibbous.'\n\nThe career military man, who reported this episode to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), added: 'I observed it for at least a minute before fear took over and I sank back down into the bed of my truck and into my sleeping bag.'\n\nThe oval-shaped 'stationary, bright white light' resembles one newly public case reported this November by Connecticut policeman Robert Klein, who professed that an orb UFO, the size of a Mini Cooper, 'lit up the entire cab' of his patrol car in 2022.\n\nFear over roughly car-sized 'unidentified aerial phenomena' (UAP), often described as 'mystery drones,' has swept the nation since November as sightings across New Jersey and surrounding states have eerily matched cases over US military bases.\n\nLocal leaders in the Garden State are 'livid,' according to journalist and author Michael Shellenberger, who obtained audio from a video briefing delivered to more than 500 New Jersey mayors by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nA US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed a late night encounter with a UFO that lit up his campsite. Above, Nest camera footage from a July 24, 2019 UFO case in Leominster, MA, in which a similar brightly lit object (a possible meteor) zoomed across the sky\n\nThe US military witness saw their 30-40 foot long, oval shaped UFO while camping at the the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California. Above: the Milky Way galaxy seen over a Joshua Tree in the park on May 12, 2024\n\n'One of them [i.e. a mayor] got up there,' Shellenberger told Fox News, 'and said, \"I had two automobile-sized drones hovering over my house.\"'\n\nThe newly public military witness's case, as he told NUFORC was itself roughly 8\u201310 feet tall, making this bright oval UFO about the size of a school bus.\n\nThe sighting, which the military man said lasted for over a full minute, occurred at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites, just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California where he was 'the only camper/hunter in the area that night.'\n\n'I was laying in the tarped bed of my truck,' he told NURFOC, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that has coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on UFOs for decades.\n\n'It was pitch black out,' he said, as the waning gibbous moon was shining weakly \u2014 when 'instantly' the ordinary noises of the insects and animals in the wild 'went completely silent' as the UFO appeared.\n\n'It made absolutely no noise, didn\u2019t pulsate or move, and did not radiate any sort of heat,' he said, adding the temperature was 'about 40 degrees Fahrenheit' that night.\n\nBy his estimation, this 'stationary, bright white light' was 'about the size of a medium sized helicopter but with the light encompassing the entire object' as it hovered at 'tree top level, behind an about 30-40 foot tall pine tree, only about 100 yards away.'\n\nThe encounter, which ended as abruptly as it began, differed from Officer Klein's encounter with a car-sized glowing orb UFO in that the Connecticut policeman's sighting pulsated its light from white to red to green to orange.\n\nThe veteran cop took pains to emphasize to NewsNation that, in the early moments of his encounter, he was able to get 'a very close-up view of it' from 30 feet below the hovering, orb-like object: 'It wasn't a drone \u2014 I can guarantee you that.'\n\nSwarms of drones have been spotted in the skies of New Jersey for weeks, sparking officials to call for a 'limited state of emergency' - with drone bans taking effect in some areas\n\nMayor Mike Ghassali of Montvale, New Jersey took to Facebook to reveal what happened to a resident's quadcopter drone when they had a run-in with a mysterious drone UFO hovering in the air nearby - noting there was 'sophisticated' technology at play in this December 15 event\n\nThe military witness delivered the coordinates of his October 2024 UFO sighting as 33 degrees 32' 12.8\" North and 116 degrees 27' 38.7\" West (red pin, above) - placing him at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsite east of Los Angeles at the time of his\n\n'I froze,' Klein said, recalling that moment looking up at the object. 'I wasn't in fear. I just was really trying to understand what exactly I was looking at.'\n\n'I was trying to just process what I was looking at,' he said. 'Still to this day, I'm perplexed.'\n\nSpeaking before Congress this past November, Luis Elizondo, the former head of the Defense Department's UFO-hunting Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), criticized federal officials for 'excessive secrecy' on the UFO issue.\n\n'I believe that we as Americans can handle the truth. And I also believe the world deserves the truth,' Elizondo said.\n\nThe former intelligence officer also urged Congress to pass legislation that would protect government whistleblowers afraid to reveal what they know about UFOs, a common refrain among those testifying at the November 13, 2024 open hearing.\n\nThe hearing, held by the House Oversight committee, was part of a larger investigation into UFOs to determine whether any government officials have been withholding evidence from Congress.\n\n'Advanced technologies not made by our government, or any other government, are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,' Elizondo insisted, raising unsettling implications for the rash of 'mystery drone' sightings at US bases.\n\nIn recent months, the Garden State has been ravaged by thousands of unexplained drone sightings, as over 5,000 reports of odd drones have been filed with federal law enforcement\n\nAlthough misidentifications of conventional planes have been rife amid the growing public panic, reports by from US military officials across America and Europe, alongside local police, have told matching accounts of these car-sized drones.\n\nThe drone swarm's lighting colors, as well as its behavior, match those that also made repeated brazen incursions over the restricted airspace above Air Force joint-base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, then home to America's stealth F-22 fighter fleet.\n\nFor at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of these noisy, small UFOs were also seen at dusk 'moving at rapid speeds' and 'flashing red, green, and white lights.'\n\nAnd these cases are almost identical to what has been reported above sensitive sites in New Jersey, like the US Army's Picatinny Arsenal, since mid-November 2024.\n\nBase police have reported 11 confirmed and unauthorized drone sightings over the arsenal since November 13, meaning security officers 'visibly witnessed a drone.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last October that the unexplained incursions over Langley-Eustis were 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' as Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

            "article_content": "Most people, when they think about AI, focus on applications such as image generation or chatbots. But as we're starting to learn, there is so much more to artificial intelligence than these simple tools.\n\nAs well as the high-specification AI products, which help with science, deep research and other heavyweight needs, AI is also extremely useful in the softer sciences.\n\nOur existence is made up of relationships \u2014 work, family, friendships, they're all part of the important mix of life. So let's take a quick look and see how our computerized friend can help us navigate the tricky waters around our important social activities.\n\nIt's important to remember, however, that AI will never be a substitute for real-life engagement or professional guidance. This is just an example of how you can use AI, not professional advice.\n\n1. Communications\n\nSo much of the hard work relating to relationships comes from simply navigating communications. It's no surprise that large language models, which are the bedrock of today's AI, excel at language. We can use this ability to significantly improve our interactions.\n\nA growing number of people use their chatbot as a sounding board, to ask for advice on how to deal with tricky communications. Things said or unsaid.\n\nA simple tool is to give ChatGPT something you plan to send to a friend, loved one or even a colleague and ask: \"Can I phrase this better?\"\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n2. Conflict resolution\n\nInterview roleplay with GPT-4o voice and vision - YouTube Watch On\n\nOne of the sad but true facts about relationships is the fact that they involve a fair amount of conflict in one way or another. Chatbots can offer feedback on tricky episodes, as well as suggestions for how to overcome certain positions.\n\nEven asking simple questions about how to apologize, or requesting help with mediation is a valuable way to use the power of AI language.\n\nFor those who need something a little more structured, the Flamme app may be a worthwhile investment. It offers a wide range of options and is available on iPhone and Android. Essentially, it offers advice on interacting with your partner every day including tips and information.\n\n3. Mental Health\n\nAgain, this is not advice, merely a list of tips and apps you can use with AI.\n\nThere's a growing palette of AI tools being deployed for mental health applications. These cover the range from simple mood apps, which check your current state of mind and help to improve it, to deep therapy products which are designed to work alongside professional mental health services.\n\nOne such tool is Youper, which is a CBT chatbot designed to help people with emotional issues. Always check with medical professionals.\n\n4. Organizational tool\n\nA lot of the negative issues arising out of relationships come from simple bad planning. Forgetting appointments, losing track of obligations or simply not contributing our share to a workload. Again AI can come to the rescue through the use of a variety of tools to help manage these kinds of daily demands.\n\nThe free Trevor AI app is one such example amongst many. It combines an AI assistant with an organizer, to-do list manager and more.\n\n5. Social skills aid\n\nHave you ever wished you were more socially adept? You're not alone, millions of people across the world feel like they fail to cope with basic social skills. We can use artificial intelligence to help practice these skills, because they can be learned just like any other skill.\n\nRole-playing, active listening sessions and empathy exercises are all part of the things we can use to improve ourselves.\n\nThere are a number of commercial apps which can be used for this purpose, although many are just wrappers for the standard AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic and the rest. It's probably just as valid to use a standard chatbot in the first instance.\n\n6. Memory aid\n\nIt pays to remember the simple things in our relationships. Even banal issues like forgetting birthdays or anniversaries can be a cause of conflict and discord.\n\nBy using AI technology to manage our memory, calendar or even alarm clock, we can encourage smooth sailing in every way.\n\nSetting reminders for gift ideas is a very quick win. This type of feature is likely to become more common in standard AI models as the memory functions improve over time.\n\n7. General relationships\n\nIt may sound a little excessive, but by using an AI advisor to help us with relationship expectations at the beginning of an important life journey, we can proactively prevent issues down the line.\n\nWe can also use AI to help us with cultural and language gaps which may occur in our personal interactions.\n\nFinally, using AI to help with relationship goal setting in a collaborative way can be very useful. By working together on these kinds of tasks, we can probably strengthen the depth of our connection in subtle but important ways."

            "article_content": "Let\u2019s be honest; the whole idea of a prequel makes no sense.\n\nNarratives have to move forward, advancing the life of the main character. It\u2019s counter-intuitive to take a character to point B in one story just to start another story before point A. That\u2019s why so many franchises prefer to reboot, like the 2009 Star Trek or 2011\u2019s Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nHowever, some talented filmmakers have managed to use the prequel structure to their advantage. Playing on the audience\u2019s expectations and knowledge, these movies take a character back before the start and show how they became the heroes we wanted to follow in the first place.\n\n1. The Godfather, Part II (1974)\n\nImage Credit: Paramount Pictures.\n\nOn one hand, director Francis Ford Coppola kind of cheats with The Godfather, Part II, as the narrative splits between the rise of the new Don Michael (Al Pacino) and the arrival in America of his father Vito (now played by Robert De Niro).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, The Godfather, Part II is one of the greatest movies of all time, showing how the mistreatment of immigrants drove newcomers to rely on the mafia while also showing the cost of those decisions in the present.\n\n2. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)\n\nImage Credit: Jasin Boland; Warner Bros.\n\nCharlize Theron and her soulful take on the Imperator Furiosa stole the show from Tom Hardy as the title character in Mad Max: Fury Road. But when the long production time for the prequel Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga forced Theron to leave the project, she left behind some giant shoots for incoming actor Anya Taylor-Joy to fill.\n\nTaylor-Joy proves more than up to the challenge, thanks in part to the more deliberate story that Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris tell in Furiosa. Add in an unhinged performance from Chris Hemsworth, and Furiosa shows how the title character made the brave decision that sent her down the fury road.\n\n3. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992)\n\nImage Credit: New Line Cinema.\n\nFive minutes into the first episode of Twin Peaks, the cult television show by David Lynch and Mark Frost, viewers see the dead body of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) wrapped in plastic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me looks back at the last week of Laura\u2019s life, elevating her from a mere victim to a conflicted figure who has agency over her fate.\n\n4. Final Destination 5 (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Doane Gregory; New Line Productions, Inc.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinal Destination 5 works so well as a prequel because it doesn\u2019t act like one. Most of the movie, directed by Steven Quale and written by Eric Heisserer, plays like any other entry in the cult horror series.\n\nBut in the final moments, the main characters (portrayed by Nicholas D\u2019Agosto and Emma Bell) celebrate the fact that they\u2019ve survived an ordeal by boarding a plane. Turns out, it\u2019s the same plane that gets destroyed at the start of the first Final Destination movie, thus completing the circle.\n\n5. Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century-Fox.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the recent run of Planet of the Apes movies connects to the first film from 1968. But even if the new story of Caesar never leads to Dr. Zaius, Zira, and Cornelius, the third, fourth, and fifth movies of the original series go back before the Planet of the Apes.\n\nAfter the Earth blows up in Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape from the Planet of the Apes begins with Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) arriving in 1971 America, setting off a chain of events that leads to intelligent apes in the future.\n\n6. Pearl (2022)\n\nImage Credit: Christopher Moss \u2013 Origin Picture Show LLC/A24.\n\nJust weeks after the slasher X hit theaters, director Ti West revealed that he and star Mia Goth made another movie together, the prequel Pearl. Written by West and Goth, Pearl takes place on the same farm as X and checks in with that movie\u2019s elderly killer as a young woman.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoth portrayed the older Pearl under piles of make-up in X. But Pearl allows her to perform without such limitations, letting her add layers to the damaged psyche of the future killer.\n\n7. Monsters University (2013)\n\nImage Credit: Pixar/Disney Studios.\n\nAt the start of Monsters University, go-getter Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) comes to school ready to become a scarer against the taunts of his privileged but lazy roommate, Sully (John Goodman).\n\nOf course, any who saw Monsters, Inc. knows that Mike never becomes a scarer, but he does become best pals with Sully. Director Dan Scanlon, who co-wrote the script with Dan Gerson and Robert L. Baird, uses that knowledge to tell a moving story about dealing with failure and disappointment.\n\n8. Prometheus (2012)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Studios\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFans cheered at the news that director Ridley Scott would come back to the Alien franchise that he started in 1979, especially when they learned he\u2019d be making a prequel to that first film.\n\nHowever, Scott exceeded all expectations with Prometheus, which uses the world of Alien for theological exploration more than horror, all while showing why the Weyland-Yutani company took such interest in the xenomorph in the first place.\n\n9. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023)\n\nImage Credit: Murray Close/Lionsgate.\n\nWhen The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes hit theaters in 2023, no one expected much from a prequel of a series that ended its story almost a decade earlier.\n\nHowever, Songbirds & Snakes won over fans, in part because of Rachel Zegler\u2019s winning turn in the lead and in part because of the film\u2019s look at the life of franchise villain Coriolanus Snow, reimagined as a complicated young man played by Tom Blyth.\n\n10. Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox.\n\nStar Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace relaunched the Star Wars franchise by turning Darth Vader into a cute little blond boy. By the end of Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith, little Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) had grown up and traveled down the dark path.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe specific reasons for Yoda going into hiding and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) watching over young Luke don\u2019t make too much sense, but Episode III does complete the origin of Darth Vader, making him into a tragic figure.\n\n11. X-Men: First Class (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.\n\nNo part of the timeline in the X-Men movie franchise makes much sense, but director Matthew Vaughn gets the important parts right for the prequel X-Men: First Class. By casting Michael Fassbender as Magneto and James McAvoy as Professor X, Vaughn recreates the tension of the previous films.\n\nFurthermore, Vaughn and his co-writers Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, and Jane Goldman use the 1960s setting of First Class to tie the heroes into real-world events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n12. Wonka (2023)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNobody ever needed an origin story for Mr. Wonka, the chocolatier from Roald Dahl\u2019s novels and the movie adaptations, one featuring a beloved performance by Gene Wilder and the other a tolerated performance by Johnny Depp.\n\nBut thanks to the whimsy that writer and director Paul King brought to the Paddington films, Wonka wins over even cynical viewers who want to learn how Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s penniless dreamer opens his own chocolate factory.\n\n13. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\n\nImage Credit: Lucasfilm, Ltd.\n\nOne would be forgiven for not realizing that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a prequel to Indy\u2019s first adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark. At no point do writer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg, working from a screenplay by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, wink toward the previous film.\n\nHowever, the darker-edged Temple of Doom does see Indy (Harrison Ford) dropping his cynicism and becoming the hero he is in Raiders.\n\n14. The Thing (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Universal Pictures.\n\nThe 1982 classic The Thing begins with Norwegian scientists chasing a dog across the Arctic to a nearby American outpost, warning that the dog is, in fact, a monster. The 2011 film The Thing, directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and written by Eric Heisserer, goes back to show what happened to those Norwegians.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe 2011 movie\u2019s digital effects don\u2019t hold a candle to Rob Bottin\u2019s creature designs from the 1982 film, but van Heijningen finds clever ways to set up iconic images from the Carpenter movie.\n\n15. The First Purge (2018)\n\nImage Credit: Universal Pictures.\n\n2013\u2019s The Purge became a hit despite its ludicrous premise, set in a near-future America where all laws get suspended for an annual 24-hour period.\n\nFor the prequel, The First Purge, director Gerard McMurray and screenwriter James DeMonaco don\u2019t worry about justifying the absurd practice. Instead, they tie the purge to current events, channeling the political anger of the year into thrilling genre filmmaking.\n\n16. Orphan: First Kill (2022)\n\nImage Credit: Steve Ackerman; Paramount Players, a Division of Paramount Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo much of the 2009 horror movie Orphan hinged on its big reveal that the killer kid Esther was, in fact, a full-grown adult who just looked like a child.\n\nAlthough director William Brent Bell and writer David Coggeshall got star Isabelle Fuhrman, who was a kid when she shot the first movie, back for the prequel Orphan: First Kill, she was visibly older. To their credit, Bell and Coggeshall take advantage of the audience\u2019s knowledge and disbelief, making Orphan: First Kill a more absurd and fun movie.\n\n17. The First Omen (2024)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Studios.\n\nDespite direction from Richard Donner, 1976\u2019s The Omen always played like an unimpressive knockoff of The Exorcist. Yet, director Arkasha Stevenson doesn\u2019t let that low bar limit her for The First Omen and instead launches into a surreal and wild movie.\n\nFor the most part, The First Omen script by Stevenson, Tim Smith, and Keith Thomas avoids too many winks to the 1976 movie. But by the time it reaches its conclusion (and post-credit scene), The First Omen goes right into The Omen.\n\n18. Infernal Affairs II (2003)\n\nImage Credit: Media Asia Distribution.\n\nMost Americans know Infernal Affairs as the inspiration for Martin Scorsese\u2019s hit crime film The Departed. However, where The Departed stood as its own film, the source franchise continued with the prequel Infernal Affairs II.\n\nInfernal Affairs star Andrew Lau serves as director, along with Alan Mak, for the prequel. Instead, he lets Edison Chen take over as Lau Kin-ming with Shawn Yue as Tony Leung\u2019s character, Chan Wing-yan. Despite these changes, Infernal Affairs II keeps the spirit of the original, showing how cops and criminals got to the point where they could switch places.\n\n19. Saw X (2023)\n\nImage Credit: Alexandro Bola\u00f1os Escamilla; Lionsgate.\n\nNon-horror fans know the Saw franchise as a gore-filled series about death traps. But horror fans also know that the Saw franchise is part police drama with a twisty timeline that would confuse the most hardened soap opera fan.\n\nSaw X, directed by Kevin Greutert and written by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg, takes advantage of that unusual chronology to set a story between the original Saw and its first sequel, Saw II. There, viewers see the doomed John Kramer (Tobin Bell) take one last chance at a normal life before embracing his identity as the killer Jigsaw.\n\n20. Prey (2022)\n\nImage Credit: David Bukach; Hulu; 20th Century Studios.\n\n1990\u2019s Predator 2 ends with tough cop Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) getting honored by three alien Predators for his ability to defeat one of their members. They reward him with a pistol engraved with the name Raphael Adolini and the year 1715, revealing that the aliens have been coming to Earth for decades.\n\nPrey checks in on one of those early expeditions, with a Predator arriving in the Great Plains in 1719. There, the alien clashes with Comanche Naru (Amber Midthunder), which director Dan Trachtenberg and writer Patrick Aison present as both a set-up for Predator and a satisfying action movie in its own right.\n\n21. Paranormal Activity 3 (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Paramount Pictures.\n\nBy the second entry in the found-footage horror series Paranormal Activity, one begins to wonder why ghosts care so much about sisters Katie and Kristie.\n\nDirectors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, along with writer Christopher Landon, seek to answer that question, going back to girls\u2019 childhood. In addition to some of the most inventive scares in the series, Paranormal Activity 3 also reveals the events that doomed the sisters to lifelong hauntings.\n\n22. Ouija: Origin of Evil (2018)\n\nImage Credit: Universal Pictures.\n\nOuija: Origin of Evil is the rare follow-up film that outdoes its predecessor. Where 2014\u2019s Ouija was an unambitious scary movie about the famous board game Origin of Evil comes from Mike Flanagan, the excellent filmmaker behind Doctor Sleep and The House on Haunted Hill.\n\nSet 47 years before the first film, Origin of Evil, shows how the titular board game got cursed in the first place. While these connections help develop Ouija, the most interesting thing is the rich human drama that Flanagan brings to the film.\n\n23. Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nIn a weird quirk of Hollywood filmmaking, The Exorcist has not one but two prequels, both based on the same story with the same cast. Both movies show the first encounter between Father Merrin (played by Max von Sydow in the 1973 movie and by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd in the prequels) and the demon Pazuzu.\n\nBut while Exorcist: The Beginning, directed by Renny Harlin, goes for cheap scares, Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist, directed by Paul Schrader, tries to match the depth of the William Friedkin films.\n\n24. Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990)\n\nImage Credit: Showtime.\n\nThe shocking reveal of 1960\u2019s Psycho left a lot of questions about what happened to Mrs. Bates and how her son Norman (Anthony Perkins) came to develop a second personality around his mother. The TV film Psycho IV: The Beginning, directed by Mick Garris and written by Joseph Stefano, answers that question.\n\nPerkins returns to play Norman, who tells his story to an interviewer, with E.T. star (and frequent Mike Flanagan collaborator) Henry Thomas as the young Norman. The movie tries to humanize the connection between Norman and his mother (Olivia Hussey), which just makes the tale creepier."

Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, the franchise is produced by Atomic Monster, the Safran Company, and New Line Cinema.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe films dramatize the alleged real-life experiences of Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators and writers connected to well-known but controversial haunting cases. The spin-off films concentrate on the origins of some of the creatures the Warrens have encountered, while the main series follows their efforts to help those who are being bothered by the spirits.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Conjuring Universe movies in order\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nun (2018)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nun (Source: Prime)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on a screenplay by Gary Dauberman and James Wan, The Nun is a 2018 American gothic supernatural horror film that was directed by Corin Hardy. In the Conjuring shared universe, it is the fifth movie and a spiritual spin-off of The Conjuring 2. The story involves the discovery of an awful secret in 1952 Romania by a Roman Catholic priest and a nun in her novitiate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nun II (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nun II (Source: Prime)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nun II is a 2023 American gothic supernatural horror film that was directed by Michael Chaves. Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, and Akela Cooper wrote the screenplay, which was based on a Cooper novella. The film is the eighth release in the Conjuring Universe franchise and a follow-up to The Nun (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film is set in 1956 in France. The Nun's sequel follows Sister Irene as she confronts the demonic power Valak, the Nun, once more.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnabelle: Creation (2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnabelle: Creation (Source: Prime)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2017 American supernatural horror movie Annabelle: Creation was written by Gary Dauberman, produced by Peter Safran and James Wan, and directed by David F. Sandberg. It is the fourth film in the Conjuring Universe series and a precursor to 2014's Annabelle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nun (Stephanie Sigman) and six orphaned daughters are welcomed into the California farmhouse of Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), a former toy maker, and his wife Esther (Miranda Otto). Annabelle (played by Samara Lee), the couple's 7-year-old daughter, lost her life in a terrible vehicle accident years earlier. One child soon discovers a seemingly innocent doll that seems to have a life of its own after breaking into a forbidden room.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnabelle (2014)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnabelle (Source: Netflix)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2014 American supernatural horror movie Annabelle was written by Gary Dauberman, produced by Peter Safran and James Wan, and directed by John R. Leonetti. Ed and Lorraine Warren's story of a doll named Annabelle served as the basis for the movie. It is the second overall installment in the Conjuring Universe and a spin-off and prequel to the 2013 movie The Conjuring.\n\n\n\n\n\nWard Horton's character, John Form, believes he has discovered the ideal present for his pregnant wife, Mia (Annabelle Wallis): a vintage doll wearing a stunning white outfit. But the couple's happiness is short-lived. The couple is violently attacked by devil worshippers who break into their house one dreadful night. The cultists transform the once-beautiful object into a vehicle for ultimate evil as they attempt to call forth a demon by smearing a bloody rune on the nursery wall and dripping blood on Mia's doll.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Conjuring (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Conjuring (Source: Prime)\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Wan is the director of the 2013 American supernatural horror movie The Conjuring, which was written by Chad Hayes and Carey W.

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, scientists think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Yet most of the hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile</\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "HOLLYWOOD, FLA. (WSVN) - A South Florida mother is demanding accountability after, she said, her 11-year-old son was attacked by a teacher while on a field trip.\n\nSpeaking with 7News on Thursday, Yasmine Fran\u00e7ois said the incident occurred while her son Kendrick, a sixth-grade student at McNicol Middle School in Hollywood, was on a field trip at the Museum of Discovery and Science in Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 20.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said she initially got a call that Kendrick had gotten into a fight.\n\nUpon the child\u2019s arrival at home, Fran\u00e7ois took away his phone and prepared to scale back his Christmas gifts.\n\nBut then a friend sent her a video showing the moments after the fight.\n\nThe video, provided by the mother, shows a woman identified by Kendrick as a teacher pulling him into a picnic bench, then jumping on top of him.\n\nAudio from the video captures what sounds like a slap. On top of all that, the woman seen in the clip yelled profanities at the child.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said she was stunned.\n\n\u201cHow do you handle a kid like that? Who does that?\u201d she said.\n\nBefore seeing the video, Fran\u00e7ois said she was skeptical of what had occurred.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s Christmas, he knows he\u2019s in trouble, so he\u2019s probably \u2013 I didn\u2019t believe that. I said, \u2018No teacher would choke you, especially a lady, like no,'\u201d she said.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said her son got a three-day school suspension, adding that the school principal never reported the teacher\u2019s actions which, the concerned mother said, crossed the line.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teacher and you address your student? That\u2019s the language? Is that the vocabulary you use to speak to a kid? Is that how you speak in the classroom?\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nThe mother now wants the teacher to be held accountable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the mom that\u2019s gonna take sides with my son. Like, if you do something bad, you know, you do something bad. I\u2019ll most likely side with the school before I side with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m highly disappointed because I feel like I was misled. They told me what he did. They didn\u2019t tell me what they did to him.\u201d\n\nBroward County Schools did not immediately respond to 7News\u2019 request for comment, as they are on winter break.\n\nThe mother hopes that once school resumes, she can sit down and have a conversation with school officials about what occurred.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

            "article_content": "OpenAI says its corporate structure must evolve to advance its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2014 AI that can complete most tasks humans can \u2014 benefits all humanity.\n\nOpenAI currently has a for-profit org controlled by a nonprofit, with a \u201ccapped profit\u201d share for investors and employees. But in a blog post published Friday, the company says it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest.\n\nThose details had been reported elsewhere. In December, The New York Times revealed that OpenAI was in discussions to pay its nonprofit billions of dollars for it to cede control. However, it\u2019s the first time OpenAI has laid out its proposal in a public memo.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup \u2014 we have to become an enduring company,\u201d OpenAI wrote in its post. \u201cThe world is moving to build out a new infrastructure of energy, land use, chips, data centers, data, AI models, and AI systems for the 21st century economy. We seek to evolve in order to take the next step in our mission.\u201d\n\nOpenAI says establishing the PBC would enable it to \u201cbalance shareholder interests, stakeholder interests, and a public benefit interest\u201d in its decision-making while allowing it to \u201craise the necessary capital with conventional terms.\u201d It would also create one of the best-resourced nonprofits in history, OpenAI claims; OpenAI\u2019s existing nonprofit would receive shares in the PBC \u201cat a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a nonprofit and a for-profit today, and we will continue to have both,\u201d OpenAI wrote. \u201cOur current structure does not allow the board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission and does not enable the nonprofit to easily do more than control the for-profit. The PBC will run and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while the nonprofit will hire a leadership team and staff to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies including Microsoft.\n\nIn October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, bringing its total raised to $17.9 billion. The company still expects to lose money this year, however \u2014 $5 billion, according to CNBC \u2014 and the terms of its latest funding round require that it completes a for-profit transition within two years.\n\nThe plan faces hurdles.\n\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s co-founders, billionaire Elon Musk, has filed for an injunction to halt the company\u2019s transition to a for-profit, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission. Musk has also alleged that OpenAI has deprived his own AI company, xAI, of capital by extracting promises from investors not to fund it.\n\nOpenAI has called Musk\u2019s complaints \u201cbaseless\u201d and simply a case of sour grapes.\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI\u2019s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, nonprofit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government,\u201d Meta wrote in the letter.\n\nOpenAI competitors like xAI and Anthropic are structured as PBCs, but lack a nonprofit component.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s structure as it exists today is what ultimately led to the abrupt ousting of CEO Sam Altman last November, which greatly displeased investors \u2014 in particular Microsoft. It also gives OpenAI\u2019s board the power to determine exactly when OpenAI has achieved AGI, and exempts this AGI from the licensing agreements the startup has in place with customers.\n\nOne of those customers is Microsoft \u2014 and Microsoft and OpenAI are said to have a specific, internal financial definition of AGI. According to The Information, the two companies signed an agreement last year stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nOpenAI continues to deal with an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Carroll Wainwright, who researched aligning AI systems with safety policies, wrote in a post on X this fall that OpenAI \u201cwas structured as a non-profit [but] acted like a for-profit\u201d and \u201cshould not [be trusted] when it promises to do the right thing later.\u201d"

In the current study, investigators characterized trends in cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations, health care costs, and procedural utilization.\n\nThe investigators conducted a retrospective analysis using discharge data and ICD-10 codes from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016 to 2021 (costs adjusted and reported in 2023 dollars). The NIS is the largest all-payer, encounter-level database in the US for hospitalizations (about 7 million deidentified hospitalizations/year).\n\nThe investigators noted in 2021, the 4,687,370 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the US cost $108 billion. The highest costs, $18.5 billion, were accounted for by heart failure (HF), $11.2 billion by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), and $10.9 billion by stroke. Adults aged at least 65 years accounted for 64% of all cardiac-related hospitalizations, and those aged 45 to 64 years accounted for 30% (55% men; 70% White; 16% Black; 9% Hispanic).\n\n\u201c \u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021, significant upward trends were noted in the following:\n\nHF\n\nStroke\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nSTEMI\n\nChest pain\n\nHypertensive emergency\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nAortic dissection\n\nSudden cardiac death\n\nPericarditis\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia\n\nPulmonary heart disease\n\nTotal costs increased over $10 billion across the study period, although not linearly, with significant declines likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Total CV-related costs by 2030 may reach $131.3 billion.\n\nProcedures most performed in all years included coronary, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-bypass peripheral vascular surgery, pacemaker replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n\nStudy limitations include ICD codes may underreport primary diagnoses, NIS data are event-level related to discharge with unclear interpretation of how readmissions affect the data, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations and costs was undetermined.\n\n\u201cOverall, from the years 2016 to 2021, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures demonstrated upward trends,\u201d the investigators wrote. \u201c\u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Some [or one] study author(s) declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, scientists think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Yet most of the hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile</\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

Initiatives in terms of quality, innovation and wider global reach will help the Indian pharma sector to realise the potential,\" according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain.\n\nGiven the conducive policies and the advantage of demographic and digital talent, India will play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all in years to come, he added.\n\nIPA represents 23 leading research-based Indian pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, among others.\n\nJain said innovation will continue to be a major focus for the industry going forward.\n\nHe noted that the government is expected to soon announce the operational details of the Promotion of Research & Innovation Programme which would also spur innovation.\n\nElaborating on the initiatives lined up in the private sector, he said that leading companies are increasing their focus on specialty portfolios and diversifying into higher-value drugs.\n\n\"Additionally, the industry is set to make notable progress in areas such as CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA vaccines, and the development of complex molecules, which hold immense potential for driving future growth,\" Jain said.\n\nBesides, the patent expiries of blockbuster biologics by 2025 present a significant growth avenue in the global biosimilars market, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai said the industry is set for a profound transformation in 2025.\n\nTechnological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine are set to revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, he said.\n\nOPPI represents research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.\n\nBesides, strengthened regulatory frameworks will enable the swift adoption of innovative therapies while prioritising patient safety, Matai said.\n\n\"A focus on research excellence and innovation will position India as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals. Collaboration between policymakers, academia and industry stakeholders will address unmet medical needs, particularly in underserved regions,\" he stated.\n\nAlso, adherence to Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) will uphold ethical standards, fostering trust and transparency across the healthcare ecosystem, Matai stated.\n\nReflecting on the year gone by, Jain said 2024 has been a year of building on a robust foundation with sustainable growth and thrust on simplifying regulations and harmonisation with global standards.\n\nThe PLI (production linked incentive) schemes have started seeing dividends with the launch of greenfield projects for the production of Penicillin G and Clavulanic acid, among others.\n\nMatai noted that the notification of the Patent (Amendment) Rules 2024, waivers for Phase 3 clinical trials for certain categories of drugs already approved in well-regulated markets, and the much-awaited Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states reflect India's progressive strides toward creating a dynamic, globally competitive pharmaceutical sector that is driven by innovation.\n\nCommenting on the healthcare segment, Fortis Healthcare MD & CEO Ashutosh Raghuvanshi said that the hospital market is projected to grow from nearly USD 99 billion in 2023 to an estimated USD 194 billion by 2032.\n\n\"Our sector is not only expanding but evolving to meet the diverse needs of our population. This year has been particularly significant as hospitals have emerged as the leading recipients of foreign direct investment within the healthcare landscape,\" he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the industry must focus on several key trends that will shape the future of healthcare in India, Raghuvanshi said.\n\n\"The ageing population will drive demand for specialised geriatric care, while a growing emphasis on preventive care will shift our focus from merely treating illness to promoting wellness,\" he stated.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and telemedicine will enhance diagnostic precision and operational efficiency, ultimately improving patient outcomes, he added.\n\nCommenting on the medtech sector, Poly Medicure MD Himanshu Baid said it is imperative for companies to step up their investments in R&D and innovation to sustain growth momentum.\n\n\"The future belongs to those who can develop transformative technologies that address the healthcare needs of a dynamic and diverse world. With initiatives like the new medical devices scheme and a favourable regulatory environment providing the necessary foundation, India is well-positioned to expand its influence globally,\" he added.\n\nAs the market is expected to reach USD 50 billion by FY30, the med-tech industry's growth story reflects the power of collaboration and self-reliance, he added.\n\nMetropolis Healthcare Promoter and Executive Chairperson Ameera Shah said as the diagnostics industry progresses from USD 13 billion in FY23 towards an expected USD 25 billion by FY28, it is fuelled by increasing awareness of preventive healthcare, an aging population, and broader insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, the path forward demands a strategic focus on technology, accessibility, and collaboration, she added.\n\nThe future of diagnostics lies in embracing genomics, digitalisation and technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data analytics, Shah said."

            "article_content": "From pv magazine 12/24-01/25\n\nJust over a decade ago, Sandia National Laboratories founded the PV Performance Modeling Collaborative (PVPMC). PVPMC is increasing transparency and accuracy in PV system performance modeling, according to Sandia, with the organization helping to bring together stakeholders to improve modeling practices. Joshua Stein, senior scientist at Sandia, thinks it is time for a similar effort to shed light onto data analytics for PV plant performance monitoring.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of standardization and harmonization in the way people are talking about fault analytics and monitoring,\u201d he explained to pv magazine. Currently, some companies are offering services that include data analytics and fault identification and classification based on monitoring data from PV power plants. However, these companies each use their own set of failure definitions, which means that it is very difficult to compare and contrast the value of these services.\n\n\u201cImagine if every doctor or hospital you visited used their own set of diagnoses and clinical practices.\u201d said Stein. \u201cIt would be very difficult and confusing to get a second opinion. Most mature industries standardize their definitions of faults and mitigation procedures. Solar PV is not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, the introduction of machine learning techniques to automate fault detection in PV systems has further muddied the picture. Stein was careful to clarify that he is not against machine learning. \u201cAutomated ML-based fault detection is beneficial in that it can lead to highly scalable analytics,\u201d said Stein.\n\nRethinking KPIs\n\nTechnical key performance indicators (KPIs) are essential for evaluating PV power plants, from the development stage to contractual agreements between asset owners and O&M providers.\n\n\u201cWhile IEC and ASTM standards define some KPIs, such as performance ratio (PR) and capacity tests, their calculation methods often vary or rely on user interpretation, leading to uncertain results,\u201d said Stein\u2019s Sandia Labs colleague Marios Theristis.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there is significant flexibility in data handling, which can introduce biases that impact contracts and financial decisions. Without clear KPI definitions and harmonized calculations, contracts may be unfairly affected \u2013 not due to actual under-performance or over-performance, but because of calculation bias,\u201d he added.\n\nBad data is data that is not useful because it has been obtained through inadequate means. It contains errors or it isn\u2019t clean. This in turn creates problems for PV stakeholders who rely on it to tell them what their system\u2019s actual performance is.\n\nStandard industry practice is for asset owners to subcontract an O&M provider to take care of operation and maintenance. This means a contractual agreement dictating the power plant is being maintained appropriately and meeting certain KPIs.\n\n\u201cIf you have bad data quality, then there will be some bias introduced in the KPI estimation. This bias can be positive, or it can be negative. In a hypothetical scenario where the PR bias is negative, then the O&M provider would be unfairly paying penalties caused by data quality, and not under-performance,\u201d said Theristis.\n\nThis also works in reverse where an O&M provider could benefit, due to bias caused by data quality and not plant over-performance. Theristis continued: \u201cIn some cases, the operational PR is compared to the pre-construction PR generated by a PV design software, leading to an apples-to-oranges comparison: Is the PR difference due to an overly optimistic pre-construction simulation or actual underperformance?\u201d\n\nProgram transparency\n\nTheristis has begun a new program to tackle these issues, the PV O&M Analytics Collaborative (PVMAC). He introduced the project at the EU PVSEC conference held in Vienna in September 2024.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to create a collaborative network to improve transparency in PV analytics software and services, engage with monitoring/analytic companies, O&M providers, asset owners, insurers, and help these stakeholders come together to agree on what standards are needed and improve the overall market\u2019s transparency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe team is also using Sandia Labs\u2019 supercomputers to run simulations across the United States to reduce uncertainties in KPI estimation.\n\nPVMAC is still very new, but over the next few months the researchers will meet with industry to carry out interviews and tests such as blind analytic comparisons. This involves giving stakeholders real or synthetic performance data and asking them to identify and classify faults and calculate KPIs.\n\n\u201cBlind comparisons are a great way to evaluate the state of the industry practice and the consistency between different providers.\n\n\u201cWe expect that these comparisons will highlight discrepancies in how different companies define faults and calculate KPIs,\u201d said Stein.\n\n\u201cWe plan to host dedicated sessions on O&M analytics, failure and KPI harmonization at our upcoming PVPMC workshops,\u201d added Theristis.\n\nStandardizing performance\n\nThe two scientists hope that by shining light on any inconsistencies, it will be easier to build consensus on the steps needed for standardization. For example, an O&M provider that offers a performance guarantee could be incentivized to not clean irradiance sensors well because a dirty pyranometer makes the PV performance appear better than it actually is. The goal for Stein and Theristis is to quickly determine why a PV plant is under-performing and suggest strategies for addressing the problems.\n\nA lot is at stake, even a small percentage of underperformance for a large PV plant results in significant financial losses. Stein reckons measuring the performance of a PV system is not that different from measuring the health of a person.\n\n\u201cYou collect data about your patient, e.g., vital signs, medical history, if these indicate a more serious problem, you order more tests. At least in medicine, standards are pretty much international, so it doesn\u2019t matter where you go in the world, you will be evaluated in a similar manner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that with PV, we can have a similar system. The oil and gas industry, for instance, has been standardized. If you go to an oil rig or a gas turbine in any country in the world, the standards are similar,\u201d he said.\n\nTangled web\n\nPoor power plant management can also pose problems. Theristis warned that although many O&M products and services are available, asset owners may not have \u201ca quantitative knowledge\u201d of the potential benefits of investing in data quality, O&M, and analytic capabilities. \u201cThese solutions have not achieved transparency and lack independent validation,\u201d he said.\n\nUsing supervised machine learning methods for classification is preferable to unsupervised, according to Stein, because the former allows you to tell the algorithm what the categories are.\n\n\u201cBut many people opt for unsupervised, which basically says there\u2019s a problem without necessarily specifying the problem,\u201d said Stein. \u201cIt can get tangled up in clustering algorithms which say all these problems are similar somehow and then if you use the same practice on multiple data sets you can end up with clustered data, but it is clustered in for different reasons.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the dangers of machine learning; it works for a particular data set, but it\u2019s hard to extend it to a different data set that you haven\u2019t trained it on.\u201d\n\nIf machine learning is to be used effectively to monitor fault detection, the industry must first agree on how these faults are defined. Not all companies selling and using AI or machine learning solutions to identify faults are using these methods consistently and transparently, Stein said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is the problem is not all companies are doing the same thing. Some companies are doing very good work and have very valuable products but there\u2019s nobody out there actually coming up with the standards and validation so those companies can be properly valued, right?\u201d\n\nThe scientist warned that \u2018AI hype\u2019 might be to blame. \u201cMany companies advertise that their software uses AI technology, but few are willing to describe exactly how it is being used. And so, each company has their own sort of \u2018diagnostic manual\u2019 for what can go wrong with the PV system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is just a buzzword sometimes.\u201d"

Although Russia launched a powerful new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile at a Ukrainian weapons facility after the first two volleys of Western long-range missiles, it has since responded to them with its usual mix of drones, missiles and threats."

            "article_content": "After 20 months of civil war, Sudan is suffering the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Things are going to get much worse for civilians, experts say.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSudan\u2019s civil war has unleashed violence, death, hunger and disease on a scarcely imaginable scale: tens of thousands of people have been killed, 12 million have been displaced and, with the country on the brink of famine, more than half of its 48 million citizens are acutely food insecure.\n\nBut the toll of the war on civilians is likely to get much worse in the coming months, political analysts and aid workers told Euronews.\n\nWith no decisive military victory on the horizon, experts say that Sudan, whose war is often overlooked, is going to see more displacement, more hunger and more disease outbreaks in 2025, compounding what is already the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cThings look set to get much worse for civilians in the new year,\u201d said Kholood Khair, a Sudanese political analyst who runs the Confluence Advisory think tank.\n\nHeavy fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a militia, broke out on 15 April last year in the capital Khartoum.\n\nThe SAF leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is better known as Hemedti, were once allies.\n\nIn October 2021, they seized power in a joint coup, thwarting Sudanese hopes for a civilian-led government, several years after a peaceful revolution had toppled the dictator Omar al-Bashir. Based, as it was, on shaky foundations, the generals' alliance soon fully unravelled due to clashing ambitions between the two men and their forces.\n\nRSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti) in Galawee, northern Sudan, on 15 June, 2019. STR/Copyright 2019 The AP. All rights reserved.\n\nIn the ensuing war, both sides have been accused of war crimes and of weaponising humanitarian aid.\n\n\"There is no straightforward good guy, bad guy binary that media attention and public attention usually craves to understand these types of situations,\" said Michael Jones, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a defence and security think tank.\n\n\"The intent and in the scale of RSF atrocities are qualitatively different,\" he noted, citing reports that the militia is targeting specific populations. \"SAF has been accused of indiscriminately shelling RSF-held areas and putting civilians at risk. Both are crimes but they are different in nature, intent and scale and they have a different underlying logic.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) said earlier this year that the RSF could be guilty of ethnic cleansing in its campaigns against non-Arab ethnic groups in parts of Darfur, just as the janjaweed militias \u2014 from which the RSF formed \u2014 did two decades ago. Hemedti\u2019s forces and their allies have also raped young girls and women and kept them as sex slaves, according to first-hand testimony published by HRW this month.\n\nMeanwhile, the SAF has put civilians' lives at risk by carrying out indiscriminate bombing attacks on RSF-held territory. Earlier this month, an SAF airstrike hit a busy market in Kabkabiya, North Darfur, killing dozens of non-combatants in an attack that Amnesty International called a \"flagrant war crime\".\n\nNo end in sight\n\nAn end to the fighting seems a distant prospect, analysts have warned,** especially after the arms race between the SAF and the RSF this summer.\n\n\"There is more sophisticated weaponry all round. The net result is that civilians are more at risk of being killed,\" said Khair of Confluence Advisory.\n\n\u201cSudan is awash with small arms. A friend of mine, who recently went into the north of the country to do some research, told me that an AK-47 costs less than a week's groceries,\u201d Khair added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe political analyst thinks Sudan\u2019s civil war should be viewed as \u201ca war on civilians\u201d, in which both the SAF and the RSF are guilty of harming the Sudanese population and of failing to properly open aid corridors.\n\n\"There is no straightforward good guy, bad guy binary that media attention and public attention usually craves to understand these types of situations.\" Michael Jones\n\nJones of RUSI said the prospect of peace is slim in the short term, especially because of the internationalised nature of the war.\n\n\u201cThe involvement of external stakeholders and the quantity of foreign munitions, vehicles and fuel \u2014 supplies that are being poured into the conflict \u2014 do seem to be ramping up. And that's a worry because that's ultimately the dynamic that enables and sustains fighting,\u201d he said.\n\nCredible reports cited by the UN suggest that the UAE is the RSF\u2019s chief international backer, although Abu Dhabi denies involvement. However, it benefits from both warring parties when it comes to Sudan\u2019s lucrative gold industry, which is a key economic driver of the conflict, said Khair.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There is more sophisticated weaponry all round. The net result is that civilians are more at risk of being killed.\" Kholood Khair\n\nOn the other side, Western officials have confirmed that Iran has provided the SAF with Mohajer-6 combat drones. Such technology has helped al-Burhan to win territory, even if it has not, as of yet, dramatically changed the nationwide outlook on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cOver the course of 2024, we saw a few shifts. You saw sporadic counter-offensives launched by the SAF that tended to run out of steam quite quickly,\u201d Jones noted.\n\nThe RSF has, for months, been fiercely besieging El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, the SAF\u2019s only foothold in the state. Elsewhere, the militia still holds sway in Khartoum, but the SAF have taken back the Jebel Moya axis, south of the capital, which allows them to launch campaigns into Gezira state, Sudan's agricultural heartland.\n\nRSF soldiers are shown in East Nile province, Sudan, on 22 July, 2022.

In any case, the enmity between the two precludes serious ceasefire negotiations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe belligerents have one thing in common, which is that neither wants to see a democratic Sudan, Khair said. \u201cKeeping the war going allows them to hedge that they may be able to turn things in their favour and diminish what is left of the revolution, what the revolution calls for. That is, an end to a militarised Sudan as much as possible.\u201d\n\nJones agrees that it is neither in the SAF nor the RSF\u2019s interest to stop fighting. \u201cThe domestic warring parties don't have the incentive or need to come to the negotiating table in any real way,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't really think there's an immediately obvious pathway to peace.\u201d\n\nWith no sign of the war abating, the country is poised to become ever more fragmented.\n\nSudan could split not only into SAF and RSF areas, but also along other lines, if local warlords and militias who currently support the main sides decide to carve out territory for themselves. \u201cWe will likely see the fragmentation, Balkanisation of Sudan,\u201d said Khair.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith past Sudanese conflicts as her benchmark, Khair believes the war could last another 20 years. Unless political will changes, she said, and stricter weapons embargos and sanctions on the gold trade are introduced and enforced.\n\nWorsening humanitarian crisis\n\nAs things stand, the scale of the humanitarian crisis is already staggering. In the first 20 months of the war, more than 9 million Sudanese have been internally displaced, while 3 million others have fled into neighbouring countries such as Chad.\n\nSudan is, in fact, experiencing the world\u2019s largest ever recorded humanitarian crisis, with 30.4m people in need of assistance, according to the UN\u2019s Global Humanitarian Overview 2025. To put the numbers into perspective globally, Sudan is home to less than 1% of the world\u2019s population, but has 10% of the world\u2019s people in need.\n\nPeople board a truck as they leave Khartoum, Sudan, on 19 June, 2023. AP/Copyright 2023 The AP. All rights reserved.\n\nHunger and disease stalk the country. More than 24 million Sudanese are deemed to be acutely food insecure, and famine, which was declared in August in Zamzam camp, Darfur, risks becoming widespread, according to the UN.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe country is in the midst of a large cholera outbreak, something made all the more difficult because more than 70% of Sudan\u2019s hospitals and medical facilities have been shuttered by the war.\n\nDespite such problems, Sudan is struggling to get sufficient humanitarian funding from the international community. This year, UNHCR, the United Nation's refugee agency, sought to raise $1.031 billion (\u20ac1bn) for Sudan. But as of the end of October, it had only received [40% of this amount](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/situations/sudan-situation. US Sec).\n\nHowever, on 19 September, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration was donating a further $200m (\u20ac192.4m) for food, shelter and health care in Sudan.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, Sudan not only holds the title of the world's worst displacement crisis, but it's also the world's worst hunger crisis,\u201d said Anne-Marie Schryer-Roy, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s (IRC) regional advocacy coordinator for East Africa. \u201cThere are people who are starving to death each day.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReflecting on a recent trip to SAF-held territory in Sudan, Schryer-Roy described seeing signs of displacement wherever she went.\n\nPeople sleep by the roadside and outside mosques, while others live in camps for internally displaced people (IDPs). Winter has started, and the displaced lack the necessary warm clothes and blankets, Schryer-Roy said.\n\n\u201cI met this woman, Huda, who's been displaced twice by the conflict and has had to move with just the clothes on her back and her three children,\u201d the IRC representative said. Huda told Schryer-Roy of her despair, but also of her hopes for peace.\n\n\u201cThat's the biggest thing people are asking for now: an end to the fighting so that they can resume their lives and their livelihoods,\" Schryer-Roy said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAid groups are urging both the SAF and the RSF to allow unfettered aid access, so the most vulnerable people can be helped. Although there have been small improvements in recent months, the situation remains challenging.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, Sudan not only holds the title of the world's worst displacement crisis, but it's also the world's worst hunger crisis.\" Anne-Marie Schryer-Roy\n\nWhile international organisations struggle with access, local networks such as the Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs), which was nominated for this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, are working to feed millions of people through community kitchens and evacuate thousands from areas hit hard by the fighting.\n\nTargeted by both sides, some ERR volunteers have been arrested and killed. As of early February, the ERR said more than 20 of its volunteers had been assassinated, while dozens more had been detained.\n\nCounting the dead\n\nThere is no way of knowing for certain how many Sudanese have been killed so far by the civil war, either as a result of direct violence or a lack of medical treatment. Official estimates have put the deaths in the tens of thousands, but US Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello has said it could be as high as 150,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA new study from the Sudan Research Group, a collaboration between humanitarians and public health academics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), estimated that 61,000 people had died in Khartoum province alone in the first 14 months of the war.\n\nThis is a 50% increase from pre-war rates. Of this total, 26,000 were killed by direct violence, the study found.\n\nThe researchers used a technique called \"capture-recapture analysis\" to reach their estimate. This method compares data across multiple sources. In this case, researchers used three lists drawn up from social media, and private and public surveys.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard work because one of the features of the war \u2014 and of many wars \u2014 is that the impact is meant to be silent,\" said Maysoon Dahab, the study's lead author.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"You see the trend in Sudan before most big attacks: the internet and the electricity will be cut off. There's a real effort to try to make it difficult to communicate what is happening.\u201d\n\nOn-the-ground visits were too dangerous, so everything had to be done remotely, both inside and outside Sudan.\n\nDahab, an epidemiologist at the LSHTM, said the results from Khartoum province showed just how devastating the war has been on civilians. And this is without estimates from worse affected regions, including Darfur and Kordofan.\n\n\u201cWe think that Khartoum \u2014 bad as it is \u2014 is probably much better than other places,\u201d Dahab said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'Every Sudanese life is important'\n\nAljaili Ahmed, one of Dahab\u2019s colleagues on the LSTHM survey, said their work shows the world just how bad the situation in Sudan is.\n\n\u201cWhat we have tried to do is really to document what is happening. And then people have no way of saying, 'We didn't know it was that bad'. You knew. We've given you the information.\u201d\n\nSpeaking as a Sudanese citizen, Ahmed, who now lives abroad, also reflected on his people's hopes for civilian rule after the 2019 ousting of al-Bashir.\n\n\u201cWe had lots of hope after the revolution. We thought things would change for the better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to rebuild a Sudan that is fair, peaceful and diverse. And then suddenly, because both parties [the RSF and the SAF] wanted to grab power, the war started.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There's a real effort to try to make it difficult to communicate what is happening.\u201d Maysoon Dahab\n\nAlthough he does not see peace coming soon, Ahmed said civilians have to be involved in negotiations further down the line. \u201cIt shouldn't be armies negotiating with each other. Because the language they use and the solutions they have are just going to repeat this current situation over and over again.\u201c\n\nOmamah Abbas, who worked on the LSHTM study from Khartoum before fleeing Sudan earlier this year, saw death and destruction firsthand.\n\n\u201cFrom my room in Khartoum, I watched burials almost every day through my window. These were for people killed by shells or stray bullets,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhile hearing gunfire and shooting, I stayed on my laptop writing down the names of the dead. I also wondered if I would be on that list one day. Every time I recorded a death, I thought, 'How will I die? Will it be from a shell, a stray bullet or something else?\u2019\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was difficult for Abbas to get enough signal. She had to go up to her building\u2019s roof and wait for as long as it took to send in her results. Given the war raging outside, this entailed risk, but Abbas was spurred on by all the people who had died \u2014 by all those who, as she put it, once \u201chad dreams, hopes and plans for the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cEvery Sudanese life is important. We wanted to show the world the effect of this terrible war for us. We want to remember every life lost.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The AI computing market may shift in 2025, opening opportunities for smaller companies.\n\nNvidia dominates AI computing. Evolving workloads could benefit competitors.\n\nCompanies like Groq, Positron, and SambaNova focus on inference to challenge Nvidia's market hold.\n\nIn 2025, the tides may turn for companies hoping to compete with the $3 trillion gorilla in AI computing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 90% of the market share for AI computing. Still, as the use of AI grows, workloads are expected to change, and this evolution may give companies with competitive hardware an opening.\n\nIn 2024, the majority of AI compute spend shifted to inference, Thomas Sohmers, CEO of chip startup Positron AI, told BI. This will \"continue to grow on what looks like an exponential curve,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn AI, inference is the computation needed to produce the response to a user's query or request. The computing required to teach the model the knowledge needed to answer is called \"training.\" Creating OpenAI's image generation platform Sora, for example, represents training. Each user who instructs it to create an image represents an inference workload.\n\nOpenAI's other models have Sohmers and others excited about the growth in computing needs in 2025.\n\nOpenAI's o1 and o3, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and a handful of other AI models use more compute-intensive strategies to improve results after training. These strategies are often called inference-time computing, chain-of-thought, chain-of-reasoning, or reasoning models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, if the models think more before they answer, the responses are better. That thinking comes at a cost of time and money.\n\nThe startups vying for some of Nvidia's market share are attempting to optimize one or both.\n\nNvidia already benefits from these innovations, CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's November earnings call. Huang's wannabe competitors are betting that in 2025, new post-training strategies for AI will benefit all purveyors of inference chips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to three challengers about their hopes and expectations for 2025. Here are their New Year's resolutions.\n\nWhat's one thing within your control that could make 2025 a big year for alternative chips?\n\nMark Heaps is the chief technology evangelist for Nvidia challenger Groq. Groq\n\nMark Heaps, chief technology evangelist, Groq:\n\n\"Execution, execution, execution. Right now, everybody at Groq has decided not to take a holiday break this year. Everyone is executing and building the systems. We are all making sure that we deliver to the opportunity that we've got because that is in our control.\n\nI tell everyone our funnel right now is carbonated and bubbling over. It's unbelievable, the amount of customer interest. We have to build more systems, and we have to stand up those systems so we can serve the demand that we've got. We want to serve all those customers. We want to increase rate limits for everybody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO, SambaNova Systems:\n\n\"For SambaNova, the most critical factor is executing on the shift from training to inference. The industry is moving rapidly toward real-time applications, and inference workloads are becoming the lion's share of AI demand. Our focus is on ensuring our technology enables enterprises to scale efficiently and sustainably.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThomas Sohmers, CEO, Positron:\n\n\"My belief is if we can actually deploy enough compute \u2014 which thankfully I think we can from a supply chain perspective \u2014 by deploying significantly more inference-specific compute, we're going to be able to grow the adoption rate of 'chain of thoughts' and other inference-additional compute.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's one thing you're hoping for that's not in your control for 2025?\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO and cofounder of SambaNova Systems. SambaNova Systems\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"It's about customers recognizing that there are novel advancements against incumbent technologies. There's a lot of folks that have told us, 'We like what you have, but to use the old adage and rephrase it: No one ever got fired for buying from \u2014 insert incumbent.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we know that it's starting to boil up. People are realizing it's hard for them to get chips from the incumbent, and it's also not as performant as Groq is. So my wish would be that people are willing to take that chance and actually look to some of these new technologies.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"If I had a magic wand, I'd address the power challenges around deploying AI. Today, most of the market is stuck using power-hungry hardware that wasn't designed for inference at scale. The result is an unsustainable approach \u2014 economically and environmentally.\n\nAt SambaNova, we've proven there's a better way. Our architecture consumes 10 times less power, making it possible for enterprises to deploy AI systems that meet their goals without blowing past their power budgets or carbon targets. I'd like to see the market move faster toward adopting technologies that prioritize efficiency and sustainability \u2014 because that's how we ensure AI can scale globally without overwhelming the infrastructure that supports it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\n\"I would like people to actually adopt these chain of thought capabilities at the fastest rate possible. I think that is a huge shift \u2014 from a capabilities perspective. You have 8 billion parameter models surpassing 70 billion parameter models. So I'm trying to do everything I can to make that happen.\"\n\nWhat's your New Year's resolution?\n\nPositron AI executives. From left to right: Edward Kmett, Thomas Sohmers, Adam Huson, and Greg Davis. Positron AI\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"In the last six months, I've gone to a number of hackathons, and I've met developers. It's deeply inspiring. So my New Year's resolution is to try to amplify the signal of the good that people are doing with AI.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"Making time for music. Playing guitar is something I've always loved, and I would love to get back into it. Music has this incredible way of clearing the mind and sparking creativity, which I find invaluable as we work to bring SambaNova's AI to new corners of the globe.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\nI want to do as much to encourage the usage of these new tools to help, you know, my mom. Part of the reason I got into technology was because I wanted to see these tools lift up people to be able to do more with their time \u2014 to learn everything that they want beyond whatever job they're in. I think that bringing the cost down of these things will enable that proliferation.\n\nI also personally want to see and try to use more of these things outside of my just work context because I've been obsessively using the o1 Pro model for the past few weeks, and it's been amazing for my personal work. But when I gave access to my mom what she would do with it was pretty interesting \u2014 those sort of normal, everyday person tasks for these things where it truly is being an assistant.\""

            "article_content": "As India lost its soft-spoken former prime minister, here\u2019s a look at how Manmohan Singh transformed the face of the Indian economy in 1991 read more\n\nIndia\u2019s first Sikh Prime Minister and the architect of the Indian economy Dr Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday at age 92. A statement from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hospital said that Singh died due to an \u201cage-related medical condition\u201d. The soft-spoken former prime minister was born in undivided Punjab and was touted as the man who saved the Indian economy.\n\nWhen India was on the verge of bankruptcy, Singh, who was then the Finance Minister, introduced policy changes that changed the country\u2019s economic trajectory. As India now stands tall as the fifth-largest economy in the world, Singh\u2019s revolutionary policies acted as a foundation for its growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an impassioned speech, while presenting the Budget of 1991, Singh quoted Victor Hugo saying: \u201cI do not minimise the difficulties that lie ahead on the long and arduous journey on which we have embarked. But as Victor Hugo once said, \u2018No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.\u2019 I suggest to this august House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea\".\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Singh saved the Indian economy from collapsing.\n\nPrelude to the whole saga\n\nSingh was sworn in as the Finance Minister in former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao\u2019s cabinet in June 1991. During this time, the Indian economy was operating in accordance with the Nehruvian-socialist agenda. However, the economy was struggling with external debt pegged at 23 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and Internal public debt amounting to 55 per cent of the GDP.\n\nNot only this, the Indian employment rates went down to a negative and the fiscal deficit stood at eight per cent of the GDP. The effects of the poor state of the economy were felt everywhere with inflation rising by a good 13 per cent and retail inflation going even higher up the bend by a whopping 17 per cent.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of it all was the fact that India\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserves stood as low as Rs 2500 crores, which was 75 per cent lower than what it was in 1990. Overall, the Indian economy was facing a major crisis and the leaders were in desperate need to bring out new reforms.\n\nSingh: The best man for the endeavour\n\nWhen Singh took the helm, he was facing the major task of changing the face of the struggling Indian economy. Many believe that he was the best person for the job. Singh had a strong background in Business, Economics and Globalisation, having obtained a degree in economics from Oxford University.\n\nHe worked in the United Nations for three consecutive years and had another stint as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The former premier also held the post of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982-1985. He served as Chief Economic Advisor (1972-1976) and Planning Commission Head (1985-1987). Hence it was safe to say that Singh knew the ins and outs of the Indian economy more than anyone who was in charge at that time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6 ways Manmohan Singh saved the Indian economy\n\nSingh was tasked to present the first budget of the Rao government, in less than a month after he took charge of the finance ministry. After evaluating the situation at hand Singh realised that the Indian economy needed a shift towards economic liberalisation and a strategic end to the \u2018license raj\u2019. Here are 6 ways Singh changed the trajectory of the Indian economy:\n\n1. Devaluation Programme\n\nSingh started his endeavour with a two-step devaluation programme with the RBI devaluing the Indian currency against major currencies by nine per cent initially and then brought down to eleven per cent two days later. This gave the Indian economy a much-needed boost to trade and deal with the International markets.\n\n2. Welcoming Foreign Investments\n\nSingh brought India out of the Nehurivan socialist ideology and opened doors to welcome foreign investment into the Indian Capital. With the introduction of \u201cLiberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation (LPG)\u201d, Singh\u2019s policies gave a boost to industrialisation in the country. With these reforms, the Indian entrepreneurs were given direct access to the required capital, technology and target markets around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Mortaging India\u2019s gold holdings\n\nThe next thing the former prime minister did was to convince the RBI board to mortgage India\u2019s gold holdings with the Bank of England in four tranches. This way, India managed to get the necessary financial assistance it needed to sail. Singh got the idea from the State Bank of India which sold 20 tonnes of gold to the Union Bank of Switzerland, for which they had received about $200 million.\n\n4. Restructuring India\u2019s trade policy\n\nSingh had to restructure the Indian trade policy since it was on the verge of being banned from essential imports such as oil and gas. Under the LPG, Singh\u2019s reforms called for doing away with unnecessary controls, streamlining the licensing process and linking non-essential imports to exports to discourage such imports. Singh took the hard decision to abolish the popular \u2019export subsidies\u2019 along with the further expansion of the \u201cLicense Raj\u201d opening the country\u2019s economy to a great extent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Taking help from the IMF\n\nGiven the crisis at hand, Singh called for economic relief from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He applied for an emergency loan of $220 million, which was later seen as the main tool which prevented India from recording a debt default. While India had to follow some of the conditions presented by the international financial body, Singh\u2019s reforms acted as a cushion between India\u2019s socialist background and the IMF\u2019s capitalist and liberalising approach.\n\n6. Market Regulators\n\nSingh also called for the transfer of full statutory powers to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to enable it to regulate the workings of the Stock Exchanges in the country. Hence, SEBI soon became India\u2019s sole market regulator. Singh went on to propose a tax concession under section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act to export of software. As a result of this concession, the Indian Software companies became more cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Singh has garnered several criticisms from his opposition, over the years, one thing that cannot be denied is the fact that he managed to save the Indian economy from shamble in 1991."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "The expert said the prospect of an AI more intelligent than humans is a 'very scary thought'\n\nBritish-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said we need to be \"very careful\" and \"very thoughtful\" about the development of artificial intelligence (AI) which he says is a \"potentially very dangerous technology\". Professor Hinton, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics this year, said the pace of change in the area of AI is \"much faster\" than he expected and there has not been enough time to complete the research he believes is required. While his work has laid the foundations for machine learning, technology that allows computers to mimic human intelligence, his recent efforts have centred on advocating for safer AI. Last year he made headlines after resigning from his job at Google, citing concerns \"bad actors\" would use the technology to harm others. Google said at the time: \u201cAs one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence captures Sun's varying atmospheric conditions\n\nReflecting on where he thought the development of AI would have reached when he first started this work, Prof Hinton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I didn't think it would be where we would be now. I thought at some point in the future we would get here. \"Because the situation we're in now is that most of the experts in the field think that sometime, within probably the next 20 years, we're going to develop AIs that are smarter than people. \"And that's a very scary thought.\" He added: \"I like to think of it as, imagine yourself and a three-year-old - we'll be the three-year-olds, and they'll be the grown-ups.\" Prof Hinton said he thinks the impact AI could have on the world will be similar to the industrial revolution. \"In the industrial revolution, human strength ceased to be that relevant because machines were just stronger, and if you wanted to dig a ditch, you dug it with a machine. \"What we've got now is something that's replacing human intelligence, and just ordinary human intelligence will not be at the cutting edge anymore. It will be machines,\" he said.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
