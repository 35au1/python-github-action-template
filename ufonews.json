            "article_content": "Dallas County, April 1897\n\n\n\nNewspapers of the day reported the sightings straight-faced, although one can read more than a little tongue-in-cheek writing into some of the dispatches from community correspondents.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of the airships varied somewhat, but there was a general consensus that they had cigar-shaped bodies or cabins 50 to 60 feet long with propellers at each end, large bat-like wings, and huge floodlights fore and aft. Most witnesses saw neither pilot nor crew, but in some cases, not only did observers see people manning the ships, but talked to them. The Dallas Morning News' correspondent at Waxahachie reported a long conversation between Judge Love of the community and an airship crew, which claimed to be from the North Pole.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Field, 1952\n\n\n\nThere was considerable air traffic in the vicinity (normal Love Field activity) and there was enough light that aircraft were identifiable as the general type when viewed in the southwest, the sun to the rear. I first noticed an orange colored light which appeared to be nothing more than the exhaust or running light of an aircraft. Then, I noticed the light gave off an exhaust trail similar to that of an afterburner. I watched the light in its descending path for about four seconds when it seemed to fire a number of \"rockets\" and vanished.\n\n\n\nUniversity Park, 1961\n\n\n\nAt exactly 4:07 AM CST early Thursday morning, March 9th, I was out in my back yard doing a bit of amateur satelloon watching [a balloon satellite] ....hoping to see the polka-dot 12 footer, and I SAW A BIG, extremely fast, unidentified object streaking from about ENE to SW across the sky. It moved so fast was hard to focus on it, but I DO remember quite a bit of the impression it left on me. This object, seemingly, moved so darn fast that I would never have given it much later thought, except that the 7:00 AM news that morning carried big story that the Russians had orbited a dog, etc. in a 5-ton rocket.\n\nDenton, 2007\n\n\n\nI think I saw a UFO. I am not really sure. I feel like I am kind of crazy for thinking this. I was driving on 35W in Denton, TX around 10:15 a.m. 11/21/07 this morning and when I came over a hill I saw three white things in the sky. It was like 1 mile in front of me, slightly to the right. I wasn't sure if it was the balls that are on powerline to warn airplanes and then I thought it was a reflection the stadium. the balls were white with some silver tint. They were almost a perfect circle, but a little oblong.\n\n\n\nThey were perfectly aligned in a row a little to the left of me looking straight ahead. I was thinking I should take a picture because I thought oh it might be a UFO. I was trying to figure out what it was and the one on the right disapeared and one second later the middle one dissapeared and a little less then one second later the left one dissapeared. It didn't fade out or dart away. It just dissapeared in a split second.\n\n\n\nI am super freaked out right now and I don't know if It was something from Carswell air base or Lockead Martin, but I have NEVER seen anything like this before. It was soooo clear too. Not fuzy at all! PLease let me know if anyone else has seen this one in Denton! I have been very skeptical of UFO sightings, but I am so freaked out and paranoid now!\n\n\n\nIrving, 2021\n\n\n\nThe shiny spinning disc was seen hovering over a golf course before it appeared to have landed on the ground in Irving on April 25.\n\n\n\nFootage was recorded by a man who was visiting the area with his friends. They then saw the strange object reflecting the sunlight from a distance.\n\n\n\nA man was heard saying in the background: \u2018You see that? That\u2019s not a weather balloon, dude, it\u2019s flat.\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s moving really weird, it\u2019s like spinning and it\u2019s got another disc inside of it that\u2019s spinning.\u2019\n\n\n\nHe described the object as a \u2018large metallic ring that floated around a separate metallic sphere within the ring, like a flying armillary sphere.\u2019\n\nPilots flying near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport recently reported some suspicious lights floating around that air traffic controllers couldn't spot with their technology. It provoked quite the conversation.Seems UFO sightings is a topic that may never go out of style, especially in North Texas. In fact, a recent study names Texas as one of the top hotspots for UFO sightings in the U.S. Some of the more talked-about UFO sightings in the nation\u2019s history have occurred in other parts of Texas like Levelland, Lubbock and Dayton, for example.It got us to thinking about North Texas\u2019 history with UFO sightings. In case you aren\u2019t aware, it\u2019s neithera rare nor recent phenomenon. This is by no means a comprehensive compendium of North Texas UFO sightings, but here are some of the accounts that stuck out the most to us.UFO sightings in North Texas were all the rage back when ol\u2019 Charles Culberson served as the state\u2019s 21st governor, just 30-plus years removed from the Civil War. According to the Texas Almanac , \u201cbetween April 13 and 17, 1897, there were 38 reported sightings of \u2018airships\u2019 in 23 counties in Texas, including in Denton and Dallas Counties.\"In 2015, the published an article looking at the Dallas UFO sightings mentioned in Project Blue Book, a federal program that subjected reports of UFO sightings to certain scientific analysis. This sighting noted in Project Blue Book caught our eye.Another local example logged in Project Blue Book was intriguing to us. One man who reported a UFO sighting was indeed looking to the sky for something unique, but not for what he says he found.Did you know there\u2019s a National UFO Reporting Center? The center has a website where folks can log their sightings. This account from Denton, reprinted as it appeared, caught our attention, as we could relate to feeling more than a little perplexed at what we think we may have just seen.Look, not all UFO sightings are created equal. Not all accounts are going to get the public all riled up. But here\u2019s one from Irving from only three years ago , and it includes the term \u201c armillary sphere ,\u201d for which we give props. It's a wonderfully on-point description of what we think an alien spacecraft may look like. Plus, there\u2019s a video of it, posted to a website called Newsflare."

Slay the Princess \u2013 The Pristine Cut\n\n5 Slay the Princess blends romance with horror Credit: Black Tabby Games\n\nSlay the Princess was first released last year, but The Pristine Cut adds more routes, expanded dialogue, and extra endings.\n\nEvery decision reflects back at you in this romantic horror game where you try to slay and save each other over and over.\n\nWith more choices than any other game I\u2019ve played, it raises the bar for the genre.\n\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out our Slay the Princess review.\n\n4. UFO 50\n\n5 UFO 50 has so many games you have to love at least one of them Credit: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 is a collection of more than 50 retro-inspired games that span the gamut of genres.\n\nIt has everything from puzzle games to deck builders, RPGs, 2D platformers, and metroidvanias.\n\nThere\u2019s also an overarching meta-narrative that connects all of the games together, and secrets within each game to discover.\n\nIt was even nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards if you need more proof.\n\n3. Tactical Breach Wizards\n\n5 Tactical Breach Wizards blends strategy and puzzle solving Credit: Suspicious Developments\n\nIf you like XCOM but wish it had more puzzle-solving, then Tactical Breach Wizards is for you.\n\nIt has the squad-based tactics gameplay of XCOM but changes it so you are solving puzzles in the heat of the moment and on the fly.\n\nEach teammate's abilities are unique and yet they can synergise in some way with every other character in the game.\n\nIt\u2019s all topped off by hilarious writing, to make a funny and satisfying experience.\n\n2. Balatro\n\n5 Balatro mixes Poker hands with a high score multiplyer deck building Credit: Apple / Balatro\n\nIt\u2019s rare that an indie game gets nominated for Game of the Year, let alone one developed by just one person.\n\nBalatro is a Poker-inspired deck builder, where you use different Jokers to multiply the score of each hand you play.\n\nWith various difficulties, decks, Jokers, and other cards to collect, you\u2019ll keep picking Balatro up for just one more run.\n\nIf you want to read more about it, check out our Balatro review.\n\n1. Indika\n\n5 Indika is the most unique game we played this year Credit: Odd Meter\n\nThere are very few games that ask you to play as a Russian nun during the 19th century, in fact, Indika is the only one we\u2019ve played.\n\nIt makes for a beautifully surreal story of self-discovery and genre-blending where third-person action gives way to pixel-art 2D platforming.\n\nIndika has a unique perspective in direction, cinematography, and storytelling, making it nothing else we\u2019ve played quite like it.\n\nIt was everything unique and special about Indika that has left it as our favourite indie game of 2024."

            "article_content": "I\u2019ve spent the past year covering every major phone launch in the US, and each one loudly declared the same thing: AI is here, and ours is the AI phone you\u2019ve been waiting for. Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least.\n\nThe theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn\u2019t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you\u2019ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You\u2019ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you\u2019re free, and add it to your calendar. You\u2019ll ask it about something a friend said to you \u2014 maybe in an email or a text, you\u2019re not sure which \u2014 and it will go find the information for you.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini assistant has steadily improved since launch but still falls short of a true AI assistant.\n\nPersonally, all of the above sounds great to me. I\u2019d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone \u2014 and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos.\n\nThe (supposedly) AI smartphones of 2024\n\nAll of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn\u2019t call them AI smartphones.\n\nSupposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos \u2014 but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as \u201cI am eating my chair.\u201d (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off.\n\nSometimes AI gets it right \u2014 it correctly identifies an artificial plant here.\n\nLater in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company\u2019s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There\u2019s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools \u2014 from silly to seriously worrying.\n\nSome of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don\u2019t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly \u2014 and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you.\n\nApple Intelligence started shipping a month after the iPhone 16, but its blockbuster features won\u2019t arrive until 2025.\n\nLast but not least, we met the iPhones \u201cbuilt for Apple Intelligence\u201d in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple\u2019s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming.\n\nRight now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they\u2019re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There\u2019s more to come, but what\u2019s here now certainly doesn\u2019t add up to an AI smartphone.\n\nA messy year for AI\n\nIt\u2019s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that\u2019s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It\u2019s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it\u2019s so goddamn loud!\n\nAnd there really might be a signal in there \u2014 especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions \u2014 like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising \u2014 so they\u2019re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too.\n\nThe trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it\u2019s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon \u2014 before our collective patience starts to run out."

This lightweight, wearable device aids paraplegics by locking onto the user's body, helping them navigate stairs and obstacles, marking a leap forward in assistive technology.\n\nIn the realm of space exploration, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) has attracted 30 companies for a pioneering initiative to establish home-grown satellite constellations. This effort aims to bolster India's defense and infrastructure capabilities by reducing dependency on foreign data.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

The two companies have been headed in diverging directions, however, and Reuters reported today that Microsoft is looking to add more models to its 365 Copilot product that aren\u2019t built by OpenAI.\n\nThe reasoning, according to the report, is that Microsoft sees OpenAI\u2019s cutting-edge GPT-4 model as too expensive and not fast enough to satisfy its enterprise customers. Copilot 365 is an AI-powered assistant built into Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity applications including Word and PowerPoint. The tool is supposed to ingest all of a company\u2019s data and do a myriad of things, like give users the ability to quickly find information without needing to hunt through disparate apps; quickly generate a list of the company\u2019s most profitable business units; or instantaneously summarize meetings and emails.\n\nIt is supposed to do those things, but customers and insiders alike are still underwhelmed by Copilot 365, which costs an extra $30 per month per user on a team. In a recent Business Insider story, employees of Microsoft speaking anonymously called the tools \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cgimmicky,\u201d not working well 75% of the time. On the customer front, Business Insider cited a survey of 123 IT leaders published by management consultancy Gartner, which found only four said Copilot provided significant value to their companies. It should be noted some other stories have reported on companies that have found value in using large language models, such as by simplifying customer support.\n\nSome customers who spoke to Business Insider specifically noted that 365 Copilot is too expensive.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is a frontier, general model, meaning it is trained on vast swaths of data and can be more expensive and slow to run; that is why most models are offered in \u201clite\u201d versions that perform less intensive inference or \u201cthinking.\u201d Microsoft has been training its own in-house, smaller models like one called Phi-4, and Reuters reports that sources speaking to the outlet said the company is looking to \u201ccustomize other open-weight models to make 365 Copilot faster and more efficient.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, it makes sense that Microsoft would want to reduce its reliance on OpenAI. If the company is right and AI is going to be the next generational change in computing, relying on an independent company for the core technology is not a great idea.\n\nMicrosoft has plowed billions of dollars into OpenAI and will receive 75% of its profits until it makes it breaks even on its investment, and even then will still hold a large stake in the startup. The company in effect gets to hedge its bets\u2014build its own in-house models while keeping a lottery ticket in OpenAI in case it continues on its current skyward trajectory.\n\nDespite being the front-runner today, some skeptics of OpenAI say that we may not know a true winner in the AI race yet (should these technologies be as revolutionary as we are told to believe). In the same way that there were numerous search engines that came online in the \u201990s, only to be quickly trounced when the latecomer Google showed up. Microsoft is likely wise to hedge."

In its new whitepaper, 101 Technology Trends That Will\u2014and Won't\u2014Shape 2025, analysts from global technology intelligence firm ABI Research. ABI Research analysts identify 54 trends that will shape the technology market and 47 others that, although attracting vast amounts of speculation and commentary, are less likely to move the needle over the next twelve months. In the Digital Payment Technologies space, 2025 will see increased QR code payment acceptance but little growth for payment card IC ASPs.\n\n2024 Logo (PRNewsfoto/ABI Research)\n\n\"2024 has been marked by challenges, from global conflicts and inflationary pressures to political uncertainty. These factors have strained enterprise and consumer spending, leading to market inertia, short-term technology investments, sidelined capital, and the exposure of vulnerable suppliers,\" says Stuart Carlaw, Chief Research Officer at ABI Research. \"From a technology perspective, many industries and end markets are in that awkward stage of technology adoption where they are formulating implementation strategies, assessing solutions and partners, and trying to see if they have the resources needed to roll out solutions at scale. This is a particularly sensitive time, which tends to suggest 2025 will have tech implementers and end users on the brink of a period of a massive technology shift as they work through these issues.\"\n\nWhat Will Happen in 2025:\n\nQR code payment acceptance will continue to increase with use cases expanding\n\nAlthough QR code payment acceptance is prevalent in countries such as China and growing in emerging digital payment markets, including in India, use cases and potential growth areas are not limited to these countries. Significant and continued investments by vendors, including PayPal, Stripe, and SumUp, are setting the foundation for increased adoption in other mature and established economies with use cases expanding. Although QR codes are already being used by many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and pop-up retail businesses, 2025 will mark the year when the technology begins to shift from one niche to partial mainstream.\n\nWhat Won't Happen in 2025:\n\nPayment card IC ASPs will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, chipset pricing has been on a continual rise, driven by increased pricing in myriad manufacturing areas, including energy, raw material, transit pricing, and inflation, driving up wages. The chip shortage further compounded this, and according to ABI Research, the Average Selling Price (ASP) for a payment card Integrated Circuit (IC) increased by approximately +30% between 2020 and 2023. However, despite pricing pressures returning, the cost of payment ICs is some years away from matching pre-COVID-19 levels. Although 2025 will mark another year of pricing deprecation, it will not be until around 2028 when pricing is expected to drop to levels similar to those achieved in 2019 steadily.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Nestle Vietnam has set its sights to capitalise on rising demand for convenient beverage options in the country to drive the growth of its Nescafe a ready-to-serve liquid concentrate.\n\nAccording to the firm, Nescafe stepped up its format and product innovation to keep up with the latest trends and consumer demands.\n\n\u201cVietnam, in particular, is a country with a very rich coffee culture, and there have also been some novel popular trends emerging over the past few years,\u201d Nestle Vietnam Business Executive Officer Mostafa Youssef told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\n\u201cCold coffee tends to be more popular here, and interestingly there has also been a movement towards liquid coffees \u2013 which is why we have recently launched a new innovation in the form of a coffee concentrate in a stick.\n\n\u201cThe convenience factor is strong with these as all consumers need to do is open up the coffee stick, pour over ice \u2013 and that\u2019s all done, they can enjoy a very quick cup of coffee with no need to source hot water to dissolve powder or dilute the coffee unless they want to.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia has asked experts in India to weigh in with recommendations for India\u2019s spice sector bounce back from two high profile contamination scandals this year.\n\nCarcinogenic ethylene oxide is a pesticide that was found in spice powders from major Indian brands Everest and MDH, putting the country\u2019s spice industry under intense scrutiny.\n\nThis has led to bans in Hong Kong and the Maldives, product recalls in Singapore, and stricter checks on India\u2019s spices in Australia and the US.\n\nDespite the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) emphasising its stringent regulations, overseas bans and domestic concerns raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong ban on 5 April, FSSAI issued a statement on 8 April that raised the maximum residue limits (MRL) of pesticides by 10 times from 0.01mg/kg to 0.1mg/kg.\n\nAlthough FSSAI clarified that these only applies to pesticides not registered with the Indian authorities, and that the international Codex standards were adhered to, it sparked criticism and confusion.\n\n\u201cIt does seem counterintuitive for the FSSAI to increase the MRL for pesticides not registered with authorities, especially considering the potential health implications,\u201d Equinox Labs CEO Ashwin Bhadri said.\n\n\u201cThe implications of such a decision could be significant, as it may lead to increased pesticide residues in food products, potentially impacting consumer health in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt may also raise doubts about the effectiveness of regulatory measures in ensuring food safety and quality.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian government has revised food packaging regulations in response to consumer and academic concerns over the presence of dangerous chemicals entering the food supply chain.\n\nAs of 2023, Indonesia had no specific regulations in place regarding certain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), more commonly known as the \u2018Forever Chemicals\u2019 due to their slow degradation rate.\n\nA great deal of scientific evidence already linked PFAS exposure to an array of health issues from cancer, cardiovascular disease, infertility, elevated blood pressure and more.\n\n\u201cIndonesia currently has no regulations on PFAS in food packaging [but] the troubling findings from our study indicate that we need stronger regulations to protect our children and families from exposures to toxic PFAS chemicals especially in daily products,\u201d Nexus3 Senior Advisor Yuyun Ismawati said whilst announcing the study findings.\n\n\u201cPFAS can also be released when people wear clothing, during washing, and when used synthetic textile wastes are disposed \u2013 [this] can contaminate waterways, leading to PFAS exposures from contaminated drinking water or food.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia took a closer look at five of the top trends affecting the Asia Pacific food and beverage industry in 2024.\n\nThese included the \u2018premium affordability\u2019 trend surfaced by many food firms, as well as the evolution of plant-based protein to moving away from mimicry in innovation.\n\nOther significant trends included the rise of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages driven by convenience and relatability, the continuous rise of low-to-no alcohol, and major factors behind the growth of the snacking industry.\n\nThe European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced major pushback from ministers and trade organisations within Europe, as well as alongside continued pressure from palm oil producer nations in Asia this year.\n\nOn March 28 2024, an industry-wide cross-commodity letter was addressed to EC President of the Council for Environment and Minister for the Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and the Green Deal of Belgium Zakia Khattabi, calling for \u2018urgent clarifications and workable solutions\u2019 on EUDR implementation.\n\nThis was signed by a coalition of more than 20 European industry organisations spanning many areas of trade, including representatives on food trade in cereals, oils, rice, livestock, meat and more \u2013 all highlighting concerns over the supposed enforcement in December 2024.\n\n\u201cConsidering the significant adjustments that are needed from suppliers, operators and traders, we would like to express serious concerns regarding the pace of preparation of EUDR-related legislative acts, the mandatory systems and the guidance and clarifications required for implementation,\u201d the coalition said in the letter, which FoodNavigator-Asia has viewed.\n\n\u201cOperators and traders are working hard to prepare their supply chains and adapt their systems and due diligence processes for compliance with the EUDR [and] try to develop workable solutions compatible with the EUDR provisions.\n\n\u201cHowever, these efforts are impeded by large gaps in information, lack of appropriate technical solutions and by misconceptions as to the functioning of our complex chains.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government has planned to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over the next two years.\n\nSouth Korea committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThis year\u2019s developments saw the ministry calling for public comment on an initiative to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cFrom January 1 2026, all individual types of drinking water bottles such as mineral waters that are manufactured in Korea will be subject to this change.\n\n\u201cAs the label-free QR code display method is mandated for target audiences, we aim to start with a smooth trial operation and early conversion [in order to] reflect any industry difficulties regarding displaying any necessary sales information via the QR code, as well as to determine the scope for product promotion and advertising.\u201d\n\nGlobal food corporation Cargill has leveraged its cocoa-sourcing networks in Asia and other business units to support customers in overcoming the cocoa supply shortage, and ensure consumers continue to have access to chocolate products.\n\nAccording to the International Cocoa Organization, global cocoa supply is projected to decline by nearly 11% to 4.449m tonnes in the 2023-2024 season, compared with 2022-23.\n\nThis is primarily caused by \u201ccatastrophic harvests\u201d in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which are responsible for over 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa supply.\n\nIn the face of this crisis, Cargill has drawn on its extensive cocoa sourcing networks and innovation expertise to help customers address current challenges, and ensure consumers still get to enjoy chocolate products.\n\n\u201cCocoa supply is indeed a pressing issue for the industry. Cargill is a bean-to-bar solutions provider, which means that we have the capabilities to innovate along every step of the value chain, from sourcing of raw materials to product customisation and solutions provision. For example, we are able to provide Asian-sourced cocoa products as we source globally.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are actively reaching out to our customers to see if they need support in managing this situation, such as sourcing, alternative recipes and product trials. We are able to tailor-make cocoa powder for a certain flavour and colour, and combine different ingredients to create new solutions or replacements,\u201d Xiaoling Liu, Indulgence Leader, Food Solutions Asia Pacific at Cargill, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nThe EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced pressure from within its own Parliament to postpone implementation as an \u2018urgent\u2019 matter this year, with concerns over key trade commodities such as palm oil and cocoa.\n\nThe EUDR received much criticism particularly from palm oil industry experts and countries producing key commodities likely to be affected such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee, and came under fire from within the EU parliament as well.\n\nThis dissent was led by European Peoples\u2019 Party (EPP) environmental spokesperson Peter Liese, who pushed for an \u2018urgent\u2019 postponement and \u2018far less bureaucratic\u2019 implementation of the EUDR.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the EUDR is correct, but its implementation is far too bureaucratic [and] the European Commission absolutely must postpone the entry into force of the deforestation regulation, then use the transitional period to reduce bureaucracy in the text,\u201d he said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe must do something about deforestation worldwide and take our responsibility seriously, [however] the regulation has been turned into a bureaucratic monster - Many small farmers around the world and even small forest owners in the European Union cannot work with the text.\n\n\u201cThe preparatory work that the Commission should have carried out has not been done [and many] countries are complaining massively about the legislation, including countries that are pursuing the same goal as we are, namely to stop deforestation.\n\nAs of time of writing, the EUDR implementation has been postponed to the end of 2025.\n\nResearchers in India have highlighted that the misuse of antibiotics in food animal production in Asia could pose a serious danger to public health in the region.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a significant global threat, causing substantial economic losses and an estimated annual loss of 700,000 lives.\n\nResearchers at the Veterinary and Animal Sciences University in Punjab noted the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance and its potential transmission to humans through the food chain.\n\nThey also shed light on the pervasive use of critically important antibiotics in food animal production across Asia as well as how limited surveillance and regulatory controls had amplified concerns over antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe study encompassed 11 WHO member countries \u2014 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.\n\nResults from the review of 108 selected publications revealed a staggering 1,126 scientific publications on antibiotic use in food animals, wherein the study identified a concerning trend of antibiotic misuse in livestock, poultry and aquaculture.\n\nChina\u2019s removal of tariffs on all dairy products from New Zealand has been posited to spell huge potential for brands with a strong focus on quality and sustainability.\n\nChina and New Zealand signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in 2008, but with regard to dairy it took 16 years to finally see all tariffs removed.\n\nAccording to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade data, New Zealand was the first developed country in the world to enter into an FTA with China.\n\nVarious New Zealand dairy products have seen export tariff decreases over the years, but although many of these hit zero in 2019, duties were still in place for liquid milk, butter and cheese until 2021; and for milk powder until Dec 31 2023.\n\nAs of Jan 1 this year, all tariffs were officially declared to have been removed by the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand via a formal statement, which was warmly welcomed by New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay.\n\n\u201cAll safeguard duties on milk powder [entering China] have been removed as of January 1 2024, which marks the final liberalisation of dairy access under the [China-New Zealand] FTA,\u201d McClay announced via a separate statement."

On November 21, the SEC announced that Chair Gary Gensler would be leaving the position on January 20, 2025, ending a nearly four-year tenure as its lead administrator. The SEC\u2019s press release acknowledged a legacy of enforcement actions, including for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct. Data from the Blockchain Association quantifies that legacy at 104 enforcement actions through 2023. In remarks to the Practising Law Institute\u2019s 56th Annual Institute on Securities Regulation, shortly before the announcement of his departure, Chair Gensler defended his enforcement record, stating, \u201cCourt after court has agreed with our actions to protect investors\u201d while simultaneously recognizing that \u201c[n]ot every [digital] asset is a security,\u201d citing bitcoin, Ether, and stablecoins as examples. Gensler\u2019s announcement came less than a month after SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal announced his own departure on October 2. Like Gensler, Grewal oversaw more than 100 enforcement actions addressing what the SEC called \u201cwidespread noncompliance in the quickly growing crypto space.\u201d\n\nOn November 21, the SEC announced that Chair Gary Gensler would be leaving the position on January 20, 2025, ending a nearly four-year tenure as its lead administrator. The SEC\u2019s press release acknowledged a legacy of enforcement actions, including for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct. Data from the Blockchain Association quantifies that legacy at 104 enforcement actions through 2023. In remarks to the Practising Law Institute\u2019s 56th Annual Institute on Securities Regulation, shortly before the announcement of his departure, Chair Gensler defended his enforcement record, stating, \u201cCourt after court has agreed with our actions to protect investors\u201d while simultaneously recognizing that \u201c[n]ot every [digital] asset is a security,\u201d citing bitcoin, Ether, and stablecoins as examples.

In her remarks at the Wharton FinTech Lecture Series, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce spoke of the delicate balance between regulation and innovation, particularly in the context of financial technology and crypto assets. She illustrated the complexities of excessive regulation using the analogy of a potholder she had recently purchased that came with a 20-page disclosure document, making the point that excessive regulation could stifle the innovation of even relatively innocuous products. Peirce then addressed the SEC\u2019s inconsistent approach to crypto regulation, which has often been characterized by legal uncertainty and a focus on enforcement rather than collaboration, which, in her view, has pushed much of the innovation overseas. Peirce advocated for a more open and predictable regulatory framework that would allow for experimentation and innovation, including the creation of a \u201cmicro-innovation sandbox\u201d to facilitate cross-border experimentation. Peirce also pointed out the potential benefits of asset tokenization and the need for clear guidance to foster its development.\n\nIn her remarks at the Wharton FinTech Lecture Series, SEC Commissioner Hester M.

SEC Commissioner Uyeda praises regulatory leadership of Indo-Pacific countries on crypto regulation. On October 24, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda delivered remarks at the 2024 AIMA APAC Annual Forum in Hong Kong, highlighting the significance of the Indo-Pacific region in global financial markets, the regulation of private funds in the US, and the importance of international regulatory engagement. Uyeda expressed concerns about government criticisms of alternative investments and the role of \u201cshadow banking\u201d in financial stability. He emphasized the importance of alternative investments in providing nontraditional funding to companies, which is crucial for innovation and economic growth. Uyeda also discussed the recent court ruling that vacated the SEC\u2019s prescriptive rule on private fund advisers, which he opposed, and the ongoing regulatory proposals that could impact private fund managers, such as the re-proposed custody rule and pending cybersecurity regulations. Uyeda claimed that the SEC\u2019s current regulatory approach to crypto is less advanced compared to that of the Indo-Pacific region. He highlighted the leadership of jurisdictions in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and Australia in facilitating crypto and fintech innovation while promoting investor protection. Uyeda pointed out the lack of sufficient guidance from the SEC on key issues, such as when a crypto offering needs to be regulated as a security. He emphasized the need for the SEC to engage more transparently with market participants. Uyeda also mentioned the challenges faced by private fund managers in the US regarding the custody and auditing of crypto assets and called for the US to learn from the regulatory approaches of other countries to better facilitate innovation, capital formation, and investor protection in the crypto space.\n\nCongress\n\nHouse Committee on Financial Services holds hearing on technological innovations in financial services. On December 4, the House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled, \u201cInnovation Revolution: How Technology is Shaping the Future of Finance.\u201d In a memorandum published before the hearing, committee staff previewed that a significant portion of the hearing focused on blockchain technology and digital assets, which the committee sees as potential building blocks for the next generation of internet technology. During the hearing, committee members recognized that blockchain enables the creation of decentralized networks that offer new ways to provide services, such as financial products and social networks, with greater user autonomy and privacy. The hearing further acknowledged that the market capitalization of digital assets is approximately $3 trillion, with stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) providing price stability. Speakers also discussed the potential of tokenization, which involves creating digital representations of real-world assets on the blockchain in order to increase liquidity, transparency, and access. The memorandum did, however, note that innovators will need to address challenges such as interoperability and systemic risks.\n\nOn December 4, the House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled, \u201cInnovation Revolution: How Technology is Shaping the Future of Finance.\u201d In a memorandum published before the hearing, committee staff previewed that a significant portion of the hearing focused on blockchain technology and digital assets, which the committee sees as potential building blocks for the next generation of internet technology.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency comments on crypto volatility in remarks before Committee on Financial Services. On November 20, Michael J. Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, provided an update on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety and soundness of national banks and federal savings associations. He discussed the state of the federal banking system, highlighting that the overall condition remains sound with strong levels of regulatory capital and sufficient liquidity buffers. Hsu emphasized the importance of safeguarding trust in the banking system and outlined four priorities: guarding against complacency, elevating fairness, adapting to digitalization, and managing climate-related financial risks. He noted that the OCC\u2019s focus on strong risk management has helped banks navigate challenges such as the crypto market downturn, rising interest rates, and commercial real estate concerns. The OCC has also been working on enhancing fairness in banking, modernizing the Community Reinvestment Act, reforming overdraft practices, and expanding financial inclusion through initiatives like Project REACh. Regarding cryptocurrency and digital assets specifically, Hsu highlighted the significant impact of the crypto market\u2019s volatility, noting that crypto lost over $2 trillion in value, leading to the failure of many players in the industry. He stressed the importance of strong risk management in preventing complacency and ensuring stability in the banking system amid such volatility. Hsu also discussed the challenges posed by the digitalization of banking, in which nonbank financial technology companies (fintechs) offer banking services, creating confusion and diffused accountability. He mentioned the bankruptcy of Synapse, a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) middleware firm that affected many consumers when they were not able to access their money. Hsu voiced support for the Department of the Treasury\u2019s push for federal payments regulation and a chartering regime for nonbanks to close regulatory gaps and promote responsible innovation and competition.\n\nTreasury\n\n2024 FSOC report identifies digital currencies as source of financial instability risk. In December, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) published its annual report providing a comprehensive assessment of risks to US financial stability. The FSOC comprises heads of the Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and OCC, among others. The report highlights vulnerabilities in various sectors including commercial real estate, residential real estate, corporate credit, and digital assets. The report outlines the Council\u2019s activities, recommendations for enhancing market integrity, and responses to emerging threats. The report places significant emphasis on the growing market of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. As of July 2024, the global market value of crypto assets was just under $2 trillion. The FSOC highlights the risks associated with stablecoins, particularly their vulnerability to runs and the lack of a comprehensive federal prudential framework. The FSOC recommends that Congress pass legislation to address these risks, including regulatory requirements for reserves, capital, and reporting. The report also discusses the launch of new crypto asset exchange traded products (ETPs) and their potential to increase interconnections between the traditional financial system and the crypto asset ecosystem. Additionally, the FSOC notes the importance of monitoring the use of tokenized products and the potential financial stability risks they pose. Overall, it continues to advocate for enhanced regulatory oversight and data collection to better understand and mitigate the risks associated with digital assets.\n\nIn December, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) published its annual report providing a comprehensive assessment of risks to US financial stability.

IRS memorandum advises reporting assets frozen in bankrupt digital asset platforms as income. On November 1, in response to a taxpayer\u2019s request for advice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a memorandum providing advice \u201cregarding the proper year of inclusion of frozen digital asset rewards in gross income.\u201d According to the memorandum, a taxpayer who receives rewards, such as staking rewards, from a digital asset trading platform that files for bankruptcy in the same year, must still report those awards in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income even though the taxpayer has no access to those rewards while they remain locked in bankruptcy proceedings. The IRS justified this position on the basis that the rewards are credited to the customer\u2019s account as soon as they are distributed. Thus, the IRS acknowledged that rewards that are not distributed to a taxpayer before the company files for bankruptcy, or credit to the taxpayer subject to a lockup period, do not need to be reported until the taxpayer takes \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the rewards.\n\nOn November 1, in response to a taxpayer\u2019s request for advice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a memorandum providing advice \u201cregarding the proper year of inclusion of frozen digital asset rewards in gross income.\u201d According to the memorandum, a taxpayer who receives rewards, such as staking rewards, from a digital asset trading platform that files for bankruptcy in the same year, must still report those awards in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income even though the taxpayer has no access to those rewards while they remain locked in bankruptcy proceedings.

Department of the Treasury and IRS announce 2024-2025 Priority Guidance Plan. On October 3, the Department of the Treasury and IRS published their 2024-2025 Priority Guidance Plan (Guidance Plan). The Guidance Plan outlines 231 guidance projects that are priorities for the allocation of resources from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. It suggests the development of specific guidance related to digital assets \u2013 including regulations under Sections 6045A and 6050I \u2013 regarding information reporting of transactions involving digital assets between \u201cbrokers.\u201d Additionally, the Guidance Plan further suggests developing guidance under Sections 1001 and 1012 involving token wrapping.\n\nFDIC\n\nFDIC reports 4.8 percent of US households use or hold digital currency. On November 12, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published the results of its 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households. According to the FDIC\u2019s press release, the nation\u2019s overall rate of households without a bank or credit union account hit a record low of 4.2 percent, representing 5.6 million households. The survey also included questions about the use of crypto or digital assets to store and transfer money. The survey found that in 2023, 4.8 percent of US households owned or used crypto or digital assets in the previous 12 months. 92.6 percent of these households held crypto or digital assets as an investment, while only 4.4 percent used digital assets as a form of payment.\n\nOn November 12, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published the results of its 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.

OCC meets with SIFMA to discuss FDIC proposal to restrict brokered deposits. On November 18, representatives from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) met with the FDIC and the OCC to discuss the FDIC\u2019s proposed rule on brokered deposits. According to the OCC\u2019s memorandum documenting the meeting, SIFMA representatives expressed concerns about the lack of supporting data for the proposed changes and recommended either withdrawing or significantly revising the proposal. They highlighted that the 2021 Final Rule had modernized restrictions on brokered deposits and created exceptions for broker-dealers providing sweep deposit services, which had resulted in a substantial reduction in reported brokered deposits. The new proposal, however, seeks to eliminate or narrow these exceptions without providing new data or studies to justify the changes, potentially reclassifying a significant portion of deposits and impacting institutions' capital and liquidity requirements. In response, the FDIC pointed to the failure of crypto company Voyager Digital to justify its plan to restrict insured depository institutions (IDIs) from accepting brokered deposits. Voyager was not considered a deposit broker due to its exclusive relationship with a single IDI, and the funds placed at Voyager were unsafely kept resulting in customer confusion about FDIC insurance coverage. Despite Voyager\u2019s failure, SIFMA representatives noted that Voyager\u2019s former IDI partner continues to operate without adverse impacts, indicating that the proposed changes may not address the actual risks associated with digital assets and related entities. The representatives argued that the proposal lacks a comprehensive cost and benefit analysis and does not sufficiently consider the implications for consumers and institutions involved with digital assets.\n\nOn November 18, representatives from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) met with the FDIC and the OCC to discuss the FDIC\u2019s proposed rule on brokered deposits.

Committee on Capital Markets Regulation weighs in on FDIC\u2019s proposed brokered deposits rule. On November 13, the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, an independent research organization formed from leaders in several disciplines related to capital markets, submitted comments regarding the FDIC\u2019s proposed rule on brokered deposits. The Committee argued that the proposal\u2019s expanded definition of brokered deposits would increase banks\u2019 capital and liquidity requirements and deposit insurance premiums for many types of deposit arrangements. The Committee expressed that the proposal is fundamentally flawed, stating that it fails to consider relevant evidence; reverses a prior agency action without a rational basis; and does not acknowledge the costs it would impose on the banking system, financial intermediaries, and their customers. As a result, the Committee recommended that the FDIC withdraw the proposal and maintain the existing regulations established in 2020. In particular, the Committee\u2019s comments mention the failure of Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which held the deposits of customers of the crypto company Voyager Digital, which failed in 2022. The FDIC\u2019s proposal acknowledges that Metropolitan Commercial Bank was put at risk because it held deposits of Voyager customers, indicating that such arrangements create legal, operational, and liquidity risks for the bank if the broker fails. However, the Committee argues that the bankruptcy of Voyager does not support the conclusion that these depository arrangements create these risks, as Metropolitan Commercial Bank did not experience distress as a result of Voyager\u2019s failure. Instead, the bank has apparently enjoyed increased profitability and improved capital ratios since Voyager\u2019s failure in 2021. The Committee\u2019s comments join similar arguments from industry representatives such as the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), Better Markets, and Charles Schwab.\n\nCFTC\n\nCFTC\u2019s Global Markets Advisory Committee advances recommendation on tokenized non-cash collateral. On November 21, the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) of the CFTC advanced a recommendation to expand the use of non-cash collateral through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT). The recommendation provides a legal and regulatory framework for how market participants can apply their existing policies, procedures, practices, and processes to support the use of DLT for non-cash collateral in a manner consistent with margin requirements for both cleared and non-cleared derivatives, subject to specified conditions and limitations designed to mitigate credit, market, and liquidity risks. The recommendation was approved without objection.\n\nOn November 21, the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) of the CFTC advanced a recommendation to expand the use of non-cash collateral through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT).

On October 31, the CFTC published an alert warning users of popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram to beware of scams to defraud users of crypto assets. According to the alert, fraudsters use these apps to lure users into cryptocurrency \u201cpump-and-dump schemes\u201d by advertising enormous returns with \u201czero risk\u201d by supposedly getting into a cryptocurrency investment early. The alert advises users to ignore the messages and change their settings to avoid being added to large group messages.\n\nOn October 31, the CFTC published an alert warning users of popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram to beware of scams to defraud users of crypto assets.

CFTC issues advisory related to clearing of options on spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. On November 15, the CFTC announced issuance of a staff advisory addressing the clearing of options on spot commodity-based exchange traded fund (ETF) products. The advisory notes that spot commodity ETF shares based on bitcoin have been listed and traded on national securities exchanges, and the SEC approved spot commodity ETF shares of Ethereum. CFTC staff states that \u201c[b]ecause \u2026 it is substantially likely that spot commodity ETF shares would be held to be securities, we believe that these shares listed on SEC registered national securities exchanges do not implicate the [CFTC\u2019s] jurisdiction, and therefore, the clearing of these options\u2026would be\u2026subject to SEC oversight.\u201d The advisory asserts that the CFTC \u201cdoes not have any more role regarding the clearing of these options.\u201d\n\nFINRA\n\nFINRA report addresses implications of the metaverse on the securities industry. In October, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) released a report entitled, \u201cThe Metaverse and the Implications for the Securities Industry,\u201d which explores the potential applications, challenges, and regulatory considerations of the metaverse for the securities industry. The report describes the metaverse as an immersive and interactive virtual world that blends digital and physical experiences and observes that financial institutions are increasingly interested in leveraging metaverse technologies for various purposes, including customer engagement, training, and data visualization. The report highlights the significant revenue opportunities in the metaverse, with projections of it contributing over $3 trillion to global GDP by 2031. The document also discusses the potential for the metaverse to transform business models and processes within the securities industry, emphasizing the importance of addressing privacy, cybersecurity, and compliance challenges. The report explores the role of digital assets within the metaverse, noting that the metaverse offers a lucrative environment for commerce, with users holding a total of $163 billion in digital payments, with assets like bitcoin, Ether, and Robux enjoying a strong preference among metaverse users. The document also highlights the regulatory scrutiny surrounding native tokens of decentralized platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland. Additionally, the report mentions the potential for metaverse payments to accelerate the shift towards digital commerce, influencing how investors interact with financial market professionals. The integration of wearable devices in the metaverse, for example, could lead to the collection of extensive user data, which financial services firms might use for customer acquisition and market research.\n\nFederal Reserve\n\nFederal Reserve issues annual Financial Stability Report. In November, the Federal Reserve published its annual Financial Stability Report, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the stability of the US financial system. The report focuses on vulnerabilities related to asset valuations, borrowing by businesses and households, leverage in the financial sector, and funding risks. It highlights that valuation pressures remain elevated in various markets, including equity, corporate debt, and residential real estate. The report specifically addresses the growth and risks associated with digital assets, particularly stablecoins. Stablecoins have grown substantially since last year\u2019s report. By the beginning of November 2024, the total market capitalization of stablecoins exceeded $170 billion, nearing the record high observed in April 2022. Despite their growth, the report emphasizes that stablecoins are structurally vulnerable to runs and lack a comprehensive federal prudential regulatory framework. The report suggests that while stablecoins currently have a relatively small footprint in the US economy, their rapid growth and potential to scale quickly pose significant risks to financial stability. The report calls for the Federal Reserve and other US government agencies to take steps to address these risks and enhance the resilience of the financial system against potential shocks from digital assets.\n\nIn November, the Federal Reserve published its annual Financial Stability Report, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the stability of the US financial system.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York issues report on risks of digital assets to financial stability. In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published an Economic Policy Review entitled, \u201cFinancial Stability Implications of Digital Assets.\u201d The review provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial stability risks associated with the digital asset ecosystem. It adapts the Federal Reserve\u2019s framework for assessing systemic risk in the traditional financial system to the digital asset ecosystem, focusing on vulnerabilities such as valuation pressures, leverage, funding risk, and interconnectedness. The review hypothesizes that fragility in the digital asset space could destabilize the broader financial system. The analysis covers various sectors within the digital ecosystem, including crypto assets, stablecoins, centralized crypto lenders, centralized crypto exchanges, and decentralized finance (DeFi). In addition, it discusses how stress in these areas could potentially spill over into the traditional financial system. The review notes that crypto assets, such as bitcoin and Ether, are prone to significant price declines, which can be amplified by the use of leverage and interconnectedness within the digital ecosystem. The document also discusses the risks associated with stablecoins, pointing to the collapse of TerraUSD (an algorithmic stablecoin) as an example. Centralized crypto lenders and exchanges are highlighted as additional sources of leverage and funding risk, with their failures potentially leading to broader financial instability. Additionally, the document explores the role of DeFi protocols in creating interconnectedness and leverage within the digital asset ecosystem. Despite these risks, the document concludes that the overall contribution of digital assets to systemic risk remains limited, though this could change as the digital ecosystem grows and becomes more integrated with traditional financial markets.\n\nIn November, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published an Economic Policy Review entitled, \u201cFinancial Stability Implications of Digital Assets.\u201d The review provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial stability risks associated with the digital asset ecosystem.

Governor Waller questions role of central bank digital currencies in public remarks. On November 12, Christopher J. Waller, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, delivered a speech at The Clearing House Annual Conference in which he discussed the roles of the private sector and the Federal Reserve in the payments ecosystem. Waller emphasized the importance of private sector innovation in providing goods and services efficiently, including in the payments system. He argued that government intervention should only occur to address market inefficiencies that cannot be resolved by the private sector alone. Waller provided a historical overview of the US payments system, highlighting the evolution from state-chartered banks to the establishment of the Federal Reserve, which was created to address coordination problems and enhance the resilience of the payments system. He noted that the Federal Reserve\u2019s role includes providing core clearing and settlement infrastructure, which supports private sector innovation. Waller then addressed ongoing public discussion about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He questioned the necessity of a CBDC, asking what specific market inefficiency it would address. Despite his interest in new payment technologies, Waller expressed skepticism about the need for a CBDC, stating he had not yet heard a satisfactory answer to justify its implementation. He highlighted the private sector\u2019s role in developing and deploying new technologies, including digital assets, due to their ability to take on innovation risks and efficiently allocate resources. Waller also referenced the Federal Reserve\u2019s engagement with the private sector and other central banks through initiatives like the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Project Agor\u00e1, which explores the use of tokenization technology to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments.\n\nOn November 12, Christopher J.

Waller also referenced the Federal Reserve\u2019s engagement with the private sector and other central banks through initiatives like the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Project Agor\u00e1, which explores the use of tokenization technology to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments. Governor Waller suggests blockchain technology could improve efficiency and reduce costs. On October 18, Federal Reserve System Governor Christopher J. Waller delivered remarks at The Vienna Macroeconomics Workshop. Waller discussed the roles of centralized finance and DeFi, including his views on whether they are substitutes or complements. He highlighted the historical context of centralized finance, emphasizing the role of intermediaries or middlemen in facilitating financial trades and the associated costs and benefits. Waller explained that centralized finance has provided significant value through efficient matching of buyers and sellers, risk assessment, and legal enforcement, but it also comes with transaction costs and the need for trust in intermediaries. He noted that technological innovations, such as the telegraph, telephone, and internet, have historically advanced financial trading, and that the next wave of innovations could address some drawbacks of centralized finance. Waller then focused on the emergence of crypto assets and their impact on DeFi. He described the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts: crypto assets, the technology facilitating their trade (including smart contracts and tokenization), and the blockchain for recording trades and ownership. He explained that the earliest digital asset, bitcoin, was designed to function without intermediaries, relying on cryptographic technology for privacy and control. Waller discussed how technologies like DLT, tokenization, and smart contracts could complement centralized finance by improving efficiency and reducing costs. He also mentioned stablecoins, which aim to provide a stable value for trading and reduce the need for payment intermediaries. He cautioned, however, that stablecoins face risks similar to other substitutes for genuine US dollars. Ultimately, Waller concluded that while some services emerging through DeFi cannot be provided by centralized finance, the technological innovations from DeFi are largely complementary and have the potential to enhance centralized finance.\n\nOn October 18, Federal Reserve System Governor Christopher J.

Federal Reserve Governor Bowman encourages community banks to experiment with crypto assets ecosystem. On October 2, Michelle W. Bowman, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, delivered a speech at the 2024 Community Banking Research Conference, emphasizing the importance of community banks and proposing a tailored regulatory and supervisory framework for their future. Bowman discussed the challenges of current regulatory thresholds, which often fail to account for economic growth and inflation, leading to unintended regulatory burdens on smaller banks. She also stressed the importance of innovation within the banking sector, including partnerships with fintech companies and the use of digital ledger technology, while cautioning against regulatory frameworks that might stifle such innovation by pushing smaller banks into higher compliance tiers. Bowman acknowledged the evolving financial landscape and the role of innovation, including the provision of traditional banking services to entities involved in the crypto asset ecosystem. She noted that innovation, such as engaging in bank-fintech partnerships and considering the use of digital ledger technology, presents challenges for both regulators and banks, but emphasized that regulatory thresholds should not discourage investment in innovation among community banks. She also highlighted the need for clear and actionable guidance to help community banks navigate the complexities of third-party risk management, including those related to digital assets.\n\nSTATE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nDigital assets\n\nCalifornia passes law imposing new requirements for sellers of \u201cdigital goods.\u201d On September 24, California Governor Gavin Newsom approved Assembly Bill 2426 (AB 2426), which addresses situations in which digital media sellers, such as game publishers, revoke consumer access to purchased digital goods without recourse. The law mandates that sellers of digital goods (including movies, apps, games, books, and music) must clearly communicate what consumers are actually receiving when they \u201cpurchase\u201d these items. Under the new law, sellers must either obtain an affirmative acknowledgment from buyers that they are only receiving a license, including all applicable restrictions, or provide a clear and conspicuous statement that the purchase is only a license, with access to full details of the license. The law excludes subscription-based services, free digital content, and digital goods that cannot be revoked after the transaction. Though AB 2426 does not explicitly address non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other blockchain-based digital assets, NFTs could fall under the law\u2019s scope if the digital asset is considered a \u201cdigital good\u201d ownership, which could be revoked by the seller. Sellers must ensure compliance with the new requirements by January 1, 2025 to avoid regulatory penalties or false advertising claims.\n\nOn September 24, California Governor Gavin Newsom approved Assembly Bill 2426 (AB 2426), which addresses situations in which digital media sellers, such as game publishers, revoke consumer access to purchased digital goods without recourse.

California amends and delays implementation of the Digital Financial Assets Law. On September 29, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1934 which amends the previously-passed Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL). The amendment extends the deadline for digital asset companies operating in California to obtain a license to operate in the state for an additional year until July 2026. The amendment also imposes new requirements for digital asset companies to maintain monthly compliance records and clarifies provisions related to stablecoins.\n\nOn September 29, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1934 which amends the previously-passed Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL).

Pennsylvania House advances bill to endorse framework for use and custody of digital assets. On October 28, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill entitled, \u201cThe Digital Assets Authorization Act,\u201d which establishes a legal framework for the use and custody of digital assets within the state. The act defines key terms such as \u201cblockchain,\u201d \u201cblockchain protocol,\u201d \u201cdigital asset,\u201d and \u201chardware wallet.\u201d A digital asset is characterized as a decentralized virtual currency, cryptocurrency, or native electronic asset (including decentralized stablecoins or NFTs), but explicitly excludes central bank digital currencies or any other government-controlled digital-only assets. The act prohibits the state or any municipality from restricting or impairing the ability of individuals or businesses to accept digital assets as payment for legal goods and services, or to maintain self-custody of digital assets using self-hosted or hardware wallets. Additionally, it prevents the imposition of additional taxes or charges on digital assets solely based on their use as a payment method. The act also authorizes the operation of nodes for connecting to blockchain protocols and transferring digital assets on these protocols. It ensures that the provisions of the act do not override existing laws related to commercial code, fiduciary access to digital assets, licensing and regulation of virtual currency businesses, and the reporting and disclosure of financial exploitation or fraud. The act aims to create a supportive environment for the use and development of digital assets and blockchain technology in Pennsylvania, promoting innovation while ensuring compliance with existing legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND LITIGATION\n\nFEDERAL\n\nSecurities\n\nSEC charges entities operating Mango Markets crypto trading platform.

On October 10, Bitnomial Exchange LLC filed a complaint against the SEC in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Bitnomial challenges the SEC\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over its planned listing of XRP Futures, a futures contract based on the digital asset XRP. Bitnomial argues that the SEC is incorrect to take the position that XRP is a security that would require it to comply with additional SEC regulations, including registering as a national securities exchange. Instead, the complaint alleges that XRP Futures should be regulated solely by the CFTC, under whose jurisdiction Bitnomial has already self-certified the product. Bitnomial argues that precedent from the Southern District of New York establishes that XRP is not inherently a security when traded on secondary markets, which is the context for XRP Futures. The company alleges that the SEC\u2019s position imposes unnecessary regulatory burdens and hinders its ability to list XRP Futures, despite compliance with CFTC requirements. Therefore, it seeks a court declaration that XRP Futures are not security futures and an injunction to prevent the SEC from bringing an enforcement action.\n\nOn October 10, Bitnomial Exchange LLC filed a complaint against the SEC in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

The Board of Governors alleges that Hanes\u2019s actions violated the bank\u2019s policies and constituted unsafe banking practices, breaches of fiduciary duties, and violations of law or regulation. Hanes has separately pleaded guilty to embezzlement by a bank officer and agreed to make restitution of approximately $60.5 million. FBI seizes more than $1 million in USDT from fraud scams. On November 26, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the North District of Ohio announced a civil complaint in forfeiture directed at 947,883 USDT, nearly half of which were the life savings of an Ohio man caught in a fraud scam. According to the announcement, the man was tricked into believing that his retirement account had been compromised and gave remote computer access to scammers who then transferred his money to various crypto accounts. The announcement followed an October 4 press release in which the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the same district announced that it was seeking forfeiture of an additional $200,000 in USDT taken fraudulently from a different Ohio man. In both cases, federal investigators managed to trace the funds and executed a seizure warrant in July 2024, freezing the USDT in a law enforcement-controlled wallet.\n\nOn November 26, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the North District of Ohio announced a civil complaint in forfeiture directed at 947,883 USDT, nearly half of which were the life savings of an Ohio man caught in a fraud scam.

Northern District of California finds DAO members can be held liable for securities violations. On November 18, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued a ruling that certain token holders of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are considered general partners under California law. This ruling means that these token holders can be held liable for securities law violations, such as the failure to register DAO governance tokens token as a securities with the SEC. The court denied a motion to dismiss in Samuels v. Lido DAO, affirming that DAOs can be held accountable for unregistered securities sales. The plaintiff, Andrew Samuels, had alleged that Lido DAO and its key investors violated Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 by selling unregistered securities. The court found that entities like Paradigm Operations, Andreessen Horowitz, and Dragonfly Digital Management acted as general partners by holding large voting blocks of Lido DAO tokens LDO and participating in the DAO\u2019s governance. This participation included influencing the development and operational decisions of Lido DAO. The court also highlighted that DAOs might be liable for soliciting token purchases on secondary markets, as seen in the Houghton v. Leshner case, decided in September 2023, where the same court ruled that members of Compound DAO could be held liable for failing to register COMP tokens as securities and for soliciting public investment. These rulings collectively emphasize that DAOs, despite their decentralized nature, are not immune from legal liability, and key investors who influence DAO governance can be held responsible for its actions.\n\nNFTs\n\nFederal judge approves $4 million settlement in Dapper Labs\u2019 NFT case. On October 18, Judge Victor Marrero of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York approved the final settlement between Dapper Labs, Inc. and a class of plaintiffs, which included NBA Top Shot Moments, between June 15, 2020 and December 27, 2021. Judge Marrero, who previously sustained plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the NFTs were sold as unregistered securities, approved a settlement amount of $4 million.\n\nOn October 18, Judge Victor Marrero of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York approved the final settlement between Dapper Labs, Inc. and a class of plaintiffs, which included NBA Top Shot Moments, between June 15, 2020 and December 27, 2021.

Second Circuit Court of Appeals hears arguments in MetaBirkins appeal. On October 23, a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard arguments on whether Mason Rothschild, who goes by the name Sonny Estival, infringed Herm\u00e8s International's trademarks with his \u201cMetaBirkins\u201d NFTs. The case, which has been ongoing for years, centers around the artistic intent and trademark use of Rothschild\u2019s digital assets. A jury previously found Rothschild liable for trademark infringement, influenced by his statements that the NFTs were \u201cdigital commodities\u201d and a \u201cgold mine.\u201d Questioning from Judges Denny Chin and Raymond J. Lohier Jr. appeared sympathetic to Herm\u00e8s, probing whether Rothschild was leveraging Herm\u00e8s\u2019 goodwill for his own benefit. Rothschild\u2019s attorneys compared his work to Andy Warhol\u2019s Campbell's Soup Cans, arguing that his NFTs blur the line between art and business. The judges appeared to grapple with application of Rogers v. Grimaldi, which protects artists\u2019 First Amendment rights, and its relevance in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 ruling in Jack Daniel\u2019s Properties v. VIP Products LLC, which suggests that Rogers does not apply if a trademark is used as a \u201cdesignation of source\u201d for goods. Judge Chin questioned whether Rothschild\u2019s use of the Birkin mark served as a source identifier, while Judge Lohier expressed skepticism about accommodating First Amendment interests under the Jack Daniel\u2019s framework. Judge Pierre N. Leval, however, appeared persuaded that Rothschild was acting as an artist rather than a merchant, suggesting that his statements were more about homage than deception.\n\nIllicit finance\n\nDOJ disrupts billion-dollar money laundering network.

On November 26, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash, a popular cryptocurrency mixer. The court concluded that immutable smart contracts, which Tornado Cash uses to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions, do not qualify as \u201cproperty\u201d under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Fifth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, which eliminated broad Chevron deference to agency interpretations of statutory text. The Fifth Circuit emphasized that immutable smart contracts cannot be owned or controlled, and thus, do not meet the statutory definition of property. The case arose after OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging it was used to launder over $7 billion in cryptocurrency, including funds stolen by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group. The sanctions included adding Tornado Cash and its immutable smart contracts to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, effectively banning US persons from engaging with the service. The Fifth Circuit, however, found that these immutable smart contracts, being unchangeable and unremovable, do not constitute property as they cannot be owned or controlled by any party. The court also observed that these smart contracts do not qualify as \u201ccontracts\u201d or \u201cservices\u201d under OFAC\u2019s regulatory definitions. This decisi"

            "article_content": "One of the most significant emerging trends of 2024 has been the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) and the crypto ecosystem. Historically this has primarily been on the infrastructure side, affecting various layers of the stack such as decentralized compute, storage and model training and inference. However, the last few months the crypto x AI crossover has taken stage front and center as agents have surfaced and are multiplying by the thousands. While the AI agent narrative has taken up a lot of mindshare of late, we've barely scratched the surface of what we're going to see in 2025.\n\nWhat are AI agents?\n\nAI agents are autonomous programs designed to perform specific tasks. This could be as simple as sharing memes on X, all the way to complex on-chain transactions optimizing trade execution or yield farming strategies. Unlike standard bots, AI agents can learn best practices over time and make undefined decisions to meet predefined goals. Think of them as highly skilled, evolving crypto participants capable of navigating the digital economy autonomously.\n\nThe value of AI agents lies not just in their utility but in their potential to scale human capabilities. Agents are no longer just tools \u2014 they are emerging as participants in the on-chain economy, driving innovation across finance, gaming and decentralized social platforms. With protocols such as Virtuals and open-source frameworks like ELIZA, it\u2019s becoming increasingly simple for developers to build, deploy and iterate AI agents that serve an increasingly diverse set of use cases.\n\nEmerging applications of AI agents\n\nThis year offered glimpses of the potential applications for AI agents. From the bizarre rise of the Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) memecoin to the rapid growth of agent-led experiments, AI agents are beginning to reshape how we interact with technology, culture and finance. Terminal of Truths (ToT) , an AI agent trained on a satirical internet religion, received a grant from prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreesen and amassed over 200,000 followers becoming crypto\u2019s first AI KOL (key opinion leader) and millionaire as it drove $GOAT to a market cap of more than $1 billion.\n\nWhile ToT might feel like an anomaly, it serves as a proof of concept for how AI agents can drive community-building, capture attention and fuel the next generation of on-chain activity. Since then over 11,000 agents have launched on the leading platform Virtuals, which may seem like a lot yet pales in comparison to pump.fun which is averaging 4x that every single day. While most of the agents launched are simple bots that simply propagate memes, we\u2019re also seeing agents such as aixbt, which provides sophisticated investment research, and zerebro, which creates unique digital art. These applications may appear niche, but they offer a glimpse into the growing design space for AI agent innovation.\n\nWhy crypto is the frontline for AI agent development\n\nUnlike the core foundational AI models that are developed behind the walled gardens of OpenAI and Anthropic, AI agents are being innovated in the trenches of the crypto world. And for good reason. Blockchains provide the ideal infrastructure as they offer permissionless and frictionless financial rails, enabling agents to seed wallets, transact and send funds autonomously \u2014 tasks that would be unfeasible using traditional financial systems.\n\nIn addition, the open-source nature of crypto allows developers to leverage existing frameworks to launch and iterate on agents faster than ever before. With more no-code platforms like Top Hat gaining traction, it\u2019s only getting easier for anyone to be able to launch an agent in minutes. Add in the financial incentive in which agents that gain traction tend to have a rise in price similar to your run-of-the-mill memecoin, potentially making the creator huge amounts of money, and you can see how this environment is ripe for attracting talent and accelerating progress.\n\nWhat AI agents will do in 2025\n\nIf 2024 laid the foundation for AI agents, 2025 will be the year they scale. Three trends will drive this evolution:\n\nFirst, agent-to-agent and human-to-agent interactions will proliferate. Decentralized social platforms like Warpcast have already shown how agents can launch tokens, trade autonomously and interact with communities. As tools for creating agents become more accessible, these interactions will become a defining feature of the on-chain experience.\n\nSecond, AI agents will dominate financial activity on-chain. As developers build agents capable of optimizing trades, managing wallets and automating yield strategies, the financial infrastructure of crypto will become increasingly autonomous. Blockchain\u2019s efficiency, combined with agents\u2019 adaptability, will position crypto as the preferred environment for financial AI.\n\nFinally, agent-led ecosystems will reshape gaming and entertainment. Projects like Wayfinder and Echelon Prime\u2019s Parallel Colony point to a future where AI agents not only participate in games but also manage assets, coordinate strategies and drive entire in-game economies. These agents will blur the lines between players, developers and automated participants, creating new dynamics for virtual worlds.\n\nThe rise of AI agents marks a new chapter for both artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. While the applications we\u2019ve seen so far \u2014 from memecoins to agent-led communities \u2014 may feel experimental, they mark a preview of the impact these agents will have as they scale."

            "article_content": "With the global population aging, and rising concerns about mental health, loneliness, and social isolation, understanding and enhancing later-life satisfaction has become increasingly crucial for both individual and global health and productivity. The World Health Organization1 reports that by 2030, one out of six people will be 60 years or older, comprising 1.4 billion people, with those over 80 approaching half a billion.\n\nGiven the vast scope of this issue, it's surprising that we have a limited understanding of what preserves and enhances generativity in our later years, as research to date is still early-on. Along similar lines, increased generativity would be expected to enhance well-being, and protect against many of the negative outcomes currently associated with aging. With the global population getting older and the average human lifespan increasing, it is imperative to work out how to extend healthspan and productivity, meaning, purpose and community.\n\nDeveloping Machine Learning Approaches to Understand Complex Problems\n\nA recent study by Mohsen Joshanloo, Ph.D., published in the Journals of Gerontology (2024), took a novel approach using machine learning to extract key variables from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset. This study included a wide range of psychological and demographic variables and measured generativity using the Loyola Generativity Scale. Participants ranged from 39 to 93 years old, with an average age of 63.64. Using maching learning allows us to make sense out of complicated data sets where standard statistical approaches may falter.\n\nFrom a broad perspective, a few key concepts help us understand aging across the lifespan. These include Erik Erikson\u2019s developmental model, especially Middle and Older Adulthood (below, with some flexibilty on the age spans given how long we're living nowadays); the balance of stability and plasticity (contributing to consistency and change); and the two major forms of well-being\u2014eudaimonic (meaning) and hedonic (pleasure), which need to be in harmony. Personality traits, measured by the Big Five (Five Factor Model, or FFM), play a role in this process, with some contributing to stability or plasticity. For example, openness to experience is linked with plasticity, while neuroticism, because of an anxious reluctance to take risks, is often associated with stability.\n\nSource: Robert.G Sacco, CC BY-SA 4.0 / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe study used a \"Random Forest Analysis\" machine learning technique. This method builds multiple decision trees to sift through large datasets, identifying non-linear relationships and dynamic interactions. The model was trained on a subset of data and then tested against the rest to minimize prediction error and enhance accuracy. It analyzed 34 variables for 2,830 participants, after removing those with missing data and reducing the original 70 variables to a set of non-redundant measures.\n\nThe final model predicted 40% of the variance in generativity, revealing five key factors as the strongest predictors, ranked by significance:\n\nSocial Potency: Assertiveness, persuasion, and leadership orientation are crucial. Generativity is inherently social, requiring not just drive but also the interpersonal skills to lead and influence others. Openness: Mental flexibility and the ability to entertain new ideas and experiences are the second strongest predictors. This is consistent with the personality trait openness to experience, which has also been linked to giftedness2. Social Integration: This factor emphasizes the importance of social function in generativity. Beyond leadership, the ability to be part of a group, experience belonging, and find one\u2019s place in the social order is also critical. Social integration protects against loneliness, and the ill effects on health. Personal Growth: The drive for continuous development, particularly in later life, is another important contributor to generativity. As people age and face existential challenges, this drive to grow becomes even more significant. Achievement Orientation: The drive and passion to pursue goals is a key factor in generativity. A strong desire to get things done is inherently generative, though without the other factors, it may lack deeper meaning.\n\nAdditional important factors include a sense of purpose in life and self-acceptance, which highlight the importance of living a meaningful life (eudaimonia) and having a coherent life narrative. Generativity is influenced by how we view ourselves against the backdrop of our life story. Spiritual experiences also emerged as a relevant factor, pointing to the role of transcending quotidian concerns to see ourselves within a broader context.\n\nFactors that were not significant in this model included demographic and health factors such as gender, health status, and socioeconomic variables. While these factors have been important predictors of well-being and life satisfaction in other studies, the machine learning analysis suggests they may not be the most crucial drivers of generativity, though they likely influence the key factors mentioned above. They may be necessary but not sufficient for generativity, perhaps accomplishments from earlier stages of life and provision of basic needs, providing stability and an all-important springboard for generativity into later life.\n\nBecause the dataset is cross-sectional, the results are correlational rather than causal. Future research using machine learning approaches such as Random Forest Analysis, and others, could look at longitudinal data sets to determine causality and further explore additional variables that may influence generativity. Hybrid intelligence, synergizing human and artificial minds to go beyond the capacity of either alone, holds promise for addressing knotty problems.\n\nLiving Large\n\nWhile the jury is still out, this study identifies important factors which, beyond their statistical significance, make a certain intuitive sense when contemplating how to flourish and increase generativity as we grow older. Rather than fading away, focusing on social factors including both leadership and belonging emerges as important. Cultivating mental flexibility and openness to experience are core. Stability is important, but in excess may lead to stagnation, and failure to take necessary risks.\n\nPlasticity factors dovetail with personal growth orientation, flowing together into Erikson's last two developmental tasks: Middle Adulthood Generativity vs. Stagnation, and Late Adulthood Integrity vs. Despair. It's important to maintain ambition as part of the story, but not to an extreme, understand who we are and where we fit into a broader sense of purpose and meaning, and at the same time enjoy ourselves along the way."

In fact, after our conversation in Brussels in the presence of all European leaders, nothing surprises anymore.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for our lives, Fico is fighting for money, and it\u2019s unlikely that money is for Slovakia.

We were ready to do this. Fico did not want compensation for the Slovaks. And he does not want to cooperate with the European Commission.

Mr Fico had accused Mr Zelensky of opposing any gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia, which is dependent on gas supplies piped in via its neighbour.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly said it will not extend an existing transit deal for gas flows from Russia to Europe, which expires on 1 January. Payments for the gas have helped Russia to wage its almost three-year war in Ukraine, Kyiv says.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said Mr Fico had been offered possible compensation for Slovakia for losses resulting from the expiry, as well as transit alternatives for non-Russian gas.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Slovak prime minister Robert Fico during a meeting in Moscow (Reuters)\n\n\u201cFico did not want compensation for the Slovaks,\u201d Mr Zelensky said in his evening address.\n\nSlovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russia\u2019s Gazprom, has said buying in gas from elsewhere would cost it $229m more in transit expenses.\n\nMr Zelensky gave no further details on the compensation offer but earlier on Monday said that Mr Fico was interested only in Russian gas and that \u00a3398m per year was at stake.\n\nMr Fico said last week that Mr Zelensky had offered \u20ac500m (\u00a3414m), which he said had been tied to Nato membership and was from Russian assets that the Slovak leader said Ukraine did not possess.\n\n\u201cPresident (Zelensky) came back to the subject of gas and asked me if I would then vote for Nato membership if he gave me 500m euros of Russian assets, and of course, I said \u2018never\u2019,\u201d said Mr Fico, who has opposed Ukraine\u2019s bid for a place in the transatlantic security alliance.\n\nWho was Igor Kirillov, Russian general killed by bomb in Moscow?\n\n03:01 , Tom Watling\n\nWho was Igor Kirillov, senior Russian general killed by bombing in Moscow?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to feel festive, say Ukrainians marking third Christmas in UK\n\n02:57 , Namita Singh\n\nUkrainians in the UK, marking their third Christmas away from home and another milestone since Russia\u2019s invasion, have said it can be \u201cdifficult to be in a festive mood\u201d.\n\nMaria Romanenko, 32, left the Kyiv region for Manchester shortly after the Russian invasion began on 24 February 2022, alongside her Mancunian partner Jez.\n\nThe couple made a perilous journey to the Polish border, where they had to wait four days for confirmation that Maria would be allowed to enter the UK with Jez.

He said the two also discussed the military situation in Ukraine, chances for a peaceful solution to the war and the bilateral relations between their two countries which Fico said they will seek to \u201cstandardise.\u201d\n\nVladimir Putin and Robert Fico pose for a photo during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, (AP)\n\nHis trip, however, was condemned by the major Slovak opposition parties.\n\nSlovakia last month signed a short-term pilot contract to buy natural gas from Azerbaijan, as it prepares for a possible halt to Russian supplies through Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, it struck a deal to import US liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.\n\nThe country can also receive gas through Austrian, Hungarian and Czech networks, enabling imports from Germany among other potential suppliers.\n\nUkraine says Russian forces executed five POWs\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 04:00 , Holly Evans\n\nRussian forces executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukraine\u2019s Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said on Sunday.\n\nLubinets said on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops shot the five unarmed soldiers after capturing them.

The company recently updated its lineup of Cirrus7 Incus models to support AMD Ryzen 9000 series CPUs [h/t FanlessTech].\n\nSince our original coverage, the lineup has also been upgraded with Intel 14th Gen support, though the Ryzen 9000 series will likely be the more compelling choice for most users. Cirrus7 Incus' designs are all based directly on the ASRock DeskMini mini-PC designs, which use a custom Mini-STX motherboard and case\u2014though Cirrus7 is using a highly overhauled design for its passive cooling aims with Incus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCirrus7 highlights in its official documentation that the three distinct cooling designs (Standard Edition, Extended Cooling Edition, and Extreme Cooling Edition) are passive cooling solutions with thermal mass and case dimensions corresponding to intended workloads. The Extreme Cooling design is intended for full-time, high-wattage use with CPUs like the Ryzen 7 9700X, while the other designs are more appropriate for lower-power APUs. However, Extended Cooling or better is likely best for chips with a Radeon 780M iGPU or better.\n\n*Technically based on but considerably changed from various models of ASRock DeskMini mini-PCs, ranging from DeskMini X300 and DeskMini X600, which use AMD CPUs, and DeskMini B760, based on an Intel platform.\n\n**Any \"Cooling Edition\" can be used with any platform\u2014this distinction is made to illustrate dimension and I/O differences between otherwise identical PCs more clearly.\n\nThe cheapest starting configuration, including the full-fat Ryzen 9700X and Extreme Cooling Edition design, starts at 1076\u20ac Euros and includes 8GB of DDR5-4800 RAM and a 250GB Samsung 980 NVMe 3.0 drive. While the starting memory and storage specs are relatively humble, these specifications can be configured much higher, with plenty of storage configuration options available thanks to 4 total SSD connectors (2 SATA, 2 NVMe M.2).\n\nFor those who are fans of passive cooling and mini-PC designs, the Cirrus7 Incus may be a winner for its cooling capacity, compact size, and reasonably balanced aesthetics. The acceptable pricing will, of course, vary depending on the buyer. However, we recommend that those interested in PC gaming opt for an AM5 APU with an onboard Radeon 780M rather than a Radeon 7 9700X configuration with a weaker iGPU. Unfortunately, eGPU options don't look great with this mini PC, so be extra wary of the balance between CPU and iGPU you're picking at checkout."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nYou expect your electronic devices to work a certain way when you use them. If you tap an app icon on your phone, it should open. When you boot up your laptop, it should start in a reasonable amount of time. But that\u2019s not always how it goes. As your device ages, it often develops inefficiencies and quirks that make it slower and less reliable.\n\nNo device is immune to this kind of decline, yet certain brands have a reputation for building tech that performs reliably\u2014without crashes, slowdowns, or other glitches\u2014for longer periods. Others\u2026not so much. So, which brands should you buy from if you want tech you can depend on for the longest time?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a definitive answer to this question, we asked thousands of our readers to share their experiences and rate the products they depend on in our Readers\u2019 Choice surveys about , , and . In those surveys, conducted over the past year, our audience rated electronics manufacturers on a scale from 1 to 10 for reliability. Here\u2019s which brands come out on top.\n\nThe Best PC, Tablet, and Phone Brands for Reliability\n\nLaptops: MacBooks Are the Most Trusted\n\nIf you need a laptop you can count on, you\u2019d be wise to pick up a MacBook. Apple\u2019s laptops score nearly half a point higher than competing machines from any other brand. Apple\u2019s MacBooks are known for their longevity and seamless updates, making them favorites for students, creatives, and professionals.\n\nMSI comes in second for laptops, with Lenovo and Asus rounding out the top tier. All have respectable reliability scores, but nevertheless pale in comparison to Apple. MSI, however, excels in the gaming and performance space. If you prefer Windows, MSI is the way to go, but whether you\u2019re after a powerhouse for gaming or a workhorse for productivity, these brands won\u2019t let you down.\n\nFor more, read .\n\nApple Aces Laptops for Work\n\nWhile Windows-based machines have a reputation for being more business-oriented, PCMag readers suggest that Apple computers are the most reliable work machines.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\u2019s MacBook line scores well ahead of the big three PC manufacturers (Dell, HP, and Lenovo) here, with Dell in last place. Couple that with Apple\u2019s excellent scores for and in our companion stories, and it\u2019s obvious that office workers with Apple laptops are happier\u2014and with this level of reliability, they\u2019ll be using them for a long time.\n\nIT-Managed Laptops: HP Is the MVP in the Office\n\nWhat do the people who purchase and maintain laptops for big offices think? Well, they didn\u2019t think of Apple enough to rate them in our results\u2014they stick with the big three manufacturers. Of them, HP and Lenovo are deadlocked for the best reliability, according to IT managers. But thanks to the tie-breaker from the overall score earned in the same survey, the award goes to HP.\n\nBut when things are so close, anything could change in the future. (If you\u2019re an IT manager, take our currently running right now to impact the results for next year's story.)\n\nFor more, read .\n\nDesktops: Top Reliability Ratings Go to Apple\n\nApple\u2019s desktops vary in many ways, including size, shape, and price\u2014but they\u2019re lumped together by PCMag readers as the most reliable PCs you can buy for home use, period. Apple desktop systems are a half point ahead of the nearest competitor in this category.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep in mind that if you're a Windows aficionado, the \u201creal\u201d winner after Apple is a PC you buy locally or build yourself. These DIY rigs score even higher than the next best PC vendor (Dell, in this case).\n\nApple system soundness stands out specifically in all-in-one computers as well. Dell and HP both score respectably, but the Apple iMac continues to set the standard. If you\u2019re looking for a sleek, space-saving machine that handles everything from work to creative projects, the trustworthy is a fantastic choice. It\u2019s a little pricier, but the build quality and reliability make it worth the investment.\n\nGamers Give the Nod to HP Desktops\n\nWhen it comes to non-portable PCs built for games, HP tops the reliability charts with a score of 9.4. Alienware and MSI aren\u2019t far behind, but self-built rigs once again shine the brightest with a 9.5.\n\nIf you\u2019re handy and want the best bang for your buck, building your own gaming PC is tough to beat. But if you're not into DIY, HP delivers an excellent mix of reliability and performance.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more, read .\n\nMacs Earn Workplace Trust in Desktops\n\nWhile Windows-based machines are know for being better-suited for most business applications, PCMag readers suggest that Apple computers are the most reliable work machines.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting (and somewhat surprising) that self-built computers are the real winner here, scoring even higher than Apple when it comes to reliability for work-focused machines. Building your own PC gives you full control over the components, which means you can prioritize quality and tailor everything to your exact needs. But if you don\u2019t want to mess with screwdrivers and thermal paste, Apple\u2019s prebuilt systems are a solid choice for reliability and performance.\n\nIT-Managed Desktops: Managers Prefer Lenovo\n\nDell, HP, and Lenovo are the biggest sellers of PCs in the US, especially because they sell in bulk to businesses. They might seem evenly matched in many ways, but when it comes to longevity, IT managers in our surveys specifically peg Lenovo as a bit more dependable. And that kind of thing on a fleet of desktop units can make all the difference.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat said, the Dell and HP numbers are respectable among IT professionals. There\u2019s a reason these brands are top sellers, after all. They make PCs that last, even when abused by staffers.\n\nFor more, read .\n\nPhones: Samsung Is the Most Reliable Brand for Home and Work\n\nApple, Google, and Samsung top our charts in phone reliability with a score of 9.1, tying for the lead. To break the tie and determine a single winner, we look at overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend scores, which means Samsung grabs the win.\n\nSo, what does that mean for you? If you\u2019re deep in the Apple ecosystem\u2014or just want a phone you can depend on\u2014iPhones are the way to go. That said, Google and Samsung phones are just as solid, according to our readership.

            "article_content": "Focusing on providing the Army with advanced intelligence, electronic warfare and sensor capabilities through agile acquisition is core to the PEO IEW&S mission. Processing, dissemination and exploitation of data and intel requires advanced sensors and systems, not to mention a robust and future-focused command and control environment.\n\nNext Generation Command and Control (NGC2) is the Army\u2019s new approach to develop a data-centric architecture for the commander to make more, faster, and better decisions, and ultimately reduce sensor to effector/shooter timelines.\n\nNGC2 is a fundamentally different approach to C2, not just in the capability itself, but also in how the Army is organizing to deliver and rapidly scale using cloud-native, trainable, open architecture design characteristics.\n\nPEO IEW&S\u2019 systems and programs are already designed around many of the NGC2 design principles, which should allow our systems to plug in and operate in the NGC2 environment.\n\nCloud native and Trainability\n\nOperating in the cloud environment isn\u2019t something new to the Intelligence community. As early adopters of cloud, seeing the value of it for storing and disseminating intelligence data, put them out in front. NGC2 aims to leverage the cloud environment to ensure command and control can be done to the edge.\n\nPEO IEW&S supports Next Gen C2 through military intelligence, Integrated Sensor Architecture and electromagnetic warfare capabilities. As the Army develops NGC2, the experiences of PEO IEW&S will serve as a model for the Army network enterprise, allowing for better data transfer, more accessibility for units with cloud service, and seamless integration of systems thanks to common architecture standards and design. (Photo Credit: (Image courtesy of PEO IEW&S) ) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nArmy Intelligence Data Platform (AIDP), managed by Project Manager Intelligence Systems and Analytics (PM IS&A), enables intelligence soldiers the ability to gather, analyze and distribute information to units faster and more accurately than ever before through its many features, ease of use and housing in the military intelligence cloud environment.\n\n\u201cWith all the intelligence data in the cloud, we\u2019re able to funnel it into one common spot,\u201d Col. Chris Anderson, PM IS&A said. \u201cAIDP in the cloud means you have a global common intel picture instead of just a regional one.\u201d\n\nThe Army\u2019s expansion into cloud environments is critical to enable modern, data-driven operations.\n\nAs NGC2 develops, the Army will begin integrating existing intelligence software applications as well as custom analytical capabilities to further enhance situational awareness and provide enhanced target data across all Mission Command applications.\n\nTraining soldiers on AIDP has been faster and easier than with past intelligence systems thanks to the cloud and because soldiers can access AIDP from anywhere and train anytime, anywhere.\n\nOpen Architecture\n\nPEO IEW&S project managers are no stranger to open architecture principles. They have been employing them along with open architecture best practices for years, working open architecture language into contracts to ensure the systems designed today will be able to plug and play with future systems and systems proliferated throughout the military branches.\n\n\u201cWe do a good job with contract language that encourages and enforces (Modular Open System Architecture) MOSA,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cOur HYDRA API in one of several API standards the Army is considering, and we\u2019re closely partnered with the Integrated Sensor Architecture (ISA) team to make sure all of our current and future platforms all talk to each other seamlessly.\n\nThe HYDRA API is a government-owned application programming interface, created to address data exchange across the PEO IEW&S portfolio. It enables developers\u2019 easier integration of new software onto the Army network while maintaining core capabilities. The Army expects to use several API standards to ensure flexibility as it conducts prototyping.\n\nISA is the connective tissue allowing sensors across domains and echelons to connect and communicate with each other. With ISA enabled sensors, Commanders have the ability to know what sensors they have access to and what each one can do for them. ISA is integrating into Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT-X) and Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN).\n\nSimplifying the complexity of military C2 through standard architecture and frameworks is a priority for the development of all systems moving forward.\n\nProject Manager Electronic Warfare and Cyber (PM EW&C) was an early adopter of C5ISR Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS) which informs EW systems. All PM EW&C programs are now designed with open systems architecture in mind, making plugging into a widely adopted framework like Tactical Assault Kit (TAK), seamless.\n\n\u201cUsing an underlying software architecture gives us a number of advantages,\u201d Ken Strayer, PM EW&C said. \u201cIt allows us to rapidly develop new capability on a mature framework that already has built in joint and coalition interoperability.\u201d\n\nEWPMT-X, PM EW&C\u2019s most direct contribution to NGC2 according to Strayer, is the C2 tool for the EW officer, supporting mission planning, situational awareness and processing sensor data.\n\n\u201cEWPMT-X will converge with the TAK framework allowing the system to be more widely used due to the widespread use of TAK across the Army,\u201d Strayer said.\n\nTAK serves as a versatile, field-proven framework for enhancing situational awareness, communication and decision making, all key elements for NGC2.\n\nProtection and NGC2\n\nPM EW&C, who specializes in all things electronic warfare and cyber, sees their role with NGC2 as one of providing protection. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) has become a key domain the Army wants to dominate. Controlling, dominating and understanding the spectrum will be critical for command and control to occur.\n\n\u201cAnother key contribution to NGC2 is the ability to see yourself in the spectrum,\u201d Strayer explained. \u201cSeeing ourselves is part of the equation, but our systems also provide the ability to identify threats that are going to keep units from being able to communicate.\u201d\n\nTwo EW systems critical to enable NGC2 and enhancement of commanders\u2019 decision making by means of the EMS are Terrestrial Layer Systems (TLS) BCT Manpack and Spectrum Situational Awareness System (S2AS).\n\nTLS BCT Manpack, which has entered into rapid fielding and is currently being equipped to brigade combat teams, enables brigades to understand their EMS environment, identify threats and ultimately communicate more effectively.\n\nS2AS is designed for commanders to see themselves in the spectrum and is planned for a start in FY25.\n\n\u201cCommanders will be able to see how they look in the spectrum and allow them to reposition or mask their own capabilities or limit their EMS signature,\u201d Strayer explained. \u201cThey can maintain the ability to communicate while also picking up any unknown things going on in the environment that may be impacting the Army\u2019s ability to communicate.\u201d\n\nThe lessons learned over the last few years by PEO IEW&S apply closely to what the Army is aiming to do with NGC2.\n\nThe expertise and experience at PEO IEW&S in applying these NGC2 characteristics across the intel, EW and sensor enterprise serves as a model/example for the entire Army network enterprise, allowing for better data transfer, more accessibility for units with cloud service, and seamless integration of systems thanks to common architecture standards and design. These cross-cutting solutions ultimately enable more robust and capable C2."

We expect that further details regarding the subpoena process will be disclosed during discovery.\"\n\nHowever, lawyer Bryan Freedman, who is representing Abel, Baldoni, Melissa Nathan, and Wayfarer Studios, has said that none of his clients received a subpoena.\n\nLively alongside her husband Ryan Reynolds (Cindy Ord/Getty Images)\n\nBaldoni's lawyer's response\n\nFreedman said that they planned to sue Abel's former boss, Stephanie Jones, telling Variety: \u201cIf all of the text messages were produced in that \u2018subpoena,\u2019 then Lively\u2019s team knows the true facts of what actually happened and did not happen.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe truth is completely different than what has been portrayed in the complaint and they know that.\n\n\u201cThe complete set of text messages unequivocally show that there was no smear campaign initiated at all which is why certain texts are incomplete and other texts, which tell the truth, are purposefully excluded.\u201d\n\nAn attorney hired by Jones, Kristin Tahler, also responded to this, claiming that her client was being used as a 'scapegoat' for having just responded to the subpoena.\n\n\u201cDesperate to shift attention away from their disgraceful sliming of Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni\u2019s team is doubling down on their smears by going after someone who had nothing whatsoever to do with this ugly campaign.\" Tahler told Variety.\n\n\u201cHaving pushed Steph Jones out of her long-standing business with Baldoni, Jen Abel and Melissa Nathan are now looking to scapegoat Steph for having the temerity to respond to a court-ordered subpoena. Unfortunately for them.\n\n\u201cSteph won\u2019t be bullied \u2013 even by paternalistic threats of being sued into oblivion.\n\n\u201cTo quote Nathan herself, \u2018it just shows you \u2026 people really want to hate on women.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Dallas County, April 1897\n\n\n\nNewspapers of the day reported the sightings straight-faced, although one can read more than a little tongue-in-cheek writing into some of the dispatches from community correspondents.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of the airships varied somewhat, but there was a general consensus that they had cigar-shaped bodies or cabins 50 to 60 feet long with propellers at each end, large bat-like wings, and huge floodlights fore and aft. Most witnesses saw neither pilot nor crew, but in some cases, not only did observers see people manning the ships, but talked to them. The Dallas Morning News' correspondent at Waxahachie reported a long conversation between Judge Love of the community and an airship crew, which claimed to be from the North Pole.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Field, 1952\n\n\n\nThere was considerable air traffic in the vicinity (normal Love Field activity) and there was enough light that aircraft were identifiable as the general type when viewed in the southwest, the sun to the rear. I first noticed an orange colored light which appeared to be nothing more than the exhaust or running light of an aircraft. Then, I noticed the light gave off an exhaust trail similar to that of an afterburner. I watched the light in its descending path for about four seconds when it seemed to fire a number of \"rockets\" and vanished.\n\n\n\nUniversity Park, 1961\n\n\n\nAt exactly 4:07 AM CST early Thursday morning, March 9th, I was out in my back yard doing a bit of amateur satelloon watching [a balloon satellite] ....hoping to see the polka-dot 12 footer, and I SAW A BIG, extremely fast, unidentified object streaking from about ENE to SW across the sky. It moved so fast was hard to focus on it, but I DO remember quite a bit of the impression it left on me. This object, seemingly, moved so darn fast that I would never have given it much later thought, except that the 7:00 AM news that morning carried big story that the Russians had orbited a dog, etc. in a 5-ton rocket.\n\nDenton, 2007\n\n\n\nI think I saw a UFO. I am not really sure. I feel like I am kind of crazy for thinking this. I was driving on 35W in Denton, TX around 10:15 a.m. 11/21/07 this morning and when I came over a hill I saw three white things in the sky. It was like 1 mile in front of me, slightly to the right. I wasn't sure if it was the balls that are on powerline to warn airplanes and then I thought it was a reflection the stadium. the balls were white with some silver tint. They were almost a perfect circle, but a little oblong.\n\n\n\nThey were perfectly aligned in a row a little to the left of me looking straight ahead. I was thinking I should take a picture because I thought oh it might be a UFO. I was trying to figure out what it was and the one on the right disapeared and one second later the middle one dissapeared and a little less then one second later the left one dissapeared. It didn't fade out or dart away. It just dissapeared in a split second.\n\n\n\nI am super freaked out right now and I don't know if It was something from Carswell air base or Lockead Martin, but I have NEVER seen anything like this before. It was soooo clear too. Not fuzy at all! PLease let me know if anyone else has seen this one in Denton! I have been very skeptical of UFO sightings, but I am so freaked out and paranoid now!\n\n\n\nIrving, 2021\n\n\n\nThe shiny spinning disc was seen hovering over a golf course before it appeared to have landed on the ground in Irving on April 25.\n\n\n\nFootage was recorded by a man who was visiting the area with his friends. They then saw the strange object reflecting the sunlight from a distance.\n\n\n\nA man was heard saying in the background: \u2018You see that? That\u2019s not a weather balloon, dude, it\u2019s flat.\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s moving really weird, it\u2019s like spinning and it\u2019s got another disc inside of it that\u2019s spinning.\u2019\n\n\n\nHe described the object as a \u2018large metallic ring that floated around a separate metallic sphere within the ring, like a flying armillary sphere.\u2019\n\nPilots flying near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport recently reported some suspicious lights floating around that air traffic controllers couldn't spot with their technology. It provoked quite the conversation.Seems UFO sightings is a topic that may never go out of style, especially in North Texas. In fact, a recent study names Texas as one of the top hotspots for UFO sightings in the U.S. Some of the more talked-about UFO sightings in the nation\u2019s history have occurred in other parts of Texas like Levelland, Lubbock and Dayton, for example.It got us to thinking about North Texas\u2019 history with UFO sightings. In case you aren\u2019t aware, it\u2019s neithera rare nor recent phenomenon. This is by no means a comprehensive compendium of North Texas UFO sightings, but here are some of the accounts that stuck out the most to us.UFO sightings in North Texas were all the rage back when ol\u2019 Charles Culberson served as the state\u2019s 21st governor, just 30-plus years removed from the Civil War. According to the Texas Almanac , \u201cbetween April 13 and 17, 1897, there were 38 reported sightings of \u2018airships\u2019 in 23 counties in Texas, including in Denton and Dallas Counties.\"In 2015, the published an article looking at the Dallas UFO sightings mentioned in Project Blue Book, a federal program that subjected reports of UFO sightings to certain scientific analysis. This sighting noted in Project Blue Book caught our eye.Another local example logged in Project Blue Book was intriguing to us. One man who reported a UFO sighting was indeed looking to the sky for something unique, but not for what he says he found.Did you know there\u2019s a National UFO Reporting Center? The center has a website where folks can log their sightings. This account from Denton, reprinted as it appeared, caught our attention, as we could relate to feeling more than a little perplexed at what we think we may have just seen.Look, not all UFO sightings are created equal. Not all accounts are going to get the public all riled up. But here\u2019s one from Irving from only three years ago , and it includes the term \u201c armillary sphere ,\u201d for which we give props. It's a wonderfully on-point description of what we think an alien spacecraft may look like. Plus, there\u2019s a video of it, posted to a website called Newsflare."
