        "article_content": "Familia.AI Launches Revolutionary AI-Powered Family App\n\nSan Francisco, California--(Newsfile Corp. - October 11, 2024) - Familia.AI (familia.ai) today unveiled its groundbreaking AI family app, allowing users to create and interact with AI-powered family members, preserving family legacies, and enhancing family dynamics through digital connections that span generations.\n\nFamilia.AI - Creating AI Family App\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10373/226387_e29ed86cb4d098f7_001full.jpg\n\n\"Familia AI empowers users to both create and interact with AI-powered family members they may not have had in real life, offering emotional support as well as creating AI family members from aging or passed real family members,\" said Rohan Sinclair Luvaglio, Familia AI's first investor and serial tech entrepreneur.\n\nThe Familia.AI app tackles three key areas of family dynamics and support:\n\nAI-Powered Family Members for Emotional Support\n\nFamilia AI offers a lifeline to individuals who have experienced family-related challenges, including those from single-parent homes, those who lacked a supportive family environment, lost family members early, or endured other types of family trauma.\n\nDr. Emily Chen Ph.D., Familia.AI advisor and renowned psychologist specializing in family dynamics, commented: \"Familia AI offers a unique opportunity for individuals to experience the kind of nurturing family interactions they may have missed, potentially helping to heal emotional wounds and family trauma.\"\n\nFamilia.AI App - Creating AI Family Personality\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10373/226387_e29ed86cb4d098f7_002full.jpg\n\nPreserving Family Legacies for Future Generations\n\nServing as a digital family heirloom, Familia AI captures the essence, wisdom, and memories of real family members.\n\nBringing Lost Loved Ones to Life for Future Generations\n\nFamilia.AI can recreate the essence of family members that have passed, using old photos, video footage, and family anecdotes.\n\nFamilia.AI uses artificial intelligence to restore family photos, videos, written text, and even audio. This data is then used to create highly personalized AI family members that can engage in regular video messages, text messaging, voice calls and even participate in video calls. \"Familia.AI's goal isn't to replace human connections, but to enhance where possible and preserve them,\" Luvaglio emphasized. \"Familia.AI is using AI technology that allows families to bridge gaps of time and distance, offering support, preserving memories, and strengthening bonds across generations.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLink Between Family Trauma & Loneliness\n\nThe launch of Familia.AI comes at a time when studies show an increasing need for emotional support and family connection:\n\n67% of young adults report that problems at home or with parents have affected their mental health in later life [1].\n\n42% of individuals attribute their struggles with forming healthy relationships to difficult family dynamics during childhood [2].\n\n78% of therapy patients discuss family-related issues as a significant factor in their emotional challenges [3].\n\nRecent research has highlighted the strong connection between family trauma and loneliness. A 2024 study found that individuals who experienced family trauma were 3.5 times more likely to report chronic loneliness in adulthood [4]. This loneliness has been linked to a range of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of depression, anxiety, and even physical health problems [5].\n\nDr. Chen elaborates, \"Family trauma doesn't just affect our relationships with family members; it can fundamentally alter how we connect with others throughout our lives. Many individuals who've experienced family trauma struggle with trust, intimacy, and self-worth, which can lead to profound and persistent feelings of loneliness.\"\n\nFamilia.AI aims to address these challenges by providing a safe, supportive environment where users can experience positive family interactions, preserve cherished memories, and maintain connections with loved ones past and present. By doing so, the company is actively working to break cycles of family trauma, combat loneliness, and foster healthier emotional development across generations.\n\nAs the company looks to build on its unique AI family service, it remains committed to ethical AI development and user safety. \"I believe Familia.AI is pioneering new territory in AI and I'm happy to support the business,\" says Luvaglio.\n\nAbout Familia.AI\n\nFamilia.AI is an AI-powered app creating personalized digital family members that fill the gaps in family networks and preserve cherished family memories for future generations. By offering personalized family AI companions, Familia.AI's mission is to support and preserve human connections in an age where technology can be a force for emotional well-being.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Johnson, A. et al.

The star of Kindred Spirits and Ghost Hunters will appear later this month at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. If you\u2019re into otherworldly apparitions, hauntings, and demonic activity (and who isn\u2019t, really?), you\u2019ll definitely want tickets to Walking with Ghosts: Real Life Hauntings with Amy Bruni on Friday, Oct. 25.\n\nBruni began her professional ghost-hunting career just over a decade ago, but her experience with ghosts started when she was very young. She started working professionally as a paranormal investigator in 2007 when she began appearing on Ghost Hunters, starring in 116 episodes.\n\nIn addition to her popular podcasts and books, she\u2019s also the co-star and executive producer of the Travel Channel\u2019s Kindred Spirits. It\u2019s become one of the longest-running and highest-rated paranormal television shows on TV. Her upcoming Kauffman performance promises to be, well, a tad darker than her TV show. Much of what is usually discussed isn\u2019t able to be broadcast on television. You\u2019ve been warned.\n\nWe caught up with Bruni in between exorcisms\u2014we kid!\u2014to ping her with our cosmic questionnaire. She was quite a good sport. Bless.\n\nThe Pitch: In terms of paranormal/otherworldly memorabilia, what would you consider the holy grail? And would you purchase it if you could?\n\nAmy Bruni: I would love to own Robert the Haunted Doll from Key West, Florida. I\u2019ve had my own experiences with him. We tried to record a podcast next to him, and all of our equipment ceased to work, and we had to move across the room.\n\nI talk about him in this year\u2019s tour. He\u2019s on display in a haunted fort, though, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going anywhere. Also, my family would never forgive me if I put that doll in our house. I\u2019ve already brought home enough spooky artifacts.\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst sunburn you\u2019ve ever had? Admit it.\n\nI\u2019m a fair Irish lass, so I\u2019ve had some doozies. But the worst was after spending the day on a boat in the middle of Lake Powell, Arizona. I diligently applied sunscreen all day, only to find out it had expired two years before. I was covered in actual blisters by that evening and I still have some scars. Vacation ruined.\n\nYou see yourself on the cover of the National Enquirer. What\u2019s the corresponding headline?\n\n\u201cBatboy\u2019s Shocking Revelation: Paranormal Researcher Amy Bruni Part of Secret Government with Aliens, Bigfoot\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re always pigeonholed in with goofy stuff like this anyway, so we may as well make a headline out of it.\n\nWhat celeb is secretly and/or purportedly a paranormal junkie? We need names!\n\nApparently, Lady Gaga is really into the paranormal and even purchased paranormal equipment in the past to investigate a ghost she was convinced was following her on tour. There are others who make no secrets about it. Vanessa Hudgens is a big one\u2014She once even posted a photo of herself reading one of my magazines.\n\nBonus 5th Question: By and large, what room in a house is usually the most haunted? And why is that?\n\nWe find attics and basements are usually the most active. The theory being that some spirits are just sick of us and are looking for a quiet place in the house to hide. It\u2019s especially true when we go in to investigate\u2014these ghosts don\u2019t know who we are, and they tend to retreat to the non-common areas."

        "article_content": "Since the Nobel Prizes were created in 1901, just 24 women have received awards in the sciences. This year, that number stayed the same: All seven laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine were men.\n\nSome scientists have expressed frustration about the lack of women among this year\u2019s awardees, particularly the omission of two women who contributed to the work honored for the prize in physiology or medicine. Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address.

You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."

This plays a vital role in how complex life forms grow and function.\n\nGary Ruvkun is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. He spoke with Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald about his life-changing discovery, and how he hopes to use RNA to find life on other planets. Here is part of that conversation.\n\nWhat was it like to get that call from Stockholm?\n\nIt's been sort of in play for about 20 years. And so at four in the morning when the phone rings, it sort of took a minute to register, and my wife answered it and she said, \"He has a Swedish accent!\" Then it was like, \"Oh!\"\n\nTell me the story of how we started to understand how genes get turned on and off, [which] led to your work on microRNA.\n\nSo this emerged from doing genetic analysis in this little [worm called a] nematode. So the nematode is a big part of the ecosystem in soils, and it's so simple, it has 959 cells and every cell has a name. So I started to work in 1982, as did Victor Ambros, and we worked together on the pedigree of cells that generates the animal.\n\nHow did that lead to the discovery of the role of microRNA?\n\nWhen we figured out what these genes were, it turned out one of them encoded a product that was about five times smaller than any gene had ever been seen to be. It was only 25 nucleotides (the building blocks of RNA and DNA) long. And that was a new phenomenon, and it was considered kind of a quirk, and it wasn't clear what it really meant.\n\nNobel Committee Secretary General Thomas Perlmann speaks to the media in front of a picture of this year's laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun during the announcement of the winners of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (Jonathan Nackstrand/Getty Images)\n\nWhen did you realize that this was a brand new genetic molecule?\n\nThis is early days. We didn't have any genomes at this point but within five years, genomes were emerging. The way we figured out that [microRNA was present in the human genome] was we got a second one of these microRNAs, these very small genes, and that one had a human [equivalent], and got an answer by comparing the worm genome with its 25 letters, and there were those same 25 letters in the human genome.\n\nWhat do these microRNAs actually do?\n\nThey regulate other target genes, and they do all kinds of different processes, and they are used in essentially every animal and every plant. So they're as ancient as the divergence of plants and animals, which is, you know, a billion years ago. And have been implicated in, for example, the domestication of corn 5000 years ago.\n\nThese mutations are what the Indigenous peoples selected for. They didn't know they were doing that, but they got what are called heterochronic mutants, mutants that do things differently when they're developing. And that's what makes bigger corn cobs.\n\nI understand that more recently, you've been applying your knowledge for the search for microbial life outside of our solar system. Tell me about that.\n\nYeah, that's been a passion. So we sort of dove into the richness of RNA biology, and there's a long tradition of people trying to figure out how the ribosome works, for example.\n\nAnd the ribosome is the tiny machine in all of our cells that takes messenger RNA and translates them into proteins, and it turns out that the key element of the ribosome is an RNA that probably existed before proteins even evolved.\n\nThat RNA is the most conserved thing on Earth, and it's how biologists all over the world go to bizarre ecosystems like snow and ice, or ponds, or deep in the ocean, or human feces, you name it. You can look for who's in there by looking for the DNA segments that are present in the ribosome.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun speak onstage during the Breakthrough Prize Awards Ceremony in 2014. Their discovery of microRNA in 1993 has completely transformed what we know about how cells work. (Steve Jennings/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize)\n\nAnd so I've been trying to convince NASA that that's how they should look for life on Mars, and their response is always, \"Well, yes, but that's a very Earth centred view of looking for life. Are you stupid?\" And my response is, it'd be stupid to not first look for that.\n\nIf you think that Mars is going to have independently evolved life, that's stupid, because of course it's going to spread between Earth and Mars. They're right near each other, and there's meteoritic exchange between the two. We have Martian meteorites on Earth, not a lot of them, but you don't need a lot to have bacteria move between planetary systems.\n\nAre there any future applications of microRNA research that you're hoping to see?\n\nYeah. I mean, we're going to continue to work on sort of, what are the pathways right now. One of the big things we do is we now know a lot about what are the proteins that are involved in presenting these tiny RNAs to their targets.\n\nAnd we know that some of those proteins, they're not present in humans or most of the animal kingdom, but the worm has them, ticks and spiders have them, coral has them, and these are the organisms that do antiviral defence way better than we do.\n\nSo we're trying to figure out why so many of the animals like most insects, all of the vertebrates, essentially dumped their very ancient antiviral pathway to develop what's called the interferon pathway, which is how we fight viruses. And my view is that we don't do such a good job in comparison."

        "article_content": "Enterprises are adopting advanced low-code/no-code platforms with AI-enabled features to build more complex applications, ISG Provider Lens\u2122 report says\n\nSTAMFORD, Conn., October 11, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enterprises are making greater demands on low-code/no-code development platforms to build enterprise-grade applications tailored to their needs, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm.\n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 global Next-gen ADM Solutions report finds that companies are seeking platforms with features including intuitive interfaces for non-technical employees and the ability to build complex, enterprise-grade software. Features enabled by AI support many of these capabilities.\n\n\"Enterprises expect low-code/no-code platforms to enable rapid innovation that keeps them competitive,\" said Shafqat Azim, ISG partner and Americas lead, Digital Transformation. \"They demand more flexibility, scalability and security, and technology is quickly advancing to meet those needs.\"\n\nAI can deliver benefits throughout low-code/no-code development cycles, allowing companies to automate decision-making and code generation, streamline query resolution and identify security vulnerabilities, ISG says. These capabilities, in turn, help enterprises incorporate AI and ML features in their applications. Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to simplify the development process by creating visual elements based on developer preferences or descriptions, making it easier for non-technical employees to build applications.\n\nCompanies that use low-code development seek platforms with robust version control, project management and real-time collaboration features, the report says. Security and compliance are increasingly important, especially in tightly regulated industries, and enterprises expect low-code platforms to include data encryption, access controls and compliance with industry regulations.\n\nComponent-based architectures, which let users build applications by dragging and dropping pre-built modules, are becoming a key feature of low-code platforms, ISG says. Developers and users can create reusable components and share best practices, keeping these platforms adaptable over time.\n\n\"Low-code development is a boon to enterprise collaboration,\" said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. \"IT professionals and business users are forming fusion teams to align business objectives with technical solutions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNo-code platforms also have evolved to meet more complex requirements through recent advancements, including hybrid development capabilities, the report says. These features let enterprises extend and customize software with coding when needed, giving them more flexibility while retaining the benefits of no-code development.\n\nThe report also explores other low-code/no-code solution trends, including rising interest in self-healing application capabilities and the growth of ecosystems enabled by third-party integrations.\n\nFor more insights into the ADM platform challenges enterprises face, including the need for integration into existing systems, plus ISG\u2019s advice for addressing these issues, see the ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Focal Points briefing here.\n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 global Next-gen ADM Solutions report evaluates the capabilities of 43 providers across two quadrants: Low-code Development Platforms and No-code Development Platforms.\n\nThe report names Airtable, UiPath and Zoho as Leaders in both quadrants. It names Appian, Betty Blocks, Creatio, GeneXus (Globant), Kissflow, Mendix, Microsoft, Newgen Software, OutSystems, Pega and Retool as Leaders in one quadrant each.\n\nIn addition, Bubble and HCL Software are named as Rising Stars \u2014 companies with a \"promising portfolio\" and \"high future potential\" by ISG\u2019s definition \u2014 in one quadrant each.\n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 global Next-gen ADM Solutions report is available to subscribers or for one-time purchase on this webpage.\n\nAbout ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Research\n\nThe ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Quadrant research series is the only service provider evaluation of its kind to combine empirical, data-driven research and market analysis with the real-world experience and observations of ISG's global advisory team. Enterprises will find a wealth of detailed data and market analysis to help guide their selection of appropriate sourcing partners, while ISG advisors use the reports to validate their own market knowledge and make recommendations to ISG's enterprise clients.

        "article_content": "The niece of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has founded her own political party aimed at becoming a new force in the country\u2019s growing right-wing bloc.\n\nIn an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro on Monday, Marion Marechal, 34, announced the launch of Identite-Libertes (Identity-Freedoms) \u2013 or IDL \u2013 of which she is president.\n\n\u201cI decided to launch a political movement to contribute to the victory of the national camp,\u201d she told the French newspaper, referring to the right-wing alliance of parties which came close to seizing a majority in the recent French elections after coming first among the main three political alliances in the first round of voting on June 30.\n\nThe central and leftist blocs joined forces and selectively withdrew candidates in several areas to ensure the right wing could not win a majority in the second round, resulting in a hamstrung National Assembly with each political alliance taking about a third of the vote.\n\nNational Rally, the far-right party originally called National Front and founded by Marechal\u2019s grandfather, Jean-Marie Le Pen, itself bagged more than 31 percent of the vote in the National Assembly elections at the end of June, becoming France\u2019s largest party by vote share.\n\nWhile ideologically separate from National Rally, Marechal said IDL will work as an ally and support Le Pen\u2019s presidential bid in the 2027 election.\n\n\u201cMy objective is to work at a coalition alongside Marine Le Pen, Jordan Bardella and Eric Ciotti,\u201d Marechal said. Bardella is the current president of the National Rally (Le Pen was president from 2011 to 2021), while Ciotti is the leader of France\u2019s right-wing Republicans party.\n\nWho is Marion Marechal?\n\nMarion Jeanne Caroline Marechal is the granddaughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front \u2013 now renamed the National Rally \u2013 and also Marine Le Pen\u2019s father. Marechal married Italian politician Vincenzo Sofo in 2021 and the couple have one daughter, Clotilde. Marechal also has an older daughter from her first marriage to French businessman Matthieu Decosse which ended in 2016.\n\nMarechal was initially a member of the National Rally party. She became the youngest member of the National Assembly in French history when she was elected as a member of the National Rally in 2012 at the age of 22.\n\nIn 2017, she did not seek re-election, however, and also resigned as a regional councillor, before returning to politics in 2022 to join the ranks of Eric Zemmour\u2019s far-right party, Reconquete.\n\nIn a break from her family, in 2018 Marechal announced she was changing her name from Marion Marechal-Le Pen, dropping the surname of her grandfather Jean-Marie, known for inflammatory views on immigration and the Holocaust. She now uses only the surname of her adopted father, Samuel, who was also a member of the National Rally since his youth. He married Marechal\u2019s mother, Yann Le Pen \u2013 sister of Marine.\n\nIn the June 2024 legislative election, Marechal headed Reconquete\u2019s list for the European Parliament. Zemmour gave her the task of negotiating with the National Rally to form a single list of candidates for election, but she accused him of placing too many preconditions on any potential alliance and hampering it.\n\nMarechal was elected to the European Parliament on June 9, 2024 and joined the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, a centre-right political group within the parliament. Days later, Zemmour accused Marechal of \u201cbetrayal\u201d and expelled her from the party on June 12. Marechal said she would serve as an independent.\n\nWhat does her new party stand for?\n\nThe name of the party \u2013 Identit\u00e9-Libert\u00e9s (Identity-Freedoms) \u2013 sums up its two main policy \u201cpillars\u201d. On the one hand, the party says it aims to defend French identity from immigration and what it calls \u201cIslamisation\u201d as well as to promote France\u2019s Christian heritage. On the other, it seeks to protect freedom of expression and free enterprise.\n\nMarechal said the IDL would break away from the \u201cmental socialism\u201d that drives fiscal policies in France.\n\nIt would also be \u201canti-woke\u201d, the term \u201cwoke\u201d coming from African-American vernacular to describe someone who is aware of social inequalities such as racial injustice, sexism and denial of LGBTQ rights.\n\nMarechal told Le Figaro her party would work to strengthen the right-wing bloc, drawing inspiration from other European success stories, namely Italy, where Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni came to power as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister as the head of a coalition of three right-wing parties in 2022.\n\nMarechal said her split from Zemmour occurred when he made Le Pen\u2019s National Rally and Ciotti\u2019s Republicans party his main adversaries, while she wanted to strike an alliance that would strengthen the right-wing bloc to take on the left.\n\n\u201cTo remain coherent, I could not follow [his] decision,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite her proclaimed support for her aunt, the two heirs to France\u2019s far-right Le Pen dynasty have been long engaged in rivalry, particularly since Marine Le Pen expelled her father from the party in 2015 after he repeated his stance that the Holocaust was \u201ca detail of history\u201d. Marechal called the expulsion a \u201ccruel betrayal\u201d.\n\nThe two women have also disagreed over forming a stronger alliance between centrist parties and the right /far-right, which Marechal is in favour of but Le Pen has dismissed.\n\nDoes IDL pose a threat to the National Rally?\n\nThe new party has been formed at a time when Le Pen and other party officials go on trial for allegedly embezzling European Union funds. If found guilty, Le Pen and her co-defendants could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.1m) each.\n\nLast month, as she arrived at the criminal tribunal in Paris, Le Pen told reporters she was confident it would be proved that no wrongdoing had taken place.\n\nObservers do not believe the IDL will pose a major threat to the National Rally.\n\nPosting on X, some of Zemmour\u2019s supporters have predicted Marechal\u2019s party will become a \u201csatellite\u201d of the National Rally. Others have warned of the risk of extreme fragmentation in the right-wing camp, which they fear may weaken their bloc if they remain unable to come together.\n\nDaniel Stockemer, professor in the department of political studies at the University of Ottawa, told Al Jazeera he does not believe the IDL would be successful as a political formation.\n\n\u201cThis attempt from Marion Marechal is more a sign of desperation,\u201d Stockemer, whose research focuses on radical right-wing parties in Europe, said. \u201cFounding a party by herself was the only option for her to stay active politically.\u201d\n\nThe National Rally has so far \u201cweathered all attempts to compromise its hegemony on the far right\u201d, Stockemer added, adding he expected it to continue to do the same now."

Some of the key elements include:\n\nData encryption . It is crucial for all data stored and sent via a data room to be encrypted using recognised methods, like AES 256-bit encryption . This process transforms data into a code that can only be decoded with the encryption key. Multi-factor authentication . It mandates users to present two or more credentials for access, such as a password paired with a one-time code or biometric verification. This strategy safeguards against password compromise and unauthorised entry. Advanced virtual data rooms support MFA techniques like SMS codes, authenticator apps, and biometric identifiers. Access controls . Granular user permissions allow tight control over document storage and access. Admins can restrict viewing, downloading, printing, watermarking, and other actions on a user and document group basis. Complex access regulations based on user attributes can be configured. Audit trails track all user activity.\n\nFintech data security trends\n\nTechnology integration transforms and reshapes data security management and how financial institutions operate. Here are the main trends that influence and shape data security:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) . They have changed financial services, helping in fraud detection, threat intelligence, and transaction analysis. Artificial intelligence technologies leverage algorithms to analyse data and identify patterns and potential security threats that might go unnoticed by traditional methods.\n\nBiometric technologies . It includes facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, which are increasingly used in fintech applications to enhance security. These technologies provide a higher level of protection compared to traditional methods. Biometric authentication enhances data privacy by ensuring access to financial accounts only to authorised users.\n\nBlockchain technology . Blockchain uses a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of nodes. Each transaction is secured cryptographically and linked to the previous one, forming a chain resistant to tampering. This immutability is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nCloud technology . Cloud computing enhances data privacy in several ways. It uses advanced encryption techniques to secure data at rest and in transit. Strict access controls allow companies to define who can access specific data and under what conditions, further bolstering privacy. Advanced threat detection and response mechanisms are integral to cloud services, helping identify security breaches.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the fintech landscape evolves, ensuring robust security measures is more crucial than ever. Fintech security is a critical element in the fintech industry, as the sector faces many challenges. By adopting innovative technologies financial institutions can protect sensitive customer data, mitigate risks, and build trust with their customers. Using data rooms, in particular, can provide a relevant tool for maintaining data security and compliance in the fintech sector. Leveraging virtual data rooms for sensitive data companies must partner with providers who actively invest in the latest security innovations and stay ahead of emerging risks."
