I think,\u201d he says, grinning, checking his pulse theatrically. \u201cHold on a minute\u2026 Who paid for the last round? No\u2026 I got lucky really.\u201d\n\nClassic Rock is catching up with Mogg in Brighton, where the veteran singer now lives, to discuss the apparent dissolution of his much-loved band UFO, as well as the latest repackaging of the band\u2019s sixth album, Lights Out. He also sheds light on the birth of a new solo project called Moggs Motel.\n\nIt\u2019s mid-January, and we are among the first customers to walk through the door of a pub near the railway station. For some unexplained reason we drink halves instead of pints, forgetting that doing that usually hastens consumption. Gradually the pub\u2019s early drinkers arrive. Those are gradually replaced by the lunchtime crowd. By the time we leave, following multiple exclamations of \u201cJust one more?\u201d, darkness is approaching.\n\nOn that August 2022 evening, Mogg, now 76 years old, was at home with his wife Emma, a former glamour model, when he started to feel unwell.\n\n\u201cI thought it was indigestion or heartburn. But it was quite a bit more than reflux. Emma was watching a comedy show, with a glass of wine, and I was going [mimes choking],\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s laughing at the TV, and I\u2019m realising it\u2019s serious \u2013 \u2018Hang on, I could be dying here.\u2019 So I popped to the hospital down the road.\u201d\n\nThe eventual outcome was that Mogg had two stents implanted into his coronary arteries, and doctors advised him to rest. That caused the cancellation of the final run of dates of UFO\u2019s farewell tour, Last Orders, which was scheduled to finish in Athens. \u201cIt was all a bit of a shock,\u201d he admits.\n\nResponding to the suggestion that Mogg looks after himself better these days \u2013 certainly compared with the levels of UFO\u2019s Bacchanalian heyday \u2013 he simply chuckles darkly. Doesn\u2019t he go to the gym?\n\n\u201cNot any more. I use gardening as the gym. You can do as much or as little as you want.\u201d\n\nUFO in 1974 - group portrait\n\nThe enforced cancellation of the final run of Last Orders shows suggested the end of the long road UFO had travelled for more than 50 years, and our meeting in Brighton comes a few days after the announcement of an online auction for the equipment used by the band on their US tours.\n\n\u201cBasically, all of that stuff is in storage. We may as well flog it,\u201d Mogg says.\n\nIt seems awfully final.\n\n\u201cWell, the situation was frustrating,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you commit to doing something, you should finish it, but it just wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d\n\nSo UFO are over, definitely, for good?\n\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no going back?\n\n\u201cNo. That really cool tour we did in the UK was it. For us to suddenly reappear again, the fans would say: \u2018Oi! I paid to see you on that last tour.\u2019 Some might think that a great thing. Me, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s topsy-turvy career is a tale worthy of an entire issue of Classic Rock. The line-up changes, mid-tour departures, fist fights between band members, reunions, and now belatedly blighted by funerals, often marinated in strong booze and heightened by Class-A drugs. Its plot twists would merit a soap opera were they not so implausible.\n\nRegularly in cahoots with co-founding bass player Pete Way (RIP), as the group\u2019s singular strand of consistency Londoner Mogg was right there at the heart of it all. He\u2019s been a singer, lyricist, ringleader, villain (during the 70s he punched the band\u2019s talismanic guitarist Michael Schenker, causing him to quit), bandleader (for the 1985 album Misdemeanor, Mogg rebuilt UFO from scratch), and clown (he fell off stage on at least one occasion). But now, after 56 years of all that and much more, the time has come for Phil Mogg to do something else.\n\npage divider\n\nBefore we get into that, there\u2019s the not-so-trifling matter of the new 2024 reboot of Lights Out, remastered and with the added bonus of a fabulous archive show from London\u2019s Roundhouse in 1977. Mogg is well aware of EMI\u2019s efforts to overhaul the band\u2019s catalogue.\n\n\u201cThose reissues are impressive, aren\u2019t they? It makes me think why we didn\u2019t do that [employ such a level of care] back in the day.\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cNo, I\u2019m joking. They\u2019re very nice.\u201d\n\nLike many artists, Mogg has a complicated view of the industry\u2019s quest to re-sell to the public records that they already own.\n\n\u201cThe labels are always looking for something new, and I find myself wondering who\u2019s going to buy it,\u201d he muses. \u201cIf these things come out again on vinyl, that\u2019s a selling point for me. From that perspective it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAs a curious aside, Mogg confides that he recently bought a copy of UFO\u2019s quintessential 1979 double live album Strangers In The Night from a second-hand record shop adjacent to the pub in which we sit. \u201cI didn\u2019t own an original version, so I bought one. Just to put it on the shelf, I guess, along with everything else. Everything goes into a cupboard or on to a shelf.\u201d\n\nAs the swan song of UFO\u2019s herculean first era with Schenker on guitar, Strangers still stands up as a brilliant record. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mogg says fondly, nodding. \u201cBut I tend to remember the funny bits [more than the music]. With Lights Out, making that album was a barrelful of laughs. It was a good, fun time, everybody was enjoying themselves and stuff.\u201d\n\nIncluding the supposedly \u2018difficult\u2019 Michael Schenker?\n\n\u201cYeah. He had his moments. You had to look out for them. No\u2026 I\u2019m kidding. Michael was fine.\u201d\n\nFor UFO, Lights Out and its follow-up Obsession were the best of times. With Schenker on board, having joined from the Scorpions in 1973, the band had toured heavily for Force It and No Heavy Pettin\u2019, released in 1975 and \u201976 respectively.\n\n\u201cWe also knew that either Lights Out was going to do something big for us, or it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cNo disrespect to Leo [Lyons, the former Ten Years After bass player who produced those two records], but we had to jump from where we were to somewhere else. That\u2019s when some investigation began \u2013 which producer had made the albums that we liked best. And Ron Nevison\u2019s name kept coming up.\u201d\n\nUFO onstage\n\nWith Nevison signed up as producer, UFO and their new keyboard player/second guitarist Paul Raymond set up in Air Studios at London\u2019s Oxford Circus. Having worked with The Who and Led Zeppelin, Nevison was a hard taskmaster. A real man\u2019s man. And he liked to let his charges know who was boss.\n\n\u201cOnly if you took any notice of him,\u201d Mogg says. \u201cI\u2019m sure that to most people Ron could be quite intimidating, but we had this way of subtly\u2026 sort of not letting him do that. He was right and he was the producer, but he had a knack of putting things that might rub people up the wrong way. Fortunately we all became pals. Ron made the band sound amazing. He gave us that extra push.\"\n\nLights Out was packaged in an eye-catching sleeve, shot in the bowels of London\u2019s Battersea Power Station and created by the immensely popular and acclaimed design team Hipgnosis.\n\n\u201cWho knows what was going on there,\u201d Mogg ponders, with a wave of his hand. \u201cThe idea came from them, Storm [Thorgerson] and Po [Powell]. I\u2019m not sure if they had taken a load of pictures of inside Battersea when they worked with Pink Floyd. You know, Battersea Power Station\u2026 lights\u2026 that was the connection. We lucked out working with them.\u201d\n\nLights Out became and remains UFO\u2019s highest-charting album in the USA, but Mogg rejects the suggestion that the band felt tantalisingly close to becoming The Next Big Thing.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t buy into such preconceived ideas,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe were still too busy telling ourselves: \u2018All of this is a bit good, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d\n\nRetaining Nevison, UFO went to California to make Obsession, where their great adventure continued, residing in hired luxury pads and driving rented cars.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own them,\u201d Mogg says, smiling, \u201cand years later you discover that you still owe money on them. It\u2019s a funny old world. But yeah, we enjoyed the experience to the maximum. We certainly paid for it to the maximum.\u201d\n\nHe chuckles when he recalls the group\u2019s respective choices of mode of transport.\n\n\u201cI went for the Trans Am with the eagle on the front \u2013 I took that off, I couldn\u2019t stand it. Michael got a Chevvy Stringray, and Pete went for the Camaro. Paul took over [Chrysalis labelmate] Robin Trower\u2019s Cadillac. For some reason Andy [Parker, drums] picked a Honda Civic. That still makes me laugh.\u201d On one notable occasion the band raced through Coldwater Canyon, although Mogg claims they \u201cremained just within the speed limit\u201d.\n\nPete Way and Phil Mogg (holding a tabloid newspaper)\n\nFrom the outside it looked as though UFO were English (and German) rock stars living the Californian dream.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d says Mogg. \u201cWe were working in LA, but it really didn\u2019t feel romantic in the sense you are implying.\u201d\n\nAll the same, by that point UFO had put in more than a decade of hard work and knew they were making great records. \u201cThe thought never occurred to us,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, it wasn\u2019t like that. That\u2019s not the kind of people we are. You\u2019d be somewhere on the road in America, a bit knackered from partying and in one of the most awful places, and before going on stage Pete would gather us together and in very serious tones tell us: \u2018Right, we\u2019re about to take out Poughkeepsie.\u2019 It was absurd, but that was our general attitude.\u201d\n\nThere was also an awareness that it could all come tumbling down at any given moment.\n\n\u201cAs much as we were enjoying it to the max, nobody expected things to last,\u201d Mogg affirms. \u201cThere was a bit of friction with Michael, because Way and I were just juveniles. And of course, Parker was the sensible one.\u201d\n\nWere those times the best of his life?\n\n\u201cYeah, probably. It was pretty knockout.\u201d\n\nFollowing the departure of Michael Schenker at the end of the 70s, UFO invited former Lone Star guitarist Paul Chapman back for a second run with the band. The Welshman had played with UFO from 1974-75 as part of a twin-guitar line-up alongside Schenker. With Chapman, nicknamed \u2018Tonka\u2019 for his indestructible qualities, UFO thrived, although a softening of their sound caused Way to quit following 1982\u2019s Mechanix. The rest of the decade presented tough times and mixed results, and a number of line-up changes.\n\nIn 1991, Mogg and Way put the band back together without Schenker, although along with Raymond and Parker he rejoined for Walk On Water, an excellent album, again produced by Nevison, from a frustratingly short-lived reunion.\n\nSchenker rejoined again at the turn of the millennium. But following his shamefully inebriated performance at Manchester Apollo, UFO\u2019s fortunes plummeted to an all-time low. Still, Schenker\u2019s replacement, American guitar hero Vinnie Moore, remained a part of UFO until the very end, and from 2004\u2019s You Are Here onwards they made a string of very creditable records. Sixteen years ago, Way\u2019s own well-publicised issues with addiction gave the band no option but to \u2018let him go\u2019. He never returned to the line-up. To Mogg\u2019s great sadness, Way died in 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that, robbed of the bonhomie of his long-time partner in crime, life within UFO was never the same again for the singer. He enjoyed the 100 minutes or so performing on stage each night, but the travelling wore him down. As a man of advancing age, the more undignified elements of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll circus became magnified.\n\nWith bandmates past and present now passing on, Mogg became conscious of his own mortality. In 2018, during the build-up to UFO\u2019s 50th anniversary, he announced his retirement from the road upon completion of a tour that, inevitably, became significantly extended. \u201cThis is the right time for me to quit,\u201d he said back then.\n\nMoggs Motel group portrait\n\nMogg had ventured outside of UFO for two albums with Way under the handle Mogg/Way, and even undertook a short tour for an extremely fine 2002 project named $ign Of 4. With that in mind, the end of UFO wouldn\u2019t necessarily spell the end of his career as a musician. A fresh period of activity began when Mogg bumped into Tony Newton, the bassist with Voodoo Six, and now a member of KK\u2019s Priest.\n\n\u201cWe [UFO] had toured with Voodoo Six so we got chatting,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cI told him I was looking to do something, and he replied \u2013 this is great: \u2018Well I\u2019ve got a couple of riffs.\u2019 So we got together to see what transpired. And then Steve [Harris, Iron Maiden bassist] lent us his studio.\u201d\n\nOver the following year, and partly during lockdown, the project took shape. Just like the album, the band are called Moggs Motel (no apostrophe). \u201cMotels don\u2019t have apostrophes,\u201d he insists. \u201cNot the ones I stay in, anyway.\u201d\n\nBesides him and Newton, who also co-wrote and produced the album, the line-up includes Neil Carter, UFO\u2019s second guitarist, keyboard player and occasional saxophonist, who returned to the group unexpectedly following Paul Raymond\u2019s death in 2019, plus second guitarist Tommy Gentry (Gun, The Raven Age) and former Voodoo Six drummer Joe Lazarus.\n\nInserting Moggs Motel into a one-size-fits-all category isn\u2019t easy. On the day that we meet in Brighton, Mogg doesn\u2019t even try.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played the album to a couple of people I know,\u201d he confides, before listing several of them, including his daughter and \u201cmy mate who lives around the corner\u201d who considered it \u201clovely\u201d. Ultimately, he shrugs: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s rock music?\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of symphonic rock. No. Actually, I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\nHe whips out his mobile phone and plays a couple of tracks. Sunny Side Of Heaven features Alabama 3 singer Zoe Devlin Love, while the instrumental Harry\u2019s Place is a flute-driven nod to the Dirty Harry soundtrack. Mogg hopes to play a one-off showcase-style gig for the album in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being discussed, it\u2019s just a case of finding the right venue,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve even got a new hat.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is a great name for a band. Some guests check in and some leave. Other, less savoury, characters are barred.\n\n\u201cMy motel has speciality suites,\u201d he remarks proudly. \u201cThe Frank Sinatra Suite has been left reserved. I\u2019ve given Kate [UFO\u2019s long-suffering merchandise and web lady] the Sammy Davis Jr. Suite. There are also the Dean Martin and Lauren Bacall Suites. I\u2019m thinking about a Charles Bukowski Suite. You can have that one, because it\u2019s for writers.\u201d\n\nThanks. On that note, another half?\n\n\u201cYeah, why not.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2019, with no British dates on the cards for the line-up featuring Neil Carter, Mogg invited me to attend a couple of UFO shows on the continent. Travelling on the bus, he often sat up front in the dark, watching quietly as the miles were eaten up.\n\n\u201cI call it, white-line fever,\u201d he says. \u201cI love midnight driving, just the driver and you. I like to play Tangerine Dream, Love On A Real Train. Try it, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWill all of that be hard to relinquish?\n\n\u201cNot really. I said that when I stopped having fun I wouldn\u2019t do it any more. I hadn\u2019t reached that point, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain this\u2026 Well I do, but I\u2019m not going to. UFO was wound down at the right time. I\u2019d had a birthday, the band had had a good run, it was time to go: \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019 Plus I fancied doing something else anyway.\u201d\n\nAll the same, the other members of UFO, especially Andy Parker, felt that there was still mileage in the UFO name. Could the band still make records, without touring?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he fires back instantly. \u201cAnd there are deep rooted reasons. But\u2026 definitely not.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s career has been fascinating in so many ways. If Mogg could go back and change some of the many \u2018banana-skin\u2019 moments\u2019, would he do so, and what would they be?\n\n\u201cWhen all those glamour models were banging at my door, I should have opened it and let them all in,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cBut I was strong, I said no.\u201d\n\nIs there a serious answer for that question?\n\n\u201cNo. Some things get screwed up and others are great. That\u2019s life. But I do wish we\u2019d got a fair crack of the whip.\u201d\n\nBusiness-wise, you mean?\n\n\u201cIn our youth we were gung-ho, living in the moment. If only someone had looked after us. But those people are hard to find. As far as UFO goes, we got pretty screwed.\u201d\n\nUFO have been hailed an as influence by Metallica, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains, but Mogg states: \u201cI take all of that stuff with a pinch of salt. Steve [Harris], for instance, says nice things about us. [Pearl Jam guitarist] Mike McCready wrote a charming note after we covered [McCready\u2019s 90s project] Mad Season\u2019s River Of Deceit. You half-believe it, don\u2019t you? But I always mistrust someone that says: \u2018You\u2019re fucking great\u2019.\u201d\n\nFormer band members and associates, including ex-manager John Knowles and popular tour manager Tonio Neuhaus, are no longer with us, but they are never far from Mogg\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a question to ask Pete, and then I realise he\u2019s not there to answer any more,\u201d he sighs.\n\nDuring the later years, you and Pete remained extremely close.\n\n\u201cWe had some fucking great times. I mean ridiculous times,\u201d Mogg reminisces. \u201cThose two [Way and Chapman] always made me laugh. [Mogg launches into a scarily good impression of Way]: \u201cHere, John, is there any more money left in the float?\u201d [Then just as accurately as Chapman]: \u2018Eh, I tell you what, let\u2019s get drunk like we used to.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith impeccable comic timing, Mogg says: \u201cThat bastard [Way] still owes me twenty quid.\u201d\n\nSo, if UFO are over and done, how would Mogg like his band to be remembered? \u201cI\u2019m happy that we achieved what we set out to do, and I hope people think of us in the way I remember The Animals, who I saw as a kid and it gave me goosebumps,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI know we did some dodgy gigs when we overindulged, but the good ones really took off. So if we gave some people goosebumps, for me that would be sufficient.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is available now via SPV."

        "article_content": "Scouted selects products independently. If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.\n\nMy Foreo lore runs deep. Aside from a version of the now defunct (yet iconic) Clarisonic, the OG Foreo Luna Play was my bathtub bestie in the mid-2010s. Everyone wanted either the regular size or the miniature Luna Go. This and the aforementioned Clarisonic were my first forays into exfoliation tools. What did we really know about skincare at the time? All I knew was that I had a $100+ product gliding across my skin, and I felt elite.\n\nFast forward to 2024\u2014while Clarisonic didn\u2019t stand the test of time (#RIP), Foreo has gone on to do great things. The brand is still thriving at Sephora and Nordstrom, and as a leader in beauty tech, it continues living up to its innovative origins.\n\nI\u2019d been out of my Foreo game for a minute, but when I learned the Swedish brand launched a portable, deep facial hydration tool that labeled itself as \u201can iron for your wrinkles,\u201d I knew I had to get my hands on it. I\u2019ve tried (and loved) the Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro, but hydration, specifically, is something I\u2019m always chasing. Naturally, Foreo\u2019s UFO 3 Deep Facial LED Hydration Treatment spoke to me.\n\nForeo UFO 3 Deep Facial Hydration Anti-Aging Device\n\nI\u2019ll admit, I get a bit freaked out by techy things. Anything that calls for an app download has me running for the hills. But I was intrigued by the compact size of this product, and was really taken by its promises. It claims to increase skin moisture by 126 percent in just two minutes, with greater efficacy than a sheet mask. It also says it\u2019s clinically proven to reduce the look of wrinkles in just one week. With that, I snagged myself the smart tool stat.\n\nBuy Foreo UFO 3 Deep Facial Hydration Anti-Aging Device at Foreo, $359\n\nBuy Foreo UFO 3 Deep Facial Hydration Anti-Aging Device at Revolve, $359\n\nAt $359, this bad boy comes with four unique mask types (H2Overdose Mask, Youth Junkie Mask, Manuka Honey Mask and Acai Berry Mask), and six masks per selection. Don\u2019t be fooled by the high-tech design. It\u2019s so easy to use. I downloaded the app, selected my user-friendly settings, and then began using the H2Overdose mask. I attached it to the device (as seen HERE in this video), and voila. It cuts down the time you\u2019d wear a traditional sheet mask by at least 15 minutes, and it doesn\u2019t require you to leave something balancing on your face. All I did was glide the tool along my face for a couple of minutes\u2014and with no pain or discomfort, my skin felt instantly moisturized.\n\nIt also features heating and massage options, along with LED light therapy. The biggest draws for me, in addition to spotting immediate results, are the travel-size convenience and user-friendly instruction. Consider the multifaceted tool easy enough for a beginner to enjoy, but advanced enough for an experienced skin tool user to embrace. If you think this is wild, the brand also just launched a 2-in-1 LED Scalp Massager. Does this mean I have to toss my beloved Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Scalp Massager?\n\nWith all this innovation, my 2013 self will just hope and wait for Clarisonic to make a comeback!\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nErase Eye Bags Instantly With This Lymphatic Drainage-Boosting Massager\n\nHere\u2019s How I Got My Sculpted Jawline Back Without Surgery\n\nThe LUNA 3 Facial Cleaning Brush Can Now Help Fight The Signs of Aging \u2014 And It\u2019s on Amazon Right Now\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

        "source": "VentureBeat",
        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nHugging Face has released an innovative new Python package that allows developers to create AI-powered web apps with just a few lines of code.\n\nThe tool, called \u201cOpenAI-Gradio,\u201d simplifies the process of integrating OpenAI\u2019s large language models (LLMs) into web applications, making AI more accessible to developers of all skill levels.\n\nThe release signals a major shift in how companies can leverage AI, reducing development time while maintaining powerful, scalable applications.\n\nHow developers can create web apps in minutes with OpenAI-Gradio\n\nThe OpenAI-Gradio package integrates OpenAI\u2019s API with Gradio, a popular interface tool for machine learning (ML) applications.\n\nIn just a few steps, developers can install the package, set their OpenAI API key, and launch a fully functional web app.\n\nThe simplicity of this setup allows even smaller teams with limited resources to deploy advanced AI models quickly.\n\nFor instance, after installing the package with:\n\npip install openai-gradio\n\nA developer can write:\n\nimport gradio as gr import openai_gradio gr.load( name='gpt-4-turbo', src=openai_gradio.registry, ).launch()\n\nThis small amount of code spins up a Gradio interface connected to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4-turbo model, allowing users to interact with state-of-the-art AI directly from a web app.\n\nDevelopers can also customize the interface further, adding specific input and output configurations or even embedding the app into larger projects.\n\nSimplifying AI development for businesses of all sizes\n\nHugging Face\u2019s openai-gradio package removes traditional barriers to AI development, such as managing complex backend infrastructure or dealing with model hosting.\n\nBy abstracting these challenges, the package enables businesses of all sizes to build and deploy AI-powered applications without needing large engineering teams or significant cloud infrastructure.\n\nThis shift makes AI development more accessible to a much wider range of businesses. Small and mid-sized companies, startups, and online retailers can now quickly experiment with AI-powered tools, like automated customer service systems or personalized product recommendations, without the need for complex infrastructure.\n\nWith these new tools, companies can create and launch AI projects in days instead of months.\n\nWith Hugging Face\u2019s new openai-gradio tool, developers can quickly create interactive web apps, like this one powered by the GPT-4-turbo model, allowing users to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses in real-time. (Credit: Hugging Face / Gradio)\n\nCustomizing AI interfaces with just a few lines of code\n\nOne of the standout features of openai-gradio is how easily developers can customize the interface for specific applications.\n\nBy adding a few more lines of code, they can adjust everything from the input fields to the output format, tailoring the app for tasks such as answering customer queries or generating reports.\n\nFor example, developers can modify the interface to include specific prompts and responses, adjusting everything from the input method to the format of the output.\n\nThis could involve creating a chatbot that handles customer service questions or a data analysis tool that generates insights based on user inputs.\n\nHere\u2019s an example provided by Gradio:\n\ngr.load( name='gpt-4-turbo', src=openai_gradio.registry, title='OpenAI-Gradio Integration', description=\"Chat with GPT-4-turbo model.\", examples=[\"Explain quantum gravity to a 5-year-old.\", \"How many R's are in the word Strawberry?\"] ).launch()\n\nThe flexibility of the tool allows for seamless integration into broader web-based projects or standalone applications.\n\nThe package also integrates seamlessly into larger Gradio Web UIs, enabling the use of multiple models in a single application.\n\nWhy this matters: Hugging Face\u2019s growing influence in AI development\n\nHugging Face\u2019s latest release positions the company as a key player in the AI infrastructure space. By making it easier to integrate OpenAI\u2019s models into real-world applications, Hugging Face is pushing the boundaries of what developers can achieve with minimal resources.\n\nThis move also signals a broader trend toward AI-first development, where companies can iterate more quickly and deploy cutting-edge technology into production faster than ever before.\n\nThe openai-gradio package is part of Hugging Face\u2019s broader strategy to empower developers and disrupt the traditional AI model development cycle.\n\nAs Kevin Weil, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Product Officer, mentioned during the company\u2019s recent DevDay, lowering the barriers to AI adoption is critical to accelerating its use across industries.\n\nHugging Face\u2019s package directly addresses this need by simplifying the development process while maintaining the power of OpenAI\u2019s LLMs.\n\nHugging Face\u2019s openai-gradio package makes AI development as easy as writing a few lines of code. It opens the door for businesses to quickly build and deploy AI-powered web apps, leveling the playing field for startups and enterprises alike.\n\nThe tool strips away much of the complexity that has traditionally slowed down AI adoption, offering a faster, more approachable way to harness the power of OpenAI\u2019s language models.\n\nAs more industries dive into AI, the need for scalable, cost-effective tools has never been greater. Hugging Face\u2019s solution meets this need head-on, making it possible for developers to go from prototype to production in a fraction of the time.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a small team testing the waters or a larger company scaling up, openai-gradio offers a practical, no-nonsense approach to getting AI into the hands of users. In a landscape where speed and agility are everything, if you\u2019re not building with AI now, you\u2019re already playing catch-up."

        "article_content": "San Diego is believed to be packed with paranormal prowlers all year round, from a ghostly ship crew whose love for their ship persists through death to a grizzly old beast that lurks in the woods.\n\nGrab a flashlight and creep into the spooky spirit by exploring the following reportedly haunted locations.\n\nBerkeley Steam Ferry Boat\n\nThe Berkeley Steam Ferry Boat first operated in the late 1800s on the San Francisco Bay, and played a large role in rescuing citizens in a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in 1906. Today it serves as a hub for the Maritime Museum of San Diego, housing offices, a research library and more. Multiple former passengers are believed to haunt the boat today, one of whom is miner John Norbom, who died in an onboard explosion in 1911. There have been reports of the bathroom stalls, where the explosion took place, locking themselves, and some visitors claim to have seen a ghostly figure dressed in a fedora and coat looming around the ship. Earthquake victims and others who were injured in the explosion are believed to roam the boat, evidenced by reports of mysterious slamming doors and disappearing objects. 1492 N. Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nCosmopolitan Hotel and restaurant\n\nOriginally designed as a home for cattle rancher Don Juan Bandini, the Cosmopolitan Hotel is said to have seen a few friendly apparitions. When Bandini\u2019s youngest daughter, Ysidora, leaned too far over the home\u2019s second-floor balcony railing and fell, it\u2019s believed that she was saved by Colonel Cave Johnson Couts, who caught her below. The two supposedly married soon after, but Ysidora\u2019s ghost is said to linger in room 11 of the hotel, where she once lived. There have also been sightings of an apparition of a cat roaming the hallways. Both are reported to be playful and friendly. 2660 Calhoun St., San Diego\n\nDavis-Horton House\n\nFormerly known as the William Heath Davis house, the Davis-Horton house was built in 1850, making it the oldest surviving structure in San Diego. It was once used as a makeshift hospital and much of its paranormal presence has been attributed to the fact that many died in the building. Among the numerous ghosts that have been spotted at the residence are a mysterious Victorian woman and a man wearing a World War II uniform. The home is on the National Registry of Historic Places and currently serves as the office for the Gaslamp Quarter Historical Foundation as well as the Gaslamp Museum. Tours are offered weekly. 410 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nDel Mar Fairgrounds\n\nRumors of paranormal activity at the fairgrounds have been circulating among employees for years. From magically moving furniture to strange sounds at night, many employees have reported supernatural experiences with the spirits of the fairgrounds. Former fairgrounds spokeswoman Linda Zweig decided to call on South Coast Paranormal to investigate in early 2011. The team uncovered what they believed to be \u201cvoices from the disembodied\u201d and spent five nights awake on the supposedly haunted fifth floor of the grandstand to investigate. 2260 Jimmy Durante Blvd., Del Mar\n\nEl Campo Santo Cemetery\n\nA few blocks from the Whaley House in Old Town San Diego, the El Campo Santo Cemetery has been continuously studied by paranormal experts due to the volume of supernatural reports from the area. When the city was becoming overcrowded in the 19th century, graves were relocated and many were paved over to make way for a road, disrespecting the spirits at rest below. Most paranormal reports from the cemetery include ghosts roaming the grounds, many dressed in period appropriate clothing, as well as car alarms going off and vehicles not starting when parked in front of the graveyard. 2410 San Diego Ave., San Diego\n\nElfin Forest\n\nThe Elfin Forest is home to a number of ghost stories, from the vengeful white witch who is believed to be searching for the murderer of her son and husband, to the 10-foot owl that hovers around the area. Nicole Strickland from the San Diego Paranormal Research Society said that many have reported feeling a sense of doom when passing through the area in the dark. 8833 Harmony Grove Road, Escondido\n\nHorton Grand Hotel\n\nRoom 309 of the Horton Grand Hotel has a haunting history. The room was once occupied by notorious gambler Roger Whitaker, known in the mid-1800s for his drinking and cheating habits. One night, his debts caught up with him when he was shot dead by creditors while hiding in the room\u2019s armoire. Today, the room has been reported as a site for paranormal activity, which many believe is caused by Whitaker\u2019s ghost. A female spirit belonging to Ida Bailey is also said to be present at the hotel. Bailey was the owner of a brothel that once operated right where the hotel was built, and has been reported to haunt the spot in the form of white mist or a cold chill. 311 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nHotel del Coronado\n\nThe ghost of 24-year-old \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d Kate Morgan is believed to haunt this lavish hotel. Morgan checked into the hotel on Thanksgiving Day in 1892. Five days later, she was reported to have been found dead, dressed in black with a lace shawl over her head and a gunshot wound in her right temple. Police found no sure way to identify her immediately, so Morgan was referred to as \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d by many news outlets. Today, she is said to be the hotel\u2019s resident ghost, playful but harmless. Guests and staff have reported flickering lights, electricity issues and various other oddities in the room that Morgan stayed in, and paranormal experts have been able to document this activity using infrared cameras, radiation sensors and sound detectors. 1500 Orange Ave., Coronado\n\nHunter Steakhouse\n\nPerched on a hill above the Buena Vista Lagoon, Hunter Steakhouse was built atop the old Buena Vista cemetery which is believed to have held around 50 bodies. In 1970, some of those bodies were moved to a different cemetery to allow for commercial developments, and it is said that the developer covered up bodily remains to speed up construction. Customers of the steakhouse have reported experiencing power surges, cold spots and a ghostly figure lingering near the stairs of the bar. 1221 Vista Way, Oceanside\n\nJulian Pioneer Cemetery\n\nMany Gold Rush-era ore miners were put to rest in the Julian Pioneer Cemetery in the 1870s. The cemetery was declared a California historical landmark in 1948, and has drawn paranormal experts for decades due to reports of ghostly men in 19th-century mining clothes as well as an eerie woman in a nightgown. 2811 Washington St., Julian\n\nLake Morena\n\nNamed one of \u201cthe most haunted campgrounds in the U.S.\u201d by Outside Magazine, Lake Morena is said to have supernatural energy. A San Diego Union article from 1983 titled \u201cMore than Fish Haunt Morena\u201d recounts the horrifying stories of those who had experienced strange happenings at the park, from the sound of thundering footsteps to haunting men appearing to walk on air. Today the spooky encounters have continued, with campers hearing screaming and feeling an omnipotent presence. 2550 Lake Morena Drive, Campo\n\nMt. Woodson Castle\n\nThis 27-room, 12,000-square-foot castle is believed by some to be occupied by the ghost of former owner and designer of the home Amy Strong. The castle was completed in 1921 and was listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1978. Supposedly, the sound of Strong sewing on her machine fills the night, despite the fact that she died in 1950. Some say that a worker who lost his finger while working on the home can also be heard scratching the rocks outside trying to recover the finger. While the chief financial officer of Personal Touch Dining, which now manages the castle, claims she has never seen a ghost on-site, others aren\u2019t so convinced. Speculation surrounds the Zodiac room that Strong built in the home and her increasing interest in the spiritual realm in her older days. 16302 N. Woodson Drive, Ramona\n\nOld Point Loma lighthouse\n\nOver 150 years old, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse is a beacon for ghostly encounters. Visitors have reported hearing heavy footsteps, moaning and labored breathing while exploring the space in addition to sporadic cold spots. Some believe that the spirit of former Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who landed at San Diego Bay in 1542, occupies the space. Others believe that it is the spirit of Captain Robert Decatur Israel, the lighthouse\u2019s final lightkeeper, who remains to protect his precious lighthouse. The lighthouse was shut down in 1891 and now remains part of the Cabrillo National Monument. 1800 Cabrillo Memorial Drive\n\nProctor Valley\n\nStories of the gigantic hairy beast from the Proctor Valley area date back to more than a century ago, with stories of disembodied limbs frightening some and enticing others to go out monster hunting. The monster has become a sort of legend for the community, with a local playwright penning a musical comedy show titled \u201cThe Return of the Proctor Valley Monster\u201d which has been performed locally many times. The Bonita Museum keeps a footprint on display that is believed to belong to the Proctor Valley monster. Some blame the Proctor Valley\u2019s missing cattle on the monster, while others simply chuckle at the mention of it. Proctor Valley Rd., Chula Vista\n\nRancho Buena Vista Abobe\n\nThe Rancho Buena Vista Adobe was built in 1846 and is filled with historical artifacts and architecture. Over the years it has changed ownership several times. The city of Vista purchased the property in 1989 and now operates it as a historical museum. Experts believe the Adobe to serve as a portal to connect the living and spirit worlds, thankfully one that is believed to only accept peaceful ghosts. 640 Alta Vista Drive, Vista\n\nSan Diego Bay\n\nThere have been reports of San Diego\u2019s very own sea monster lurking in the bay since 1873. The initial sighting was reported by Captain George Charlesworth, who reported a 30-foot \u201cserpent-fish\u201d that he claims drew itself out of the water and onto the sand. Charlesworth\u2019s sighting led to an Academy of Sciences meeting and several expeditions in an attempt to sight the monster, but to no avail. All that was left were markings in the mud where the creature was believed to have slithered away.\n\nStar of India\n\nThe Star of India tall ship is the world\u2019s oldest active sailing ship, having been on the sea since 1863 and making a total of 21 voyages around the world before its retirement. The ship is believed to be haunted by the spirits of those who died aboard, including young stowaway John Campbell, who died falling 100 feet from the rigging, and Army Capt. McBarnet who slit his own throat and ultimately bled to death. All sorts of paranormal activity have been reported since. The ship is part of the Maritime Museum of San Diego and is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. 1492 N Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nUSS Midway Museum\n\nThis decommissioned Navy aircraft carrier-turned-museum is said to be home to a number of ghosts. Back when the ship was still in service, many crew members believed there to be a crew of ghosts living among them, and to this day, visitors and staff have reported ghostly sightings all around the ship. The museum\u2019s curator and leader of San Diego\u2019s largest paranormal group, David Hanson, has deemed the ship as \u201cparanormally active\u201d rather than \u201chaunted\u201d due to the negative connotation that the latter holds. He believes that the crew members that linger on Midway have returned out of love for the ship and are not to be feared. 910 N Harbor Drive, San Diego midway.org\n\nVilla Montezuma Museum\n\nThis Sherman Heights mansion was named a historical site by the city of San Diego in 1970 due to its Victorian style architecture. Built in 1887, the mansion is believed to be haunted by former resident Jesse Shepard. Shepard was a writer, musician and spiritualist who only resided in Villa Montezuma for a few years, despite having the mansion specially built to include music rooms and hidden doorways. The story goes that Shepard used to host seances in the home, claiming to have communicated with the spirits of Mozart and Beethoven. He is believed to have died on a piano bench, eerily right as he finished playing a song. Witnesses say a bright and enchanting energy has been left in his wake. Today, tours of the mansion museum are available Fridays through Sundays. Chair of the friends of the Villa Montezuma Louis Torio describes the mansion as \u201cmagical\u201d and radiating a \u201cpositive energy.\u201d 1925 K St., San Diego\n\nWhaley House\n\nBuilt atop San Diego\u2019s old execution grounds, the Whaley House in Old Town was once home to an unlucky family of five. Despite being aware of the land\u2019s dark history, entrepreneur Thomas Whaley decided to proceed with the construction of his family\u2019s home in 1857, and even placed a large arch in the parlor room of the home to mark the exact spot where former Yankee thief Jim Robinson experienced a drawn out and grueling execution. The Whaley family experienced a total of five deaths during their time living in the home, including several children and Thomas\u2019 wife, Anna. The home has been said to be haunted by their spirits ever since. The home was deemed \u201cthe most haunted house in America\u201d by Life magazine. Today, the home is open to the public for self-guided daytime tours or haunted night tours. A tour guide at the home reported that a doll in the nursery room of the home is known to shift positions at night when the museum closes for the day. 2476 San Diego Ave., San Diego."

        "article_content": "Two scientists have won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their discovery of microRNA, tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it\n\nBy DANIEL NIEMANN Associated Press , MARIA CHENG Associated Press , and MIKE CORDER Associated Press\n\nSTOCKHOLM -- Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine on Monday for their discovery of microRNA, tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it.\n\nIf scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.\n\nThe work by Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun is \u201cproving to be fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function,\" according to a panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun were initially interested in genes that control the timing of different genetic developments, ensuring that cell types develop at the right time.\n\nTheir discovery ultimately \u201crevealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\u201d the panel said.\n\nRNA is best known for carrying instructions for how to make proteins from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to tiny cellular factories that actually build the proteins. MicroRNA does not make proteins, but helps to control what cells are doing, including switching on and off critical genes that make proteins.\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel for medicine went to scientists who discovered how to manipulate one of those types of RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA, now used to make vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nAmbros' and Ruvkun's revolutionary discovery was initially made in worms; they set out to identify why some kinds of cells didn't develop in two mutant strains of worms commonly used as a research model in science.\n\n\u201cTheir groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\u201d according to the citation explaining the importance of their work.\n\nThat mechanism has been at work for hundreds of millions of years and has enabled evolution of complex organisms, it said.\n\nAmbros, currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, performed the research at Harvard University. Ruvkun\u2019s research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he\u2019s a professor of genetics.\n\nThe study of microRNA has opened up approaches to treating diseases like cancer because it helps regulate how genes work in our cells, said Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London.\n\nFletcher said there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as possible indicators of diseases, by tracking microRNA levels in the body.\n\n\u201cIf we take the example of cancer, we\u2019ll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,\u201d said Fletcher. She said scientists might one day be able to use microRNA to stop such effects.\n\nEric Miska, a geneticist at Cambridge University, said the discovery by Ambros and Ruvkun came as a complete surprise, overturning what scientists had long understood about how cells work.\n\nTheir discovery of microRNA shocked many scientists, Miska said, explaining that such small bits of genetic material had never been seen before. The tiny fragments of RNA \u2014 the human genome has at least 800 \u2014 were later found to play critical roles in how our bodies develop.\n\nMiska said there is ongoing work on the role of microRNA in infectious diseases like hepatitis and that it might also be helpful in treating neurological diseases.\n\nFletcher said the most advanced studies to date are reviewing how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but no drugs have yet been approved. She predicted that might happen in the coming years, adding that most treatments at the moment target cell proteins.\n\n\u201cIf we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nThe phone call from the Nobel panel is often a surprise, but there are certain signs that recipients and their families pick up on.\n\n\u201cWell, when a phone rings at 4:30 in the morning. ... It never happens here,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\n\u201cNatasha actually answered it,\u201d Ruvkun added, referring to his wife. \u201cAnd she goes: \u2018He has a Swedish accent.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt took a little longer to rouse Ambros.\n\n\u201cSomebody called my son, who called my wife as my phone was downstairs,\u201d he said.\n\nRuvkun knew immediately the impact the award would have on his life.\n\n\u201cWell, I just kept repeating in my mind, this changes everything because you know, the Nobel is just mythic in how it transforms the life of people who are selected,\u201d Ruvkun said. \u201cThe Nobel Prize is a recognition that\u2019s sort of 100 times as much press and celebration as any other award. So, it\u2019s not part of a continuum. It\u2019s a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nGoing to pick up his award in December will be the third time he has been to a Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm after attending to watch his mentor Robert Horvitz receive the 2002 award and then his buddy Jack Szostak, who won in 2009.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trip coming up. It will be the third, possibly the best,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAmbros said he didn\u2019t expect the award as he felt that the Nobel committee has already singled out RNA in the 2006 prize that went to his friends Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.\n\n\u201cIt represents the recognition of how wonderful and unexpected discoveries come from a curiosity in basic science financed by taxpayer money. It\u2019s a vitally important, probably the most important message, that this investment really pays off,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that microRNA helps regulate gene activity, rather than carrying instructions for making proteins.\n\n___\n\nCorder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, Cheng reported from London.

        "article_content": "Why no code and process mining are the future of digital transformation\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Wichy / Shutterstock\n\nNo-code platforms have revolutionized software development by allowing users without programming skills to create applications through intuitive interfaces. These platforms democratize software creation, making it accessible to a wider audience and offering critical advantages in today's fast-paced business environment by accelerating development and reducing reliance on specialized IT resources.\n\nOriginating in the early 2000s with visual programming and rapid application development (RAD) tools, no-code platforms have evolved significantly due to technological advancements and the need for more agile software solutions. Now experiencing unprecedented growth, with Gartner predicting 65% of application development will use no-code or low-code platforms by 2024, these platforms are essential for businesses to adapt, innovate, and streamline operations.\n\nIn the midst of this rapid growth, the scope of no-code platforms has expanded beyond the field of application development. Nowadays, no-code platforms are empowering organizations to quickly document, analyze, automate, and optimize processes without requiring extensive coding expertise. This shift of scope is fundamentally altering how businesses approach digital transformation, ushering in a new era of innovation and agility.\n\nRole of no\u2013code and process mining\n\nWhile digital transformation is undoubtedly a business imperative, achieving it can be difficult. According to a report from McKinsey, 70% of digital transformation initiatives fail. Notably, these failures are often caused by a lack of tools to help inform and support data-driven decisions to continuously optimize end-to-end business processes. In this context, process mining plays a pivotal role, offering insights that inform automation and optimization strategies.\n\nProcess mining enables business teams to analyse, monitor and optimise their business processes using data extracted from systems of record. In this way, organizations gain a clear, evidence-based understanding of their processes, far beyond theoretical process models.\n\nThe synergy between process mining and no-code platforms is powerful. Together they provide deep process insights and enable the rapid implementation of process improvements, without the need for coding. Armed with this intelligence, organizations manage business processes with greater efficiency, responsiveness and agility.\n\nNo-code platforms can provide business users with access to the tools that they need to independently drive organizational change without relying heavily on IT teams.\n\nDemocratizing business transformation\n\nA decade ago, process mining was a complex task reserved for technical experts. No-code solutions have democratized process mining, allowing businesses to gain insights, access data and test changes without needing large technical support teams or specialized data scientists. This shift means that organizations can create faster, more efficient business processes, enhancing their agility and flexibility in the digital transformation journey.\n\nBusinesses using no-code platforms can explore their data, validate hypotheses and make quicker decisions. The ability to do this independently reduces potential issues, ensuring the entire team maximizes the value of their data and integrates process mining seamlessly into their operations.\n\nThe key benefits of no-code\n\nWhen planning a transition to no-code, there are four key benefits to consider: Accessibility, acceleration, integration, and cost efficiency,\n\nAccessibility: No-code platforms democratize technology. This means it is accessible to employees at all levels. This fosters a collaborative environment that unifies teams and drives innovation.\n\nAcceleration: Most businesses want to drive change with pace. No-code enables them to do this. Significantly accelerating project timelines.\n\nIntegration: Seamless integration with existing enterprise software is another major advantage. This enables business leaders to gain deeper insights through built-in connectors, without disrupting daily operations.\n\nCost reduction: No-code platforms can offer significant cost savings by reducing the need for extensive IT resources and custom development.\n\nReal-world applications\n\nNo-code is a proven, effective tool across a diverse range of industries. For example, in finance, no-code process mining tools lead an important digital transformation initiative. The adoption of no-code solutions enables the automation of customer onboarding procedures and other functions such as complaints management.\n\nThe no-code approach empowers business teams to independently review, innovate, analyze and recreate processes. This is a priceless level of efficiency that grants organizations an edge over other competitors by being able to adapt quickly, integrate changes with agility and keep the customer in mind. Organizations are also able to manage their business security needs thanks to no-code\u2019s ability to control data, within a private cloud environment, this enables them to stick to strict security and compliance standards.\n\nWill no code tools truly disrupt tech development?\n\nThe future of no-code platforms in process mining looks promising. As more organizations recognize the value, the adoption of no-code solutions continues to grow exponentially.\n\nThe no-code revolution is not just alive - it's thriving. It\u2019s changing how software is built, transforming entire businesses from the ground up. No-code process mining is empowering organisations to adapt and remain competitive in today\u2019s dynamic markets. The future belongs to those who embrace agility and innovation, and with no-code platforms at the forefront, the race to digital transformation has never been more accessible\u2014or more critical.\n\nWe've featured the best AI website builder.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

        "article_content": "Report Ocean has published a new report on the Building Information Modeling Software Market, delivering an extensive analysis of key factors such as market restraints, drivers, and opportunities. The report offers a detailed examination of industry trends and developments shaping the growth of the Building Information Modeling Software market. It also provides a comprehensive analysis and forecast of the market future performance.\n\nGlobal Building Information Modeling (BIM) Software Market is valued at approximately USD 3.96 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 19.4% over the forecast period 2024-2032.\n\nRequest To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) software facilitates the creation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of facilities, essentially enabling the development of 3D models embedded with detailed data on components such as material specifications, dimensions, and maintenance schedules. This technology spans the entire lifecycle of a building, from design and construction through to operation and maintenance, enhancing collaboration among architects, engineers, and constructors by enabling real-time sharing and updating of information. The adoption of BIM software is significantly reducing errors and conflicts during construction, allowing for the simulation of construction processes, early identification of potential issues, and optimization of project schedules and costs.\n\nThe market\u2019s expansion is driven by the escalating demand for efficient project management solutions and the increasing adoption of advanced technologies within the construction sector. As construction projects become more complex, the need for sophisticated tools that facilitate seamless collaboration, streamline workflows, and mitigate risks throughout the project lifecycle has grown. BIM software, with its comprehensive suite of capabilities including 3D modeling, visualization, simulation, and analysis, plays a critical role in modernizing construction practices and enabling informed decision-making at every project stage. However, high implementation costs and limited skilled workforce for BIM are the key factors that are substantially halting the growth of the market globally.\n\nMoreover, global regulatory bodies and governments are recognizing the potential of BIM to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of built environments. As a result, they are introducing mandates and guidelines that require or incentivize the adoption of BIM in construction projects.\n\nGet a Free Sample PDF copy of the report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\nThis regulatory push is driving demand for BIM software and encouraging widespread industry adoption, further fueling market growth. Additionally, the integration of BIM with emerging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) is enhancing its capabilities, making it an indispensable tool in the construction industry\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nThe key regions considered for the global Building Information Modeling (BIM) software market study include Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Rest of the World. North America is anticipated to play a significant role in the market\u2019s growth, owing to its robust construction industry, technological advancements, and supportive regulatory environment. The region\u2019s construction sector, characterized by large-scale infrastructure projects and innovative architectural designs, creates substantial demand for advanced project management solutions like BIM. In contrast, the Asia Pacific region\u2019s burgeoning construction industry, driven by rapid urbanization and infrastructure development, presents significant opportunities for market growth as investments in construction projects across residential, commercial, and transportation sectors continue to rise.\n\nMajor market players included in this report are:\n\n\n\nAutodesk Inc.\n\n\n\nBentley Systems, Incorporated\n\n\n\nNemetschek Group\n\n\n\nTrimble Inc.\n\n\n\nDassault Systemes SE\n\n\n\nSchneider Electric SE\n\n\n\nAsite Solutions Ltd\n\n\n\nProcore Technologies Inc.\n\n\n\nHexagon AB\n\n\n\nArchidata Inc.\n\nFor an in-depth analysis, you can refer sample copy of the report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\nThe detailed segments and sub-segments of the market are explained below:\n\n\n\nBy Type:\n\n\n\n3D BIM\n\n\n\n4D BIM\n\n\n\n5D BIM\n\n\n\n6D BIM\n\n\n\n7D BIM\n\n\n\nBy Application:\n\n\n\nDesign & Modeling\n\n\n\nConstruction Management\n\n\n\nFacility Management\n\n\n\nBuilding Energy Analysis\n\n\n\nBy Deployment:\n\n\n\nOn-Premise\n\n\n\nCloud-Based\n\n\n\nHybrid\n\n\n\nBy End-User:\n\n\n\nArchitecture, Engineering, & Construction\n\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nBy Region:\n\n\n\nNorth America\n\n\n\nU.S.\n\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\nUK\n\nGet an Exclusive Sample Copy of the Report at @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\nGermany\n\n\n\nFrance\n\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\nItaly\n\n\n\nROE\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\n\n\nRoAPAC\n\n\n\nLatin America\n\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\n\nMexico\n\n\n\nRoLA\n\n\n\nMiddle East & Africa\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\n\nRoMEA\n\nYears considered for the study are as follows:\n\n\n\nHistorical year \u2013 2022\n\n\n\nBase year \u2013 2023\n\n\n\nForecast period \u2013 2024 to 2032\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\n\nMarket Estimates & Forecast for 10 years from 2022 to 2032.\n\n\n\nAnnualized revenues and regional level analysis for each market segment.\n\n\n\nDetailed analysis of geographical landscape with Country level analysis of major regions.\n\n\n\nCompetitive landscape with information on major players in the market.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of key business strategies and recommendations on future market approach.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of competitive structure of the market.\n\n\n\nDemand side and supply side analysis of the market.\n\nBuy Now and Get a Discount of 30% @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to the Building Information Modeling Software Industry\n\nChapter 2: Executive Summary\n\nChapter 3: Dynamics of the Market\n\nChapter 4: Profiles of Leading Companies\n\nChapter 5: Competition in the Building Information Modeling Software Market among Players\n\nChapter 6: Market Size across Regions\n\nChapter 7: Application Segments in the Market\n\nChapter 8: Segment Analysis of the Building Information Modeling Software Industry\n\nChapter 9: Market Chain, Sourcing Strategies, and Downstream Buyers\n\nChapter 10: Strategies and Key Policies by Distributors/Suppliers/Traders\n\nChapter 11: In-depth Analysis of Key Marketing Strategies by Market Vendors\n\nChapter 12: Evaluation of Market Impact Factors\n\nChapter 13: Forecasted Building Information Modeling Software Market Size (2024-2032)\n\nKey Questions Addressed in the Market Report:\n\nWhat are the consumer buying behaviors and preferences within the market?\n\nWhat are the essential success factors and considerations for entering or expanding within the market?\n\nWhat potential risks and challenges do market participants face?\n\nWhat investment opportunities exist, and what are the expected returns?\n\nHow is the market segmented, and how should target markets be identified?\n\nWhat marketing and advertising strategies are employed by successful market players?\n\nWhat are the barriers to market entry and the level of competitive intensity?\n\nWhat are the forecasts and projections for the market\u2019s future?\n\nWhat strategies are recommended for market participants to achieve success?\n\nAccess Full Report Description, TOC, Table of Figure, Chart, etc. @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\n(*Note: The report\u2019s historical data and future projections can be customized based on client needs.
