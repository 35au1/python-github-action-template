            "source": "The Verge",
            "article_content": "A lot of AI tools promise something like magic. Just write down all the stuff you need to do, or better yet, just let the tool record every second of your life, and presto manifesto, it\u2019ll do\u2026 something. Buy plane tickets, maybe, or magically reorder your calendar to maximize your flow state. The idea is huge and enticing, that you could just live your life and your AI assistant will make everything happen on your behalf. But hardly any of it works.\n\nThe developers of the app Twos are taking a much more cautious and, as a result, much more actually useful approach. Twos is an app for taking notes, managing to-dos, and generally making lists of any and every kind \u2014 Parker Klein, the app\u2019s creator, just calls it \u201ca place to write things down.\u201d Klein has been working on the app for nearly a decade, first as a tool just for himself and most recently as a true startup. I\u2019ve been using Twos off and on for a couple of years, and there\u2019s a lot to like about the app.\n\nThe Twos AI approach, which Klein and cofounder Joe Steilberg call \u201csmart suggestions,\u201d is to use AI to help you simply take the first step in getting something done. If you write down the name of a movie, Twos might offer you a link to a JustWatch search or the IMDb page for that movie. If you write a person\u2019s name and phone number, it can add them to your contacts with one tap. If you\u2019re making a grocery list, it\u2019ll send you to Amazon or Walmart or Instacart to buy it.\n\nThe logic behind all these suggestions is really simple: Twos looks for certain words and phrases to determine what you\u2019re trying to do and which integration makes the most sense. (You can pick and choose, too \u2014 I never use Uber Eats, for instance, so I turned that off entirely.) All the smart suggestions really do is take the first step. They\u2019re definitely not perfect \u2014 when I type \u201cbake blueberry muffins,\u201d it offers me an Allrecipes link, which is helpful and relevant, and a Google Maps search for \u201cblueberry muffins around me,\u201d which is not. But even in the feature\u2019s early days, I\u2019ve found it way more useful than almost every other, vastly more ambitious productivity tool.\n\nLike any to-do list app worth its valuation, Twos now has an AI chatbot. Image: Twos\n\nTwos also has a built-in chatbot, which you can use to ask questions about your notes. If you use your note-taking app like a journal, this can be really cool \u2014 \u201cwhat was the name of that Thai food place we went to a few weeks ago?\u201d is a surprisingly common question in my life. Lots of apps have something like this, and they all suffer from the same problem: if you don\u2019t put everything in the app, the search isn\u2019t that useful. But whether it\u2019s Notion or Dropbox or Twos, the AI integrations reward the heaviest users.\n\nAI turns Twos into not just my to-do list but the jumping-off point for all my tasks. Since the app works across platforms \u2014 it\u2019s fundamentally a web app, but there are versions for Android and iOS, Windows and Mac, and more \u2014 it\u2019s easy to just dump information into. Then, when it\u2019s time to leave for the restaurant I wrote down and promptly forgot the name of, I open Twos, tap the sparkles that appear next to any item with a smart suggestion, and it opens Google Maps and directs me there. You can store and organize things inside of Twos, but I find myself using it transiently, just for the small things in day-to-day life. I need to make bread: click the sparkles, bread recipes appear. Remember to buy those Sesame Street bath toys for the kid: click the sparkles, Amazon search done. Ollie\u2019s birthday is December 7th: click the sparkles, in my contacts.\n\nFor now, the Twos smart suggestions are only available in beta testing, and there\u2019s a waitlist for new users. (Though Klein did tell me that if you sign up and use the code \u201cVerge,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to skip the line.) Klein and Steilberg are working on more integrations and more ways to do even more with just a few words of your writing. They\u2019re obviously enticed by how far this might go. Why not automatically buy the toys or start the grocery delivery and take a cut for themselves? It\u2019s an age-old idea, that one. Any.do tried it years ago; there was even a frenzy of apps like Magic that would do it all via text message. Even the Alexa business model used to depend on you being willing to just shout \u201cbuy toilet paper\u201d at your speaker and trust it to do the rest.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the idea: it doesn\u2019t work. There are too many logistical questions, too many ways to screw it up, and too many consequences for getting it wrong that it\u2019s not going to work anytime soon. If ever."

In a slick demo video, the company showed the OS running on a car\u2019s entertainment system, a smart speaker, a TV, and an Android phone.\n\nIn many ways, CosmOS hints at what Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple\u2019s Siri could become if/when they are combined with AI agent-like capabilities. It\u2019s a voice assistant that can understand complex queries and interact with other apps and services on your behalf.\n\nHumane says that CosmOS is based on the operating system that powers its Ai Pin. \u201cThis intelligent conductor seamlessly coordinates various AI models, datasets, services, and device capabilities to deliver a fluid, intuitive experience,\u201d the company said in the video.\n\nIn its first example, the person in the video talks to CosmOS in their car and asks the assistant to turn up the heat at home. In the same query, they also want to know when people are coming over tonight.\n\nWe\u2019re also instantly reminded that Humane is once again pitching a vision more than a product: The logo on the steering wheel is blurred out and there\u2019s a note saying it\u2019s \u201cfor illustration purposes only. Does not reflect available car functionality.\u201d\n\nOther use-case examples in the video include asking for takeout restaurant recommendations, asking for a recipe that the user already checked the day before, and asking a question about a sports game. The smart speaker used in the video is also blurred out.\n\nOn the TV, Humane is pitching a multimodal and multi-step use case. For instance, you could ask how many goals a soccer player has scored this season. The AI assistant is supposed to understand who you are talking about based on the player on the screen and then answer your original question.\n\nAs for the smartphone integration, the demo reminds me of Apple\u2019s pitch for a better Siri powered by Apple Intelligence at WWDC earlier this year. In Humane\u2019s case, CosmOS understand what\u2019s on your screen and can interact with your calendar in the background.\n\nHumane claims that third-party developers will be able to build integrations between CosmOS and their \u201cagents, data, and services.\u201d In reality, the demo video feels more like a sales pitch \u2014 to see if there\u2019s any company out there that would be interested in acquiring Humane and repurposing Humane\u2019s software in their own products.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

The house, a 3,100 square foot farmhouse and eight-acre property, was made famous by the movie series that began in 2013. Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nThe subject of the box office hit \"The Conjuring,\" a house in Harrisville, R.I. (a village in the town of Burrillville) that came to be known as \"The Conjuring House\" has been ordered to close. Known for its alleged paranormal happenings, the house drew in paranormal investigators and fans who sought to stay over at the \"haunted\" attraction.\n\nOn Nov. 18, the renewal of the house's annual entertainment license was declined via a vote by the Burrillville Town Council, with Town Manager Michael C. Wood pointing out issues with insurance, police and the fire marshal as reasons why the renewal of the house's license should be declined.\n\n\"Quite frankly, there's too many problems on the site,\" Wood said in a video of the Nov. 18 meeting. \"It's unfortunate because it was a great business for the town in the past.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDuring the meeting, it was determined by the Town Council that the house's entertainment license would cease at the end of November.\n\nIssues became prevalent a few weeks earlier when the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training issued a stop work order after it was discovered that the business had been operating without workers' compensation insurance coverage since May 2024, according to the Providence Journal. The stop work order was lifted in mid-November when the necessary insurance was obtained.\n\nBoston Globe reporter Amanda Milkovits and her sister Susanne Carpenter, and colleague John Huntington, Paranormal Investigator in the house's \"dairy room\" in the cellar at the \"Conjuring\" house in Harrisville, RI on Oct. 14, 2020.

Nun\u0303ez's charge will be addressed at a pretrial conference on Dec. 17, according to the Providence Journal.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nNun\u0303ez purchased the house in 2022 for $1.5 million \u2014 a 3,000 square-foot property located on eight acres of land that boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The house is open to the public for house tours and investigations for paranormal researchers. \"The Conjuring House\" also offers overnight stays and a \"GHamping experience\" which allows guests to camp outside while exploring the house at night.\n\nIn the 1970's, paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren made multiple visits to the small house in Harrisville to investigate what was believed to be a \"haunting.\" The couple traveled from Connecticut to investigate reports of levitating furniture and smells of rotting flesh, according to the New England Society of for Psychic Research (NESPR), an organization founded by the Warrens.\n\nThe events surrounding the Warrens' investigation into the house were cemented in film history with the 2013 movie \"The Conjuring.\" The popularity of the movie led to the \"Conjuring Universe\" of movies, which have collectively grossed more than $2 billion globally at the box office.\n\nTony Spera, co-director of NESPR and the son-in-law of the Warrens, said that he believes there is still much left to uncover behind the \"haunting\" of the \"Conjuring\" house.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"Annabelle\" doll in the house's living room at the \"Conjuring\" house in Harrisville, RI on Oct. 14, 2020. Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\n\"Much can be learned from paranormal research, in trying to pierce the veil between our world and the paranormal realm,\" Spera said via Messenger. \"We have just scratched the surface with respect to understanding spirit entities and why they sometimes haunt specific locations.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with WPRI, Nu\u00f1ez said she is not shutting down in December so that she can accommodate guests who have made reservations for this month. However, new tours are not being booked. Nu\u00f1ez said she will attempt to get the business license back, but if that fails, she will not sell the house.\n\n\"There are people that want me to sell. I\u2019m never selling,\" Nu\u00f1ez told WPRI. \"If I don\u2019t run a business, I still have a great house.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAccording to the Burrillville town ordinances, an entertainment license can be revoked \"for violation of any requirement of this article.\" The punishment for violations to the town ordinances, according to Sec. 1-6 of the ordinances, can include a fine of up to $500, up to 30 days of imprisonment, pay a restitution of up to $2,500 or 10 days of community service."

            "article_content": "I love a good show about teenagers fighting supernatural entities while also facing the mortifying ordeal of being a high school student. So Netflix\u2019s Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld, which not only sees a superpowered teenage girl battle demons but also draws from Chinese mythology, seems like it was created in a lab just for me. From the first trailer, I had high expectations. With bright, bold colors and character designs, compelling character relationships, and some very funky monsters and action sequences, it really checked all my boxes.\n\nBut there\u2019s one specific scene that I can\u2019t stop thinking about, because it so perfectly exemplifies the tone of this show and why it works so well.\n\n[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld.]\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld kicks off when 16-year-old Jentry (Ali Wong) learns that a demon is after her for the powers she\u2019s suppressed for most of her life. She must return to her hometown in Texas with her great-aunt Gugu (Lori Tan Chinn) in order to close a portal to the underworld and prevent more monsters from wreaking havoc in the world. All the while, she tries to fit in with her new (old?) classmates and slowly learns more about her own past and Gugu\u2019s refusal to reveal more about her parents.\n\nAbout halfway through the show, Jentry discovers that Kit (Woosung Kim), the new boy at school with big, dreamy eyes, is actually a Painted Skin demon from Chinese mythology. This means that he\u2019s actually a long-limbed shadowy demon who must construct elaborate disguises out of human skin to conceal his true form. Jentry is initially hurt by this revelation, but she eventually seeks his help to create a skin form in her image for a heist.\n\nCue a montage where the two of them carefully sew together a Jentry skin in Kit\u2019s dimly lit workshop while a soft romantic song plays. Kit cuts into a roll of flesh so that it best replicates Jentry\u2019s body, and gently tilts her face up so he can measure her chin. Jentry is mildly disgusted when Kit rifles through a bin of body parts and asks him to warn her when he picks the eyes, to which he replies he already knows the exact match for her eyes, because he\u2019s imagined them so often \u2014 and Jentry blushes.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt\u2019s a bit gross. It\u2019s incredibly intimate. It\u2019s uncanny, yet super romantic. It\u2019s adorably reminiscent of a budding high school romance, and also like something out of The Silence of the Lambs. But it\u2019s emblematic of how showrunner Echo Wu has marvelously leaned into the wonderfully weird, both with the paranormal elements and the more grounded stakes.\n\nThe show leans pretty hard on the more terrifying aspects of Chinese mythology, like a trip to Diyu, the Daoist version of hell, where souls are tortured for eons. The bright colors and cartoonish character designs keep the show firmly planted in PG territory, but it does get a bit freaky, in a good way. At one point, for instance, the house ghosts need to generate some more ectoplasm, so one of them volunteers to be brutally maimed \u2014 off screen, but with some screaming \u2014 in order to generate just a splash of magical ghost fluid. And even with those darker elements, the tone never gets too dire, and a lot of the fun comes from the weird situations and paranormal entities that Jentry and her friends encounter.\n\nAnd because Wu is tapping into a cultural mythos that American animation hasn\u2019t fully explored, none of the supernatural plotlines feel overdone (do we really need another broody vampire when we can have a Painted Skin demon?). American cartoons have long flirted with Chinese mythology, without actually delivering. American Dragon: Jake Long and The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, two animated shows that aired in the mid-2000s, also featured a young Chinese American protagonist guided by an elderly relative to battle monsters \u2014 but both shows primarily prioritized Western mythology, only incidentally pulling in Chinese legends. Jentry Chau does the reverse: By default, everything Jentry encounters is from Chinese mythology, mixing in other cultural perspectives without assuming that the default is Western. It\u2019s a unique lens, and one that really lets the show shine and avoid any trite cliches.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld. Ali Wong as Jentry in Jentry Chau vs the Underworld. Cr. COURTESY OF NETFLIX \u00a9 2024 Image: Netflix\n\nBut even with the fun paranormal side, Wu never loses sight of the show\u2019s more realistic threads. At the end of the day, Jentry is a teenage girl who just wants to be normal. Her relationships with her friends, her secretive great-aunt, and her own self might be colored by the paranormal, but they all feel very rooted in realism. The scene with Kit works so well because even though it\u2019s a demon making a skin costume, it\u2019s also about teenage crushes and complicated feelings (and the fact that those complicated feelings stem from your crush actually being a demonic creature). Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld certainly isn\u2019t the only high school supernatural romp out there, but Wu takes care to balance the fantastical elements with the real ones.\n\nStill, the show works so well because Wu isn\u2019t afraid to get weird. As both a coming-of-age story and a supernatural show, Jentry Chau could easily fall into some cliched genre pitfalls. But Wu doesn\u2019t let that happen, simply by embracing the funkier beats and really letting them sing. It\u2019s in the little details in the background, like Jentry\u2019s Lisa Frank leopard poster and Gugu\u2019s crocs. And it\u2019s also in the bigger scenes, like that romantic moment between Jentry and Kit, set against the sewing of a flesh suit. Now that\u2019s something special \u2014 and the whole show is a special, weird gem that sparkles with neon intensity.\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld is available to stream on Netflix now."

There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.\u201d\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren\u2019t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can\u2019t do that, says Bryk: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.\u201d\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn\u2019t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it\u2019s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user\u2019s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven\u2019t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today\u2019s AI search engines as a sandwich with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nMore than keywords\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here\u2019s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users\u2019 queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nA screenshot of Websets showing results for the search: \"companies; startups; US-based; healthcare focus; technical co-founder\"\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa\u2019s search engine predicts the next link. Type \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa\u2019s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That\u2019s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn\u2019t see this as a problem: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embed the whole web to be useful,\u201d he says. (Fun fact: \u201cexa\u201d means a 1 followed by 18 0s and \u201cgoogol\u201d means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)"

            "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nOpenWeb's board ousted the company's founder and CEO, Nadav Shoval, earlier this year.\n\nIn his first interview since his removal, Shoval said his situation is a cautionary tale for other founders.\n\nA legal battle between Shoval and OpenWeb is ongoing in an Israeli court.\n\nNadav Shoval says the conflict that culminated in his dramatic ouster from OpenWeb, the company he cofounded, started with a disagreement over a potential BlackRock investment.\n\nIn his first interview since his removal as CEO, which is still playing out in court, Shoval told Business Insider that tensions with OpenWeb's board bubbled up when the company received \"several term sheets\" for further investment in mid-2024, including an offer from BlackRock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenWeb, which provides tech to publishers to help manage the comment sections of their sites, create newsletters, and sell advertising, had previously raised $392 million and was last valued at $1.5 billion.\n\nShoval said BlackRock's capital infusion would have been a \"game changer,\" allowing the company to make its fourth acquisition and advance toward an initial public offering. But it hit a roadblock.\n\n\"We brought in some of the best bankers in the world to support the process, and everybody was very excited until we started to see that one of the board members, specifically, one of the funds, was really pushing against taking this money,\" Shoval said, without naming the fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo people familiar with the discussions said some board members had concerns about the conditions tied to BlackRock's proposed investment. They asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations. Their identities are known to BI.\n\nBlackRock declined to comment.\n\nOpenWeb's big-name investors include Insight Partners and Georgian Partners, among others. It has also attracted investments from Samsung's Next investment group, The New York Times, and the famed NYU Stern professor and podcaster Scott Galloway, who sits on the company's board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoval's relationship with his board of directors went rapidly downhill from there \u2014 and was thrust into public view.\n\nShoval's messy battle with the board goes public\n\nTensions boiled over in mid-2024 when OpenWeb's board changed Shoval's reporting line, a move he felt breached his contract. He sent an ultimatum to reverse the change to the board, which responded by firing him.\n\nThen the company announced to staffers that Shoval would be replaced with an interim CEO, OpenWeb's former chairman Tim Harvey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoval went on a rampage.\n\nCut off from his business accounts, he used his personal Gmail to send a companywide email saying that he refused to step down.\n\nHe also took to LinkedIn, writing: \"I do not accept these actions. I will continue to fight for OpenWeb's mission and purpose alongside our team.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoval made his dispute with the OpenWeb board public by posting on LinkedIn in October. Screenshot from LinkedIn\n\nTwo former colleagues of Shoval and four people who have worked closely with him described him as a force of nature who is extremely passionate about the publishing industry. They said he could also be hotheaded and sometimes lacked the willingness to listen to others, including the board. They declined to be named to protect business relationships. Their identities are known to BI.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn October, Shoval sued OpenWeb and many of its board members in a Tel Aviv court, alleging he had been the victim of an illegal boardroom coup enacted so investors could seize control of the company. His complaint argued that he should be reinstated as CEO and able to appoint two new board directors of his choosing.\n\nThe litigation is ongoing, and OpenWeb is seeking to have the case dismissed. BI has reviewed copies of some of the related court filings, translated from Hebrew to English.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn denying Shoval's claim for a temporary injunction against his firing, Ariel Zimmerman, the Tel Aviv judge presiding over that case, said the chances of Shoval succeeding in his claim for reinstatement as CEO \"do not appear promising, to say the least.\"\n\nIn response to Shoval's suit, OpenWeb said in court filings that the case was a classic situation in which the board of directors had lost confidence in its CEO. OpenWeb said Shoval was trying to extract money that was not owed to him and that he had chosen to give up control of the company when he brought in investors.\n\nIn a statement to BI, a spokesperson for OpenWeb said the company was excited about the steps it had taken to set it up for long-term success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The company is moving forward without distractions, fully committed to the success of our employees, partners, and the broader community we serve,\" the OpenWeb statement said.\n\nShoval told BI he is optimistic that \"justice will come\" as he continues his legal fight. He said he hoped his story would serve as a lesson to other founders to vet the funds and directors they work with closely.\n\n\"No one wants to see the behind-the-scenes of restaurants,\" Shoval said. \"This is what I feel like I've seen about the VC industry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoval's path to the New York startup scene\n\nShoval said he's used to defying the odds.\n\nHe often describes how he came close to death when he was 2 years old from Kawasaki disease, a rare condition that causes swelling of the blood vessels and can lead to heart problems.\n\nShoval said the disease affected his motor skills, making it difficult to write. He later struggled with dyslexia and didn't finish high school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter serving in the Israel Defense Forces' elite Maglan commando unit \u2014 famed for going behind enemy lines \u2014 he moved to New York City in 2012 at the age of 21. There he cofounded OpenWeb, then known as Spot.IM, alongside two other cofounders who have since left the company.\n\nOpenWeb was founded in 2012 under the name Spot.IM. Shoval is pictured left. Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nShoval said he had noticed that publishers and content creators were \"under massive threat\" from Big Tech companies that wouldn't compensate them for their content.\n\nThe startup sought to build tech to keep people more engaged on publishers' websites. It began with the comment section, providing community management tools and analytics to help make online conversations less toxic. It later acquired three other companies to help publishers in other areas, like advertising and newsletter building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenWeb grew to more than 370 employees and says it reaches more than 150 million active monthly users across sites like Fox News, CNN, and Yahoo.\n\nThrough secondary transactions, as OpenWeb raised more capital, Shoval diluted his stake in the company leaving him with less than 2% of issued shares and a remaining 5% in unvested options, per OpenWeb's legal filings.\n\nThe sales, which OpenWeb calculated earned Shoval tens of millions of dollars, resulted in him ceding his control of the company to its investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe board calls Shoval's bluff\n\nShoval said in legal filings that OpenWeb's sudden decision in mid-2024 to change his reporting line was an illegal move that hindered his management capabilities and diminished his role. The board had decided he would start reporting to a newly appointed temporary executive chairman, Omer Cygler, the managing partner of its investor Lion Investments. Shoval had previously reported to the entire board.\n\nFurious, he sent a letter in September to the board demanding it reverse the decision.\n\nOpenWeb's legal filing said Shoval's letter had also set out \"excessive and baseless financial demands\" amounting to tens of millions of dollars in exchange for his continued appointment as its chief executive. In an attachment to his letter, Shoval had mapped out a scenario where he would resign as CEO and help with the search for a replacement until summer 2025, on the condition that the investors bought his shares and accelerated the vesting of his options.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe board called his bluff.\n\nBoard members convened an urgent telephone meeting in which the directors who attended, including those appointed by Shoval himself \u2014 Galloway and Cygler \u2014 unanimously voted for his dismissal.\n\nScott Galloway, pictured with podcast cohost Kara Swisher, invested in OpenWeb in 2021. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nIn the statement to BI, OpenWeb said: \"OpenWeb is laser-focused on continued growth and advancing our mission to foster healthier online discourse \u2014 creating a web that is safe for users, profitable for publishers, and fair for advertisers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoval says his ousting is a cautionary tale for other startup founders\n\nLooking forward, Shoval told BI he remains committed to fixing toxicity in online discourse and promoting independent journalism.\n\nShoval didn't start the company \"for a small secondary,\" he said, referring to money he might have taken off the table were the company to raise a further investment round. \"It's not a nonprofit, I'm here also for everybody to make money, but it's not the only reason why I started the business. I'm an extremely mission-driven person. I love what we do.\"\n\nShoval speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco in 2019. Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nShoval maintains that OpenWeb board meetings and decisions were conducted improperly and that he still has the right to appoint two new board directors of his choosing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoval said that he wants to impart a lesson to other founders: That there can be some occasions in startups when \"there is inherent conflict between the fund and the founder.\"\n\nAfter the huge investment boom of 2021 amid a stock market rally and low interest rates, many startup valuations plunged in the following years, and IPO and M&A activity dramatically slowed.\n\n\"When those funds are successful, they act like a cheerleader,\" Shoval said. \"They agree with you. They follow your strategy. As soon as market conditions change \u2014 and it really, really changed \u2014 some of those people change.\""

            "article_content": "I\u2019ve been a keyboard nut for a long time. I build mechanical keyboards on my own, soldering iron and all. And I love the excessive way you can customize them, with wireless or wooden keycaps, or all sorts of crazy stuff. But there\u2019s a trend I\u2019ve spotted lately that I cannot abide: Sticking a screen on a keyboard. Stop it, get some help.\n\nRazer. Asus. SteelSeries. Even the budget brands on Amazon are hopping on the trend, and they all seem to be using teeny tiny screens from the same two or three suppliers. I can see this spreading and I want it to stop. It is the epitome of form over function, trend-chasing nonsense. And I say this as someone who can justify buying a keyboard that costs more than a car payment.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to look at your keyboard\n\nHere\u2019s a surprising fact about PCWorld\u2019s resident keyboard expert: I\u2019m terrible at typing. I flunked my typing class in middle school, and I just used hunt-and-peck all through college. It wasn\u2019t until I became a professional writer and started typing for eight to twelve hours a day that I learned to touch type.\n\nAnd \u201clearned\u201d is a generous word in this context. What happened was that my horrible hunt-and-peck technique gradually morphed into touch typing as my muscle memory grew. I can get about 80 words per minute \u2014 very slow, by professional standards \u2014 but it\u2019s horrible form. I use my left hand for about 75 percent of the actions on the keyboard. My grandmother, who was an office assistant back when \u201celectronic typewriters\u201d were the new hotness, could put me to shame.\n\n\n\nMichael Crider/Foundry\n\nBut here\u2019s my point. As horrible as my typing actually is in technical terms, I never actually need to look at my keyboard. Even when I\u2019m using tricky gaming macros or adapting to a new keyboard every other week for review purposes, I\u2019m looking at my screen. Because that\u2019s how you use a computer. That\u2019s how a computer works!\n\nHell, it\u2019s how you use pretty much anything with an interface \u2014 I\u2019m betting that you rarely look at the virtual keyboard on your phone unless you\u2019re doing something like putting in a GIF or hunting for the pound sign. Even if you\u2019re still hunting and pecking to type (no shame, you are seen and you are valid!), you\u2019re looking at the keys, not whatever\u2019s above them.\n\nI feel like this isn\u2019t a very complicated concept, but for some reason I have to repeat and emphasize it.\n\nWhat about gaming?\n\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that keyboards have become complex enough that you need a little more information about what they\u2019re doing, especially for gaming keyboards with complex mechanisms like adjustable actuation. But even as someone who\u2019s repeatedly used these keyboards, I find that a tiny screen next to the keyboard just isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nTake Razer, for example. Razer\u2019s most complex keyboards are the Huntsman line, which uses optical sensors to determine how hard you press each key and adjust the input to your game accordingly. And this can get extremely complicated. We\u2019re talking increments of one tenth of a millimeter, two or three or four functions per key, to say nothing of the controversial Snap Tap.\n\nAnd yet, the Huntsman didn\u2019t get Razer\u2019s first screen. The BlackWidow V4 Pro 75 percent did \u2014 and while that keyboard can do a lot of cool things, true adjustable actuation isn\u2019t one of them. The BlackWidow is Razer\u2019s play for the high-end, customizable, mechanical keyboard enthusiast crowd. The Huntsman, more complex and technically better suited for gamers, does without an individual screen.\n\nThis Razer Huntsman\u2019s keys are more mechanically complex than the BlackWidow\u2019s, and it still doesn\u2019t need a screen to show you its actuation settings. Michael Crider/IDG\n\nAnd again, it doesn\u2019t need it. The Huntsman\u2019s LED indicators can communicate its settings to the user clearly. If that doesn\u2019t work for you, Razer has its Synapse software, which is a must-have for pretty much any advanced setting on the keyboard anyway. You can see it in both notification and full-fat interface form on your screen.\n\nYou know, the screen you\u2019re looking at while you\u2019re gaming. Or typing. Or doing almost literally everything on your computer aside from taking it apart.\n\nI could list similar examples from all the brands that are sticking little screens on their keyboards. (This SteelSeries can show you the battery remaining with its LEDs, again, undercutting the need for a dedicated display!) But suffice it to say, this is completely unnecessary, unless you find a lot of value in a looping GIF right above your keys. This is basically just one more thing to add a screen onto, like your RAM or your CPU cooler.\n\nPressing Fn+ B will show the battery percentage with green lights on the number bar. Which is really cool\u2026and makes the OLED screen pretty much completely useless to me. Michael Crider/Foundry\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to take my word for it, because I can show you the receipts.\n\nIt\u2019s been tried before\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that there\u2019s been a trend of sticking screens on keyboards. In the early 2000s (boy it feels weird to say that), multiple keyboard brands tried it, including Logitech and Razer. LCD screens had become cheap and ubiquitous enough that it was a new and exciting possibility.\n\nThis 15-year-old Logitech gaming keyboard had a screen. It wasn\u2019t very useful then, either. Logitech\n\nThey eventually dropped these designs. Precisely why, I don\u2019t know\u2026 but I\u2019d hazard a guess that they didn\u2019t appeal to users because there wasn\u2019t any added utility, and they added unnecessary expense and complications to keyboards. Which is exactly what they\u2019re doing now.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to restrict the scope to keyboards to see this happening again and again. Apple added a little horizontal touchscreen to its MacBook Pro laptops starting in 2016. If you look for the keyboard screen on the latest Arm-powered MacBooks, you won\u2019t find it, because they were dropped from the final model last year.\n\nEven Apple gave up on this idea, and it\u2019s still putting charging ports on the bottom of its mice. Apple\n\nWhen Apple sinks millions of dollars into a design and decides it\u2019s not a good idea, it might just be worth paying attention.\n\nA couple of exceptions\n\nAlright, I\u2019ve been indulging my inner Dvorak curmudgeon for a thousand words or so. But I\u2019m nerdy enough to admit that there are exceptions to every rule. Not every single possible combination of a keyboard and a screen (or should I say an additional screen) is a bad idea.\n\nElgato/Corsair\n\nThere are extensions of the standard computer interface that greatly benefit from a little extra data, most notably in things like Elgato\u2019s Stream Deck and similar devices. That\u2019s less of a secondary screen than an extension of programmable buttons, but the Stream Deck+ adds in a screen as well.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not showing you any information that couldn\u2019t be communicated on your monitor or laptop display. But the context and spatial closeness to relevant controls makes it more immediate if you\u2019re doing advanced media stuff. It makes sense.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen keyboards that go all-in on the display as decoration, like this one. That\u2019s more \u201cbling\u201d than utility, and while it doesn\u2019t appeal to me personally, I can at least get behind the purity of purpose. No one\u2019s trying to convince you that this extra bit of flashiness will increase your productivity.\n\nSomething that might actually do that is a tiny secondary monitor\u2026 though now we\u2019re getting into some extremely niche territory. I think these cyberdeck-style designs are pretty cool, but unfortunately it has no battery and you can\u2019t load up Android or Linux on there and use it as an geeky laptop alternative.\n\nIt needs something to drive the display, like a tablet. Or a phone. Or a laptop. And at that point you\u2019ve essentially strapped a USB monitor to a keyboard and made both of them less flexible (and probably more expensive) than they would have been on their own.\n\nI can\u2019t wait for this trend to die\n\nSo, there you have it. Tiny screens on keyboards are, in almost every iteration, dumb. They don\u2019t add real utility to any device that already has a screen, especially the gaming PCs that most of these seem to be going for. They\u2019re adding expense and complication that don\u2019t need to be there.\n\nAs a keyboard nut myself, I\u2019d advise avoiding them entirely, especially on any wireless board where the screen will drain your battery super-fast. On a wired board it\u2019s less of a drawback\u2026 so long as you don\u2019t mind the padded price tag for trend-chasing."

The study identifies the most widely used free and open-source software (FOSS) as application libraries. Among its key insights, the study underlines the ongoing importance of open source collaboration.\n\nCensus III is the third study investigating the widespread use of open source software and provides the most comprehensive aggregation of data to date. Derived from over 12 million observations of FOSS libraries in production applications at more than ten thousand companies, the report highlights critical trends shaping the open source ecosystem.\n\nThe Census III effort was conducted in partnership with Harvard University and leading software composition analysis (SCA) organizations, including Black Duck, FOSSA, Snyk, and Sonatype. This collaboration advances the state of open source research by combining insights and resources to better understand the value and security of the OSS ecosystem.\n\nKey Findings of Census III Report\n\nThe report highlights several key trends and insights, such as: The use of cloud service-specific packages is increasing. There is an ongoing transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Maven packages continue to be widely used, and there is an increased prevalence of NuGet and Python packages. Use of components from Rust package repositories has increased considerably since Census II. There continues to be a need for the use of standardized naming schema for software components. Much of the most widely used FOSS is developed by only a handful of contributors. Individual developer account security is increasingly important. Legacy software persists in the open-source space.\n\nCensus III is authored by Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School; Kate Powell, Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard; Richie Zitomer, Harvard Business School; and David A. Wheeler, Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), The Linux Foundation.\n\nTo read the report, download the Census III of Free and Open Source Software\u2014Application Libraries research study on the Linux Foundation website.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\nLinux Foundation\n\n\"Understanding the health and security posture of open source software is a critical step to ensure its sustainability. Census III underscores the importance of identifying and supporting widely used open-source components, complementing Linux Foundation projects, initiatives, and security-focused research, and it comes at a critical time as we navigate regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act. These insights are vital for prioritizing resources in our efforts to steward a secure and resilient open source ecosystem.\"\n\n-Hilary Carter, SVP Research, The Linux Foundation\n\nOpenSSF\n\n\u201cFOSS is now ubiquitous, serving as a foundational infrastructure of society. However, its success has also made it a target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. This study provides valuable insights that will help individuals and organizations worldwide prioritize their investments to significantly reduce both the recurrence and impact of vulnerabilities in FOSS\u2014both unintentional and malicious. This marks a critical step in safeguarding our software supply chains against attacks and ensuring they deliver reliable, high-quality results.\u201d\n\n- David A. Wheeler, Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security, Open Source Software Foundation (OpenSSF)\n\nHarvard Business School\n\n\u201cFree and open source software has become the backbone of the digital economy. However, understanding which projects are critical to sustaining the FOSS ecosystem is difficult since there is limited ability to centrally measure the most widely used packages. Census III provides deep and broad insights into this problem as it measures which FOSS packages companies are most heavily reliant on and offers guidance for organizations and individuals who want to invest to support and secure this essential public good.\u201d\n\n- Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School\n\nBlack Duck\n\n\u201cThe ubiquity of FOSS as both foundational software and as an innovation engine demands that companies understand that the health of the FOSS they consume is a business risk just as any other supply chain risk. If there are only a handful of contributors to a critical component or if the supplier is effectively one anonymous GitHub user account, the cybersecurity and software hygiene decisions of those individuals could introduce unexpected business risks.\u201d\n\n- Tim Mackey, Head of Software Supply Chain Risk Strategy, Black Duck\n\nFOSSA\n\n\u201cThis third multi-party open-source census from the Linux Foundation and Harvard is an important examination of the FOSS ecosystem, and I'm proud FOSSA was asked to contribute again. The report clearly reaffirms the ubiquity and continued growing influence of open source on the economy, but more than that, it plays a material part in the trend towards greater transparency. Government regulations, industry initiatives, and research like this are all instrumental in improving the software supply chain through open communication, which ultimately builds trust. On behalf of the thousands of organizations who use FOSSA and share our love of open source, thank you!\u201d\n\n- Kevin Wang, CEO, FOSSA\n\nSnyk\n\n\"Free and Open Source Software forms the backbone of modern technology, yet its decentralized nature presents challenges in understanding its true impact and vulnerabilities. Efforts like the Free and Open Software Census are pivotal, combining community-driven data with analytical rigor to help the industry identify critical dependencies and prioritize investments. By sharing data and fostering collaboration among developers, organizations, policymakers, and academia, we can secure and sustain the health of this invaluable ecosystem for the digital economy\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n- Danny Allan, Chief Technology Officer, Snyk\n\nSonatype\n\n\"Sonatype is proud to contribute to the Census III effort as part of our commitment to strengthening the open source ecosystem. By providing critical data and insights into FOSS usage, we aim to empower organizations to make informed decisions about securing their software supply chains.\"\n\n- Brian Fox, Co-Founder and CTO, Sonatype\n\nBackground on Census Projects I & II\n\nThe original Census Project (\u201cCensus I\u201d), conducted in 2015, centered on identifying critical software packages within the Debian Linux distribution that are essential to server operations and security. This initial effort provided a foundational understanding of the most vital components of the FOSS ecosystem, helping stakeholders prioritize their security and maintenance efforts.\n\nCensus II expanded the scope to include a broader analysis of language-level FOSS packages commonly used in applications developed by both private and public organizations. By broadening the lens beyond Debian, this phase captured a more comprehensive view of how FOSS is integrated into diverse applications and infrastructure, providing deeper insights into the dependencies that organizations rely on for their day-to-day operations.\n\nBuilding on these efforts, Census III takes the initiative even further by leveraging anonymized usage data from leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) partners. This collaboration allows for a more robust and data-driven understanding of FOSS adoption and security trends. With this enhanced dataset, Census III offers actionable insights to help stakeholders better prioritize resources and address critical security challenges within the FOSS ecosystem. This progression underscores the growing need for collaboration and coordination across the industry to sustain and secure the vital infrastructure that FOSS represents.\n\nAdditional Resources"
