            "article_content": "Nothing to worry about?\n\nNot according to a growing number of lawmakers and local officials who are becoming increasingly alarmed about the number of drone sightings reported near sensitive locations in New Jersey.\n\nOne candidate for governor says it might be time to declare a state of emergency while two congressmen have called for the drones to be shot down. One of those congressmen says evidence suggests that the sophisticated drones are tied to a foreign adversary, although the Department of Defense officials said there was no truth to that.\n\nDrones tied to Iran?\n\nU.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J. 2nd District, said \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d ties \u201cdrones could be the work of foreign adversaries, specifically Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we know that there are drones flying in from the direction of the ocean. We also know there is an Iranian drone mothership that is missing from port in Iran, with a timeline matching the emergence of these drones,\" Van Drew said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe time to act on this information is now before the threat escalates any further. These drones are intentionally flying in uncontrolled airspace, expertly navigating around areas with radar coverage,\u201d Van Drew said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pentagon, however, shot down that theory, telling the Wall Street Journal that the drones were not tied to any foreign adversary.\n\nVan Drew said the drones should be shot down in order to assess the threat.\n\n\u201cWe should have already taken action by imposing flight restrictions to regain our control. Whether this is a foreign adversary or even just a group of drone hobbyists, we cannot allow unidentified drones to operate freely in our airspace with no consequences and it is time we eliminate the threat they pose and shoot them down.\u201d\n\nDrone over Ocean County Drone over Ocean County (Ocean County Sheriff's Office) loading...\n\nTime for a state of emergency?\n\nState Sen. Jon Bramnick, R-Union, a candidate for governor, said a state of emergency should be declared to \u201cshut down the airspace to drones and allow the Department of Defense to investigate.\n\nOn Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testified in the House of Representatives that no evidence indicates the drones are threat, but added that \"we just don't know. And that's the concerning part.\"\n\nState homeland security officials met behind closed doors Wednesday morning with mayors from across the state.\n\nDrone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 Drone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 (Alette Knoblauch via Facebook) loading...\n\nWhat are people seeing? Army of drones\n\nPolice have been receiving reports about drones since Thanksgiving. The drones, some as large as cars, have been spotted near President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s properties, power lines, a reservoir, police stations and military installations.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said he saw police footage that recorded more than 50 drones coming from the ocean, with more than a dozen trailing a Coast Guard vessel. Coast Guard officials said they did not know their origin.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy, who last week first acknowledged the reports, says they do not appear to be a threat. But those statements do little to allay fears because Murphy and federal officials have also said that they do not know who is operating the unmanned aircraft.\n\nMurphy said the drones go dark after they are spotted, hampering efforts at investigating them.\n\nSome reports have been false, with people mistaking planes or helicopters for drones.\n\nOn Tuesday, police in Parsippany-Troy Hills refuted rumors on the Ring app community claiming that a drone had downed power lines in a fiery crash. Instead, a car crash had toppled a utility pole."

We're making a big deal about it,\" Bergen told New Jersey 101.5. \"But I get down there, these people legitimately had no answers to what is going on.

            "article_content": "In the face of piling controversy \u2014 and a second lawsuit concerning the welfare of children \u2014 Google has taken pains to downplay its relationship to the embattled AI chatbot startup Character.AI.\n\nAbout this time last year, though? Google was crowning Character.AI as Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app of the year.\n\n\"AI made a major splash in 2023 allowing people to harness the technology to build knowledge, improve expression, and much, much more,\" reads a Google post lauding the app. \"Enter Character.AI, an innovative new app that brings unique AI-powered characters to you, each with their own distinct personalities and perspectives.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A world of characters is now at your fingertips,\" the post adds. (OpenAI's ChatGPT is listed as the category's honorable mention.)\n\nEarlier today, two Texas families filed a lawsuit accusing the Character.AI platform of engaging in emotional and sexual abuse of their minor children, resulting in self-harm and physical violence. The complaint is the second in recent weeks concerning the welfare of child users of Character.AI \u2014 the first, filed in October in the state of Florida, argues that a 14-year-old's death by suicide was caused by his interactions with Character.AI \u2014 and argues that these disturbing incidents are the result of intentional design choices inherent to the platform's function.\n\nAccording to the suit, Character.AI and its cofounders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas, aren't the only parties at fault. It also targets Google, a significant financial backer of Character.AI and the provider of its AI computing infrastructure, alleging that the tech giant knew about the Character.AI platform's dangers and facilitated its operations anyway in a ploy to farm valuable troves of user data without accountability.\n\nIn a statement to Futurism, Google rejected the lawsuit's characterization of its relationship with Character.AI, claiming that \"Google and Character.AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we've taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes,\" the company added.\n\nWhether Google intentionally used Character.AI as an unofficial AI testing facility remains to be proven in court.\n\nBut the two parties do clearly have deep ties: Shazeer and de Freitas, in fact, founded Character.AI in 2021 after departing Google over frustrations with corporate red tape. The Character.AI platform would make its way into consumers' hands in the fall of 2022, shortly before the AI race kicked off with the public release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnd in the heat of that industry-wide AI race \u2014 which caught Google on its back foot, as the New York Times reported at the time \u2014 Character.AI and Google seemingly held onto their close association. In May of 2023, for instance, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian bragged onstage at a developer conference that Google was providing Character.AI with the pricey computing infrastructure needed to power its AI platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We provide Character with the world's most performant and cost-efficient infrastructure for training and serving the models,\" said Kurian at the time, calling Character.AI a \"partner.\" \"By combining its own AI capabilities with those of Google Cloud, consumers can create their own deeply personalized characters and interact with them.\"\n\nLater year, in early November, Reuters reported that Google was weighing a high-dollar investment into Character.AI. By the end of that same month, the platform had been crowned Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app.\n\n\"We've been increasingly impressed by what AI can do,\" Google added in its announcement of the award, \"and we know you'll be impressed, too.\"\n\nGoogle's interest in Character.AI continued into August of 2024, when the search behemoth agreed to pay Character.AI $2.7 billion for access to its AI model in the form of a one-time licensing fee. As part of that deal, Shazeer and de Freitas rejoined Google's AI division and took 30 other Character.AI employees with them, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple Futurism reviews of Character.AI have revealed droves of alarming AI characters hosted by the platform, including chatbots explicitly dedicated to themes of suicide, pedophilia, pro-eating disorder content, and self-harm roleplay.\n\nThese disturbing chatbots were easy to find, accessible to Character.AI accounts listed as belonging to minors, and available for users to interact with well beyond Google's most recent August investment into the AI company \u2014 and, to that end, well after the platform's \"Best with AI\" crowning.\n\nCharacter.AI, for its part, has since removed a note about the Google Play award from its \"About\" page.\n\nMore on Character.AI and Google: Google-Backed AI Startup Tested Dangerous Chatbots on Children, Lawsuit Alleges"

            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "EXCELSIOR SPRINGS, MO. \u2014 They say the Elms Hotel is haunted. In fact, the hotel leans into these stories with nightly paranormal tours that highlight the ghost stories.\n\nBut it also leans into its history. The story of the Elms begins with the discovery of healing mineral waters in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, in the late 1800s. People would come from all over to experience the dozen or so springs in town, particularly Siloam Spring, on the grounds of the Elms Hotel. Sometimes, miraculous tales of healing followed.\n\nThe Elms Hotel, about 30 minutes to the northeast of Kansas City, literally sprang up with these tales. In 1888 the original Elms was built. It was destroyed in a fire, as was its successor in 1910. The current iteration has been around since 1912. It\u2019s now a full-service upscale Hyatt property.\n\nThose ensuing years have seen a lot of history. Harry S. Truman stayed at the hotel the night he was elected president. Al Capone was a regular guest. There\u2019s even an Al Capone Suite on the second floor. And you can tour the boardroom where his gambling parties used to happen and see the safe he hid contraband in.\n\nNaturally, with all that history, ghost stories spring up: Doors that close without warning, TVs that go on and off. There\u2019s the story of a dog that roams the hotel as well as the story of a gangster from Prohibition days who haunts the lap pool. The hotel was featured on an episode of \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d in 2013.\n\nYou can learn all about the hauntings on one of the hotel\u2019s nightly paranormal tours. A guide (thankfully equipped with a headset speaker) takes a group on a tour of all floors of the hotel. Our guide, Jay, recounted countless stories, sometimes of particular rooms. The thing that gets you is the scope and scale of them. There are so many, and according to Jay, that was just a small fraction. Thankfully, all the stories told were of harmless or even benevolent ghosts, except one. That\u2019s when the tour got a little spooky for me, but for the most part it\u2019s full of history and fun. The tours are $25; just sign up at the front desk.\n\nThe Elms has 152 guest rooms and suites and makes for a perfect girls getaway or couples weekend. Amenities include a 10,000-square-foot spa (more on that later), an indoor European lap pool, a fitness room, an outdoor pool with hot tubs and a walking trail. A cozy fireplace in the opulent, open lobby is a great place to have drinks with a friend.\n\nThose healing waters\n\nNow, because of some safety concerns and a number of other reasons, only a couple of those famous springs remain. One can be found in the basement at the Elms, its brown magnesium-rich waters bubbling up in the corner of the most gorgeous lap pool room you have seen.\n\nBut you can get a feel for the springs\u2019 history at the Hall of Waters in downtown Excelsior Springs. The art deco building began in the 1930s as a public works project to take advantage of the springs\u2019 reputation. It was both a bottling facility and a spa of sorts for the healing, medicinal mineral waters. There, in its gorgeous tiled hall is a bar. No, not used for wine or whiskey but for water. Will you take yours with iron, magnesium, calcium? Hot or cold?\n\nNow, the building is used for city works with offices and even a courtroom. You can tour it, and the museum there, which features remnants of an old bath house. There\u2019s also an empty competition-sized saltwater swimming pool and an empty polio pool in the lower levels. Some days, you can tour those.\n\nYou can learn more about the town at the Excelsior Springs Museum and Archives. Normally, I skip these small-town museums, but I found this one fascinating, mainly because it is housed in a building that was once the Clay County State Bank built in 1894. The magnificent gold ceiling is buttressed on each end by 100-year-old paintings, copies of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet\u2019s paintings \u201cThe Gleaners\u201d on the south wall and \u201cThe Angelus\u201d on the north wall. There are even the original teller windows and a giant vault in the back.\n\nAlso in downtown Excelsior Springs you will find a number of antique shops and boutiques as well as restaurants and bars. Catch a show at the Slightly Off Broadway Theatre (sobtheatre.org) and definitely grab a beer at Atlas Saloon Brewery (atlassaloon.com). The space, including the cash register and wood bar have been around since the late 1800s, but the beer is worth a stop on its own; get a flight to taste as many as you can.\n\nDining in the hotel\n\nJust as you enter the front doors at the Elms there is a cute bar to the right, Soterian, which serves coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. It has almost an upscale-soda-fountain vibe. To the left, is the hotel\u2019s signature restaurant, Three Owls, which is open for breakfast (buffet on weekends), lunch and dinner. It\u2019s a gorgeous space. I told my friend that aesthetically it may be my favorite restaurant ever. It has soaring ceilings, bright white walls with clever artwork, a fireplace and a sweeping staircase that leads to more seating. Its breakfast food (oh, my, that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e French toast) is as thoughtfully prepared as its short ribs. But it\u2019s hard to pass up the perfectly cooked steak. On the second floor, there is a cozy bar called the Tavern. It sometimes has live music and serves small bites.\n\nThe Spa\n\nFor many couples and girlfriend groups, the draw here is the spa. Since \u201cspa\u201d is in the name of the hotel (The Elms Hotel & Spa), you know it\u2019s a priority there. Whether you are there for couples massages, a girls-day facial or a more elaborate service, like a thermal mineral mudwrap, the spa leans into the hotel\u2019s earlier days of healing and beautifying.\n\nIts 28,000-square-feet include at least 15 treatment rooms, a sanctuary for relaxing and the Grotto, a modern twist on a Roman bath, which you can enjoy with your spa appointment. The Grotto Experience includes: steam shower, hot tub, cold plunge shower, steam sauna, dry sauna, and a self-service aromatherapy bar. You can pay $75 for the Grotto experience, but opt for a treatment and it\u2019s included (for reference, my collagen facial, which was amazing, was $180).\n\nIf you go Getting there: Excelsior Springs is less than four hours' drive from downtown St. Louis. More info: elmshotelandspa.com, 816-630-5500; cityofesmo.com Rates: Rooms start at $169."

            "article_content": "Researchers at The Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa have discovered an 18-digit code that allows proteins to attach themselves to exosomes - tiny pinched-off pieces of cells that travel around the body and deliver biochemical signals. The discovery, published in Science Advances, has major implications for the burgeoning field of exosome therapy, which seeks to harness exosomes to deliver drugs for various diseases.\n\n\"Proteins are the body's own home-made drugs, but they don't necessarily travel well around the body,\" said Dr. Michael Rudnicki, senior author of the study and Director of the Regenerative Medicine Program at The Ottawa Hospital and Professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\nThis discovery allows us to harness exosomes to deliver any protein throughout the body. It opens the door to a whole new field of drug development.\" Dr. Michael Rudnicki, Senior Author and Director, Regenerative Medicine Program, The Ottawa Hospital\n\nDr. Rudnicki and his team discovered the exosome-targeting postal code or zip code within a protein called Wnt7a, which plays a critical role in development, growth, regeneration and cancer. First, they showed that Wnt7a can attach itself to exosomes. Then, they deleted various parts of the Wnt7a protein until they found the smallest part that was responsible for exosome-targeting. They called this part, which consists of 18 amino acids, the Exosome Binding Peptide (EBP). They then discovered that the EBP binds to proteins called Coatomers on exosomes, and that EBP could be used to target any protein to exosomes.\n\n\"Researchers have been trying for years to turn Wnt7a into a muscle regeneration drug, but it is very difficult to deliver Wnt7a throughout the body, since it is covered in fatty molecules that don't mix well with body fluid,\" said first author Dr. Uxia Gurriaran-Rodriguez, a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Michael Rudnicki's group, who is now working at the Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences (CIC bioGUNE) in Spain. \"Now that we know how Wnt7a attaches to exosomes, we have solved this problem and can now accelerate the development of drugs for devastating diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\"\n\nExosomes have become a major area of research for both academic labs and biopharmaceutical companies, with DelveInsight predicting \"tremendous\" growth in the field. The Ottawa Hospital, together with the University of Ottawa and other partners, has become a leader in combining exosomes with proteins, RNA and other biomolecules to develop new therapies. The Ottawa Hospital's Biotherapeutics Manufacturing Centre will continue to play a key role in translating this promising part of the life science innovation ecosystem for the benefit of patients."

Two dangerous pests were found inside a shipment of flowers from South Africa. One of the bugs had never been seen before in the region, and the other had not been observed in Virginia in 40 years.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture officials confirmed the discovery recently. The two pests were found while CBP agriculture officers were inspecting a shipment of 188 protea and chamelaucium cut-stem flowers imported from South Africa on Oct. 7. The flowers were destined for an address in King George, Virginia.\n\nAn entomologist with the Department of Agriculture identified the specimens as Caprhiobia sp. (Lygaeidae), and Oxycarenus maculatus (Protea seed bug). Both pests are known to occur in Africa.\n\nCaprhiobia sp. (Lygaeidae) is a plant bug known to occur in South Africa that that has a voracious appetite and causes extensive damage to vegetation. The USDA entomologist consulted the national pest identifier database and confirmed this as a first-in-port discovery, meaning there has been no previous reported discovery of Caprhiobia sp. (Lygaeidae) in this region.\n\nSeed bugs are a crop pest and poses a serious threat to our nation\u2019s crop industries, such as corn, grains, wheat, cotton, fruit, tree nuts, and vegetables. The USDA entomologist consulted the national pest identifier database and confirmed that this insect pest has not been observed locally since November 1984.\n\nCBP agriculture specialists routinely inspect flower imports to ensure that they are free of pests that pose serious threats to our nation\u2019s agricultural and environmental resources.\n\n\u201cInvasive insect pests pose a severe threat to our agricultural industries and to our nation\u2019s economic security,\u201d said Marc Calixte, CBP\u2019s Area Port Director for the Area Port of Washington, D.C. \u201cCustoms and Border Protection agriculture specialists remain steadfast on our nation\u2019s frontline protecting our natural and agricultural resources from invasive pests and plants, and from animal and plant diseases that could cripple our nation\u2019s economy.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The major tech companies have had a fraught relationship with federal regulators in recent years, with politicians from both parties finding different reasons to try and loosen their power and influence. Google is currently fighting against a recent court ruling that found it has an illegal monopoly on search and must divest its Chrome browser. The search giant has been defending itself aggressively in the case, arguing it has plenty of competition in the industry from the likes of OpenAI.\n\nBut a funny thing is that the same companies are happy to cry to the regulators about concerns of unfair or anti-competitive behavior when it\u2019s to their benefit. Case in point, Google has reportedly approached the FTC and asked the agency to end Microsoft\u2019s exclusive deal with OpenAI to provide cloud hosting for ChatGPT. It argues the deal limits competition and potentially could impose higher costs on developers seeking to use ChatGPT APIs in their products. Apparently, tech companies believe anti-competitive behavior does exist in the industry, it\u2019s just not them doing it.\n\nThe Information first reported on the news.\n\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion into OpenAI and in return has gained access to the company\u2019s cutting-edge models as well as served as its exclusive cloud provider through Azure. These types of deals have been referred to as \u201cround-tripping,\u201d as Microsoft is giving OpenAI money that will ultimately go back into its own coffers. On top of the exclusive hosting agreement, Microsoft is also entitled to receive 75% of OpenAI\u2019s profits until it recoups its investment and afterward will still hold its equity in the company.\n\nThe FTC is already investigating Microsoft over its cloud hosting contracts. The regulatory agency is looking into allegations that Microsoft charges customers more to use its suite of services, like Office 365, if they use a different hosting provider, like Google Cloud. Of course, Microsoft software is ubiquitous in the enterprise world. If developers have to use Microsoft Azure in order to access ChatGPT, that would only make it that much harder to use other hosting providers. Google, of course, would likely welcome the opportunity to host ChatGPT, or at least put in a bid to do so.\n\nIn general, the United States prohibits any behavior intended to create a monopoly and harm competition and consumer welfare. The Clayton Act of 1914 in particular prohibits tying arrangements in which exclusive contracts force customers to buy one product in order to get another if those contracts lessen competition.\n\nIn recent years, however, tech companies have been able to argue against breakups by pointing to the fact that many of their services are offered for free or at the greatest convenience to consumers and therefore consumer welfare hasn\u2019t been harmed. The administration under Biden has taken a much different stance on the issue. In the case of Amazon, FTC chairwoman Lina Khan has argued that even though Amazon has historically kept prices low, it has done so in ways that pushed out competitors, such as requiring sellers on its platform to offer it the best price.\n\nGoogle itself has faced intense scrutiny over a\u2014yes\u2014exclusive arrangement with Apple in which it pays tens of billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine in Safari. Smaller competitors like DuckDuckGo have said that makes it nearly impossible to compete, as changing the default search engine is difficult and cumbersome for everyday people. The irony is not hard to notice.\n\nThere\u2019s optimism in Silicon Valley that the new administration will take a more laissez-faire approach to tech, especially as President-elect Trump is filling his cabinet with leaders from Silicon Valley. But it\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll intervene in cases like the one against Google. Republicans still disdain the company and believe it has been biased against conservatives in search results."

A bunch of new things, big and small. 12 Days of OpenAI starts tomorrow.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCEO Sam Altman also alluded to the campaign Wednesday at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. \"We have a bunch of new, great stuff. We're doing this kind of fun thing for the holidays. We're doing 12 days of OpenAI,\" he said. \"We'll either launch something or do a demo every day for the next 12 weekdays.\"\n\nHere's everything OpenAI has released so far for \"Shipmas.\"\n\n'Shipmas' Day 1\n\nOpenAI started the promotion with a bang by releasing the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1.\n\n\n\nOpenAI previewed o1 in September, describing it as a series of artificial-intelligence models \"designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.\" Until now, only a limited version of these models was available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users.\n\n\n\nNow, these users have access to the full capabilities of o1 models, which Altman said are faster, smarter, and easier to use than the preview. They're also multimodal, which means they can process images and texts jointly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMax Schwarzer, a researcher at OpenAI, said the full version of o1 was updated based on user feedback from the preview version and said it's now more intelligent and accurate.\n\n\"We ran a pretty detailed suite of human evaluations for this model, and what we found was that it made major mistakes about 34% less often than o1 preview while thinking fully about 50% faster,\" he said.\n\nAlong with o1, OpenAI unveiled a new tier of ChatGPT called ChatGPT Pro. It's priced at $200 a month and includes unlimited access to the latest version of o1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Shipmas' Day 2\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI previewed an advancement that allows users to fine-tune o1 on their own datasets. Users can now leverage OpenAI's reinforcement-learning algorithms \u2014 which mimic the human trial-and-error learning process \u2014 to customize their own models.\n\n\n\nThe technology will be available to the public next year, allowing anyone from machine-learning engineers to genetic researchers to create domain-specific AI models. OpenAI has already partnered with the Reuters news agency to develop a legal assistant based on o1-mini. It has also partnered with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop computational methods for assessing rare genetic diseases.\n\nRelated stories\n\n'Shipmas' Day 3\n\nThe Explore page of OpenAI's Sora AI tool, which generates AI videos from text prompts. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nOpenAI announced on December 9 that its AI video generator Sora was launching to the public.\n\nSora can generate up to 20-second videos from written instructions. The tool can also complete a scene and extend existing videos by filling in missing frames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want our AIs to be able to understand video and generate video and I think it really will deeply change the way that we use computers,\" the CEO added.\n\nRohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said a product team of about five or six engineers built the product in months.\n\nThe company showed off the new product and its various features, including the Explore page, which is a feed of videos shared by the community. It also showed various style presets available like pastel symmetry, film noir, and balloon world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI showed off Sora's features, including Storyboard for further customizing AI videos. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nThe team also gave a demo of Sora's Storyboard feature, which lets users organize and edit sequences on a timeline.\n\nSora is rolling out to the public in the US and many countries around the world. However, Altman said it will be \"a while\" before the tool rolls out in the UK and most of Europe.\n\nChatGPT Plus subscribers who pay $20 monthly can get up to 50 generations per month of AI videos that are 5 seconds long with a resolution of 720p. ChatGPT Pro users who pay $200 a month get unlimited generations in the slow queue mode and 500 faster generations, Altman said in the demo. Pro users can generate up to 20-second long videos that are 1080p resolution, without watermarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Shipmas' Day 4\n\nChatGPT can provide more specific edit notes and run code using canvas. OpenAI\n\nOpenAI announced that it's bringing its collaborative canvas tool to all ChatGPT web users \u2014 with some updates.\n\nThe company demonstrated the tech in a holiday-themed walkthrough of some of its new capabilities. Canvas is an interface that turns ChatGPT into a writing or coding assistant on a project. OpenAI first launched it to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in October.\n\nStarting Tuesday, canvas will be available to free web users who'll be able to select the tool from a drop-down of options on ChatGPT. The chatbot can load large bodies of text into the separate canvas window that appears next to the ongoing conversation thread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanvas can get even more intuitive in its responses with new updates, OpenAI said. To demonstrate, they uploaded an essay about Santa Claus's sleigh and asked ChatGPT to give its editing notes from the perspective of a physics professor.\n\nFor writers, it can craft entire bodies of text, make changes based on requests, and add emojis. Coders can run code in canvas to double-check that it's working properly.\n\n'Shipmas' Day 5\n\nAll Apple users need to do is enable ChatGPT on their devices. OpenAI 'Shipmas' Day 5\n\nOpenAI announced an integration with Apple for the iPhone, iPad, and macOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple users can now access ChatGPT directly from Apple's operating systems without an OpenAI account. This new integration allows users to consult ChatGPT through Siri, especially for more complex questions.\n\nThey can also use ChatGPT to generate text through Apple's generative AI features, collectively called Apple Intelligence. The first of these features was introduced in October and included tools for proofreading and rewriting text, summarizing messages, and photo-editing features. They can also access ChatGPT through the camera control feature on the iPhone 16 to learn more about objects within the camera's view."

OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's Sora AI video generator is here - how to try it\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a bit more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and will occur daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches will be both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat has been dropped so far?\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 today. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, today's live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams are held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. To make access easier, OpenAI will also post a link to the live stream on its X account 10 minutes before it starts, which will be at approximately 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET daily.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n\nThe releases remain a surprise, but many anticipate that Sora, OpenAI's video model initially announced last February, will be launched as part of one of the bigger drops. Since that first announcement, the model has been available to a select group of red teamers and testers and was leaked last week by some testers over grievances about \"unpaid labor,\" according to reports.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's o1 lies more than any major AI model. Why that matters\n\nOther rumored releases include a new, fuller version of the company's o1 LLM with more advanced reasoning capabilities, and a Santa voice for OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode, per code spotted by users only a couple of weeks ago under the codename \"Straw.\""

            "article_content": "Scientists have accidentally discovered a particle that has mass when it\u2019s traveling in one direction, but no mass while traveling in a different direction. Known as semi-Dirac fermions, particles with this bizarre behavior were first predicted 16 years ago.\n\nThe discovery was made in a semi-metal material called ZrSiS, made up of zirconium, silicon and sulfur, while studying the properties of quasiparticles. These emerge from the collective behavior of many particles within a solid material.\n\n\u201cThis was totally unexpected,\u201d said Yinming Shao, lead author on the study. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even looking for a semi-Dirac fermion when we started working with this material, but we were seeing signatures we didn\u2019t understand \u2013 and it turns out we had made the first observation of these wild quasiparticles that sometimes move like they have mass and sometimes move like they have none.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like an impossible feat \u2013 how can something gain and lose mass readily? But it actually comes back to that classic formula that everyone\u2019s heard of but many might not understand \u2013 E = mc2. This describes the relationship between a particle\u2019s energy (E) and mass (m), with the speed of light (c) squared.\n\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, nothing that has any mass can reach the speed of light, because it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it to that speed. But a funny thing happens when you flip that on its head \u2013 if a massless particle slows down from the speed of light, it actually gains mass.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. When the quasiparticles travel along one dimension inside the ZrSiS crystals, they do so at the speed of light and are therefore massless. But as soon as they try to travel in a different direction, they hit resistance, slow down and gain mass.\n\n\u201cImagine the particle is a tiny train confined to a network of tracks, which are the material\u2019s underlying electronic structure,\u201d said Shao. \u201cNow, at certain points the tracks intersect, so our particle train is moving along its fast track, at light speed, but then it hits an intersection and needs to switch to a perpendicular track. Suddenly, it experiences resistance, it has mass. The particles are either all energy or have mass depending on the direction of their movement along the material\u2019s \u2018tracks.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe researchers originally set out to study the quantum interactions in the material by watching how the electrons in it responded to light. They found that the energy level of the electrons followed an unexpected pattern as the strength of the magnetic field increases, which turned out to be a key prediction of semi-Dirac fermions.\n\nWhile it\u2019s pretty high-concept physics, the team says the discovery could eventually open up a range of applications for ZrSiS similar to that of graphene.\n\n\u201cIt is a layered material, which means once we can figure out how to have a single layer cut of this compound, we can harness the power of semi-Dirac fermions, control its properties with the same precision as graphene,\u201d said Shao. \u201cBut the most thrilling part of this experiment is that the data cannot be fully explained yet. There are many unsolved mysteries in what we observed, so that is what we are working to understand.\u201d\n\nThe research was published in the journal Physical Review X.\n\nSource: Penn State"

The Atacama Trench. (Photo: Johanna Weston/WHOI)\n\nThe Atacama Trench is a hadal zone, a term used to describe the deepest parts of the ocean, ranging from 6,000 to 11,000 meters. These areas are incredibly challenging to study due to their depth and the extreme conditions, but they are home to highly specialised and often unique species.\n\nThe Atacama Trench is particularly fascinating because of its isolation and high levels of sediment, creating a distinct environment for life to evolve.\n\nOver the years, several species have been identified as unique to this trench, including amphipods, snailfish, and even a mud dragon.\n\nThe newly discovered Dulcibella camanchaca, named for its graceful body structure, adds to the growing list of endemic species. This amphipod belongs to the Eusiridae family, which includes other predatory species found in deep trenches worldwide. This amphipod belongs to the Eusiridae family. (Photo: Johanna Weston/WHOI)\n\nUsing advanced techniques like DNA barcoding, scientists confirmed that this species represents a new genus within its family, expanding the known diversity of deep-sea predators.\n\nWhat makes predatory amphipods like Dulcibella camanchaca particularly intriguing is their role in the deep-sea food web. Unlike scavengers that feed on organic debris, these predators actively hunt smaller organisms, playing a critical role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.\n\nThe discovery highlights the Atacama Trench as a biodiversity hotspot and underscores the importance of continued exploration of the deep ocean. Each species found not only enriches our understanding of marine life but also emphasizes the need to protect these fragile ecosystems from threats like climate change and human activities."

The discovery, published in Science Advances, has major implications for the burgeoning field of exosome therapy, which seeks to harness exosomes to deliver drugs for various diseases.\n\n\"Proteins are the body's own home-made drugs, but they don't necessarily travel well around the body,\" said Dr. Michael Rudnicki, senior author of the study and Director of the Regenerative Medicine Program at The Ottawa Hospital and Professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\nThis discovery allows us to harness exosomes to deliver any protein throughout the body. It opens the door to a whole new field of drug development.\" Dr. Michael Rudnicki, Senior Author and Director, Regenerative Medicine Program, The Ottawa Hospital\n\nDr. Rudnicki and his team discovered the exosome-targeting postal code or zip code within a protein called Wnt7a, which plays a critical role in development, growth, regeneration and cancer. First, they showed that Wnt7a can attach itself to exosomes. Then, they deleted various parts of the Wnt7a protein until they found the smallest part that was responsible for exosome-targeting. They called this part, which consists of 18 amino acids, the Exosome Binding Peptide (EBP). They then discovered that the EBP binds to proteins called Coatomers on exosomes, and that EBP could be used to target any protein to exosomes.\n\n\"Researchers have been trying for years to turn Wnt7a into a muscle regeneration drug, but it is very difficult to deliver Wnt7a throughout the body, since it is covered in fatty molecules that don't mix well with body fluid,\" said first author Dr. Uxia Gurriaran-Rodriguez, a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Michael Rudnicki's group, who is now working at the Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences (CIC bioGUNE) in Spain. \"Now that we know how Wnt7a attaches to exosomes, we have solved this problem and can now accelerate the development of drugs for devastating diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\"\n\nExosomes have become a major area of research for both academic labs and biopharmaceutical companies, with DelveInsight predicting \"tremendous\" growth in the field. The Ottawa Hospital, together with the University of Ottawa and other partners, has become a leader in combining exosomes with proteins, RNA and other biomolecules to develop new therapies. The Ottawa Hospital's Biotherapeutics Manufacturing Centre will continue to play a key role in translating this promising part of the life science innovation ecosystem for the benefit of patients."

Its initial focus is on verticals including education, sales, financial services, real estate, and health and wellness.\n\neSelf\u2019s early pitch is that its agents\u2019 current query/interaction response time is under 1.7 seconds \u2014 which it claims is faster, and thus more lifelike, than voice responses from other leading companies like OpenAI. The Israeli startup has launched a \u201cno-code\u201d creation studio that lets its customers build their own agents. These agents can operate common apps \u2014 like Calendly, Salesforce, others \u2014 to schedule appointments, access collateral content, and to reference data just as a human assistant might do.\n\neSelf says it has, in stealth, already powered \u201cmillions\u201d of real-time conversations. Current customers include Christie\u2019s real estate, and Brazilian bank AGI.\n\nExplorer Investments, a firm out of Portugal, led the round with participation from Ridge Ventures and strategic angel investors such as Eyal Manor, former VP of engineering at YouTube and chief product and engineering officer at Twilio.\n\neSelf is co-founded by Dr Alan Bekker (CEO) and Eylon Shoshan (CTO), and it has an unlikely origin story.\n\nBekker, who lives in Tel Aviv, tells me his original wish was to become a rabbi \u2014 an ambition that he fell out of love with several years into studying, he said, after approaching the chief rabbi in his school, asking big questions about God and faith, and not being satisfied with the answers he got in return.\n\n\u201cI came home to my wife Lisa,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her I didn\u2019t believe in God anymore.\u201d\n\nWhether he reconciled that in the end or not, I have no idea. But it seems that he did discover another kind of religion in the wake of that dramatic moment.\n\n\u201cMy passion was always about understanding humans and our world in general,\u201d he said. He had a longstanding interest in math from his days as a student, and so he dropped out of rabbinical school and turned to university to study engineering, physics and computer science.\n\nHe signed up for a course in machine learning \u201ccompletely by mistake,\u201d he said, and it gave him a glimpse into another kind of omniscience.\n\n\u201cYou can, with mathematics, understand natural language, vision, speech,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was mind blowing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "00:00\n\nHi everybody, welcome to DEMO, the show where companies come in and they show us their latest products and platforms. Today, I'm joined by Neil Miller, he is the Director of Product Marketing at Kissflow. Welcome to the show, Neil. So tell us a little bit about what Kissflow is, and then what are you going to show us here today?\n\n\n\n00:14\n\nSo Kissflow is a no-code, low-code, application platform that really spreads the power of application development across the enterprise.\n\n\n\n00:21\n\nGenerally, who is this designed for? Is it designed for product developers, or is it other people within the company that might not be a developer?\n\n\n\n00:30\n\nYes, so Kissflow is a unique product in that it's really built for both groups, so it can handle the people that like the high-powered, low-code developers who really want to build a lot of things out -- they don't need a lot of certifications or anything. It's a platform they can get on to build things very quickly and easily. But then the other side, you also have junior developers, business analysts and specifically process owners, who want to build their own thing themselves. The platform is easy enough for them to use that they can build their own applications too.\n\n\n\n00:56\n\nDo you subscribe to the whole citizen developer movement that we're seeing in the space, because of skill shortages and things like that?\n\n\n\n01:04\n\nAbsolutely. Citizen development is one of the main themes we like to play into. Now our platform is very governed, so IT admins have the ability to govern the entire platform and know what's going on in there. But at the same time, we believe that people who actually run these processes probably know best what's there. So as long as you give them the right tools, and you give them enough training, they're able to build what they need.\n\n\n\n01:25\n\nBecause I guess if I was in IT, the biggest fear would be like, \u201cWait, you're we're giving power to who?\u201d Because the last thing you want is me programming something, with very little design or development skills. So why should companies care about Kissflow versus maybe some of the other platforms out there, or some of the other processes that go on.\n\n\n\n01:42\n\nLike I said, Kissflow\u2019s unique thing is that one, it\u2019s just super easy to use. You're going to see it in the demo here a second. The layout, the feel of it, is just really geared towards someone who knows what they want but maybe doesn't have the development skills about it. There's a lot of things we won't show today that show the power of the low-code side of it as well, so that even a higher-powered developer can come in and really do what they want to do, but that's one thing that really makes it easy, is just the ease of use and be able to generate things quickly. So even somebody who's in the IT department that just wants to build a lot of apps very quickly to get things out of their backlog, they can really easily build dozens of apps on this.\n\n\n\n02:16\n\nIf companies didn't have this, would they just be relying on developers to do a lot of the requests that are coming in? Does this offload some of those processes to people that usually don't have those skills?\n\n\n\n02:26\n\nSo a few different things. One is that they would either just be custom developing things. Second is they might be using a different low-code platform, but typically, you're only going to be building two or three applications a year on those really big platforms that are out there. Kissflow is more like, \u201cHey, give us a few dozen that we're going to get done in a year.\u201d Then the citizen developers, the other thing they would be using would just be spreadsheets, Excel or something like that, to build what they need. So this is their option to actually get something that's an improvement on Excel.\n\n\n\n02:53\n\nSo let's go into the demo. Tell us what you're going to show us.\n\n\n\n03:00\n\nWhat you see here is the basics of a process. So we have a few different modules in Kissflow, but the process builder is one of the easiest to understand, and the one that generates the most interest for most people. So we start off with a form, which is a little bit interesting. Most people are going to say, OK, build us a data table or something like that. But we actually want to start with a form, because that's where the process owner is usually going to start. They know what they want to do. In this situation, we're looking at asset disposal requests. So this is, again, something maybe your admin team is going to use, or maybe somebody else in the IT department is going to use, but it's really something that the person who is building this knows what they need, and they just want to be able to bring that in.\n\n\n\nSo the form is very, very simple. It's all drag and drop. We have tons of form fields that are available here on the left, all sorts of things, from very simple things to very complicated. We also have some AI features here. So if you want to, just based on the name asset disposal request, you're going to be able to generate types of fields you might need to know. So if somebody's building it for the first time, they're going to be able to bring those in. They can do anything here, building out sections, you're also able to refer back to fields. We have remote lookup, so you can go to databases outside of Kissflow and bring those things in. Every field has the ability to change the settings, to add validations, add visibility requirements, stylize it the way you want, and even add these custom events, which is more the low-code part of what's going on. So the field, the form is one of the things that is most fun to use, I feel like to build in, but then you want to take that form and drive it through a workflow. So that's where we go to the second phase. So here again, this is one of the powers of Kissflow, is just being able to see how simple it is to build things out. Again, we have these AI features where they will suggest steps for you based on the name of the platform. Here I have a few that are already added in. It's as easy as adding in new steps. Adding in you can do something like a parallel branch where two different things may be happening at the same time. Or you want to create conditions based on how things happen. So all these things are available to just make it easy.\n\n\n\nOne of the best things about it is how you assign things. A lot of these features, a lot of other platforms, don't have so easily to do in terms of if you're going to assign it to a group of people, if you're going to assign it to everyone, if everyone needs to approve it before it goes forward, if only a few people need to approve it. If you want to assign things to one person based on the region that they're in, but a different region needs to go to somebody else, that's really easy to do in Kissflow. If you're trying to hand-code a lot of the things, it becomes very difficult to do. You can also build in these conditions. You can look at different SLAs, actions, deadlines, field permissions that are available at different steps. That's really one of the great, but I'm able to create services requests. I'm able to create product marketing requests based on these workflows and just set up the way I want to do it.\n\n\n\n05:46\n\nDo you find that when you're doing the application itself, does it get sent to approval from the IT department to make sure that you're not missing anything? Or does another developer check your work before it gets deployed? Or because, if it's internal, maybe you don't have to do that?\n\n\n\n06:02\n\nSo within the citizen development framework, which we also try to align ourselves a lot, you kind of have these zonings of applications, they're based on the risk and based on the complexity. So a lot of risk that's involved and a lot of complexity, you really want your IT team to be hands-on doing those things. Maybe you're going to let a citizen developer work on a form or something like that. Then you have things that are less risk, but maybe with a little bit of complexity. That's where someone just needs a mentor to be able to come along and make sure, \u201cHey, you did it right, you didn't screw up anything.\u201d Then you have this other area where it's like, it's low risk, it's low complexity, and pretty much you're just letting those people just build whatever they want, because they're not going to mess up too much.\n\n\n\nSo this particular one, asset disposal, there may be some concerns about some risks that are around there, but not too much. This would be an example of one that would probably be fine for a citizen developer just to build on their own, and just for the data governance platform, just to know that it\u2019s there. But other apps you're going to want to have people more involved in it.\n\n\n\nAfter you build out all the steps that you want, and again, this can get as complex as you want. We've seen many very big workflows that go on, then you go on to permissions. So here, at each step in the process, you're able to figure out if fields should be editable, if they're read-only, or if they're hidden. You can set these rules across steps or just for individual ones. It's really just a way to make sure to ensure some privacy issues, or ensure some scalability issues, as you're building these out to make sure that each step is what it needs to be.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features within this particular function in Kissflow is the simulate button. So here, instead of having to go live with something and then test it out and figure it out, this is really a way to just test it on the back end really quickly. Here I can simulate it as myself, or as lots of other people, and see what it would be like. I can see, these fields are obviously like a read-only field, but this one is something that I can use. And if I say, \u201cOkay, well, I didn't want that to be like that,\u201d I can just go back into the process and figure that out.\n\n\n\nWith each step I can see things. I can mark it, and I can submit it as done, and see what it looks like in the next section. You can also see what it looks like on a mobile app. So this is really the fun side of Kissflow, I would say, in order to be able to see what's going on and be able to build it. In this particular process builder, deploying an app is just as simple as clicking this button to go live. Now it's live. So now at this point, this is more like the runtime. So in here, a new person would be able to get in. They're going to click this New Item button. They're going to see all the same fields that you had with Kissflow, with our process builder. You're going to see exactly when something was started, when the next step was done. So these are going to have times if they had SLAs attached to them. The SLA is going to be there to know if it was handled appropriately or not. You can also add comments for people that are involved in the workflow. So if there's some extra things that need to be added into all these things, so you get this big data trail as well. So a lot of this use of Kissflow, with an approval management cycle, you're going to be able to get all the things you need, as opposed to just trying to handle something on either a simple workflow builder, on Excel or something.\n\n\n\n09:01\n\nYou were talking to me before the show that you've got some integrations that you wanted to show off?\n\n\n\n09:06\n\nSo this part of Kissflow is about approvals. So you're talking about mostly human-based ones, but also you can build a lot of really intense integrations as well. So here, this is an integration we built for another process was about scheduling interviews with customers. This is pretty easy, and again, you're going to see a similar workflow builder here, but here we're not talking about human elements. Now we don't have approvers. Now we are just going into different systems. So here, when a status of an item is updated, we're going to make sure certain data sets match and then send an email. Those are easy to do, but again, you can see lots of different connections we have here, lots of things within Kissflow. But then also outside of Kissflow, as well, other tools that if you want to go into one of your CMS or your ERP system and make a connection, those are very easy to do. Again, this is still no code. We're still talking about people like you and me that aren't technically minded, that can just go in and make what they need to do. Maybe I get into a little bit of trouble. I need to ask somebody, Hey, what I do here, and that's very easy, just to go and then you feel really empowered as a system developer.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\nYou've got a lot of features other than the stuff that you just showed me. But do you offer a free trial? Is it? Or how do you get set up on this?\n\n\n\n10:12\n\nYeah, free trials are available. As long as you go to our website, request a meeting with our sales team, they'll kind of get a figure for how you want to use it. One of our big things is that we like to see companies with a long list of backlogged apps. If you have five to 25 apps that you're like, \u201cMan, I wish somebody would take these off our plate,\u201d that's our kind of customer. So if you're in that that zone and you really want to see it, or you want to try out citizen development as well, unleashing something for the rest of the organization, then come in, we'll figure out if it's right for you, and make sure you get set up.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\nAnd it looks simple to operate, so I'm also assuming it's going to be simple to install. You're not talking like a three-month long install process.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\nAbsolutely not. We like to see people get up and going as soon as possible. We don't have any long certification courses. You get in, you learn the platform, and then again, depending on if you want to turn this over to people, citizen developers, or IT departments. IT departments are going to be very fast with this, and like, within a week, they're going to be up and building MVPs, and things much more complicated. What I was showing you before was our standard runtime that you can see with a certain process, but we have a page builder, you can build a custom UI, so you can have everything unique. You can build your own dashboards or your own reports. This is just like one small, easy part of Kissflow, but it can really be very powerful.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\nAll right, give me the website again.\n\n\n\n11:29\n\nKissflow.com.\n\n\n\n11:30\n\nNeil Miller, thanks again for joining us on the show.

One thing the team didn\u2019t mention in its live stream or patch notes was that update 2.2 would also bring a quest based on Balatro, 2024\u2019s card game indie darling that is nominated for Game of the Year at this year\u2019s Game Awards. If you haven\u2019t booted up Cyberpunk since the update but are curious about how to see this unexpected crossover, we\u2019ve got the rundown on where to go in Night City to start the quest.\n\n\n\nFor most people, the quest should begin fairly easily. If you boot up the game, you should receive a text message from someone named Jim B (a reference to Balatro\u2019s clown mascot Jimbo) who will send V on a treasure hunt around the city, with clues and photos leading you to areas adorned with hidden Jimbo logos. Throughout the quest, you\u2019ll find Balatro-themed cosmetics, including a trophy you can put on display in your apartment.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, the quest might be bugged, as some players, myself included, are not receiving a text message from Jim B upon start-up. I tried riding around Night City to see if the clown might get in touch with me, but had no luck. I also checked the spot where the first logo is supposed to appear, and it seems like it doesn\u2019t show up in the world if you haven\u2019t started the quest. We\u2019ve reached out to CD Projekt Red about this issue and will update the story when we hear back. In the meantime, if you\u2019re looking for some help on all the clue locations, YouTuber vinal has a video showing each location on Night City\u2019s map:\n\nAll of this launches alongside a line of Cyberpunk X Balatro merchandise including shirts and a hoodie, all of which are available for pre-order on CD Projekt Red\u2019s website. While Cyberpunk 2077 may be getting a little love even four years after its release, most of CD Projekt Red\u2019s team has been moved to other projects, including a sequel codenamed Orion. We don\u2019t know much about the game, but there\u2019s reason to believe it will have some kind of multiplayer mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

The new round\u2019s target is significantly smaller than its last round \u2014 a $139 million Series B-1 that was announced in March 2023 \u2014 highlighting the challenges that middle-stage climate startups face today when trying to attract investment.\n\nAmogy did not immediately reply to questions about the funding round.\n\nThe company is focused on various transportation markets, including maritime shipping, long-haul trucking, and agriculture. Earlier this year, Amogy tested its ammonia-to-power technology in a retrofitted tugboat, and it previously tested it in semi-tractors and farm tractors.\n\nMany green ammonia startups are targeting long-distance transportation in part because ammonia can be burned inside traditional internal combustion engines with a few modifications, although it does require a so-called pilot fuel like diesel or biofuel to help it ignite. Depending on the pilot fuel, switching to ammonia eliminates most if not all carbon emissions, but it also generates oxides of nitrogen, a class of pollutants that contributes to smog and acid rain and can cause global warming.\n\nAmogy takes a different approach than most. Rather than burning the ammonia, it cracks the fuel into nitrogen and hydrogen. The nitrogen is emitted as harmless nitrogen gas while the hydrogen runs through a fuel cell, which produces electricity and water. The setup doesn\u2019t require a pilot fuel, either, meaning it\u2019s zero-carbon from the start.\n\nDespite not reusing internal combustion engines already in trucks and ships, Amogy is likely to find at least some receptive customers, particularly within maritime shipping. The industry has set a deadline of 2050 to hit net-zero carbon emissions."

However, there are some very good free apps that can help restore your missing files or photos.\n\nCCleaner\u2019s Recuva and DMDE are among the best free data recovery apps that let you preview and restore a wide variety of files at no cost. I\u2019ll focus on the free versions, but also cover the more powerful paid apps.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSpecs\n\nRecuva DMDE Platforms Windows Windows, macOS, Linux Devices unlimited (Free), 3 (Professional) unlimited (Free), 1 (Express, Standard), plus 5 monthly (Professional) Support Email Email Free version? Yes Yes\n\nPricing tiers\n\nRecuva is a full-featured free data recovery app with only minor limitations. There\u2019s no customer service for free users. The app can\u2019t read virtual drives and you have to check for updates manually.\n\nBeyond that, you can use Recuva for free for as long as you like on any Windows computer. There\u2019s not a macOS or Linux version of Recuva and it doesn\u2019t work on mobile devices.\n\nLeading solutions like Stellar Data Recovery restrict free file restoration to 1 GB, which might be enough for lots of documents and several photos. However, the free version might not retrieve all your photos and videos since they take up more space.\n\nFor $25 annually, you can install Recuva Professional on up to three computers and contact support for technical assistance. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with data recovery software and drive technology and formats, technical support could be very important.\n\nDMDE also has a free version that\u2019s just as powerful as the paid app. However, it does have some restrictions. You can restore one folder and 4,000 files at a time.\n\nUnless you dump all you photos and videos in a single folder or store a huge number of files in one place, you\u2019ll need the paid version. Since only one folder can be restored with the free app, you\u2019ll probably need multiple scans to get back missing files.\n\nAn annual subscription to DMDE Express costs $20. There\u2019s also a lifetime plan call DMDE Standard that costs just $48. If you subscribe to DMDE Express for more than two years, DMDE Standard is a better bargain.\n\nDMDE also has professional plans, starting at $95, that let you install the app on more computers.\n\nFeatures\n\nRecuva has a wizard to guide you through data recovery. You select the type of files to restore, but the option of all files seems to make the most sense. Then you get to choose the drive or let the app scan all drives. That can take a long time, so it\u2019s best to select the drive you suspect has missing files.\n\nWhen you start a scan, the app immediately starts listing files that Windows File Explorer won\u2019t show. As the scan continues, more details appear including filename, the folder it\u2019s in, the modification date, size, and more.\n\nRecuva also estimates the recoverability of each file and optionally shows a preview. Those are the most valuable details. If image previews look correct and files are rated with excellent recoverability, the app should be able to restore them.\n\nIn my review of Recuva Professional, I found it to be useful in recovering data from my external hard disk drive (HDD) and my thumb drive. It found 158 of 163 files in the HDD test, which is good, but not great.\n\nDMDE is easy to get started with, but some features can be a little confusing. It\u2019s a much more technical app with powerful and dangerous features like disk editing. It\u2019s wise to make sure you understand what will happen before making a change.\n\nBasic operation is straightforward. You select a drive, start a scan, and watch the file list appear. DMDE shows the folders in a left sidebar and files to the right. It fills in the filename, size, modification date, and shows an optional preview.\n\nThe preview is important since DMDE doesn\u2019t give a recoverability estimate. In my review, DMDE Free restored all 55 files in my folder, but none of the images in subfolders. I\u2019d need the paid version to get everything in one pass.\n\nAs a workaround, I switched to raw recovery, which ignores my folder structure and groups restored files by type. With this trick, I got 162 of 165 files, but with randomly generated numeric filenames.\n\nThe paid version of DMDE managed to restore all my HDD files, but the first letter of each folder was replaced with an underscore \u201c_\u201d symbol.\n\nSolid-state drive (SSD) recovery is almost impossible and neither app could restore a single file in these tests. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro is only app I\u2019ve tested that has successfully undeleted SSD files, which might have been due to lucky timing.\n\nSupport\n\nRecuva has a very limited help center and only offers email support to subscribers. The app has been around for decades, so your best bet is a web search if you need help with the free version.\n\nDMDE doesn\u2019t restrict help to paying customers, giving it an edge against Recuva. Support is via email, so it could take up to 24 hours to get a reply. DMDE\u2019s resource center features tutorials, a manual, and an FAQ so you can get answers faster.\n\nPopular data recovery apps like Disk Drill Pro offer live chat support, but cost more.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nThere\u2019s no need to upload data to recover files, so your files will remain private. However, if you email support or subscribe, your email address and financial information will be on record. That means cybersecurity is worth considering.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of a data breach at DMDE, but the developer of Recuva, CCleaner has had some issues. CCleaner has been hit by three major data breaches, one as recent as 2023.\n\nWhich data recovery app is right for you?\n\nThe free versions of Recuva and DMDE are both effective with HDD file recovery. While DMDE restored more data in my tests, it requires multiple passes to get back folders. Recuva is easier to use, but couldn\u2019t find as many missing files.\n\nWhile you could download and run both, HDD scans can be time-consuming, so it\u2019s better to pick one. If you absolutely can\u2019t pay to restore missing files, Recuva has the better free app.\n\nHowever, DMDE\u2019s $20 and Recuva\u2019s $25 annual subscription prices are incredibly affordable. If you\u2019re going to the trouble of scanning and restoring files, it\u2019s worth saving yourself time and effort at such a low cost.\n\nIf your photos, videos, documents, and other files are worth $20, I\u2019d recommend DMDE Express over Recuva Professional. If you anticipate needing to recover files in the future, a one-time purchase of DMDE Standard costs just $48 to use it on your Windows PC, Mac, or Linux computer forever.\n\nThat\u2019s why DMDE is high on our list of the best data recovery software.

Google reportedly was among those arguing that the deal harms competition by saddling rivals with extra costs and blocking them from hosting OpenAI's latest models themselves.\n\nIn 2024 alone, Microsoft generated about $1 billion from reselling OpenAI's large language models (LLMs), The Information reported, while rivals were stuck paying to train staff to move data to Microsoft servers if their customers wanted access to OpenAI technology. For one customer, Intuit, it cost millions monthly to access OpenAI models on Microsoft's servers, The Information reported.\n\nMicrosoft benefits from the arrangement\u2014which is not necessarily illegal\u2014of increased revenue from reselling LLMs and renting out more cloud servers. It also takes a 20 percent cut of OpenAI's revenue. Last year, OpenAI made approximately $3 billion selling its LLMs to customers like T-Mobile and Walmart, The Information reported.\n\nMicrosoft's agreement with OpenAI could be viewed as anti-competitive if businesses convince the FTC that the costs of switching to Microsoft's servers to access OpenAI technology is so burdensome that it's unfairly disadvantaging rivals. It could also be considered harming the market and hampering innovation by seemingly disincentivizing Microsoft from competing with OpenAI in the market.\n\nTo avoid any disruption to the deal, however, Microsoft could simply point to AI models sold by Google and Amazon as proof of \"robust competition,\" The Information noted. The FTC may not buy that defense, though, since rivals' AI models significantly fall behind OpenAI's models in sales. Any perception that the AI market is being foreclosed by an entrenched major player could trigger intense scrutiny as the US seeks to become a world leader in AI technology development."

            "article_content": "Machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool for detecting anomalies in network traffic structure. In this way they can support the early identification of potential attacks But what is anomaly detection? Anomaly detection works by identifying patterns that deviate from anticipated behavior or normal baseline data, which can be indicative of a threat or cyberattack.\n\nThese anomalies could indicate fraudulent behavior or system failures in finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity, for example. By being able to detect these anomalies, organizations can protect themselves from attacks, or stop threats before they even occur, while keeping their data and systems safe. Think of it like an early warning system. Once the alarm is triggered by an anomaly, security teams can get to work, responding proactively to any issue.\n\nBear in mind that the amount of data that organizations handle is enormous. Network usage continues to grow, which means the volume of information being generated across those networks is also rising. Firewalls and antivirus software are not enough to protect networks.\n\nSophisticated attackers can infiltrate networks for long periods of time and cause damage.\n\nBy using machine learning tools, organizations can flag anomalies or outliers that could be overlooked in large datasets. Unlike signature-based detection, which relies on known attack signatures, these tools rely on meta tags and labels to automatically identify deviation.To be effective though, tools capable of detecting anomalies need high-quality data and models.\n\nAll Kinds of Anomalies\n\nThere are different kinds of anomalies of course. Three anomalies that an organization should be familiar with are point anomalies, contextual anomalies, and collective anomalies.\n\nA point anomaly is self explanatory. This occurs when an individual data point differs from the rest of the dataset. This could be a spoke in network traffic. An example of a point anomaly could be for example an unusual charge on a credit card, or use of that credit card in an unusual location. That could alert organizations to the possibility that the charge might be fraudulent.\n\nWith contextual anomalies, an individual data point is different from the rest of the dataset, but within a specific context. If a user logs into a system during non-business hours or from an IP address that doesn\u2019t match their geographic location, this could be a conextual anomaly.\n\nCollective anomalies occur when a group of data points differ from an anticipated pattern. An example of this could be a surge in network traffic from IP addresses that could be a coordinated attack.\n\nHow Can Machine Learning Help?\n\nMachine learning and AI have a big role to play in anomaly detection. They are ideal for identifying patterns in large datasets in real-time, as well as for spotting anomalies. A machine learning model could analyze network traffic patterns and identify deviations, such as surges in volume, attempted intrusions, or suspicious requests, for example. This eye for pattern recognition is key.\n\nLarge datasets, such as the ones generated from an enterprise network, exhibit complex behavior that traditional systems may struggle to identify. AI-powered solutions that rely on an effective data architecture, however, excels in recognizing patterns, learning from them, and accurately identifying any deviations or anomalies. Its ability to analyze network traffic in real-time can also improve the speed with which security teams react. For instance, in a network, an algorithm might flag a jump in login attempts. The system could then turn on its automated defenses, such as blocking questionale IP addresses. This helps to address threats.\n\nMachine learning models can adapt to identify new patterns, as they learn as the data is generated. Each time, actually, there is an attack on a network, machine learning models can make related changes by automatically incorporating new attack vectors in their detection algorithms. As such, defenses are expanded. This differs from rules-based models, where responses would have to be adjusted manually with every attack.\n\nThey also offer something called proactive anomaly management, in that they might predict where anomalies might occur in the future by observing changes in patterns over time. This is accomplished through closed-loop automation, where machine learning can correct issues as they arise. This happens thanks to a feedback loop of communication between monitoring, identifying, adjusting, and optimizing the performance of the network to enable self-optimization.\n\nRelying on such tools, false positives can also be avoided too, as machine learning can be trained to differentiate between normal changes in network traffic and real security threats. Sometimes the volume of data transfers might genuinely spike compared to baseline behavior, but machine learning will be able to distinguish between normal spikes and suspicious activities.\n\nFinally, machine learning tools are scalable and save users money over time. Rather than hiring big teams to do the grunt work, machine learning models can take over, freeing up time for the security team to focus on higher-level tasks.\n\nTaken together, your cybersecurity efforts will greatly benefit from machine learning-based anomaly detection. It helps to identify unusual network traffic, which could signify a cyber-attack or data breach. Early detection allows for quick responses, minimizing damage. It also improves operational efficiency while assisting with proactive risk management and decision making.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nOleg Bondarchuk is a Microsoft Azure Certified Solution Architect Expert with over 18 years of IT experience, including more than nine years of specialized experience in designing and supporting Microsoft Azure environments, also he holds IEEE Senior Member status .

Unexpectedly, our approach outperformed protein\u2013protein interaction networks in discriminating between functionally relevant and irrelevant gene pairs.\"\n\nThrough network analysis, FunMap uncovers protein modules and a hierarchical modular organization linked to cancer hallmarks and clinical characteristics, predicts the functions of understudied cancer proteins, offers deeper insights into established cancer drivers and identifies drivers with low mutation frequency.\n\n\"More than 200 genes are highly overexpressed or under-expressed in cancer, but we know very little about their specific roles in the disease,\" Zhang said. \"When we mapped these genes in our network, we were able to look at the neighborhood and make a prediction about their function.\"\n\nFor example, the expression of the understudied gene MAB21L4 is significantly below normal in three types of cancer tumors. FunMap showed that this gene's network neighborhood is enriched for genes associated with epithelial cell differentiation, the suppression of which plays a critical role in tumor progression.\n\nClinical tumor grading data, together with a recent study showing that loss of MAB21L4 blocks differentiation to drive the development of squamous cell carcinoma, provide strong evidence to support a tumor suppressor role of MAB21L4.\n\nMoreover, leveraging cutting edge deep learning methods with FunMap uncovered numerous previously unrecognized cancer drivers with low mutation frequencies, including a novel tumor suppressor role for LGI3, supported by gene knockout experimental data.\n\nThis study highlights the great potential of integrating machine learning and proteogenomic profiling to gain a deeper understanding of complex cancer systems. By generating a comprehensive functional network, this approach provides a robust framework for cancer functional genomics research, offering valuable insights into mutations and cancer-associated proteins.\n\n\"These findings can greatly aid in prioritizing targets for clinical translation, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective cancer therapies,\" Zhang said.\n\nMore information: Mapping the functional network of human cancer through machine learning and pan-cancer proteogenomics, Nature Cancer (2024).

BALDOR Associated Press , and TARA COPP Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- Russia could launch its lethal new intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine again soon, the Pentagon said Wednesday, as both sides wrestle for a battlefield advantage that will give them leverage in any negotiations to end the nearly 3-year war.\n\nSabrina Singh, Pentagon spokeswoman, told reporters in a briefing that an attack could be carried out \u201cin the coming days.\u201d She added that the U.S. does not consider this missile \u2014 called the Oreshnik \u2014 a game changer on the battlefield, but that the Russians are \u201ctrying to use every weapon that they have in their arsenal to intimidate Ukraine.\u201d\n\nShe said the U.S. is basing its warning on a new intelligence assessment, but she couldn't provide any other details, including where Russia may strike.\n\nU.S. officials said earlier Wednesday that the U.S. was seeing the Russians make preparations for another launch of the missile, which was used for the first time last month. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive information.\n\nThe threat comes as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the war and Western allies suggest that negotiations to do so could begin this winter.\n\nSingh said the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine, including with additional air defense systems designed to protect the country against air assaults. Just days ago, the U.S. promised close to $1 billion in new security aid to Ukraine, including munitions for air defense.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also suggested that Moscow is prepared to retaliate because Ukraine used six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles to strike a military air base in Taganrog in the southern Rostov region on Wednesday, injuring soldiers. It said two of the missiles were shot down by an air defense system and four others deflected by electronic warfare assets.\n\n\u201cThis attack with Western long-range weapons will not be left unanswered and relevant measures will be taken,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time that U.S. officials have warned of potential Russian action or strategic moves, in part as a diplomatic effort to message Moscow and possibly sway decisions.\n\nIn the run-up to Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. openly discussed intelligence that Russia was readying troops to move on Kyiv. And later publicly said Moscow was positioning operatives in eastern Ukraine to conduct a \u201cfalse-flag operation\u201d that would create a pretext for its troops to invade.\n\nAccording to the U.S. officials, Russia has only a handful of the Oreshnik missiles and they carry a smaller warhead than other missiles that Russia has regularly launched at Ukraine.\n\nRussia first fired the missile in a Nov. 21 attack against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Surveillance camera video of the strike showed huge fireballs piercing the darkness and slamming into the ground at astonishing speed. It was the first time the weapon was used in combat.\n\nWithin hours of the attack on the military facility, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine\u2019s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia.\n\nThe attack came two days after Putin signed a revised version of Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine that lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.\n\nThat strike also came soon after President Joe Biden agreed to loosen restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of American-made longer-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory, and just one day after the U.S. said it was giving Ukraine antipersonnel mines to help it slow Russia\u2019s battlefield advances.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,\u201d Putin said at the time.\n\nHe also warned that the new missile could be used against other Ukrainian sites, including the government district in Kyiv, and last month said the General Staff of the Russian military was selecting possible future targets, such as military facilities, defense plants or decision-making centers in Kyiv.\n\nThe Russian president declared that, \u201cwhile selecting targets for strikes with such systems as Oreshnik on the territory of Ukraine, we will ask civilians and nationals of friendly countries there to leave dangerous zones in advance.\u201d\n\nPutin has hailed Oreshnik\u2019s capability, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at Mach 10 are immune from interception and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, Putin charged that \u201ca sufficient number of these advanced weapon systems simply makes the use of nuclear weapons almost unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia\u2019s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. They have said it is not technically a hypersonic missile as it does not have a hypersonic glide vehicle that propels the missile for most of the launch and re-entry.\n\nIntermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nFighting has escalated in the grinding war as both Russia and Ukraine scramble to get an upper hand in any coming negotiations. Trump's inauguration next month has also raised questions about how much support the U.S. will continue to provide to Kyiv.\n\nTrump has insisted in recent days that Russia and Ukraine immediately reach a ceasefire and said Ukraine should likely prepare to receive less U.S. military aid. Writing on social media last weekend, Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwould like to make a deal and stop the madness.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration, meanwhile, announced a $988 million long-term aid package last weekend. That funding is on top of an additional $725 million in U.S. military assistance, including counter-drone systems and HIMARS munitions, announced early last week that would be drawn from the Pentagon\u2019s stockpiles to get them to the front lines more quickly. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than $62 billion in military aid since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022."

            "article_content": "The world saw a staggering surge in conflicts over the past year. At least 233,000 people were estimated to be killed in conflicts in 2024, according to new data released Thursday by a prominent nonprofit analysis and crisis mapping project. The data, released today by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), shows in raw numbers how the level of conflicts around the world have doubled over the past five years, amid wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Myanmar and elsewhere.\n\nAmong the data for this year, ACLED found that the number of people killed in conflicts in 2024 had grown by 30 percent since the preceding year, from 179,099 deaths in 2023 to 233,597 in 2024.\n\nThe war in Ukraine was the deadliest in 2024, with 67,000 reported deaths, while 35,000 deaths were reported in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the end of the year, the number of acts of violence recorded by ACLED is projected to reach almost 200,000, a quarter higher than last year and double what it was five years ago, with sharp increases found in Lebanon (958 percent), as Israel staged a large-scale military intervention, and Russia (349 percent), which has seen more attacks amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe violence has remarkable reach. One in 8 people worldwide were exposed to conflict in 2024, ACLED found. Those living within five kilometers or less of conflict count as exposed. Palestinians face the highest level of violence in the world, according to the data, with 81 percent of the population exposed to conflict.\n\nThe peak may still be ahead. Clionadh Raleigh, a professor of political geography and conflict at the University of Sussex and founder of ACLED, said that she expected global conflict to continue its rise, pointing to \u201cpossible violent surges\u201d in Iran, Chad, Ecuador and Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world may be entering a \u201cnew normal\u201d of conflict, said Paul Poast, a professor at the University of Chicago who tracks global violence and was not involved in drafting the ACLED report.\n\nThat would have political implications in the United States, where President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to \u201cstop war.\u201d Trump \u201cclaimed that he is going to solve all of these conflicts as soon as he enters office (if not before),\u201d Poast said. \u201cIndeed, it stood out to me that during his victory speech on election night, the first thing he mentioned was ending all of the world\u2019s conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe data over the past few years paints an unsettling picture: Few regions saw a decline in conflict, while both Europe and the Middle East saw major escalations. Research by other groups describes the same trend. This summer, a report put out by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace identified 56 active conflicts taking place at that time, which it said was the most since the end of World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe founding hope of the United Nations, international peace is an increasingly distant prospect, as the trend builds over consecutive years.\n\nHigh levels of conflict worldwide have multiple and complex causes, including choices made by world leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. But there have also been global shifts in the way that conflicts are fought, according to the data collected by ACLED.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, conflict became more urbanized and concentrated, and the same places and communities have been attacked several times over,\u201d Raleigh said, adding that the world had seen a 300 percent increase in the use of bombing over the past five years.\n\nThe widespread use of missiles, drones and explosives by governments has added further to the levels of conflict, Raleigh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome conflicts appeared to be tied to electoral politics, according to the ACLED data, with countries that held elections seeing a more significant rise in violence. Roughly 80 countries, together holding more than half of the world\u2019s population, held national elections in 2024.\n\nThe conflict data tracks incidents of what the authors call political violence \u2014 defined to including battles, bombings and other violent acts \u2014 and excludes nonviolent protest. ACLED notes it also recorded more than 143,000 protests in 2024.\n\nThe ongoing breakdown in global order and rising multipolarity, a world system in which power is more widely distributed, with global bodies such as the United Nations Security Council paralyzed, has led to major powers \u201casserting their regional influence and undermining one another,\u201d Poast said. U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the state of affairs as a \u201cpurgatory of polarity,\u201d in an address to the General Assembly in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nACLED, which has operated for as a nonprofit for just over a decade, collects its data through media monitoring as well as partnerships with international and local organizations. It aims to give a big picture view of trends in armed conflict through the collection of granular, detailed data.\n\nIn the year ahead, some of the conflicts could ease \u2014 particularly the war in Ukraine and fighting across in the Middle East. Some countries, like Madagascar, have seen a prolonged decline in political violence over recent years, according to ACLED.\n\nBut ACLED is predicting a 20 percent increase in conflict next year amid numerous regions of concern, including Colombia and Mexico, along with several areas of Africa like the Sahal and the Great Lakes region. The Middle East remains in a period of great uncertainty, while the risk of new wars involving China or Russia cannot be ruled out."

            "article_content": "With the end of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, the task of tallying the cost in human lives of a nearly 14-year-long civil war is continuing. Death toll estimates from the conflict are as high as 620,000, a staggering number in a country with a prewar population of 22 million.\n\nExperts say establishing the true scale of death is complicated, as estimates are drawn from different sources and methods and calculated in varying ways. Here\u2019s what we know:\n\nWhat is the latest death toll?\n\nAs of March, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had documented the names of 507,567 people who had died in Syria since the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011. The independent Syrian-run organization, which is based in Britain and collates information from multiple sources, said that it had verified another 110,343 deaths of people who were not named, bringing the total of civilians and combatants killed throughout the war to 617,910.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights, another independent human rights organization that has been tracking the toll since the start of the conflict, had counted a total of 231,495 civilian deaths through June.\n\nWhat does the United Nations say?\n\nThe Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last released an accounting in 2021, when it estimated that at least 580,000 people had been killed to that point, including 350,209 \u201cidentified individuals.\u201d The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, cautioned at the time that the figure was \u201cnot a complete number of conflict-related killings\u201d but that it indicated a \u201cminimum verifiable number, and is certainly an undercount of the actual number.\u201d\n\nBefore 2021, the United Nations had not released a report on deaths in Syria since 2014 because it said conditions on the ground made accurate documentation impossible. However, when the war reached its 10th year, the organization responded to the need for updated information with a new report. By then, the war had shifted from large-scale military hostilities to regional clashes between multiple armed groups, making access and accuracy even more complicated, so the U.N. stopped reporting numbers.\n\nHow is the death toll calculated?\n\nThe U.N. and the Syrian human rights organizations say they rely on on-the-ground interviews, news reports and publicly available information such as death certificates and hospital records. They then identify and exclude duplicates and records with only partial information from the total and check the results against other statistical estimates.\n\nCases where people had been taken into government custody with no documentation \u2014 the forcibly disappeared \u2014 are not part of the total, nor are cases in which victims are killed and their bodies not recovered.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights focuses on tallying civilian deaths. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also tracks deaths among the Syrian military, rebel factions, foreign militias and armed units sent by other governments that are party to the conflict, such as Israel, Russia and Iran.\n\nWill we ever know the final toll?\n\nThe end of the conflict will bring some clarity. When Damascus fell on Dec. 8, rebel groups opened Syria\u2019s prisons, freeing thousands of surviving detainees to the relief of friends and families. But thousands of other people remain missing.\n\nFadel Abdul Ghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, has counted more than 100,000 men, women and children who were \u201cforcibly disappeared\u201d by the Assad regime since 2011 and who were not included in any death toll. So far, he says, very few have emerged from the prisons, and he has been able to identify only about 3,000 death certificates.\n\nBased on what he has seen from the jails and the documents his team has obtained, Mr. Ghany estimated that at least 85,000 of those forcibly disappeared have been killed in al-Assad\u2019s detention centers."

Instead, research potential replacements while your old PC or Mac is still running. This will give you time to check specs, read reviews, and identify the best deals. By creating a shortlist of potential devices, you'll be ready to seize discounts when they appear.\n\nSignificant discounts are rare when shopping for a Mac, but third-party sellers often offer lower prices. For Windows PCs , there are numerous opportunities for discounts, especially on older models or less supply-constrained devices. Monitoring prices for a few months can help you spot the best available deals, allowing you to purchase when the price drops."

            "article_content": "[Shenzhen, China, December 11, 2024] GlobalData has released its 2024 Telco Cloud infrastructure competitiveness assessment report, which crowns Huawei as an industry leader across all dimensions. The report, titled Telco Cloud Infrastructure (NFVI): Competitive Landscape Assessment, provides a comprehensive evaluation of global Telco Cloud infrastructure vendors across key areas, covering architecture, management, market momentum, performance, platform intelligence, resilience, and professional services. Huawei's Telco Converged Cloud (TCC) was given a perfect score in all dimensions, solidifying its leading position in the NFVI market. The report attributes this outstanding performance to its industry-leading, carrier-grade capabilities, including an innovative dual-engine architecture, seamless hardware and software collaboration, and streamlined operations and maintenance.\n\nHuawei's Telco Converged Cloud recognized as a leader\n\nHuawei's TCC leads the way with its carrier-grade container solution powered by a dual-engine (OpenStack and K8s) architecture, the report notes. The approach accommodates both VMs and containers and enables operators to seamlessly transition from VMs to containers through software upgrades, significantly reducing time to market (TTM). With the multi-OS technology, this solution removes associated CNF upgrades during NFVI upgrades, addressing a persistent industry challenge. It also enables on-demand upgrades and seamless capacity expansion, simplifying the transition process.\n\nAccording to the report, Huawei's TCC continuously enhances its full-stack carrier-grade software and hardware collaboration capabilities to deliver an optimal service performance. Through system-level interface optimization and cross-layer collaboration, the TCC solution streamlines resource utilization and improves service forwarding and throughput efficiency. Leveraging intelligent algorithms, the solution enables remote server power management, reducing fragmentation within the IaaS resource pool. Furthermore, with proprietary chips and drivers, Huawei is the only vendor in the industry capable of dynamically adjusting CPU frequency or entering hibernation mode based on service loads, thereby achieving low carbon emissions and energy savings.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that Huawei's TCC solution enhances O&M through the use of various automation tools. By creating digital assistants and experts built on a foundation model, the solution reduces service handling time and workloads. The integration of digital twins facilitates cross-layer fault demarcation and automatic root cause analysis, enabling operators to quickly identify faults and alleviate O&M pressure. This results insecure, agile, and efficient network changes.\n\nBeing at a \"leading position\" in NFVI commercial deployments, Huawei not only \"plays a leadership role in standards organizations and industry forums\", such as ETSI, and open-source communities like OpenStack and K8s, but also significantly contributes to vendor interoperability testing, setting benchmarks for the global telecom industry's development, the report states."

Rodgers debuted the conspiracy, which has to do with apparent drones that have been flying over New Jersey, on The Pat McAfee Show earlier this week.\n\nAs Aaron Rodgers was discussing the drone sightings that have happened recently in New Jersey and Staten Island, Rodgers and the geniuses over at The Pat McAfee Show speculated that it could be aliens in the drones, which led the four-time NFL MVP down a tangent about wanting to have a \u201c5E experience\u201d with the aliens.\n\nThe five \u201cE\u2019s\u201d in the 5-E experience model stand for \u201cExcitement, Entry, Engagement, Exit, Extension.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about having a Friday night 5E experience.\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you have a big kind of meditation circle and then you call in the aliens and you use little green lasers to bring them in.\u201d\n\nAs for the drones, Rodgers says there\u2019s been some \u201ccrazy stuff\u201d happening and could barely contain his grin while doing so.\n\n\u201cDo you know what\u2019s been going on in New Jersey lately? And I\u2019m not talking about the football. There\u2019s been some crazy things going on,\u201d Rodgers said as Pat McAfee\u2019s production team cued up a video of the alleged drones. McAfee suggested it was a helicopter while co-host and perpetual floating head AJ Hawk said it was an airplane.\n\n\u201cHere we go. Look at this, cued up. What the hell is that? \u2026 That\u2019s large. What is that? \u2026 I\u2019ve seen that video. Bedminster, that\u2019s home to [predident elect Donald] Trump\u2019s golf course and our owner, Woody Johnson. So who knows, maybe those guys are\u2026\u201d Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cCowboys & Aliens is an incredible movie..

How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nWhat Is Life And How Can We Detect It?\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and Complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial life starts here\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide, and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. However, other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth, and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy for finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when the first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation by Chris Impey at University of Arizona.

            "article_content": "Nothing to worry about?\n\nNot according to a growing number of lawmakers and local officials who are becoming increasingly alarmed about the number of drone sightings reported near sensitive locations in New Jersey.\n\nOne candidate for governor says it might be time to declare a state of emergency while two congressmen have called for the drones to be shot down. One of those congressmen says evidence suggests that the sophisticated drones are tied to a foreign adversary, although the Department of Defense officials said there was no truth to that.\n\nDrones tied to Iran?\n\nU.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J. 2nd District, said \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d ties \u201cdrones could be the work of foreign adversaries, specifically Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we know that there are drones flying in from the direction of the ocean. We also know there is an Iranian drone mothership that is missing from port in Iran, with a timeline matching the emergence of these drones,\" Van Drew said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe time to act on this information is now before the threat escalates any further. These drones are intentionally flying in uncontrolled airspace, expertly navigating around areas with radar coverage,\u201d Van Drew said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pentagon, however, shot down that theory, telling the Wall Street Journal that the drones were not tied to any foreign adversary.\n\nVan Drew said the drones should be shot down in order to assess the threat.\n\n\u201cWe should have already taken action by imposing flight restrictions to regain our control. Whether this is a foreign adversary or even just a group of drone hobbyists, we cannot allow unidentified drones to operate freely in our airspace with no consequences and it is time we eliminate the threat they pose and shoot them down.\u201d\n\nDrone over Ocean County Drone over Ocean County (Ocean County Sheriff's Office) loading...\n\nTime for a state of emergency?\n\nState Sen. Jon Bramnick, R-Union, a candidate for governor, said a state of emergency should be declared to \u201cshut down the airspace to drones and allow the Department of Defense to investigate.\n\nOn Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testified in the House of Representatives that no evidence indicates the drones are threat, but added that \"we just don't know. And that's the concerning part.\"\n\nState homeland security officials met behind closed doors Wednesday morning with mayors from across the state.\n\nDrone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 Drone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 (Alette Knoblauch via Facebook) loading...\n\nWhat are people seeing? Army of drones\n\nPolice have been receiving reports about drones since Thanksgiving. The drones, some as large as cars, have been spotted near President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s properties, power lines, a reservoir, police stations and military installations.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said he saw police footage that recorded more than 50 drones coming from the ocean, with more than a dozen trailing a Coast Guard vessel. Coast Guard officials said they did not know their origin.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy, who last week first acknowledged the reports, says they do not appear to be a threat. But those statements do little to allay fears because Murphy and federal officials have also said that they do not know who is operating the unmanned aircraft.\n\nMurphy said the drones go dark after they are spotted, hampering efforts at investigating them.\n\nSome reports have been false, with people mistaking planes or helicopters for drones.\n\nOn Tuesday, police in Parsippany-Troy Hills refuted rumors on the Ring app community claiming that a drone had downed power lines in a fiery crash. Instead, a car crash had toppled a utility pole."

            "article_content": "Scientists have accidentally discovered a particle that has mass when it\u2019s traveling in one direction, but no mass while traveling in a different direction. Known as semi-Dirac fermions, particles with this bizarre behavior were first predicted 16 years ago.\n\nThe discovery was made in a semi-metal material called ZrSiS, made up of zirconium, silicon and sulfur, while studying the properties of quasiparticles. These emerge from the collective behavior of many particles within a solid material.\n\n\u201cThis was totally unexpected,\u201d said Yinming Shao, lead author on the study. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even looking for a semi-Dirac fermion when we started working with this material, but we were seeing signatures we didn\u2019t understand \u2013 and it turns out we had made the first observation of these wild quasiparticles that sometimes move like they have mass and sometimes move like they have none.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like an impossible feat \u2013 how can something gain and lose mass readily? But it actually comes back to that classic formula that everyone\u2019s heard of but many might not understand \u2013 E = mc2. This describes the relationship between a particle\u2019s energy (E) and mass (m), with the speed of light (c) squared.\n\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, nothing that has any mass can reach the speed of light, because it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it to that speed. But a funny thing happens when you flip that on its head \u2013 if a massless particle slows down from the speed of light, it actually gains mass.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. When the quasiparticles travel along one dimension inside the ZrSiS crystals, they do so at the speed of light and are therefore massless. But as soon as they try to travel in a different direction, they hit resistance, slow down and gain mass.\n\n\u201cImagine the particle is a tiny train confined to a network of tracks, which are the material\u2019s underlying electronic structure,\u201d said Shao. \u201cNow, at certain points the tracks intersect, so our particle train is moving along its fast track, at light speed, but then it hits an intersection and needs to switch to a perpendicular track. Suddenly, it experiences resistance, it has mass. The particles are either all energy or have mass depending on the direction of their movement along the material\u2019s \u2018tracks.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe researchers originally set out to study the quantum interactions in the material by watching how the electrons in it responded to light. They found that the energy level of the electrons followed an unexpected pattern as the strength of the magnetic field increases, which turned out to be a key prediction of semi-Dirac fermions.\n\nWhile it\u2019s pretty high-concept physics, the team says the discovery could eventually open up a range of applications for ZrSiS similar to that of graphene.\n\n\u201cIt is a layered material, which means once we can figure out how to have a single layer cut of this compound, we can harness the power of semi-Dirac fermions, control its properties with the same precision as graphene,\u201d said Shao. \u201cBut the most thrilling part of this experiment is that the data cannot be fully explained yet. There are many unsolved mysteries in what we observed, so that is what we are working to understand.\u201d\n\nThe research was published in the journal Physical Review X.\n\nSource: Penn State"

            "article_content": "Google captivated the tech world Monday with Willow, a new quantum chip that outperformed even the world\u2019s best supercomputer on an advanced test, and experts say this week\u2019s revelations are just the start of a new phase in cutting-edge computing.\n\nThe new chip, which wowed even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, can complete in five minutes a complex computation that would take the most powerful supercomputer 10 septillion years\u2014more than the estimated age of the universe, wrote Hartmut Neven, the founder and leader of Google Quantum AI, in a blog post.\n\nGoogle researchers were also able to prove for the first time that the chip\u2019s errors did not increase proportionately as the number of qubits, the basic information processing unit in a quantum computer, rises. The qubits in quantum computing are more prone to mistakes than a regular computer because they are highly sensitive to electromagnetic and other forms of interference and can only remain in a quantum state for very brief periods of time.\n\nBut in order for a quantum chip\u2019s calculations to make sense, it needs to have a very low error rate, Javad Shabani, a physics professor and director of the Center of Quantum Information Physics at New York University, told Fortune.\n\nGoogle\u2019s breakthrough is \u201cone of the highlights of the recent decade,\u201d he said, and could mean quantum computers are a step closer to being used for more practical purposes.\n\n\u201cClassical\u201d supercomputers, including the Frontier supercomputer, which is commonly recognized as among the most powerful, are used for advanced modeling and simulations. Yet, these supercomputers are more similar to the common laptop than you\u2019d think. They operate on the binary system of 0s and 1s that less powerful computers use, albeit at a much more advanced level. While supercomputers are undoubtedly powerful, they are huge pieces of machinery that use massive amounts of energy for cooling systems.\n\nQuantum chips like Willow operate on a much smaller scale. The qubits that make up these high-powered chips are roughly the size of an atom, and operate via the rules of quantum mechanics. The chips pack a computing punch at a minuscule level and with potentially better energy efficiency than supercomputers, but they\u2019re also limited in their uses.\n\nThe test Google ran on Willow is a \u201cbenchmark\u201d meant to show the quantum chip\u2019s capability relative to other systems, including the best existing supercomputers. Google in 2019 completed a benchmark test with its earlier Sycamore quantum chip and found at the time that the older chip could complete a calculation in 200 seconds that would take the best supercomputers thousands of years to complete, according to a blog post at the time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Willow chip has around double the qubits used to power its computing than that of the Sycamore chip, and exponentially more computing power than a supercomputer has for some uses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Willow findings show that quantum computers can perform much better than the best available supercomputers in certain cases, an assertion that just a few years ago was more widely doubted. It also possibly shifts the focus of future quantum chip development away from primarily trying to find a way to reduce errors to, instead, trying to increase the number of qubits that make up each chip, according to Rice University physics and astronomy professor and founder of the Rice Quantum Initiative Kaden Hazzard.\n\nGoogle\u2019s discovery is groundbreaking, but that doesn\u2019t mean your standard laptop will be replaced by a quantum computer anytime soon, Hazzard told Fortune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at least a few years away before we reach the kind of capabilities where the quantum computer can be used directly for things that have business applications, for example,\u201d Hazzard said.\n\nFears about Willow having the capacity to decrypt even the most advanced encryptions used in banking or tech are also overblown, Rice University assistant professor of computer science Tirthak Patel told Fortune. Solving such advanced cryptography would require a much more advanced chip than Willow, said Patel, and researchers are already finding ways to create quantum-proof encryptions.\n\nInstead, Willow is a stepping stone toward greater progress in quantum computing. Monday\u2019s findings confirmed it outperforms supercomputers in some cases and will do lots to convince naysayers of the potential quantum computing has to eventually help improve human lives, Patel said.\n\nStill, while it may be several years away, advanced quantum computing could be used to accurately simulate minuscule quantum systems like chemical reactions that could help discover new drugs, or solve quantum mechanical problems to build new types of materials or better catalysts for reactions, said Hazzard.\n\nPossibly sooner, the advanced computing ability of quantum chips could help improve weather predictions or streamline supply-chain efficiency, all while being potentially less energy-intensive than existing supercomputers, Patel said.\n\nBecause these types of applications can already run on quantum chips with fewer qubits and without the advanced error reduction that Google has shown is possible, better quantum chips could revolutionize these areas, said Patel.\n\n\u201cThe biggest task right now that most scientists and engineers working in the quantum computing field are concerned with is demonstrating the utility and practicality of quantum computing for different real-world applications,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhile this experiment hasn\u2019t done that just yet, it is a major milestone in that step.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

To a stately, scene-setting soundtrack inspired by 17th-century music, the Science Museum\u2019s new exhibition begins with an audience with not one but three French monarchs \u2013 or, rather, their portraits, aligned in an intimidating row: Louis XIV, the Sun King, who appears like a bewigged rake with a devilishly attenuated moustache; his great-grandson, Louis XV, who died, in 1774, of smallpox; and, finally, Louis XVI, surprisingly smiley given that, in 1793, he was beheaded at the Place de la Revolution in Paris. During their respective reigns, suggests this fun and fascinating show, the royal palace at Versailles became a hub of exhilarating scientific endeavour intended to further \u201cla gloire\u201d of France.\n\nAn early room makes plain the link between science and power. Copies of a pair of elaborate astronomical machines decorated with Louis XIV\u2019s solar emblem were presented as diplomatic gifts to the Chinese emperor during the 1680s. The versions on display typify the ornate scientific instruments throughout, which are often beautiful as well as practical.\n\nAn astronomical quadrant has the poise of a sleek 1960s abstract sculpture. A vast and fearsome \u201cburning mirror\u201d, designed by Louis XIV\u2019s firework-maker to harness the sun\u2019s destructive power, could zap and melt any object of the monarch\u2019s choosing \u2013 and looks like one of Anish Kapoor\u2019s polished Sky Mirrors. An elegant microscope with a barrel coated in turquoise treated leather made from the skin of a tropical stingray, and set within flowing bronze work, is, simply, a work of art.\n\nStaff with an untitled projection visualising the fountains at Versailles - Imageplotter / Alamy Live News\n\nNothing, though, skewers the imagination quite like two bespoke medical instruments \u2013 including a wickedly elongated curved scalpel, like a scorpion\u2019s flicking tail \u2013 which (and there\u2019s no way of sugar-coating this) were once deployed during a successful three-hour operation to rid Louis XIV of an anal fistula. The procedure was rehearsed, a label informs us, on \u201c75 impoverished people, some of whom died\u201d, and seemingly so traumatised the surgeon that he never operated again.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt points, the show gives the impression that France\u2019s kings were interested in science only when it could satisfy their megalomaniacal desires. Fireworks! A hot-air balloon! Never-ceasing fountains! All were seen at Versailles. At least, the latter would have been, if the supposedly state-of-the-art \u201cMarly Machine\u201d, a freakishly enormous and deafening hydraulic system with 14 paddle wheels, designed to divert water uphill from the River Seine to the palace\u2019s gardens, had worked as it was supposed to.\n\nA stuffed Indian rhinoceros, presented to Louis XV in 1769 - Isidora Bojovic | Mary Freeman\n\nA stuffed Indian rhinoceros, presented (very much alive) to Louis XV in 1769, and, we discover, fed on bread and given \u201cmoisturising oil massages\u201d, was once the \u201cmost pampered\u201d resident of the royal menagerie. Jean-Baptiste Oudry\u2019s memorable painting commemorating the first pineapples cultivated in Versailles\u2019s hothouses imbues a potted specimen of this tropical plant with the anthropomorphic presence of a grass-skirted dancer. A luxurious set of silver mathematical instruments beats the plastic ruler, set square and protractor I used to cart around at school.\n\nYet, the exhibition \u2013 a masterclass in brilliant, concise storytelling \u2013 also resists stereotypes regarding Versailles\u2019s vapid opulence by charting the emergence, during the Age of Reason, of a quest for empirical knowledge which could extend humanity\u2019s capacity for extraordinary feats. Fundamentally, this is a show about madcap imagination and invention. It\u2019s a blast.\n\nUntil April 21: sciencemuseum.org.uk\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
