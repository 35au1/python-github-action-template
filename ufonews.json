Looks like there\u2019s lots of reflection on the side of the vehicle. Not sure if that\u2019s from traffics or what.\"\n\nWhile another thought: \"It was just something tied to the door tied tight to hold it open. If you watch the door starts to close right before it happened.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThen a third argued: \"Not... really. Just actually look at the reflection and you see it actually goes on a lot longer than the 'object'.\n\n\"What likely happened here is the guy got knocked out by something from inside, or got electrocuted and jumped back.\n\n\"And at the exact same time some bug lit up in front of the camera.\"\n\nThe clip has divided the viewers (Reddit/u/kamm03)\n\nAdvert\n\nSomeone else also questioned: \"Idk.. the fact that the dog goes immediately towards where the object came from kinda freaks me out. Right after that, the dog does move to the body on the ground but its attention is immediately taken to that area. I wonder if the dog's sniffer picked something up.\"\n\n\"The eagle eyes that spotted the object circling around the cement mixer help confirmed depth and motion,\" a fifth added. \"This is a bug that is flying to the left, then towards the camera then up and over the top right edge of the camera nearly directly at it. Velocity and size of the object increase relatively proportionally to each other.\"\n\nWhatever your opinion, we can surely all agree how weird it is?"

While it\u2019s certainly not the first time someone reported seeing strange flying objects in the sky over San Antonio, it\u2019s an unusually clear video of what folks believe to be a UFO.\n\nA TikTok user shared a video of a mysterious rotating object hovering in the sky off North Alamo Street in Downtown San Antonio. While it appeared metallic or white in the video, the TikTok poster, Justin Delgado, says it nearly blended in with the darkest part of the sky.\n\nWhen the video was shared on Reddit, several commenters noted they\u2019ve been seeing mysterious objects in the sky more frequently as of late. Some said reports or quickly cropping up in New Mexico, Arizona and across the globe while other say they\u2019ve seen suspicious activity in Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI seen it all the way from Lacoste,\u201d Reddit user Historical_Wish_7627 commented. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing lots of weird stuff in the sky lately.\u201d\n\nAnother Reddit poster who lives in a rural area outside San Antonio reported seeing what looked like a satellite moving across the sky one night that faded into the night sky. The same poster says they saw a pair of mysterious lights, which they say wasn\u2019t a helicopter or airplane, hovering over the Alamo City.\n\nOthers were quick to quips on the speculation of aliens visiting San Antonio. In reference to a recent video of a mattress flying down a highway in the city, having dislodged off the back of a fast-moving pickup truck, Reddit users joked the mattress had made it into airspace.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe highway mattress has breached containment,\u201d Reddit user audientix posted, with many responding with their own jokes about the mattress being the sources of the conspiracy. There were plenty of other jokes to be made on the thread without reference to a mattress, though.\n\n\u201cThat was abuela\u2019s chancla after whooping you so hard it was sent into orbit,\u201d Reddit user Chiken_97 wrote."

In 2024, modern methods like DNA analysis and remote sensing technology revealed new evidence of past cultures, technologies, and social structures. But while archaeology often now advances through science, it still needs fresh excavations to feed future studies.\n\nHere are some of the most important archaeological discoveries from the last 12 months.\n\n1. Lidar reveals hidden cities around the world\n\nLidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging, an analog of radar and sonar that scans terrain with thousands of pulses of laser light every second. While the technology has been around for decades, its ability to detect vast structures beneath layers of vegetation and to map the subtle changes of ancient landscapes has recently revolutionized archaeology."

Roivant is discontinuing the development of a drug for the lung disease sarcoidosis following negative results from a mid-stage clinical trial.\n\nMoving forward with AI and drug discovery\n\nThe hype bubble of AI-driven drug discovery is getting a little precarious. We recently saw Insilico Medicine fall short on statistically significant efficacy with its AI-designed drug, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals showed no reportable efficacy with its own AI-discovered therapy.\n\nAI\u2019s true potential, Caleb Appleton of Bison Ventures opines in a new First Opinion essay, is in complementing traditional drug discovery, particularly in environments where data are plentiful enough to help answer specific biological questions.\n\n\u201cImprovements in efficiency will be real, but they won\u2019t take the $3 billion it costs to develop a successful drug to $50 million anytime soon,\u201d he writes. \u201cHow the industry reacts in the coming months and years will dictate whether we enter an AI winter.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead more.\n\n5 companies using AI to design small molecule drugs\n\nIn a related piece, STAT\u2019s Brittany Trang this morning highlights five companies in the AI-driven drug discovery space for small molecules.\n\nStartups like Terray Therapeutics and Isomorphic Labs are at the forefront of the field, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars to find new medicines. Interestingly, companies like Schr\u00f6dinger and Iambic are distancing themselves just a touch from labels: \u201cWe don\u2019t think of ourselves as an AI company,\u201d said Fred Manby, chief technical officer at Iambic Therapeutics \u2014 saying instead the company integrates machine learning with automated lab data, synthetic training data generated with computational physics, and Iambic\u2019s platform that \u201cenables us to move so effectively in discovery.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nUpdating the obesity drug tracker. Plus, a new feature\n\nFrom STAT\u2019s Allison DeAngelis: The competition to build better obesity drugs has gotten more intense than ever.\n\nA new quarterly update of STAT\u2019s Obesity Drug Tracker shows there are now close to 50 obesity drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, setting the stage for a news-filled 2025.\n\nLast week, Amgen \u2014 one of the pharma companies angling for a slice of weight loss drug sales \u2014 reported that its therapy MariTide led to an average of roughly 20% weight loss over a year. Boehringer Ingelheim has discontinued the development of an obesity drug targeting neuropeptide Y receptor type 2, while Arrowhead is moving its INHBE program into clinical trials. More startups clamored into the field this last quarter, including Kailera Therapeutics and Pep2Tango Therapeutics.\n\nAll told, the tracker is keeping tabs on roughly 150 drugs in development for weight loss and related conditions, about double the number of compounds than when STAT first published the tracker in fall 2023.\n\nTracking these updates is about to get even easier \u2014 you can register to get notified of updates to STAT\u2019s data tools and industry trackers, including the Obesity Drug Tracker, Generative AI Tracker, and CRISPR Tracker.\n\nGilead expanding in ADCs with Tubulis\n\nGilead Sciences is trying harder in the antibody drug conjugate space \u2014 partnering with Germany-based Tubulis in a deal worth $20 million up front to target solid tumors. Just last month, Gilead withdrew its antibody drug conjugate Trodelvy in bladder cancer, which had been approved in 2021, after a confirmatory trial failed. Trodelvy is still available for other indications, including some advanced breast cancers, and still remains a strong seller for the company.\n\nIn the deal, Gilead said Tubulis will design a topoisomerase I inhibitor-based ADC meant to have address challenges like durability and off-target toxicity issues.\n\nSanofi pours $1 billion into China for insulin plant\n\nSanofi just made its largest investment thus far in China, committing just over $1 billion to build a new insulin manufacturing facility in Beijing. This is Sanofi\u2019s fourth such site in China, which reflects the increasing demand for diabetes treatments for the 140 million adults there who have the disease. Sanofi\u2019s been in China for four decades now, and the company\u2019s plans are to integrate advanced automation, digital management, and sustainability practices into the plant.\n\nThis move comes amid challenges in China for Western pharma, FiercePharma points out, such as AstraZeneca\u2019s compliance woes and reported layoffs at Johnson & Johnson and Merck. Pfizer, meanwhile, has its own $1 billion planned investment in the country to accelerate drug development and support local biotechs.\n\nMore reads"

            "article_content": "\u201cThe web is a collection of data, but it\u2019s a mess,\" says Exa cofounder and CEO Will Bryk. \"There's a Joe Rogan video over here, an Atlantic article over there. There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.\u201d\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren\u2019t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can\u2019t do that, says Bryk: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.\u201d\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn\u2019t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it\u2019s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user\u2019s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven\u2019t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today\u2019s AI search engines as sandwiches with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here\u2019s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users\u2019 queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nA screenshot of Websets showing results for the search: \"companies; startups; US-based; healthcare focus; technical co-founder\"\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa\u2019s search engine predicts the next link. Type \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa\u2019s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That\u2019s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn\u2019t see this as a problem: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embed the whole web to be useful,\u201d he says. (Fun fact: \u201cexa\u201d means a 1 followed by 18 0s and \u201cgoogol\u201d means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)"

            "article_content": "1 Quality and Security Convergence\n\nIn 2024, we saw security start to shift left and become intertwined with product quality. In 2025, regarding quality and security as inseparable components of success will become the standard. This shift is fueled by heightened scrutiny from senior executives who recognize that flaws in either area can directly impact a company\u2019s reputation, revenue, and long-term growth. The days of siloed teams are fading. Instead, QA, development, cybersecurity, and product teams will work in tandem\u2014assuring fluid, cross-department engagement and collaboration, with all teams sharing roles and responsibilities to ensure holistic software integrity.\n\nA key driver of this trend is the push to make tools and processes more integrated. Whether it\u2019s enabling cross-team collaboration or ensuring seamless data sharing, businesses are beginning to recognize that fragmented systems slow innovation. High-quality, centralized solutions should become a core value to all companies who want to succeed in 2025. Resources to support this change should be understood as powerful investments that will aggregate value to the entire company, not only to the operational level. Companies that embrace integrated tools and cross-functional workflows will unlock faster time-to-market, elevate customer trust, and cement themselves as a strong competitor in the market."
