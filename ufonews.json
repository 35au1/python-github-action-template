Some of their most popular songs include Everybody in Love, One Shot, Beat Again, and more recently, Eternal Love and Day One.\n\nThey changed their name from UFO, which stood for Unique Famous Outrageous, when appearing on the hit TV show as it was already in use by another band in the industry. They stayed true to the acronym theme and settled on JLS, which stands for Jack the Lad Swing, combining the phrase 'Jack the lad' and the urban music of new jack swing.\n\nCommenting on this revelation on X (formerly Twitter ), one user said: \"My whole world collapsed when I found out that JLS didn\u2019t in fact stand for \u201cjust love songs\u201d like I thought it did in 2010.\" Confused, one fan asked on Fanpop : \"What does Jack the Lad Swing mean?\" In response, one user said: \"Jack the lad is a really old saying meaning like a man who is a bit cheeky, has loads of girls that like him. Cool and hangs around with his friends and has like a joke. And swing just makes it a bit more music-like.\"\n\nImage: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images) Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\nAnother user added: \"In the book it says: Jack the Lad is like a name for cheeky boys. And new swing is the kinda music they were into. So Marvin's ex-girlfriend came up with Jack The Lad Swing (JLS). They were originally called: UFO (Unique Famous Outrageous) but Simon Cowell told them to change it in Bootcamp.\"\n\nA third user said: \"Jack the lad was a saying years ago, and they added Swing on the end to make it cooler :) but I'm not too sure what it means.\" Active between 2006 and 2013 and 2020 to present, the band has been on tour this year and today released their 15th anniversary album, J15.\n\nJLS's J15 \u2013 Anniversary Edition tracklisting:\n\n1. Beat Again\n\n2. Everybody in Love\n\n3. Keep You\n\n4. Crazy for You\n\n5. Heal This Heartbreak\n\n6. Close to You\n\n7. Only Tonight\n\n8. One Shot\n\n9. Private\n\n10. Don't Go\n\n11.

        "article_content": "Among the decades-old Windows apps to get renewed attention from Microsoft during the Windows 11 era is Notepad, the basic built-in text editor that was much the same in early 2021 as it had been in the '90 and 2000s. Since then, it has gotten a raft of updates, including a visual redesign, spellcheck and autocorrect, and window tabs.\n\nGiven Microsoft's continuing obsession with all things AI, it's perhaps not surprising that the app's latest update (currently in preview for Canary and Dev Windows Insiders) is a generative AI feature called Rewrite that promises to adjust the length, tone, and phrasing of highlighted sentences or paragraphs using generative AI. Users will be offered three rewritten options based on what they've highlighted, and they can select the one they like best or tell the app to try again.\n\nRewrite appears to be based on the same technology as the Copilot assistant, since it uses cloud-side processing (rather than your local CPU, GPU, or NPU) and requires Microsoft account sign-in to work. The initial preview is available to users in the US, France, the UK, Canada, Italy, and Germany.\n\nIf you don't care about AI or you don't sign in with a Microsoft account, note that Microsoft is also promising substantial improvements in launch time with this version of Notepad. \"Most users will see app launch times improve by more than 35 percent, with some users seeing improvements of 55 percent or more,\" reads the blog post by Microsoft's Windows apps manager Dave Grochocki."

        "article_content": "Windows 11\u2019s Paint and Notepad apps are getting smart new AI features \u2013 though one of the best will be for Copilot+ PCs only\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Microsoft\n\nNotepad is getting a rewrite feature and generative fill is coming to Paint\n\nThere are a fair few more AI abilities coming too, including generative erase\n\nOne of the most impressive, generative fill, will only come to Copilot+ PCs\n\nWindows 11\u2019s Paint and Notepad stock apps have been worked on considerably in the recent past, and are getting some new AI features \u2013 albeit they\u2019re only in testing for now.\n\nMicrosoft tells us that updates for these apps have started to roll out to testers in the Canary and Dev channels (which are the two earliest test channels).\n\nLet\u2019s start with Notepad which is getting a new \u2018Rewrite\u2019 ability. This works as you might imagine \u2013 you select some text, then fire up the tool which uses generative AI to do what it says on the tin, rewriting those words.\n\nYou get three different rewrites to choose from, and it\u2019s possible to fine-tune the AI\u2019s responses, so you can ask for something longer, for example, or in a different tone.\n\nThis ability is rolling out to testers in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, and Italy. As with most of the new features here, it\u2019ll require you to be signed in with a Microsoft account.\n\nNotepad AI rewrite feature\n\nThere\u2019s another non-AI benefit for Notepad here in that the app will launch faster. Microsoft claims that Notepad will open more than 35% more swiftly, with some Windows 11 users seeing a speed boost of 55% or maybe even more. So, Notepad should be considerably nippier when appearing on your desktop.\n\nPainting clever\n\nMoving on to Paint, this core app is getting a feature called \u2018generative fill\u2019 which can be used to easily add an AI-generated element to an image.\n\nThe example Microsoft shows is a person making a landscape who decides they want a castle in the picture. So, they simply select the area where they want it situated, and feed the AI a prompt \u2013 in this case \u2018medieval castle\u2019 \u2013 and Paint goes through its processing for some seconds before the castle appears.\n\nIt\u2019s nice and seamlessly integrated into the landscape, too, although we guess as ever with AI, the results could be variable. If you don\u2019t like what Paint has provided, you can ask it to try again, and generative fill will run once more to deliver a different take on a castle (or whatever it is you want).\n\nMoving from creation to destruction, we have \u2018generative erase\u2019 also inbound for Paint. This lets you highlight an element in an image \u2013 a person in the foreground for example \u2013 and it\u2019ll be removed, with Paint filling in the empty space left to match the background. Again, it\u2019s clever stuff.\n\nIn this case, you brush over the area to be erased, allowing for a more fine-tuned selection than generative fill where you draw a box.\n\nMS Paint\n\nAnalysis: Copilot+ caveats\n\nThese are some pretty nifty AI-powered abilities with some slight caveats. The main one being that Paint\u2019s generative fill is only going to be available with Copilot+ PCs that have a Snapdragon (Arm) CPU initially. We presume it\u2019ll come to other (non-Arm) Copilot+ PCs soon enough \u2013 but as to whether Windows 11 users with a \u2018normal\u2019 PC will ever get it, that might not be the case (as it may require the beefy NPU which is a requirement for a Copilot+ machine).\n\nAll the other features are coming to non-Copilot+ devices, mind, but there\u2019s another bonus here for Copilot+ PC owners. This is that Cocreator in Paint \u2013 which is also exclusive to these Windows 11 devices, and creates AI-generated images from scratch \u2013 has been made faster, with fine-tuning to its \u201cunderlying diffusion-based model\u201d as Microsoft explains. So, everything you do with Cocreator should happen more swiftly.\n\nThe other potential catch, we guess, is that this is more fuel to the fire of discontent for some users who think that Notepad is getting beefed up too much with features \u2013 those folks would no doubt say bloated \u2013 and that this is at odds with its core philosophy . That said, at least the freshly introduced sizeable performance boost for booting the app will go down well.\n\nAll of these features are still in early testing, as noted, so it could be some time before they hit PCs running the release version of Windows 11. Microsoft sounds like it\u2019s being cautious with the rollout in testing, as it\u2019s going to \u201cmonitor feedback and see how it lands\u201d before pushing these updates to more Windows Insiders. Even if you\u2019re a tester, then, you may not see these new features for a while yet.\n\nYou may also like..."

        "article_content": "Outer Banks has become one of the most popular teen dramas on Netflix over the years. The mystery series recently finished airing its fourth season, keeping viewers engaged with the story of the Pogues, a group of teens who seek a treasure to get rid of their financial troubles.\n\nAs the fourth season ended with surprising twists, fans can\u2019t help but wonder if and when the show will return with new episodes on Netflix. Here is all you need to know about the renewal status and release date of Outer Banks Season 5.\n\nOuter Banks Season 5: Renewal Status And Release Date\n\nOuter Banks fans would be happy to know that the show has already been renewed for a fifth season. Netflix announced the renewal ahead of Season 4 premiere in November 2024. The streaming platform also revealed that the show will end with Season 5. \u201cFrom this beginning, we imagined a mystery that would lead to a five-season journey of adventure, treasure hunting, and friendship,\u201d creators Josh Pate, Jonas Pate, and Shannon Burke said in a statement.\n\nWhile Netflix still needs to set a premiere date for Outer Banks Season 5, we can make an educated guess about the release timeline based on the previous trend. There was a gap of 18 months between seasons 2 and 20 months between seasons 3 and 4. Since the fourth installment premiered in October 2024, season 5 is expected to release in the first half of 2026. Meanwhile, the creators have already started working on the script for the final season.\n\nOuter Banks Season 5: Plot\n\nIn Outer Banks Season 5, fans can expect a thrilling conclusion to the Blue Crown treasure hunt. Creator Burke said this final quest will carry the Pogues through to the end, making it their biggest adventure yet. But there will also be a lot of emotion involved as the group mourns JJ\u2019s tragic death.\n\nThis season will focus on the Pogues\u2019 promise to get justice against JJ\u2019s father, Chandler Groff. Meanwhile, John B and Sarah will deal with big changes in their lives as they prepare to become parents.\n\nOuter Banks Season 5: Cast\n\nMost of the main cast members will reprise their roles in the final season, including Chase Stokes as John B, Madelyn Cline as Sarah, Madison Bailey as Kiara, Jonathan Daviss as Pope, Carlacia Grant as Cleo, Drew Starkey as Rafe, and Austin North as Topper.\n\nHowever, Rudy Pankow will lno longer be seen in the show as JJ died in the Season 4 finale. \u201cI want to leave the cast and crew with the biggest thank-you. It\u2019s been such a pleasure to come to work. \u201cThis is by far the biggest thing I\u2019ve ever done in [my] experience, and to have this as my start is a start of a lifetime. I\u2019m going to miss it,\u201d Pankow said in an official statement following his exit.\n\nFor more such updates, check out Hollywood News.\n\nMust Read: Top 8 Paranormal TV Shows: From The Fall Of The House Of Usher To The Haunting Of The Hill House\n\nFollow Us: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Youtube | Google News"

Pompeii and Herculaneum were two settlements wiped off the face of the Earth and buried under pyroclastic surges, with left victims frozen in suspended actions as they instantly died.\n\nTo this day the death toll remains unknown, with 20,000 people living in both cities. So far, remains of more than 1,500 people have been found across the two locations.\n\nAfter the ruins of Pompeii were excavated, with it now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the desperate remains of people caught up in the eruption were found by archeologists.\n\nAdvert\n\nCast of a man with a child, both of whom died in Pompeii (Marilla Sicilia/Archivio Marilla Sicilia/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images)\n\nObservers who look at such remains see the final moments and stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.\n\nBut new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem, and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.\n\n\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d\n\nMs Mittnik and her colleagues carried out tests on 14 casts of victims found in Pompeii's ruins, where they found that they had been wrongly identified.\n\nIt wasn't just people who perished in the eruption (Ivan Romano/Getty Images)\n\nInstead of being family, one cast of a man holding a child found that the youngster was unrelated to the person assumed to be their parent. This discovery was found in a location known as 'the house of the golden bracelet'; named after an intricate piece of jewellery, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd at least one of the two people locked in an embrace, long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter, was a man. Their research was published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology.\n\nLong thought to be a sister with their mother or daughter, the other person was in fact a man (Archaeological Park of Pompeii)\n\nThe study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.\n\n\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analysed different samples,\u201d said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Brian Babineau/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nDepth has been the key to the Golden State Warriors' hot start.\n\nThe Warriors are 7-1 and fresh off an upset victory over the defending champion Boston Celtics. This has come with the full roster contributing, as the team is consistently playing 11 players a night and have even reached 13 on some occassions.\n\nWhile this has been very effective, Tim Bontemps of ESPN reported that the team knows this isn't a sustainable approach but that it can help the aging roster manage the regular season schedule and potentially return to contention in the Western Conference.\n\n\"Privately, the Warriors admit they know they can't play this way forever,\" Bontemps wrote. \"But what's proving true is that this strategy can help through the grind of the 82-game regular season and set up Golden State to be a factor in the West.\"\n\nStar guard Stephen Curry acknowledged that the grind of the season forces rotations to \"get smaller,\" per Bontemps, but the diverse usage has certainly helped him remain at the top of his game. Curry is averaging 21.2 points, seven assists and 5.2 rebounds through five games while playing 27.6 minutes per game.\n\nCurry has only played less than 30 minutes per game in one season during his NBA career and that number will likely increase as the season continues. However, the lesser usage should help the 36-year-old remain fresh as the season goes on.\n\nThis will be crucial for a Warriors team that fell in the Play-In tournament in 2023-24. The franchise has been in that round in the two seasons following its 2021-22 NBA Championship, and avoiding it could help the team go on a potential run in the postseason."

It could even replace your full-time income.\n\nKendall VanGilder, who started listing apparel on eBay in 2022, turned the side hustle into a full-time business in 2024.\n\n\"I have had months where I've exceeded what I've made from my previous job,\" the former Lululemon employee told Business Insider.\n\nThe majority of her income comes from her eBay store, Style Secondhand, but she also sells on Poshmark and makes money as a content creator. She's amassed more than 15,000 followers on TikTok, where she shares her thrifted finds and reselling tips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanGilder said she prefers to schedule her day \"like a corporate job,\" and works on her business between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. most weekdays. But in the early days of her reselling career, \"I was the most part-time that you could be. I was maybe listing five things a week. I was not consistent and lacked a little bit of motivation, just because I was working a full-time job.\"\n\nHer side hustle wasn't a time suck, nor did it cost her any money to get up and running.\n\n\"I was taking photos on my iPhone, I used natural sunlight, and you can list everything from your phone, so you don't even need to have a desk setup,\" said VanGilder. As for inventory, \"you can go into your closet or other places throughout your house and list things, and as long as you're making money on what you're listing, then you can take that money and reinvest it.\"\n\nVanGilder shops for inventory at Goodwill, Salvation Army, and other thrift stores. Courtesy of Kendall VanGilder\n\nThe first item VanGilder sold was a pair of Urban Outfitters shorts for about $13. While she still occasionally sells items from her own closet, she picks up most of her inventory from Goodwill, The Salvation Army, Plato's Closet, Uptown Cheapskate, and Style Encore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You can really make it so that you don't have any startup costs,\" said VanGilder, who also took advantage of free shipping supplies from USPS.\n\nWorthwhile purchases for a reseller: LED lights and a thermal printer\n\nVanGilder says two business-related purchases have been completely worth the money: LED lights and a thermal printer.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBefore she purchased lights, she was limited to when she could take pictures of her items.\n\n\"I couldn't really photograph on days that were dreary,\" she said. \"It was maybe $110, which is a lot but not the fanciest lights you can get. It helped that roadblock that I would hit when it was a rainy day, and I wanted to work on my photos, but I couldn't because I didn't have the sunlight.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanGilder packs and ships all of her orders. Courtesy of Kendall VanGilder\n\nPhotos are a key component of any strong listing, said VanGilder, who prefers to photograph her items on a crisp, white background.\n\n\"Look at your listing as if you were a buyer: Would I want to buy that based on the photos and price?\" she advised. \"And if your answer is no, you need to figure out why.\"\n\nAnother item that's helped her buy back time as her business has grown is a thermal printer, which is designed for printing labels.\n\n\"Cutting and taping from a regular printer would become very time-consuming if I was still doing it that way,\" said VanGilder."

        "article_content": "Generative AI is still very much an emerging technology and it\u2019s morphing and evolving rapidly, as is illustrated with the trend toward agentic AI, which we\u2019ve written about previously. But enterprise adoption is ramping quickly and organizations are moving from testing out the technology to applying it to various use cases.\n\nJeremy Foster, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Compute, saw that at a recent meeting of the IT vendor\u2019s Customer Advisory Board, where almost all of the companies said they had AI projects underway to one degree or another.\n\n\u201cSome of those projects might be starting in the cloud and some of those projects might be starting in projects on-prem, but we\u2019re seeing that process accelerate over the last six months or more from where it was and we think it\u2019s just going to continue to go faster,\u201d Foster told The Next Platform. \u201cSome of them made initial orders and they are waiting on delivery. Between the order and delivery, they\u2019re defining their use cases and how they\u2019re going to develop those applications to deliver value. It\u2019s still very early in the enterprise, but it\u2019s not one or two organizations of ten, it\u2019s eight or nine. When they get there, it\u2019s all going to come very, very fast.\u201d\n\nOne challenge they\u2019ll have to contend with is ensuring they have the right infrastructure to run AI workloads. According to Cisco\u2019s AI Readiness Index, 89 percent of IT professionals surveyed said they plan to deploy AI workloads within the next two years, but only 14 percent said their infrastructure is ready for the jobs. Overhauling infrastructure can be a costly and complex proposition.\n\nCisco is looking to make that transition easier and cheaper with new hardware offerings announced this week at its Partner Summit in Los Angeles that pull from its UCS portfolio and validated design initiatives, which put as much of the technology needed into converged and highly integrated systems. Such offerings are important to enterprises that are weighing what AI tasks they want to do in the cloud and on premises.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a lot of preference for being able to deploy things on-prem and the infrastructure patterns depend on what you\u2019re going to do,\u201d Daniel McGinniss, vice president of product management for Cisco Compute, told The Next Platform. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re training as an enterprise in the cloud and then you go on-prem. People have a lot of data on-prem and that\u2019s got a lot of gravity. If a lot of these applications are important to them, are their crown jewels, then they\u2019ll want to run them on-prem. That will lead to what we\u2019re seeing, which is all the use cases around all this coming together and taking the guesswork out, because all of those infrastructure patterns are different. I will do inferencing on a CPU but I won\u2019t be doing training on a CPU. Some of our large enterprise customers are doing that training in the cloud or maybe they\u2019ll be doing that training on-prem.\u201d\n\nAt the event, Cisco unveiled the UCS C885A M8 servers, aimed at large GPU-intensive AI training and inferencing jobs. It\u2019s the latest edition to the UCS portfolio, which Cisco first introduced in 2009 as it expanded its datacenter presence beyond networking to compete with the likes of Dell and Hewlett Packard in compute.\n\nThe UCS C885A M8 is built atop Nvidia\u2019s HGX supercomputing platform and is powered by eight Nvidia H100 or H200 Tensor Core GPUs or eight AMD MI300X OAM GPUs \u2013 support for Intel chips is expected later \u2013 and includes a Nvidia ConnectX-7 network interface card (NIC) or BlueField-3 SuperNIC for each GPU, allowing for AI model training workloads to run across a cluster of the servers. There also are Nvidia BlueField-3 data processing units (DPUs) and comes with two 4th or 5th Gen EPYC chips from AMD.\n\nThe systems are managed via Cisco\u2019s Intersight cloud-based platform.\n\nAt the same time, Cisco announced its AI PODs, which extend the vendor\u2019s validated designs \u2013 which Cisco has been offering for more than two decades \u2013 with pre-configured infrastructure stacks for AI inferencing workloads that can scale from edge deployments to large-scale clusters to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\nThe AI PODs are based in large part on Nvidia technology, including its GPUs and AI Enterprise software platform and HPC-X toolkit, as well as Cisco\u2019s UCS X-Series modular design, chassis, M7 compute nodes, a PCI-Express node with Nvidia GPUs, Cisco UCS fabric interconnects, and Intersight management software.\n\nIt also includes Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift application platform and the ability to choose between Nutanix, NetApp\u2019s FlexPod or Pure Storage\u2019s FlashStack.\n\nSuch a technology stack can be benefit to organizations still trying to get their heads around the complex infrastructure environment needed for AI, according to Cisco\u2019s McGinnis.\n\n\u201cPeople have been doing virtualized environments for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the beginning, that was confusing, too. Now we\u2019re seeing the same thing. It\u2019s almost history repeating itself. The concept of a stack is really reassuring to a customer in that they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know yet. They don\u2019t know how to size their environment yet and they don\u2019t understand this combination of CPUs and memory and drives and GPUs. It\u2019s a whole new vector that needs to be considered. There\u2019s a confidence when we can say, \u2018We\u2019ve already done the sizing for you. Here\u2019s this entire stack for where you need to get started.\u2019 They will customize it and deviate as they learn more about their needs and their environments, but the concept of a of a solution is probably very important.\u201d\n\nThe UCS C885A M8 servers \u2013 which can be ordered now and will ship by the end of the years \u2013 and AI PODs (orderable in November) are joining a growing portfolio of AI infrastructure from Cisco, which includes 800G Nexus switching platforms running on the Cisco Silicon One G200 chip and the Nexus HyperFabric AI clusters developed with Nvidia and introduced in June and which combine Cisco\u2019s AI networking with Nvidia\u2019s accelerated computing and AI Enterprise software and a data store from VAST.\n\nCisco\u2019s Foster said Nexus HyperFabric AI clusters, which will be orderable next year, allow enterprises to quickly get the necessary AI network in place.\n\n\u201cIf you think about training two networks, you\u2019ve got the frontend network and backend network,\u201d he said. \u201cWe collapse that together one Ethernet network and allow them to manage them all the way from the network down to the NIC on the back of the server and then we leverage Intersight to keep that server environment up and running and optimized based on the requirements of their use cases.\u201d"
