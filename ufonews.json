FOX 5 New York\n\nManhattan Alien Abduction: 35 years later\n\nOne of the most famous \u2014 or infamous \u2014 alleged close encounters in the city is now the subject of \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction\u201d on Netflix, with Linda Napolitano\u2019s claims the subject of as much attention as they were doubt.\n\nNapolitano, then 41, lived with her husband and two sons in an apartment near the Brooklyn Bridge at the time of the alleged abduction 35 years ago.\n\nThe native New Yorker said that on the night of Nov. 30, 1989 she was lifted out through her apartment wall in a beam of light, soared above the East River into the sky over Manhattan, and into a clam-like alien spaceship that appeared to contain volcanic fire.\n\nNapolitano shared her story with Budd Hopkins, a ufologist who was in the midst of documenting a case study centered around what he believed to be a credible individual.\n\n5 Manhattan resident Linda Napolitano claimed she was abducted by aliens in 1989. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe alleged abductee\u2019s hypnotic regression in the days after the event is shown in the docuseries.\n\n\u201cOh I feel like electricity just went through me,\u201d Napolitano says in one exchange with her eyes closed and Hopkins leaning over her, head in his hand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone in the room,\u201d the allegedly hypnotized Napolitano says in the footage.\n\n5 Napolitano\u2019s alleged alien encounter was featured in the Netflix documentary series \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction.\u201d Courtesy of Netflix\n\nShe then describes being lifted through her solid door, floated in the air in her nightgown, and drawn into a fiery clam.\n\nInterview footage, both contemporary and from the early 90s, show witness accounts of varying credibility and veracity. Many critics later poked holes in her claims.\n\nThe Mysterious \u2018Near Miss\u2019\n\nA commercial plane had a \u201cnear miss\u201d with a cylindrical object off the coast of New York that has yet to be identified or explained, according to Congressional testimony from Pentagon representatives from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\nAn airline crew reported to the Federal Aviation Administration that their commercial plane \u2014 from an unnamed airline \u2014 had a \u201cnear miss with a \u2018cylindrical object\u2019 while over the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d\n\nThis undated encounter was just one of more than 20 reports made over the past year that have stumped AARO investigators, with agency director Jon Kosloski describing them as \u201ctrue anomalies.\u201d\n\nKosloski revealed to a congressional oversight committee that the agency received 757 reports of sightings from May 1, 2023 and June 1 of this year.\n\nThe \u201cclose call\u201d off the coast of New York is considered one of 21 anomalous cases that require further investigation, according to the agency.\n\nJohn Lennon\u2019s close encounter\n\n\u201cImagine\u201d that: John Lennon reported seeing a UFO in New York on Aug. 23, 1974.\n\nThe famed singer-songwriter said in an interview after the event that he had seen an unique aircraft zooming around the East River from his apartment.\n\n\u201cUp there, I saw a UFO,\u201d Lennon said to an interviewer, pointing to his penthouse apartment that overlooks the water.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd it went down the river, turned right at the United Nations, turned left, and turned down the river.\n\n5 John Lennon claimed to have seen a UFO in New York City in 1974. Photo by Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a helicopter, and it wasn\u2019t a balloon, and it was so near,\u201d Lennon said, animatedly to the interviewer.\n\nLennon described the craft as being \u201csilent\u201d and \u201cdark.\u201d He said it was round, black or gray in the middle, with blinking lights that looked like \u201clight bulbs\u201d circumscribed on the sides, and was completed with a red light on its top.\n\nLennon tried to take photos of the craft \u2014 none of which came out legibly \u2014 and even called the cops, who said they had received other calls about an object flying through the sky, according to The New Daily.\n\nLennon also commemorated the occurrence in the liner notes of his album \u201cWalls and Bridges,\u201d writing, \u201cOn the 23rd Aug. 1974 at 9 o\u2019clock I saw a U.F.O.\u201d\n\nLatest mystery\n\nEarlier this week, a local news station aired video that incidentally showed a mysterious orb appearing to zoom down the Hudson River.\n\n5 The blue orb was caught on camera during a helicopter news report. FOX 5 New York\n\nA local report on congestion pricing aired a random four-second clip of the lower Manhattan skyline, the Hudson River and parts of New Jersey.\n\n\n\nIn that clip, a mysterious blue orb can be seen apparently zooming down the Hudson River and past the camera.\n\nAvi Loeb, a theoretical physicist, cosmologist and Harvard professor, believes the apparent orb is a trick of the lights.\n\n\u201cThis is most likely an optical artifact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera, namely a bright spot from the reflection of sunlight as the camera gradually changes its orientation relative to the sun and the ground,\u201d Loeb tells The Post.\n\nOthers believe that it was a physical object merely affected by the speed of the helicopter and the angle of the camera."

As per some more code digging by the team at Android Authority, the advanced Gemini Live voice mode could soon let you dig deeper into YouTube videos.\n\nThe idea is you could have a natural conversation with Gemini Live about a video you're watching on your phone, in addition to the Ask about this video feature that's already available if you need explanations or summaries.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLastly, a potential interface change has been spotted for Gemini Live, again by Android Authority. Hidden code in the Android app suggests you'll soon be able to pause and resume chats from a notification in the status bar.\n\nThe advantage of using Gemini Live over the other Gemini input modes is you can talk with it as you would a real person \u2013 with interruptions, pauses, and so on \u2013 and these tweaks would make the AI app even more useful."

            "article_content": "Flagstaff\u2019s Lowell Observatory recently opened the long-awaited Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center. Hundreds of visitors flocked to the new exhibits, which aim to connect people to the universe in unexpected ways. You can feel the texture of Saturn\u2019s rings, jam to the music of interstellar space, and even smell moondust.\n\nA brass band ushers in the ribbon cutting ceremony. Three years of construction and $53 million led up to this moment. Despite gray skies and a few flakes of snow, a large crowd is on hand to give a resounding cheer as the doors officially open.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Lowell Observatory's sole trustee, William Lowell Putman, cuts the red ribbon to officially open the doors to the Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nLowell Observatory has been an active research facility for more than a century (it\u2019s famous for the discovery of Pluto in 1930) but executive director Amanda Bosh says bringing in the public is part of their mission, too.\n\n\"It\u2019s not enough to just learn things about the universe,\" Bosh says. \"If you don\u2019t spread that out and tell everybody else about it, then it doesn\u2019t benefit people as much as it could, so that is a big part of who we are and what we do.\"\n\nFor Bosh, it\u2019s about expanding perspectives: \"Connecting to the night sky connects us to who we are, how we came to be humans.\"\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Exhibits in the Stardust gallery at Lowell Observatory's new Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nThat theme is clear in the new Stardust gallery\u2019s interactive exhibits. One family creates a hip hop mix out of the sounds of space, while nearby Haley Johnson uses a touchscreen to design a space mission to Saturn\u2019s largest moon Titan, exclaiming in delight when the activity is finished, \"I did it! I completed my research!\"\n\nFor some in the crowd, Lowell has always been a treasured part of the community. Sandra and Saylor Darling are newlyweds who celebrated their engagement here on Mars Hill.\n\n\"It's so beautiful,\" Sandra says of the new discovery center.\n\n\"This is making me so proud,\" Saylor adds. \"We're going to invite all our friends back.\"\n\nThey each sniff a silver tube that offers a whiff of the hydrocarbons found in moondust, and have wildly different reactions: \"It's almost pleasant,\" Sandra says, while Saylor interrupts: \"I think it's horrid.\"\n\nSamantha Christensen of Lowell Observatory led the design of the new exhibits. \"Everyone learns in a different way, so the more senses we can engage, we figure, the better,\" she says.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Kids play in the children's gallery, which has quieter areas with puzzles and games as well as interactive exhibits and a slide.\n\nShe gestures to the new children\u2019s gallery, where joyful chaos reigns as kids make water vapor rings, toss parachutes into wind tunnels, and launch model rockets. One girl dissolves into giggles when her rocket falls to pieces during launch. Christensen says the hands-on activities teach the scientific process: \"It's an opportunity to fail,\" she says, \"but fail in a fun way.\"\n\nTwelve-year-old Metta Kuehn says the rocket launching is one of her favorite activities: \"You pressurize it,\" she explains, \"and then you hit a button and the rocket shoots. It's really loud but really fun.\"\n\nKuehn has big dreams for her future: she wants to be the first person on Mars.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Opening weekend included live theater performances, a one-person show about the importance of imagination in science.\n\nAnd the kids here may be just starting out with a passion for science, but some grownups in the crowd are coming from illustrious careers. Famed comet hunter David Levy says he first saw Lowell in 1967 before it had a visitor center.\n\n\"Coming here today is like being wrapped in a cloud of passion and love for the night sky,\" Levy says. \"I\u2019ve been happy as a clam all day.\"\n\nAs night falls, visitors make their way to the open-air planetarium on the building\u2019s roof. It\u2019s just like any planetarium except the starry skies are real, not a projection.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Visitors enter the Stardust gallery, which has exhibits that engage nearly all the senses, including smell.\n\nLowell\u2019s historian Kevin Schindler says this is his favorite part: \"Seeing people come up here every night, and listening to them ooh and aah\u2014even if there\u2019s no program or anything, just looking up and seeing the night sky, or seeing the Milky Way in the night sky and being stunned by it.\"\n\nSchindler says they\u2019re all making their own discoveries, just as astronomers have done on this spot for more than a century.\n\n\"The need to explore and to look up and wonder, that\u2019s part of us,\" he says.\n\nA gasp rises from the crowd as they learn a bright star overhead is the planet Saturn. It\u2019s what every scientist and educator at Lowell was waiting for: that moment of awe."

The project is one of 16 being funded by the Council\u2019s \u00a362.6 million Towns Deal.\n\nThis world-class centre has transformed a disused underground Victorian reservoir into a 59-seater Planetarium, showcasing journeys through space with immersive shows. The original features of the reservoir, such as the intricate brick arches, have been preserved, keeping the history of the building alive.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe centre also features an exhibition hall, classrooms, meeting rooms, and a caf\u00e9. It is set to open to the public on Monday, 25 November.\n\nCllr Jason Zadrozny, Leader of Ashfield District Council, said:\n\n\u201cIt really is spectacular, and it is something that will transform the lives of not just the people of Ashfield but also further afield.\n\n\u201cIt has been incredible to see the building through the various stages of construction and to see the vision really come to life. I am proud to have played a small part in the process.\n\n\u201cThe immersive shows really are incredible, and I would encourage everyone to make sure they experience the Planetarium and all that it has to offer. This is something so unique and will see more visitors coming to Ashfield as they are transported through space.\n\n\u201cIt truly is an educational experience like no other and will hopefully inspire more young people to develop an interest in learning about space.\u201d\n\nSteve Wallace, Planetarium Project Manager, said:\n\n\u201cThis project has been a great example of how collaborative effort can produce amazing things. Our fantastic new Planetarium and Science Centre, sitting alongside our original observatory, will be a huge draw to bring people to the area and to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. We cannot wait to welcome our first visitors when we open our doors on 25 November.\u201d\n\nAdrian Grocock, Group Managing Director of G F Tomlinson, which delivered the project, said:\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to have completed works on this unique and significant Nottinghamshire landmark scheme \u2013 providing a world-class immersive facility for all ages in the heart of the Midlands.\n\n\u201cThe Sherwood Observatory will inspire and entertain visitors, and for many years to come, they will enjoy the knowledge and wonder that comes with understanding the science of space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wholeheartedly enjoyed working alongside the Sherwood Observatory team, Ashfield District Council, and other stakeholders who helped bring this incredible project to life.\u201d"
