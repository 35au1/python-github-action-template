It\u2019s peeling back the layers of an onion,\u201d said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\n\u201cThe best pilots in the world, that are our pilots, are telling us that these things are flying in close proximity to their aircraft,\u201d Burchett told \u201cNewsNation Prime.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Pentagon\u2019s alleged \u2018Immaculate Constellation\u2019 program?\n\nOne expert from Great Britain who will be watching the hearing believes that we will learn something, but not everything.\n\n\u201cDisclosure is a process, rather than a single event. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see on Wednesday a sort of parting of the curtains \u2018this is it\u2019 definitive explanation,\u201d said Nick Pope, UFO expert and retired U.K. Defense Ministry official.\n\nAlso appearing on \u201cNewsNation Prime,\u201d Pope said he\u2019s especially looking forward to the testimony of former U.S. Navy Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who knows about a part of the UFO/UAP issue that many people have never heard about: underwater phenomena.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026 is extremely sensitive because some of these things have apparently been tracking our ballistic missile nuclear submarines,\u201d he said.\n\nMystery drones flew over US base\n\nBurchett agrees, adding that Gallaudet \u201chas very compelling evidence\u201d\n\nTwo subcommittees of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee are holding the Nov. 13 hearing titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\u201d\n\nMany advocates of disclosure have high hopes for the new Trump administration when it comes to releasing files that have been secret for decades.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dropped heavy hints that he knows something,\u201d said Pope. \u201cHe\u2019s been pressured \u2026 to release the rest of the JFK files, which he says he\u2019s going to do early in his second term. Clearly in President Trump\u2019s mind, he links the UFO issue to the JFK issue \u2013 perhaps just in terms of public interest and the suggestion that there\u2019s a coverup and a conspiracy,\u201d Pope added.\n\nNetflix faces lawsuit over \u2018The Manhattan Alien Abduction\u2019\n\nBurchett is also optimistic that Trump wants to share more of what government agencies have compiled over the decades.\n\n\u201cI hope so. That\u2019s the signals I\u2019ve been given. I\u2019m convinced that that\u2019s what he wants, and that he trusts the American public,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump will move towards total disclosure.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Investigation Alien\u2019 delves into worldwide accounts of alleged UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters. Among these is a report from Council Bluffs, Iowa, dating back to December 1997. Locals claimed mysterious metal had fallen from the sky, with many suspecting it came from another world. However, Darrell Livengood offers a different perspective. He makes the argument that these claims are a hoax and presents a credible, logical explanation for what others believe to be genuine.\n\nDarrell Livengood Claimed He Could Explain the 1977 Sighting in Iowa\n\nIn December 1977, residents of Council Bluffs, Iowa, reported mysterious metal objects falling from the sky, sparking intrigue and speculation. Many witnesses described seeing a lava-like substance that solidified rapidly, embedded with blue shards. Resident Mike Moore explained that the blue fragments resembled glass from a 1950s-1960s camera but noted they didn\u2019t melt with the rest of the material. However, another resident, Darrell Livengood, shared a different perspective, recalling how he\u2019d returned from college for the holidays and gone out with three friends on December 17, 1977. Two of these worked for Union Pacific, and together, they decided to engage in some playful mischief.\n\nDarrell recounted that his friends had two tools they called \u201cchargers,\u201d which were actually similar to thermal welding devices. They decided to ignite them, and the resulting flame shot about 30 feet into the air, forming a smoke cloud that might have resembled a floating disc to onlookers. He added that the upward flame could have appeared to some as if it were moving downward. At the time, when people were collecting residue from the site, he and his friends remained silent, but over the years, he felt compelled to debunk the claims.\n\nDarrell insisted that the residue found at the site was nothing more than phosphorus and powder, supporting his claim that there was no mysterious or otherworldly explanation. Yet, when UFO journalist George Knapp took samples of the material for testing, an explosives chemist reported that the composition didn\u2019t match Darrell\u2019s account. According to the chemist, the substance couldn\u2019t have come from a thermal welding tool, as Darrell suggested. Despite the test results, Darrell remains firm in his version of events, convinced that nothing unusual occurred that day and that the incident was simply a misunderstanding rather than a supernatural encounter.\n\nDarrell Livengood is Leading a Fulfilling Life With His Wife Today\n\nDarrell Livengood is now happily settled in Surprise, Arizona, where he has crafted a fulfilling life surrounded by music, love, and a deep sense of gratitude. Darrell graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and later pursued higher education at the University of Iowa. After finishing college, Darrell embarked on a steady, dedicated career as a rural letter carrier for the USPS, a position he held for many years. His job took him across rural landscapes, connecting him to countless communities. When he eventually retired from the USPS, he was not quite ready to slow down. Seeking a new challenge, Darrell decided to take up work operating forklifts, finding fulfillment in staying active and continuing to work with his hands. He remained in this role for some time, easing into retirement at his own pace.\n\nDarrell\u2019s journey brought him back together with Marlo Keifer, the love of his life. After living together for ten years, they parted ways, and each went on a separate path. Nineteen years later, they reconnected, rekindled their love, and got married on February 18, 2014. Marlo brought two daughters into their relationship, adding to the joy in their life together, and the couple now enjoys a peaceful, contented life. Though Darrell is retired, his passion for music remains unwavering. In 2014, he proudly released his first album, \u2018Erie Canal,\u2019 a collection that reflects his lifelong love for storytelling through song. Today, Darrell and Marlo savor the simple pleasures\u2014Darrell, with his guitar in hand, is grateful for the family, friends, and moments that have shaped his journey.\n\nRead More: Donald Schmitt: Where is the UFOlogist Now?"

        "article_content": "WARNING TAKEN WITHOUT PERMISSION Matthew Szydagis, an Associate Professor of physics at the University at Albany\n\nA respected American scholar has processed the data to estimate the timeline for a potential \"catastrophic\" revelation of alien contact. Numerous experts in the UFO domain suspect the Pentagon of concealing proof of various UFO mishaps both within the US and globally. They argue that failing to execute a strategic program for disclosing such details to civilians will result in \"catastrophic\" exposure where incontrovertible evidence hits the public domain sans any precursor. This might spell serious repercussions, postulates distinguished UFO analyst Dr Steven Greer, positing that it could destabilise society and possibly spark riots or wars as humankind grapples with its abrupt shift in perspective. Matthew Szydagis, an Associate Professor in physics from University at Albany, authored an academic paper assessing the statistical odds of this apocalyptic disclosure occurring. While guesting on the UAP Studies podcast, he specified: \"I decided instead of letting things continue to be vague and qualitative to actually do the math.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 29: A group of protestors march in front of the General Accounting Office (GAO) 29 March to raise awarness about an examination being conducted by the GAO for documents about a weather balloon crash at Roswell, N.M. in 1947. The protestors believe the balloon was a crashed UFO. AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read JOSHUA ROBERTS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHis analysis emanated from the assumption that there's interaction with extraterrestrial intelligence on Earth, and that a number of reported UFO downfalls are credible. Matthew elaborated: \"I took the assumption that there is some sort of intelligence, they fly ships that can break down and that crashes like Roswell are not fictional but real. Then I went to calculate then how long is it before an accident that can't be cleaned up fast enough happens where the military-industrial complex no longer has control of the narrative.\", reports the Mirror. With the proliferation of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras in the hands of many, Professor Szydagis mentions that any crash occurring near a major city would be broadcast worldwide at lightning speed, thwarting any attempts at a cover-up. Professor Szydagis, in his academic paper, suggests that we might soon witness concrete proof of alien presence, predicting this evidence could emerge anytime from today until 2060. In the text, he notes: \"The results of simulations of numerous different potential scenarios, of varying degrees of pessimism/optimism, indicate that, if NHI/ETs is/are real, catastrophic disclosure may actually happen accidentally rather soon, with the mean expected year being 2040+/-20 under the default assumptions.\"\n\nFort Worth Army Air Field 8th July 1947: Jesse Marcel, head intelligence officer, who initially investigated and recovered some of the debris from the Roswell UFO site poses with debris. In mid-1947, a United States Air Force balloon crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Following wide initial interest in the crashed 'flying disc', the US military stated that it was merely a conventional weather balloon.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nHe comments further that in today's era, where artificially generated videos are rampant, the notion of a \"catastrophic disclosure\" leading to a genuine global crisis seems exaggerated. He goes on to say: \"People think that religion and politics and governments will fall apart. I'm not so sure I think most people wouldn't care I think that we're in such an era that actually people would just assume it's still fake and just not care.\" \"I'm not sure I buy into the idea that that capturing a crashed alien ship on your smartphone and uploading that, and having enough evidence from multiple people from different angles where it's really hard to claim that it's hoax..\" \"I think that even that is not going to really be catastrophic.\""

        "article_content": "Gemini is Google\u2019s most important product right now, with Google baking its genAI chatbot into as many products as it can. The Pixel 9 served as the key piece of hardware to showcase several new Gemini capabilities, including Gemini Live functionality. That\u2019s the equivalent of OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, which makes the AI sound like a real human.\n\nBut Google isn\u2019t happy rolling out Gemini to as many Android devices as possible. It\u2019s also targeting the iPhone, a potentially lucrative market for Google when it comes to its AI ambitions.\n\nRumors already say that Apple will soon offer chatbot choices to iPhone users by integrating Google Gemini into Apple Intelligence alongside ChatGPT. The latter will get a period of exclusivity since it\u2019s Apple\u2019s preferred partner for the launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhether or not Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, Google is testing another way to make Gemini available to iPhone users. The company rolled out a standalone Google Gemini app in some test markets, complete with Gemini Live functionality.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAn iPhone user posted screenshots on Reddit that prove the Google Gemini app for iPhone is legitimate. According to 9to5Google, the app is available in the Philippines, but you can\u2019t download it from the App Store in the US. I could not find a version of the app in the EU, but then again, the European block is never among the first regions to receive any new AI app.\n\nApp Store listing for the Google Gemini app. Image source: Reddit\n\nThe advantage of having a standalone Gemini app for iPhone is that you can talk to the chatbot directly without going through the iPhone\u2019s Google app. That\u2019s currenty the only way to access Google Gemini on iPhone without loading the chatbot in a browser. Gemini Live is not available in the Google app.\n\nHaving Gemini Live baked into a standalone Gemini app is even better. I got access to Advanced Voice Mode recently inside the ChatGPT app for iPhone, and it was an interesting experience. The smartphone is probably the place to talk to AI via voice rather than text prompts.\n\nGoogle Gemini app installed on an iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nGoogle will take advantage of the iPhone\u2019s Live Activity feature to let you talk to Gemini Live even when the screen is off or when you\u2019re using the iPhone for something else. ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode works similarly on the iPhone.\n\nAlso, if Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, it won\u2019t be available on most current iPhones. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series support Apple Intelligence. A standalone Google Gemini app would help fix that potential problem.\n\nGemini Live functionality in the Google Gemini app for iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Google will launch the Gemini app on iPhone, but it\u2019s probably only a matter of time until it happens. Apparently, Google started testing the standalone app only about a week ago."

        "article_content": "Charles Fort pioneered the paranormal and invented alien abductions The Book Of The Damned author was no crank or fraud, but someone who questioned everything.\n\nWe explore some of Wikipedia\u2019s oddities in our 6,922,857-part monthly series, Wiki Wormhole.\n\nThis month\u2019s entry: Charles Fort\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: From Mulder and Scully to Mabel and Dipper, inquisitive minds have long sought to peer beyond the veil of mystery and find the world\u2019s hidden truths. The early 20th century\u2019s foremost believer that the truth was out there was Charles Fort, a writer who wrote about what Wikipedia calls \u201cscientific anomalies,\u201d starting with his first book in 1919, the scientifically titled The Book Of The Damned. 1970s occult magazine The Fortean Times cemented Fort as the first name in strange phenomena.\n\nBiggest controversy: It\u2019s hard to tell how earnest Fort actually was. He once said \u201cI believe nothing of my own that I have ever written,\u201d and UFO writer Jerome Clark called him \u201cessentially a satirist.\u201d At the same time, his curiosity was genuine, and some of his writing had real merit. While he was interested in poltergeists, teleportation (he\u2019s believed to have coined the term), and may have been the first person ever to write about alien abduction, Fort was also fascinated by legitimate scientific phenomena that science had no explanation for\u2014ball lightning, phantom cats (big cats found well outside their natural geographic range), and unexplained disappearances.\n\nThe simplest explanation seems to be not that Fort was a crank or a fraud, but that he questioned everything unexplained, real or not.\n\nStrangest fact: Fort\u2019s friends started a Fortean society and had to trick him into joining. A group of writers including Ben Hecht, Theodore Dreiser, Alexander Woollcott, and Fort\u2019s editor Tiffany Thayer, organized a Fortean Society in 1931, full of writers who admired his ideas. But Fort himself was \u201clured to its inaugural meeting by false telegrams.\u201d Fort objected to the group, surmising that it would quickly fill up with true believers in the occult, and not questioners and skeptics as he was. He refused the presidency of his own fan club, and Dreiser had to step in in his place.\n\nThe Society petered out when Thayer died in 1959, but much of their materials passed to the International Fortean Organization (INFO), which started in the early \u201960s and still exists. The Fortean Times magazine began publishing monthly in 1973, and is still in circulation in the U.K.\n\nThing we were happiest to learn: While Fort is hardly a household name, he casts a long shadow. Sci-fi writers, including Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, and Robert Anton Wilson, have all noted him as an influence. Alfred Bester\u2019s novel The Stars My Destination names the first teleporter after Ford. And Stephen King mentions Fort in several books (the parents of the child at the center of Firestarter are advised to read Fort instead of Dr. Spock). Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 1999 film Magnolia is full of unexplained events drawn from Fort, (among other things, Fort was fascinated by animals falling from the sky without explanation), and a scene set in a library has one of Fort\u2019s books on display.\n\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: It was likely trauma that pushed Fort into Forteana. His father, a Dutch-born grocer, was authoritarian and abusive, so young Charles escaped as best he could, into books and nature. While he wasn\u2019t a good student, he was a voracious reader, and collected shells, minerals, and birds, with an eye towards being a naturalist. He escaped in a larger sense as soon as he turned 18, traveling around the western U.S., the U.K., and southern Africa, where he fell ill. (He was nursed back to health by a childhood friend, Anna Filing, who he soon married). But then another cruel fate befell Fort\u2014he became a freelance writer. He likely would have struggled on working odd jobs and publishing the odd piece in newspapers and magazines, except a wealthy uncle left him an inheritance large enough to let him quit his job and focus on writing about the truly odd.\n\nBest link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: One of the oldest strange phenomena Fort wrote about was spontaneous human combustion. Scientific debate still rages on whether the phenomena is real, but no one can deny that in rare instances, human remains have been found destroyed by an explosion with no apparent cause. Reports go back as far as 1731, when Italian Countess Cornelia Zangari Bandi was found dead one morning\u2014rather, her lower legs, three fingers, and part of her skull were found amidst a heap of ash in her bedroom. The case was famous enough that Dickens mentions the Countess in Bleak House, and the \u201cpossibility of what is called spontaneous combustion.\u201d\n\nScience\u2019s best guess at an explanation is that these incidents are not spontaneous, but caused by an external source like a cigarette, which ignites alcohol on the victim\u2019s clothes, and their body fat adds fuel to the fire. (Heavy drinking and low mobility that would prevent an escape do seem to be common factors in many spontaneous combustion cases).\n\nFurther down the Wormhole: Usually we take a few twists and turns to get to our next topic, but it\u2019s hard to resist going straight for List of Reportedly Haunted Locations. (Oddly enough, one of the Haunted Locations is named Charles Fort, but it\u2019s a fort in Ireland built for English King Charles II during Britain\u2019s long occupation of Ireland.) We\u2019ll find out whether we are or ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of no ghost next month."

        "article_content": "A team of biologists led by The University of Texas at Arlington has discovered a new tiny lizard species in the Paria Peninsula of northeastern Venezuela. This discovery, published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, highlights the unique characteristics of this gecko, including its small size (about 2.5 inches long), brown color, cone-shaped head, long snout and particular skull anatomy.\n\nThe new species, Pseudogonatodes fuscofortunatus, was identified through a combination of visual examination, molecular genetics and high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. Part of what makes this gecko unique is its distinct skeletal features, including fully separated nasal bones and fused parietal bones\u2014uncommon traits among similar geckos. These characteristics, along with genetic data, distinguish it from other species within the genus Pseudogonatodes.\n\nThe discovery was made during fieldwork in the evergreen forests of the slopes of mountains in the Paria Peninsula, an area in northeastern Venezuela that juts into the Caribbean Sea and is known for its high biodiversity, moderate temperatures and lush vegetation. The researchers collected specimens in 2002 and again in 2014, noting the gecko\u2019s unique skull structure, which led to further investigation. The species name, fuscofortunatus, reflects the brown coloration of the gecko and the fortunate circumstances of its discovery.\n\n\u201cThe Paria Peninsula, part of the Coastal Mountain Range of Venezuela, has been a hotspot for reptile and amphibian discoveries in recent decades,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Walter E. Schargel, a professor of instruction in biology and earth and environmental sciences at UT Arlington. \u201cThe region\u2019s complex geography and climate create diverse habitats that can support a wide range of species. The new gecko species adds to the growing list of reptiles that live only in this area, emphasizing the need for continued exploration and conservation efforts in the region.\u201d\n\nThe research team included experts from various institutions in the United States, Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Their collaborative efforts and combined field observations, museum specimen comparisons, DNA sequencing and advanced imaging techniques led to a comprehensive description of the new species.\n\n\u201cThis discovery not only enriches our understanding of the biodiversity in this part of Venezuela, but it underscores the significance of preserving these unique ecosystems,\u201d said Dr. Schargel. \u201cI hope this discovery fuels increased conservation measures to protect the habitats of this rare species and other native species in the region.\u201d\n\nThe study highlights the potential for further discoveries in the Paria Peninsula and similar areas, where many animal species remain undocumented. The use of modern technologies, such as CT scanning and molecular genetic analysis, play a crucial role in uncovering the hidden diversity of life on Earth, offering new insights into the evolutionary history and ecological adaptations of these fascinating creatures.\n\n***\n\nFunding for the project came from the U.S. National Science Foundation, a Biodiversity Consultancy grant through Oro Verde and Fundacion Proyecto Paria, the EDGE program of the Zoological Society of London, and Fondation Segre.\n\nAbout The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)\n\nLocated in the heart of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive teaching, research, and public service institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge through scholarship and creative work. With an enrollment of approximately 41,000 students, UT Arlington is the second-largest institution in the UT System. UTA\u2019s combination of outstanding academics and innovative research contributes to its designation as a Carnegie R-1 \u201cVery High Research Activity\u201d institution, a significant milestone of excellence. The University is designated as a Hispanic Serving-Institution and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education and has earned the Seal of Excelencia for its commitment to accelerating Latino student success. The University ranks as the No. 1 national public university in the U.S. for veterans (Military Times, 2024), No. 4 in Texas for advancing social mobility (U.S. News & World Report, 2025), and No. 6 in the United States for its undergraduate ethnic diversity (U.S. News & World Report, 2025). UT Arlington\u2019s approximately 270,000 alumni occupy leadership positions at many of the 21 Fortune 500 companies headquartered in North Texas and contribute to the University\u2019s $28.8 billion annual economic impact on Texas."

The second vehicle will be operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's National Deep Submergence Facility in Massachusetts. The institution is building the ROVs.\n\nThe vehicles are designed to work on a wider range of oceanographic ships, giving broader access and scope to researchers.\n\n\"Anything that creates a barrier to technology access can potentially be a barrier to discovery,\" said Leila Hamdan, USM associate vice president for research. \"The decision to fund and build these ROVs shows a commitment by NSF and NOAA to lift barriers and create increased access for the ocean science workforce of the future.\"\n\nStudents and faculty are learning more about the sea floor in the Gulf of Mexico with the mROV, in partnership with NOAA.\n\nThe vehicles are expected to generate new growth in the ocean-based blue economy workforce, Hamdan said.\n\n\"To operate these vehicles successfully, we will need skilled staff to maintain and operate them,\" she said. \"What better place to seek such skills than from our students in the Ocean Engineering program at USM.\"\n\nUSM\u2019s School of Ocean Science and Engineering offers a bachelor's degree in ocean engineering and a joint Ocean Enterprise Engineering Pathway program. The program also offers the opportunity for students to stay an additional year to earn a master\u2019s degree in business administration.\n\nUSM\u2019s Roger F. Wicker Center for Ocean Enterprise\n\nWhen the vehicles are operational, the USM ROV will be used in the Gulf of Mexico to help with NOAA's Mesophotic and Deep Benthic Communities restoration project for seafloor habitats damaged by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nThe USM-based ROV will complement the university's fleet of research vessels and other uncrewed vehicles and operate from USM\u2019s Roger F.

        "article_content": "The opinions expressed in this article are the writer\u2019s own and do not reflect the views of Her Campus.\n\nThis article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at Wilfrid Laurier chapter.\n\nMissing Out\n\nI used to struggle with FOMO, but over time it has gotten better. The more secure I became in my friendships and in myself, the less I felt like I needed to always be involved with everything. Yet, not being able to get concert tickets somehow sent me all the way back to middle school. All I could imagine was how much fun people were having without me. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be at The Era\u2019s Tour? A three-hour performance of all of Taylor\u2019s hit songs, it\u2019s not just a concert but a production. Even picking an outfit or making a friendship bracelet seems like an exciting rite of passage for the experience \u2013 an experience I won\u2019t be able to attend. In this instance, I would be missing out on something so big, it was only natural to feel sad about it. Usually, FOMO is irrational, but for me, this fear of not being able to go to The Era\u2019s Tour was a heart-sinking feeling. It was sadness mixed with a little bit of envy, which were two emotions that I didn\u2019t want to feel.\n\nHigh Hopes and Big Disappointment\n\nI distinctly remember when Taylor Swift announced the Canadian leg of her Era\u2019s Tour. There was excitement buzzing through my household, and I wanted those tickets so badly. It was moments of anticipation while simultaneously forcing everyone in my household to create Ticketmaster accounts in hope of getting a presale code. I thought there was no way a fan like me would not get the code. Someone in my household was going to be getting that golden ticket. Yet, when it came to the presale dates, there was no code \u2013 not with Ticketmaster, not with any special Avion Rewards. Nothing. It was definitely a disappointing feeling, and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to fly out of the country to attend a concert. My mom and I entered the radio contests and the 50/50 draws, but there was little to no chance that we would get to go to the Eras Tour. I tried telling myself that maybe general sale would still have some reasonable tickets, but it seems like in this time period, concert tickets are a luxury item. I could not find a ticket within my budget, and I also couldn\u2019t find a way to get to the concert. Toronto was already a busy city, and with thousands of fans travelling to the city, there were no hotel rooms available nor was there a transit service running when the concert was done. So even if, by some chance, I was handed a ticket to the concert, it wasn\u2019t feasible. It was something that I wouldn\u2019t get to experience firsthand.\n\nThe Scroll of Shame\n\nOn the day of the presale, whoever was able to snag some tickets for the concert made it very clear on social media that they were going to be there. It was the ultimate defeat. Seeing so many people getting the opportunity to experience The Era\u2019s Tour. I almost had to take a complete break from Instagram until all the buzz died down. There is nothing worse than wanting something so bad, just to watch other people parade it around. Social media turned into a scroll of shame, which was just another reminder of how unlucky I had been. It seemed as though everyone but me was able to get those tickets.\n\nAcceptance\n\nSo, finally, after a rollercoaster of emotions, I think I\u2019ve finally made peace with the fact that I would be missing out on the Taylor Swift Experience. No presale code, no affordable tickets, no way of getting to the concert, no way of staying overnight in Toronto \u2013 everything was out of my control. Maybe it was the long waiting period between the original ticket sales and the actual date of the concerts, but I\u2019ve accepted my fate. I went and saw the movie, which gave a sliver into what I would have experienced this month. It\u2019s not the real deal, but I\u2019ll take what I can get. Will the FOMO get worse again on the nights of the concert? Yes, I think so, it\u2019s unavoidable. The only thing left for me to do is to remind myself that I\u2019m not alone in this feeling. With so many avid fans in Canada, there are probably thousands of people who didn\u2019t get tickets either. Knowing that it wasn\u2019t just me who was stripped of this opportunity is a somewhat relaxing feeling, and at the end of the day, it is a concert. This isn\u2019t a life-defining moment for me, and whether I go to The Era\u2019s Tour or not, the world keeps spinning. Would I have had a great time if I went? Yes, but there will be so many chances for me to have fun, so I\u2019ll just have to make the most out of those."

        "article_content": "Women online have taken to filming ghoulish murder-fantasy videos in which they romanticize lacing men\u2019s beverages with deadly poison as a justifiable response to fears about abortion rights under a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nMany of the videos have been viewed millions of times on X or TikTok and feature young women fiendishly grinning as they adulterate a cup of tea or other drink with an unknown substance.\n\nSome of the women have dubbed the videos part of a \u201cMake Aqua Tofana Great Again\u201d (\u201cMATGA\u201d) movement, a nod both to President-elect Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (MAGA), and ancient killer Giulia Tofana, who has been adopted as the disturbed group\u2019s heroine.\n\nTofana was a 17th-century Italian woman who sold poison to wives who wished to dispatch their abusive husbands \u2014 resulting in the deaths of more than 600 men.\n\nTofana\u2019s signature brew was a mishmash of deadly ingredients such as arsenic and belladonna known as \u201cAqua Tofana,\u201d a concoction that was so effective, she is considered by many today one of the most prolific serial killers of all time.\n\nThe poison \u2014 believed to be flavorless and completely undetectable after death \u2014 was typically stored in ordinary cosmetics bottles, ensuring that a husband who was about to get whacked would be none the wiser to his impending fate.\n\nOne of the online clips shows a young lady with green hair, a backwards camo hat and a large, spiked septum ring with the text \u201cAqua Tofana isn\u2019t that hard to make\u201d superimposed over footage of her making the throat-slitting gesture with her thumb.\n\n3 Some women upset about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election win have posted murder-fantasy videos about poisoning men. X/ImMeme0\n\nMany of the videos include a portion of the Eminem song \u201cVenom\u201d in the background featuring the lyrics, \u201cThis f\u2013king world better prepare to get laced because they\u2019re gonna taste my venom.\u201d\n\nSome of the women don\u2019t mention Aqua Tofana specifically but instead show off their \u201cpoison rings,\u201d wearable baubles with a hidden compartment supposedly made to hold a lethal dose of a toxin.\n\n\u201cMy advice for American women,\u201d reads the text in a video of a woman standing by a body-length mirror.\n\n\u201cI know you will understand this.

It\u2019s giving off premeditated vibes. The internet is FOREVER. Also.. the 1600s were A LOT different than 2024 advancements in detecting POISON,\u201d reads the text positioned over a video of her scrunching her face in disbelief.\n\nLiberal women have been registering their dismay at the outcome of the election through the \u201cMATGA\u201d movement and a number of other ways, meticulously documenting everything online.\n\n3 The videos are part of the \u201cMake Aqua Tofana Great Again.\u201d 3 The videos reference Giulia Tofana, who allegedly killed over 600 abusive men with poison in the 17th century.\n\nSome have started shaving their heads, while others are engaging in sex strikes against men or committing to not getting pregnant or giving birth for the duration of Trump\u2019s second term, to protest what they see as potential draconian abortion measures to come under him.\n\nTrump helped pave the way in his first term for the conservative US Supreme Court that in 2022 overturned the Roe v. Wade decision ensuring abortion rights at the federal level. States now have the power to determine their own abortion laws instead.\n\nThe incoming president has stated repeatedly that he would veto a federal abortion ban. The number of abortions in America also has actually increased since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, according to the New York Times, even in states that have enacted new restrictions on the procedure."

        "article_content": "The market of employee monitoring software is on a great surge now, but what indicators will it reach in the next 5 years? It seems obvious that employee monitoring practice won\u2019t lose its positions. So, let\u2019s see what future trends will play a crucial role in further market development.\n\nAI-Powered Analytics and Predictive Monitoring\n\nArtificial Intelligence is a cornerstone in providing detailed, well-structured analytics, showing the effectiveness of the target employee.\n\nNow, not many companies offer AI-scoring; one such employee monitoring software is developed by Clever Control, a company taking a lead in this niche. The cases confirm that AI-reports contain trustworthy details. Besides, with AI, employee desktop monitoring can identify trends, highlight potential issues, and even predict future productivity patterns based on historical data. This data allows managers to predict challenges, adjust workflows, and support employees before issues get worse.\n\nBesides analytics, AI takes an active part in predictive monitoring. It is oriented on employee productivity monitoring through prediction of potential risks, including burnouts, declines in effectiveness, and non-meeting of deadlines. Such a proactive approach allows managers to streamline the workflow in the way the tasks are distributed equally among employees.\n\nSo, the introduction of AI elements into employee monitoring software makes it best to enhance productivity, to manage the tasks and deadlines, and to streamline the workflow. Additionally, executives may increase the chances to prevent internal data leakage.\n\nBut the AI application in the monitoring doesn\u2019t justify the ethics neglection. Employee monitoring ethics involves the prior notification and consent of workers.\n\nIntegration with Productivity and Collaboration Tools\n\nIntegration with productivity and collaboration tools is shaping the future of employee monitoring software. Employee pc monitoring maintains the \u201crelations\u201d with other productivity and collaboration tools. If your personnel are actively using such software as Trello, Asana or Teams, managers may integrate them to create a seamless workflow.\n\nThis integration enables monitoring tools to capture real-time data from the apps employees already use, offering a more complete view of productivity and engagement without disrupting their work routines. With integrated tools, managers can track project progress, view task completion rates, and measure productivity all in one place. This all-in-one approach saves time, reduces the need to switch between platforms, and provides actionable insights directly within the tools teams rely on every day.\n\nAnother key advantage lies in improved collaboration and team building. Managers, now, are capable of seeing and assessing the interactions inside the group of employees, one department staff. It all allows executives to build strong and trusting relationships. In the next few years, such integrations will make employee monitoring software a central hub for managing productivity and fostering stronger team connections.\n\nEnhanced Cybersecurity Capabilities\n\nBusinesses prioritize data security and protection, when addressing real time employee monitoring. The next 5 years will reveal how this software can enhance the protection of the company\u2019s confidential data. The developers of monitoring instruments will strive to design all-in one solution to either enhance productivity and to guarantee data security.\n\nFuture monitoring with cybersecurity elements can provide companies with almost bank-grade security by tracking activity logs of every employee. Activity logs include access to sensitive files, data transfers, and logins; if the employee monitoring system detects any suspicious patterns, such as unauthorized access or repeated login failures, it can alert security teams immediately.\n\nOne more benefit of enhanced cybersecurity is compliance support. Many employee monitoring tools are designed to help companies meet regulatory requirements for data protection, such as GDPR or HIPAA. By automating security audits and maintaining comprehensive logs, these tools make it easier for businesses to stay compliant and avoid costly penalties.\n\nRise of Customizable Monitoring Options\n\nThe future trends predict the necessity of the customizable monitoring options\u2019 rise. As many employee monitoring software will match this inquiry, the more profit the developers will get.\n\nCustomizable dashboards are also becoming a popular feature. These user-friendly dashboards let managers personalize their view, focusing only on the metrics that matter most to them\u2014whether it\u2019s productivity scores, time management, or collaboration data. By displaying relevant insights in a streamlined format, customizable dashboards make it easier for managers to assess team performance without getting bogged down by unnecessary details.\n\nFocus on Data Privacy and Employee Monitoring Ethics\n\nAs employee monitoring software becomes more advanced, data privacy and ethics have become crucial considerations. Companies are increasingly aware that monitoring must balance business needs with respect for employee rights. Today\u2019s software solutions often include privacy-focused features, such as allowing employees to see what data is being collected and providing transparency about the monitoring process. This openness fosters trust and reassures employees that monitoring is done responsibly.\n\nThis trend guarantees that the rights of every employee will be respected; the monitoring will include only work-related activities.\n\nSumming Up\n\nEmployee monitoring software is evolving rapidly, with future trends promising to make it more effective, flexible, and ethically responsible. As these practices continue to develop, businesses will have powerful tools to drive productivity while maintaining ethical standards. The key will be to adopt solutions that balance technological advancements with transparency and respect for employees, ensuring a productive and positive work environment for everyone."

        "article_content": "The iPhone is one of the most capable pocket cameras out there, especially if you harbor content creation ambitions, or simply want to stand out with \u201caesthetic\u201d videos destined for social media.\n\nIn either case, storage space is a luxury \u2014 especially for someone who is all-in on the mobile-only workflow of capturing, editing, and posting photos. Naturally, one would gravitate in the direction of buying an iPhone with additional storage, but they come in at quite a fat premium. The Apple storage tax, if you will.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\u201cGet yourself a portable SSD.\u201d That\u2019s a recurring piece of advice I\u2019ve received from many amateur \u201cmobigraphers\u201d and photojournalists in my circle. They\u2019re much cheaper and give you a lot more storage. It makes sense.\n\nBut an SSD dangling from the iPhone\u2019s USB-C port is not exactly a pleasant sight. The other solution is investing in one of those bulky protective cases, or even using a DIY contraption to hold the two devices in place.\n\nThe overarching theme here is that even if you\u2019re saving money on the storage upgrade \u2013 like any rational person \u2014 there is a convenience tax to be paid with a portable SSD. What if the SSD tapped into the potential of MagSafe, and stuck to an iPhone\u2019s rear shell like one of those pricey Apple wallets or power banks? Dockcase turns that \u201cwhat if\u201d into a reality.\n\nDockcase\u2019s Smart Magsafe M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure tries to solve all the problems mentioned above. It not only looks cool, but it\u2019s also one of the most practical iPhone accessories you can buy.\n\nWhat exactly is this thing?\n\nThe Dockcase device is an enclosure for a small format SSD. Specifically, 2230 and 2242 drives, the kind you will find crammed inside handheld gaming consoles such as the Steam Deck or the Asus ROG Ally. A few tablets, such as Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro, also rely on these compact SSDs as a space-saving solution.\n\nThink of this enclosure as a forever upgradable medium to park an SSD inside an iPhone. Theoretically, that is. The round enclosure takes small format SSDs that are dramatically more affordable than investing in a portable SSD.\n\nThe likes of Corsair and WD sell such small format SSDs for under $100, offering up to 1TB capacity. Taking into account how much Apple charges, Transcend\u2019s 128GB 2242 SSD costs just $25 \u2014 a quarter of what Apple demands for a similar capacity upgrade.\n\nThe inherent idea here is that you can buy an enclosure like this one from Dockcase, plop in an SSD, and still save a lot more money compared to what Apple would pull from your wallet for an equivalent bump in onboard storage capacity.\n\nFor anyone dreaming of cinematic 4K 24 frames per second (fps) or slo-mo 4K 120fps videos, Apple mandates external storage, so you will have to either invest in a portable SSD, or an enclosure like the one Dockcase offers and then buy a sufficiently fast stick of your own.\n\nHow the Dockcase accessory works\n\nDockcase supplied me with a test sample that came with a 128GB SK Hynix SSD installed within the enclosure. Thankfully, the retail package comes with a screwdriver, so you can easily remove the two screws holding the rear plate in place.\n\nThere are silicon pads underneath to make sure that the enclosure doesn\u2019t end up scratching the iPhone\u2019s glass shell. The magnetic grip is pretty solid, and during my time recording videos, it firmly held onto its spot firmly, irrespective of the phone\u2019s orientation.\n\nSetting it up is pretty easy. In fact, you don\u2019t have to do anything on the SSD\u2019s screen itself. There\u2019s a multifunction button on the side, which accepts both short clicks and long-press gestures for navigating through the UI, which is just a few pages deep.\n\nAll you need to do is plug in a USB-C cable in your iPhone\u2019s USB-C port, and the other end to the SSD enclosure. The cable Dockcase offers in the retail package allows 10Gbps passthrough, which is the bare minimum for allowing video capture on an external device.\n\nThe only criteria you need to keep in mind is that the SSD should be formatted with exFAT, which is fairly easy. As far as the build goes, Dockcase has used an aluminum alloy enclosure, which feels quite sturdy.\n\nThere are vents across the side circumference for heat dissipation. This is a crucial addition, as the kit tends to run hot. My most recent video capture session spiked the temperature levels to 123 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the display\n\nOK \u2014 let\u2019s talk about the display. It\u2019s not touch-sensitive, in case you\u2019re wondering. Ideally, when using an external storage device for shooting with a phone, you don\u2019t really need a screen atop the drive, since all the controls are available right on the phone\u2019s screen.\n\nOn the Dockcase MagSafe enclosure, you get a screen that offers an at-a-glance view for crucial information such as power loss protection (PLP) status, read and write speeds (during video capture), and battery health in terms of cycles.\n\nWith a long-press of the button, you will land on the menu page where you can enable or disable the read-only mode. This is a thoughtful addition, as it ensures that data is not deleted inadvertently, or any technical issue doesn\u2019t end up wiping a chunk of (or the entire) drive.\n\nThis is where you can also adjust the power delivery output) Why? Well, there\u2019s a second USB-C port on the device that supports up to 100 watts of output for charging the host device. You can also change the language, adjust the screen-on time, or entirely turn it off.\n\nMore importantly, this is the page where you can restart the SSD inside, or reset it. There\u2019s a chance that depending on the SSD formatting status or the native software presets, you might need to restore it.\n\nIn my case, the SK Hynix drive kept returning an error message every time I wanted to record ProRes footage. That kept happening despite the drive being in exFAT format and the iPhone also reading it properly in the Camera as well as the Files app.\n\nSince I didn\u2019t already have any data on it, I restored the SSD using the physical button on the enclosure. If you already have files saved on the drive, it\u2019s imperative to move them elsewhere before you restore the SSD.\n\nOh, also, a double tap on the button changes the screen orientation by 90 degrees. It\u2019s not exactly a life-changing perk, but it\u2019s still convenient in its own little way. Dockcase offers the MagSafe-ready enclosure in two variants \u2014 one with a 15W power supply and a pricier trim with a 100W power supply capacity.\n\nThe USB-C port is the USB v3.2 Gen 2 type, which means the peak speeds you get are 10Gbps. It\u2019s not the fastest, but gets the job done for most scenarios.\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nApple already limits the camera capabilities of your \u201cPro\u201d flagship if you invest in the lowest-priced 128GB storage variant, especially when it comes to capturing high frame rate ProRes capture.\n\nNow, it\u2019s already a crime if you sell a $1,000 phone with only 128GB storage, but that\u2019s just Apple. That status quo makes it abundantly clear that you need a solution, one that is going to stick with your iPhone, literally and figuratively, during the course of camera-first usage.\n\nAs you climb from 128GB to 256GB, you pay an extra $100. For that amount, you can get the excellent Samsung T7 portable SSD with 1TB capacity. If you go with the likes of Crucial or SanDisk, you can save even more of your hard-earned dollars.\n\nIf you\u2019re brave enough to spend on the equivalent 1TB version of the iPhone 16 Pro, your bill goes all the way up to $1,499. For the premium you pay to go from 128GB to 1TB, you can skip the Apple upgrade and buy the equivalent of 5TB storage in portable SSDs.\n\nThe disadvantage? You will have to go through the ordeal of plugging a cable into the iPhone\u2019s USB-C port in order to record all your footage on the external drive. Oh, the hassle! On the positive side, you won\u2019t have to go through the ordeal of trying to transfer all those videos to a computer.\n\nSo, which one is better? Well, if you value convenience, a portable SSD is the best choice. But if you seek the flexibility of swapping in small format SSDs with ease, using nothing but a screwdriver, then an enclosure is where you should look.\n\nThe Dockcase device just throws in a few extra conveniences, including MagSafe and a screen, to name a few. Looking over at the competition, rival brands that also offer similar enclosures miss out on facilities like auxiliary power ports, power loss protection, the assurance of a read-only mode, and health monitoring.\n\nA cool and practical investment\n\nRight now, the 15W version of the Dockcase MagSafe SSD enclosure starts at just $49 for early backers, while the 100W trim is going for $79 via the Kickstarter campaign. If you are after a gadget that offers the convenience of MagSafe and the versatility of a removable SSD, this can save you a lot of money.\n\nApple\u2019s current write speed requirements stand at 440MB per second for 4K 120 fps ProRes videos. Moreover, you need at least a USB-C cable with a 10Gbps transfer rate. With the Dockcase bundle, you are covered on both ends, as long as you pick a sufficiently fast small format SSD.\n\nThe pitfalls? Keep it as far away from water or dust as possible due to those heat vents on the sides. Also, if you are planning to use a gimbal, you are in for some awkward adjustments. Just let it dangle, I\u2019d say, for such scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, a solution like this is more of a necessity than a vanity purchase. For normal usage, I can wholeheartedly recommend this. But even if your iPhone has an ample amount of storage space, I suggest investing in something like this to shoot memories on the move and safely store them."
