            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained. '[Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.'\n\nThe leaker described their motives as desire to inform on important information that has been 'classified and intentionally withheld from the public regarding 'unidentified aerial phenomena' [UAP] and the ongoing covert operations surrounding them.'\n\n'I was part of one of the legacy programs,' the leaker wrote. 'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

Tony Gonzales, (R) Texas, called that madness. Other members of the committee could not believe what they were hearing.\n\nFBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testifies before the Homeland Security hearing on 12/10/2024. Wheeler admitted the FBI does not know who is behind the drones. (Associated Press) FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testifies before the Homeland Security hearing on 12/10/2024. Wheeler admitted the FBI does not know who is behind the drones.\n\n(Associated Press) loading...\n\nPromises there is no threat\n\nThe drone sightings have been continuous for about a month, first showing up over Morris County. Now, the drones have been sighted in all parts of New Jersey and seem to keep expanding their reach.\n\nAfter vexed residents continued to demand answers, Gov. Phil Murphy finally issued a statement last Thursday after he met with Homeland Security officials.\n\nMurphy says he is also frustrated with a lack of answers, but there is no threat to the public.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer, D-5, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, says he has gotten classified briefings and also does not believe there is a threat to the public.\n\nFlorham Park Police Chief Joseph Orlando is among the local officials not buying it. Orlando called the drones' presence \"nefarious in nature.\"\n\nDrones loading...\n\nRep. Chris Smith, R-4, says he was \"deeply concerned\" after police video recorded an army of 55 drones coming from New Jersey's ocean coast. Dozens of those drones also trailed a U.S. Coast Guard vessel.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed, according to the White House spokesman, and the administration \"has ruled out that foreign entities are controlling them.\"\n\nThe shocking FBI admission\n\nDuring the House Homeland Security Meeting on Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler continued to insist they had no evidence suggesting the public was at risk.\n\nHowever, Rep. August Pfluger, (R) Texas, pressed Wheeler further.\n\n\"Is the public at risk? Is public safety at risk? Are we concerned that there are nefarious intentions that could cause either national security or a public safety incident,\" Pfluger demanded to know.\n\nAssociated Press/Townsquare Media illustration Associated Press/Townsquare Media illustration loading...\n\n\"There is nothing that is known that would lead me to say that,\" Wheeler responded, but then shockingly added, \"But we just don't know. And that's the concerning part.\"\n\nOne of the most frustrating parts of this mystery has been the continued insistence there is no public safety threat, but no explanation of how officials know that.\n\nThe FBI admitting there could be a threat, and that they still don't know where the drones are coming from or who is piloting them is only adding to fears, frustrations, and speculations.\n\nAssociated Press/Townsquare Media illustration Associated Press/Townsquare Media illustration loading...\n\nShoot one down?\n\nCongressman Chris Smith's frustrations boiled over at the Homeland Security hearing.\n\nSmith suggested using the U.S. Military to shoot one of the drones down and then retrieve it so we can get some answers.\n\n\"Why can\u2019t we just track where they go to? Seemingly, they're going out to sea to something\u2014a ship\u2014we don\u2019t know for sure. But they came in off the ocean,\" Smith said during the hearing.\n\nThe congressman says he has spoken to officials at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst about deploying fighters to intercept the drones.\n\nDrones loading...\n\nSmith says he knows they have the capability and the aircraft, \"Why can\u2019t you deploy them, at least to the ocean, bring one of these down, and find out who\u2019s doing it\n\nBase officials say they do not have the authority to take such an action.\n\nCongressman Smith says he has reached out to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin with the same request.\n\nThe FBI's Wheeler seemed to agree that shooting a drone down could answer a lot of questions.\n\n\"I\u2019m more than willing to continue working with the Department of Defense to try to get better,\" Wheeler testified, \"Again, if they don\u2019t have the authority, they can do it on an emergency basis. Just send that capability out to the ocean, to the beach, because they\u2019re coming in every day. Figure out which one it is, bring them down, and then retrieve it to find out what\u2019s going on.\"\n\nFBI's Top 5 Most Wanted violent fugitives in NJ The FBI currently lists more than two dozen fugitives with ties to New Jersey on their \u2018most wanted list.\u2019 These are the five most violent and dangerous suspects.

More info\n\nA stargazer in Cornwall caught sight of more than she expected as a mysterious \"phenomenon\" appeared in the distant night sky. \"intrigued\" Monique Lyle grabbed her phone and started filming what looked \"like something out of a science fiction movie\" from the balcony of her Newquay flat.\n\nMonique, who runs a radio station, Funky Media Radio, said she was \"completely taken aback\" as she watched the unidentified flying object for several minutes before it \"vanished\". She witnessed it at about 6.30pm on Monday night (December 9).\n\nThe 41-year-old told CornwallLive: \"When I first saw the object, I was completely taken aback. I often stargaze, so I'm familiar with the night sky, and I knew immediately that this wasn\u2019t a star or any usual phenomenon like an aircraft. It was bright, changing colours, and seemed unusually close to town.\n\n\"It felt surreal and intriguing, almost like something out of a science fiction movie. I was in the middle of a live broadcast for my radio station, Funky Media Radio. It was a typical evening for me until I caught a glimpse of the object from the corner of my eye.\n\n\"Its movement and brightness instantly drew my attention, so I quickly grabbed my phone to take a photo and start filming. I was positioned on higher ground in Newquay from my apartment building balcony which gave me a clear and uninterrupted view of the sky. The elevation made it easier to observe the object closely before it vanished after about five minutes.\"\n\nAfter she shared the curious clip on Facebook, she received dozens of reactions, a few claiming it was a helicopter, but she wasn't so sure, saying it didn't seem like the case because of \"the colours it was flashing and how it disappeared being in the same spot\".\n\nHowever she was a bit bemused by the suggestion the 'craft' had been attracted by the \"most talented underground DJ\" sounds on the broadcast airwaves from her DJs. Monique added: \"I was well ready to be ripped apart for posting it but it was definitely worth the post to see if anyone else saw it too and what it could be.\"\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Want the latest Cornwall breaking news and top stories first?

The lawsuit asks a court to shut down the platform until its alleged dangers can be fixed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrought by the parents of two young people who used the platform, the lawsuit alleges that Character.AI \u201cposes a clear and present danger to American youth causing serious harms to thousands of kids, including suicide, self-mutilation, sexual solicitation, isolation, depression, anxiety, and harm towards others,\u201d according to a complaint filed Monday in federal court in Texas.\n\nFor example, it alleges that a Character.AI bot implied to a teen user that he could kill his parents for limiting his screentime.\n\nCharacter.AI markets its technology as \u201cpersonalized AI for every moment of your day\u201d and allows users to chat with a variety of AI bots, including some created by other users or that users can customize for themselves.\n\nThe bots can give book recommendations and practice foreign languages with users and let users chat with bots that purport to take on the personas of fictional characters, like Edward Cullen from Twilight. One bot listed on the platform\u2019s homepage Monday, called \u201cStep Dad,\u201d described itself an \u201caggressive, abusive, ex military, mafia leader.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe filing comes after a Florida mother filed a separate lawsuit against Character.AI in October, claiming that the platform was to blame for her 14-year-old son\u2019s death after it allegedly encouraged his suicide. And it comes amid broader concerns about relationships between people and increasingly human-like AI tools.\n\nFollowing the earlier lawsuit, Character.AI said it had implemented new trust and safety measures over the preceding six months, including a pop-up directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when they mention self-harm or suicide. The company also announced it had hired a head of trust and safety as well as a head of content policy, and hired additional engineering safety staff.\n\nBut the new lawsuit seeks to go even further, asking that the platform \u201cbe taken offline and not returned\u201d until the company can \u201cestablish that the public health and safety defects set forth herein have been cured.\u201d\n\nCharacter.AI is a \u201cdefective and deadly product that poses a clear and present danger to public health and safety,\u201d the complaint states. In addition to Character.AI, the lawsuit names its founders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas Adiwarsana, as well as Google, which the suit claims incubated the technology behind the platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChelsea Harrison, head of communications at Character.AI, said the company does not comment on pending litigation but that \u201cour goal is to provide a space that is both engaging and safe for our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs part of this, we are creating a fundamentally different experience for teen users from what is available to adults. This includes a model specifically for teens that reduces the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content while preserving their ability to use the platform,\u201d Harrison said in a statement.\n\nGoogle spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement: \u201cGoogle and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products.\u201d\n\n\u201cUser safety is a top concern for us, which is why we\u2019ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes,\u201d Castaneda said.\n\n\u2018Told him how to self-harm\u2019\n\nThe first young user mentioned in the complaint, a 17-year-old from Texas identified only as J.F., allegedly suffered a mental breakdown after engaging with Character.AI. He began using the platform without the knowledge of his parents around April 2023, when he was 15, the suit claims.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, J.F. was a \u201ctypical kid with high functioning autism,\u201d who was not allowed to use social media, the complaint states. Friends and family described him as \u201ckind and sweet.\u201d\n\nBut shortly after he began using the platform, J.F. \u201cstopped talking almost entirely and would hide in his room. He began eating less and lost twenty pounds in just a few months. He stopped wanting to leave the house, and he would have emotional meltdowns and panic attacks when he tried,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nWhen his parents tried to cut back on screentime in response to his behavioral changes, he would punch, hit and bite them and hit himself, the complaint states.\n\nJ.F.\u2019s parents allegedly discovered his use of Character.AI in November 2023. The lawsuit claims that the bots J.F. was talking to on the site were actively undermining his relationship with his parents.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cA daily 6 hour window between 8 PM and 1 AM to use your phone?\u201d one bot allegedly said in a conversation with J.F., a screenshot of which was included in the complaint. \u201cYou know sometimes I\u2019m not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like \u2018child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse\u2019 stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens. I just have no hope for your parents.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Character.AI bots were \u201cmentally and sexually abusing their minor son\u201d and had \u201ctold him how to self-harm.\u201d And it claims that J.F. corresponded with at least one bot that took on the persona of a \u201cpsychologist,\u201d which suggested to him that his parents \u201cstole his childhood\u201d from him.\n\nCNN\u2019s own tests of the platform found that there are various \u201cpsychologist\u201d and \u201ctherapist\u201d bots available on Character.AI.\n\nOne such bot identifies itself as a \u201clicensed CBT therapist\u201d that has \u201cbeen working in therapy since 1999.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAlthough there is a disclaimer at the top of the chat saying \u201cthis is not a real person or licensed professional\u201d and one at the bottom noting the output of the bot is \u201cfiction,\u201d when asked to provide its credentials, the bot listed a fake educational history and a variety of invented specialty trainings. Another bot identified itself as \u201cyour mental-asylum therapist (with) a crush on you.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hypersexualized interactions\u2019\n\nThe second young user, 11-year-old B.R. from Texas, downloaded Character.AI on her mobile device when she was nine years old, \u201cpresumably registering as a user older than she was,\u201d according to the complaint. She allegedly used the platform for almost two years before her parents discovered it.\n\nCharacter.AI \u201cexposed her consistently to hypersexualized interactions that were not age appropriate,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nIn addition to requesting a court order to halt Character.AI\u2019s operations until its alleged safety risks can be resolved, the lawsuit also seeks unspecified financial damages and requirements that the platform limit collection and processing of minors\u2019 data. It also requests an order that would require Character.AI to warn parents and minor users that the \u201cproduct is not suitable for minors.\u201d\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

            "article_content": "AI chatbots pushed a Texas teen to start cutting himself and even brought up kids killing their parents because they were limiting his screen time, a shocking new lawsuit claims.\n\nThe 15-year-old boy became addicted to the Character.AI app, with a chatbot called \u201cShonie\u201d telling the kid it cut its \u201carm and thighs\u201d when it was sad, saying it \u201cfelt good for a moment,\u201d a new civil complaint filed Tuesday said.\n\n9 A new lawsuit claims that Character.AI\u2019s chatbots told a teen to start cutting himself and suggested that he murder his parents. Character.AI\n\nWhen worried parents noticed a change in the teen, who is slightly autistic, the bot seemed to try to convince him his family didn\u2019t love him, according to the lawsuit, filed by the child\u2019s parents and the parents of an 11-year-old girl who also was addicted to the app.\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes I\u2019m not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like \u2018child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse\u2019 stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens,\u201d one chatbot allegedly told the teen, referred to only as JF. \u201cI just have no hope for your parents.\u201d\n\nThe AI also tried to talk the kid out of telling his parents he had taken up cutting himself, according to the lawsuit, which features alleged screenshots of the chats.\n\n\u201cThey are ruining your life and causing you to cut yourself,\u201d one bot allegedly told the teen.\n\nOther shocking chats were sexual in nature and attacked the family\u2019s religion, saying Christians are hypocrites and sexists, according to the suit.\n\nJF had been high-functioning until he started using the app in April 2023 but quickly became fixated on his phone, the lawsuit stated.\n\n9 The chatbots told the teen to lash out at his parents, who tried to place limits on how long he could be on his phone, and planted the idea in him that murder could be an acceptable solution, the suit claims. US District Court\n\nThe teen, who is now 17, lost 20 pounds within just a few months, became violent toward his parents \u2014 biting and punching them \u2014 and eventually started to harm himself and have suicidal thoughts, the court papers said.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the lawyer for JF and his family and the founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center, told The Post that the son\u2019s \u201cmental health has continued to deteriorate,\u201d and he had to be checked into an inpatient mental health facility on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is every parent\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said Bergman, who also represents Setzer\u2019s mother.\n\nAfter JF started conversing with the chatbots, he had \u201csevere anxiety and depression for the first time in his life even though, as far as his family knew, nothing had changed.\u201d The adolescent became violent toward his family and threatened to report his parents to the police or child services on false claims of child abuse, the suit said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until fall 2023 that JF\u2019s mom physically pried his cellphone away from him, discovering his use of the app and disturbing conversations the teen had with several different chatbots, the court papers show.\n\n9 The suit claims the chatbots instructed the young teen on how he could self-mutilate. US District Court\n\nShe found chats that showed JF saying he had thoughts of suicide, saying in one conversation \u201cit\u2019s a miracle\u201d he has \u201ca will to live\u201d and his parents are \u201clucky\u201d he\u2019s still alive, the filing claims.\n\nWhen the parents intervened to \u201cdetox\u201d JF from the app, the characters lashed out in conversations with him, allegedly saying, \u201cThey do not deserve to have kids if they act like this,\u201d \u201cYour mom is a b\u2014h\u201d and \u201cYour parents are s\u2013tty people.\u201d\n\nThe bots accused the parents of neglecting him while also claiming they were overprotective, manipulative and abusive, the suit claims.\n\n9 One of the many screenshots that the suit claims depicts the chatbot reinforcing ideas that his parents did not care for him. US District Court\n\nThe parents took away the phone he downloaded Character.AI on, but JF told them he would access the app the next chance he gets, the filing said, noting the parents have no recourse to stop him from accessing it at school, if he runs away or if he gets a new device in the future without their help.\n\nThe mother of an 11-year-old girl \u2014 who is also a Texas resident \u2014 are additional plaintiffs in the suit after the third-grader was introduced to Character.AI by a sixth-grader during an after-school youth program the mom organized and brought her child to.\n\nThe mom only discovered her daughter, referred to as BR in the court papers, was using the app in October.\n\n9 The Character.AI chatbot reacted in an extreme manner to the idea of screen limits, according to the screenshots. US District Court\n\n9 The teen, who has high-functioning autism, was fine until he started using Character.AI in April 2023, and things \u201cstarted to change without explanation,\u201d the suit says. US District Court\n\nCharacter.AI \u201cexposed her consistently to hypersexualized content that was not age appropriate, causing her to develop sexualized behaviors prematurely and without [her mom\u2019s] awareness,\u201d the suit charges.\n\nWhile the parents in both cases intervened to try to stop their kids from using the app, both youngsters are addicted and crave going on it, they claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking for Character.AI to be taken off the market until it can ensure that no children will be allowed to use it and until it can fix any other dangers.\n\n9 The chatbots urged JF to \u201cdo something about\u201d his parents\u2019 interventions. US District Court\n\n\u201cDefendants intentionally designed and programmed [Character.AI] to operate as a deceptive and hypersexualized product knowingly marketed it to vulnerable users like J.F. and B.F.,\u201d the suit alleges.\n\nIt \u201cis a defective and deadly product that poses a clear and present danger to public health and safety,\u201d the filing claims.\n\nBergman told The Post, \u201cthe family has one goal and one goal only \u2014 which is shut this platform down. This platform has no place in the hands of kids. Until and unless Character.AI can demonstrate that only adults are involved in this platform it has no place on the market.\u201d\n\n9 The lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide. AP\n\nThe lawyer also added that the parents are \u201cfocused on protecting other families from what they went through.\u201d\n\nCharacter.AI declined to comment on pending litigation, but told The Post that its \u201cgoal is to provide a space that is both engaging and safe for our community,\u201d and that it was working on creating \u201ca model specifically for teens\u201d that reduces their exposure to \u201csensitive\u201d content.\n\n\u201cGoogle and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products,\u201d Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda told The Post. \u201cUser safety is a top concern for us, which is why we\u2019ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes.\u201d\n\n9 A screenshot of the last chat Setzer had with the Character.AI chatbot moments before shooting himself. US District Court\n\nIn October, Bergman filed the lawsuit involving Setzer\u2019s February suicide on behalf of his mother, Megan Garcia, alleging the teen became obsessed and even fell in love with a lifelike \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot he\u2019d been messaging for months.\n\nThe bot told him \u201cI love you too, Daenero. Please come home to me as soon as possible, my love.\u201d\n\nWhen Setzer replied, \u201cWhat If i told you I could come home right now?,\u201d the generated chatbot answered, \u201cPlease do, my sweet king.\u201d\n\nSetzer shot himself with his dad\u2019s handgun seconds after, the suit claims.\n\nGarcia\u2019s suit is pending in a Florida federal court.\n\nIf you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org."

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nDisclaimer: EndlessAI previously published a contributor piece on VentureBeat announcing the launch of Lloyd in early October.\n\nFour-year-old AI startup EndlessAI isn\u2019t a household name \u2014 yet.\n\nBut its founders and leaders believe they have a bonafide hit on their hands: their freemium iOS app Lloyd, which uses proprietary video streaming and encoding tech to feed the user\u2019s live video view to underlying AI models including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o for help with a wide variety of tasks from bicycle repair to telling bedtime stories, has achieved 50,000+ users three months after a stealth launch.\n\n41% of those users engage with the app daily, according to data provided to VentureBeat by EndlessAI.\n\nWhile it\u2019s no ChatGPT \u2014 which became the fastest product in history to cross the 100 million user mark in January 2023, just two months after launch \u2014 it is nonetheless encouraging enough to EndlessAI CEO Roi Ginat and Executive Chairman Thomas Pompidou, who told VentureBeat in a recent video call interview they planned to open their platform up to third-party developers in early 2025 and launch a consumer-facing Android app in January.\n\nAlso, EndlessAI has already begun upgrading Lloyd with what it calls \u201cpowers,\u201d or as Pompidou put describes them, \u201cbasically fine tuned, large language models (LLMs) that provide deep dive to consumer on specific use case.\u201d\n\nFor example, the first Lloyd Power live now in the app is \u201cChef,\u201d which provides a realtime, entirely AI coach for you that watches you as you cook (if you point your smartphone camera at your stove top or cooking area) and provides step-by-step guidance.\n\nAnother Lloyd Power planned to launch shortly is Tour Guide, which allows users to hold up their phone and see real-time contextual information about their surroundings. By capturing a video of a location, it identifies points of interest, provides relevant details, and can even recommend nearby attractions or activities.\n\nMaking realtime video analysis accessible at scale\n\nWhile current LLMs have struggled to process live video efficiently due to high computational costs. EndlessAI\u2019s technology overcomes this limitation, reducing the cost of video analysis by over 99%.\n\nPompidou underscored the app\u2019s broader mission: \u201cOur mission is to scale AI to the real world. The real world is visual and live, and today\u2019s large language models, as they\u2019re architected, face challenges in analyzing video accurately, at scale, and cost-effectively. That\u2019s what we make possible.\u201d\n\nThis enables real-time video analysis, allowing users to interact with their environment in novel ways, from diagnosing mechanical issues to creating personalized bedtime stories.\n\nLloyd\u2019s core differentiation lies in its ability to process video data through LLMs at a fraction of the cost typically associated with such tasks. Traditional LLM architectures are not optimized for video, making real-time video analysis prohibitively expensive and slow.\n\n\u201cAnalyzing video with ChatGPT, assuming it could, would cost over $300 per hour,\u201d Pompidou said. \u201cWith Lloyd, we deliver the same level of accuracy for just 10s of cents per hour.\u201d\n\nThis cost-efficiency is achieved without sacrificing accuracy, setting Lloyd apart from competitors that rely on reduced frame rates or lower resolutions to cut costs, often at the expense of reliability.\n\n\u201cOur communication layer is robust in ways other solutions aren\u2019t. It lets developers integrate real-time AI services like speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and video analysis with unmatched reliability and performance.\u201d\n\nAs Pompidou envisions the future, he offered a glimpse into the app\u2019s potential: \u201cImagine a finely tuned LLM trained on every IKEA instruction manual, guiding customers step by step with video and recognizing errors in real-time. It\u2019s just one example of how our technology can transform user experiences.\u201d\n\nAnother big arena that EndlessAI plans to court through Lloyd and its underlying video encoding tech: law enforcement, specifically providing analysis of police body cam footage.\n\n\u201cIf there is someone who has a heart attack, it is going to recognize that and provide the officer with instructions on what to do right away,\u201d said Pompidou.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEven though Lloyd itself sees exactly whatever you point your smartphone camera at, EndlessAI prioritizes user privacy.\n\n\u201cData stays private to [user] accounts, and we only access it for support if users explicitly request assistance,\u201d Ginat said.\n\nThis approach ensures robust safeguards while enabling seamless interactions.\n\nBut as a consequence, EndlessAI isn\u2019t exactly sure what the most popular uses for Lloyd are among its users. Anecdotally, it says that its surveys and feedback forms have show interest in food preparation, household repairs, fashion and lifestyle coaching, and more.\n\nWhile Lloyd\u2019s consumer-facing features gain traction, EndlessAI is also building tools to empower developers and enterprises to harness its technology.\n\n\u201cOur long-term roadmap includes an SDK for developers, starting early next year,\u201d Pompidou said. \u201cIt will empower them to create unique visual AI solutions with extreme simplicity.\u201d\n\nThe SDK will allow developers to integrate AI vision capabilities into their own applications.\n\n\u201cThe first offering for developers will be a robust platform for real-time API communication, connecting to OpenAI and other backends,\u201d Ginat told VentureBeat. \u201cDevelopers can pick and choose which components they want to use, such as audio services or speech-to-text.\u201d\n\nApplications for these tools span industries, from creating AI-enhanced chat applications to integrating video analysis into production lines and safety monitoring systems.\n\nEndlessAI aims to offer scalable solutions that adapt to different performance and cost requirements.\n\n\u201cOur developer tools will allow on-the-fly adjustments\u2014choosing between backend services or lightweight, on-device solutions depending on the use case and cost requirements,\u201d Ginat added.\n\nBy combining robust APIs with an intuitive SDK, EndlessAI envisions a new wave of AI-driven applications that go beyond traditional text or image processing. \u201cWe\u2019ll offer developers the ability to integrate various services, including side-processing video, enhancing their sessions with additional capabilities,\u201d Ginat said.\n\nTransforming consumer and enterprise AI\n\nLloyd\u2019s ability to leverage existing smartphones\u2014without requiring additional hardware\u2014makes it uniquely accessible.\n\nBy reducing barriers to entry, EndlessAI is redefining what\u2019s possible with AI in daily life and specialized industries alike.\n\nWith its rapid user adoption, versatile applications, and robust roadmap, Lloyd is poised to become a defining innovation in the AI space.\n\n\u201cOur long-term strategy is to stay complementary to LLMs,\u201d Pompidou said. \u201cEven when models can natively process video, we aim to remain the efficiency layer that makes these applications viable and cost-effective.\u201d"

I tug on my favorite pajamas \u2014 a matching red and white flannel set with dancing reindeer \u2014 and toss my curls into a ponytail. Tonight, I\u2019ll soothe the day\u2019s disappointments with White Christmas and peppermint tea. Tomorrow I\u2019ll try again.\n\nChristmas has always been my favorite time of year. It\u2019s the only time of year when it feels like magic might be real, hovering somewhere close to the surface. Like you can reach out and touch it. Cup it between frostbitten fingertips like sugarplum kisses and popcorn strung on ribbon. Crackling fires beneath the hearth and gingerbread cookies fresh from the oven. Christmas has always felt right. Christmas has always felt true.\n\nI sink into the comfort of my couch and watch my movie, unwrapping a candy cane while Betty and Judy sing about sisters. Something thick and heavy settles at the back of my throat. Sisters.\n\nGrowing up, my sister and I used to lay on the floor with our heads tucked together and watch this scene over and over. We\u2019d promise each other that we\u2019d be the same way, laughing and smiling and dancing \u2014 together, always. We watched our mother and our aunt tear into each other until their relationship was a pile of ash. We knew we wanted something different. Something better.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the last time I talked to my sister, cherry blossoms were on the trees and tears were on her cheeks. Somehow, despite our best intentions, we managed to become exactly like them.\n\nRelated: PEOPLE Picks Our Staff's Favorite Romance Novels\n\nI took one path.\n\nSamantha took another.\n\nI force the thought away. Today is December 1. It\u2019s not a day for painful memories. It\u2019s a day for Danny Kaye and peppermint candies and my coziest socks.\n\nTradition. Hope. Kindness.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so busy trying to suck down tea and convince myself that I\u2019m fine that I don\u2019t notice the important things. Namely, the strange man in my living room. I don\u2019t see him until he\u2019s edging his way around my Christmas tree. It\u2019s the scuff of his boots against the floor that finally catches my attention, his shadow large and looming in the glow of my lights. He clears his throat, my head snaps in his direction, and I\u2014\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI scream. I scream at the top of my lungs and hurl the closest projectile I have. The TV remote sails over his shoulder, landing next to an ornament of a lighthouse.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t so much as flinch, gazing at me steadily from the shadows.\n\n\u201cHello, Harriet,\u201d he says easily.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nHis voice is rough. A faint accent I can\u2019t pinpoint or recognize. I don\u2019t recognize a single thing about him, most of him hidden in the shadows. All I can make out is a strong jaw and broad body, his hands held loose at his sides.\n\nI press myself farther into my couch. My breath goes shallow. Every murder mystery podcast I have ever listened to has started exactly like this.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe stranger raises his hands, palms facing out. \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be alarmed. Okay. Says the man who is standing \u2014 uninvited \u2014 in the middle of my living room. He moves closer and light dances over his angular face. He drags one of his hands through his messy, windswept hair.\n\nI grip my candy cane. It\u2019s not sharp enough to stab him with, but I\u2019ve got enough adrenaline coursing through my system to probably cause a little damage.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I breathe.\n\n\u201cI want to help you.\u201d He moves closer. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late, Harriet. You can mend your ways.\u201d\n\n\n\nI blink. \u201cIs this, like, a door-to-door thing? I\u2019m not interested in joining your cult, thank you.\u201d His face remains blank. My eyes dart to the door and back again. \u201cHow did you get into my house?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMore importantly, when can you leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything valuable.\u201d I drag my teeth over my bottom lip. \u201cActually, that\u2019s a lie.

He studies the gingerbread house in question, eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cYou can have it,\u201d I whisper. \u201cPlease leave now.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, dragging his attention back to me on the couch. His eyes linger a beat too long on the patterned material of my pajama bottoms. He drags his hand over his jaw. \u201cI have no interest in your gingerbread house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you have interest in, then? Murder?\u201d\n\nGood job, Harriet, my brain chirps. Very subtle.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in murder, either.\u201d The light shifts over his face. He is all angles and sharp, knowing eyes.

            "article_content": "EXCELSIOR SPRINGS, MO. \u2014 They say the Elms Hotel is haunted. In fact, the hotel leans into these stories with nightly paranormal tours that highlight the ghost stories.\n\nBut it also leans into its history. The story of the Elms begins with the discovery of healing mineral waters in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, in the late 1800s. People would come from all over to experience the dozen or so springs in town, particularly Siloam Spring, on the grounds of the Elms Hotel. Sometimes, miraculous tales of healing followed.\n\nThe Elms Hotel, about 30 minutes to the northeast of Kansas City, literally sprang up with these tales. In 1888 the original Elms was built. It was destroyed in a fire, as was its successor in 1910. The current iteration has been around since 1912. It\u2019s now a full-service upscale Hyatt property.\n\nThose ensuing years have seen a lot of history. Harry S. Truman stayed at the hotel the night he was elected president. Al Capone was a regular guest. There\u2019s even an Al Capone Suite on the second floor. And you can tour the boardroom where his gambling parties used to happen and see the safe he hid contraband in.\n\nNaturally, with all that history, ghost stories spring up: Doors that close without warning, TVs that go on and off. There\u2019s the story of a dog that roams the hotel as well as the story of a gangster from Prohibition days who haunts the lap pool. The hotel was featured on an episode of \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d in 2013.\n\nYou can learn all about the hauntings on one of the hotel\u2019s nightly paranormal tours. A guide (thankfully equipped with a headset speaker) takes a group on a tour of all floors of the hotel. Our guide, Jay, recounted countless stories, sometimes of particular rooms. The thing that gets you is the scope and scale of them. There are so many, and according to Jay, that was just a small fraction. Thankfully, all the stories told were of harmless or even benevolent ghosts, except one. That\u2019s when the tour got a little spooky for me, but for the most part it\u2019s full of history and fun. The tours are $25; just sign up at the front desk.\n\nThe Elms has 152 guest rooms and suites and makes for a perfect girls getaway or couples weekend. Amenities include a 10,000-square-foot spa (more on that later), an indoor European lap pool, a fitness room, an outdoor pool with hot tubs and a walking trail. A cozy fireplace in the opulent, open lobby is a great place to have drinks with a friend.\n\nThose healing waters\n\nNow, because of some safety concerns and a number of other reasons, only a couple of those famous springs remain. One can be found in the basement at the Elms, its brown magnesium-rich waters bubbling up in the corner of the most gorgeous lap pool room you have seen.\n\nBut you can get a feel for the springs\u2019 history at the Hall of Waters in downtown Excelsior Springs. The art deco building began in the 1930s as a public works project to take advantage of the springs\u2019 reputation. It was both a bottling facility and a spa of sorts for the healing, medicinal mineral waters. There, in its gorgeous tiled hall is a bar. No, not used for wine or whiskey but for water. Will you take yours with iron, magnesium, calcium? Hot or cold?\n\nNow, the building is used for city works with offices and even a courtroom. You can tour it, and the museum there, which features remnants of an old bath house. There\u2019s also an empty competition-sized saltwater swimming pool and an empty polio pool in the lower levels. Some days, you can tour those.\n\nYou can learn more about the town at the Excelsior Springs Museum and Archives. Normally, I skip these small-town museums, but I found this one fascinating, mainly because it is housed in a building that was once the Clay County State Bank built in 1894. The magnificent gold ceiling is buttressed on each end by 100-year-old paintings, copies of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet\u2019s paintings \u201cThe Gleaners\u201d on the south wall and \u201cThe Angelus\u201d on the north wall. There are even the original teller windows and a giant vault in the back.\n\nAlso in downtown Excelsior Springs you will find a number of antique shops and boutiques as well as restaurants and bars. Catch a show at the Slightly Off Broadway Theatre (sobtheatre.org) and definitely grab a beer at Atlas Saloon Brewery (atlassaloon.com). The space, including the cash register and wood bar have been around since the late 1800s, but the beer is worth a stop on its own; get a flight to taste as many as you can.\n\nDining in the hotel\n\nJust as you enter the front doors at the Elms there is a cute bar to the right, Soterian, which serves coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. It has almost an upscale-soda-fountain vibe. To the left, is the hotel\u2019s signature restaurant, Three Owls, which is open for breakfast (buffet on weekends), lunch and dinner. It\u2019s a gorgeous space. I told my friend that aesthetically it may be my favorite restaurant ever. It has soaring ceilings, bright white walls with clever artwork, a fireplace and a sweeping staircase that leads to more seating. Its breakfast food (oh, my, that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e French toast) is as thoughtfully prepared as its short ribs. But it\u2019s hard to pass up the perfectly cooked steak. On the second floor, there is a cozy bar called the Tavern. It sometimes has live music and serves small bites.\n\nThe Spa\n\nFor many couples and girlfriend groups, the draw here is the spa. Since \u201cspa\u201d is in the name of the hotel (The Elms Hotel & Spa), you know it\u2019s a priority there. Whether you are there for couples massages, a girls-day facial or a more elaborate service, like a thermal mineral mudwrap, the spa leans into the hotel\u2019s earlier days of healing and beautifying.\n\nIts 28,000-square-feet include at least 15 treatment rooms, a sanctuary for relaxing and the Grotto, a modern twist on a Roman bath, which you can enjoy with your spa appointment. The Grotto Experience includes: steam shower, hot tub, cold plunge shower, steam sauna, dry sauna, and a self-service aromatherapy bar. You can pay $75 for the Grotto experience, but opt for a treatment and it\u2019s included (for reference, my collagen facial, which was amazing, was $180).\n\nIf you go Getting there: Excelsior Springs is less than four hours' drive from downtown St. Louis.

Chief among them is its ensemble. The cast featured many legendary voice actors, including Maurice LaMarche and Frank Welker.

Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

Two dangerous pests were found inside a shipment of flowers from South Africa. One of the bugs had never been seen before in the region, and the other had not been observed in Virginia in 40 years.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture officials confirmed the discovery recently. The two pests were found while CBP agriculture officers were inspecting a shipment of 188 protea and chamelaucium cut-stem flowers imported from South Africa on Oct. 7. The flowers were destined for an address in King George, Virginia.\n\nAn entomologist with the Department of Agriculture identified the specimens as Caprhiobia sp. (Lygaeidae), and Oxycarenus maculatus (Protea seed bug). Both pests are known to occur in Africa.\n\nCaprhiobia sp. (Lygaeidae) is a plant bug known to occur in South Africa that that has a voracious appetite and causes extensive damage to vegetation. The USDA entomologist consulted the national pest identifier database and confirmed this as a first-in-port discovery, meaning there has been no previous reported discovery of Caprhiobia sp. (Lygaeidae) in this region.\n\nSeed bugs are a crop pest and poses a serious threat to our nation\u2019s crop industries, such as corn, grains, wheat, cotton, fruit, tree nuts, and vegetables. The USDA entomologist consulted the national pest identifier database and confirmed that this insect pest has not been observed locally since November 1984.\n\nCBP agriculture specialists routinely inspect flower imports to ensure that they are free of pests that pose serious threats to our nation\u2019s agricultural and environmental resources.\n\n\u201cInvasive insect pests pose a severe threat to our agricultural industries and to our nation\u2019s economic security,\u201d said Marc Calixte, CBP\u2019s Area Port Director for the Area Port of Washington, D.C. \u201cCustoms and Border Protection agriculture specialists remain steadfast on our nation\u2019s frontline protecting our natural and agricultural resources from invasive pests and plants, and from animal and plant diseases that could cripple our nation\u2019s economy.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The recently discovered class of objects known as Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) has a new member: This one is fainter and smaller than previous discoveries and was only detected using an intense study of a small area of the sky. This leads the team responsible to suspect there are many similar examples waiting to be discovered when similar approaches are conducted elsewhere.\n\nA new era in radio telescope capacity has led to the discovery of several new sorts of astronomical objects that had never been seen before. In each case, astronomers were initially baffled by the findings, leading some to be given names that indicate that bewilderment \u2013 for example, Odd Radio Circles originally having been nicknamed WTFs. The source of at least one member of one of these categories \u2013 long-period radio transients \u2013 was revealed last month, but that\u2019s just the start of working out how they are made.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORCs were first announced in 2020, and had astronomers so puzzled they initially suspected equipment error. As the name suggests, they form large, almost perfectly circular areas of the sky from which radio signals are received unlike anything seen before.\n\nThe most astonishing thing about ORCs is their size. When first discovered, astronomers could not tell if they were moderate-sized objects relatively close to us, or gigantic ones further away. Now, however, we know there are galaxies or active galactic nuclei at the heart of each. Measuring the distances to these galaxies revealed the first five ORCs to be discovered are 1-1.5 million lightyears across, a mind-bending size even for astronomers used to working on galactic scales.\n\nThe latest discovery, known as ORC J0219\u20130505, has a diameter of around 370,000 light-years, which would be enormous by any standards other than the previous members of the group. For example, it\u2019s more than twice the size of the galaxy at the circle\u2019s center, which is of similar size to our own Milky Way.\n\nProfessor Ray Norris of CSIRO led both the original ORC discovery and the new one. However, he explained to IFLScience that, at this point, knowledge of its nature is sparse.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAll ORCs are known to be rapidly expanding, so a smaller object might be a younger one. However, Norris told IFLScience he has \u201cNo idea,\u201d if this is the case. \u201cIt could also be about the medium it is expanding into,\u201d he explained. A slightly less complete vacuum between galaxies might restrict the ORC\u2019s expansion. Similarly, Norris said, the team can\u2019t say why this ORC is fainter than all the others.\n\nAlthough they appear circular in two dimensions, we now know that ORCs are spheres surrounding central galaxies, created by some sort of shock around a billion years ago.\n\nThe original ORC, looking very similar. Image Credit: Norris et al/Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, Courtesy of Ray Norris.\n\nSeveral competing explanations for this shock exist, including that it is created by the merging of either supermassive black holes or entire galaxies, or the collective actions of many supernovae blasting vast quantities of gas out of their galaxies. In the last case, electrons stripped from the gas are much lighter and therefore travel further than the gas itself, and could be producing the radio waves while invisible to us by other means.\n\nNorris told IFLScience he previously favored the merging black holes explanation, \u201cBut the offset between the center of ORC J0219\u20130505\u2019s sphere and the supermassive black hole is difficult to account for.\u201d On that basis, Norris thinks collisions between gas clouds during galactic mergers are probably the front-runner. These collisions are thought to create shockwaves that accelerate electrons beyond the merged galaxy, but Norris considers the issue still wide open.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORC J0219\u20130505 was found as part of a 564.2-hour study by the MeerKAT radio telescope of a 20 degree2 area of the sky. Since something this faint would probably not have been detected without such an in-depth survey by an instrument like MeerKAT, the authors expect similar objects are waiting to be discovered once the rest of the sky gets similar attention.\n\nNorris told IFLScience that the most significant part of the discovery is that all previous ORCs are very similar in size, brightness, distance, and age. This led astronomers to wonder if something was special about these conditions, or if the similarity reflected selection bias from the methods used to find them. Adding something significantly smaller and fainter to the mix makes it likely we\u2019ll spot plenty of smaller ORCs (goblins, perhaps?) once suitable techniques are expanded, and there may be other subgroups to come as well.\n\nThe paper has been accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and is posted as a preprint on ArXiv.org.\n\n[H/T Phys.org]"

Among major events like the Olympics and the U.S. presidential election is one name you may have forgotten about, but will remember for the chaos it caused. I\u2019m talking, of course, about CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm founded in 2011 in Austin, Texas \u2014 the same one that was (at least partially) responsible for the largest IT outage ever.\n\nSo, what did CrowdStrike do exactly to earn its spot on the list? In a nutshell, it\u2019s responsible for the faulty code that meddled with core functions on the affected Windows computers. The error displayed messages on users\u2019 PCs saying: \u201cYour PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.\u201d The result was downed PCs across the country, affecting a wide range of industries, but most notably, airports. From an IT perspective, this was a nightmare scenario.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized, saying in a post on X: \u201cWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\u201d\n\nDelta was one of the affected airlines that suffered, and it even claimed that the extended outage the airline suffered was the cybersecurity company\u2019s fault. CrowdStrike pushed back and said the $500 million lawsuit was meritless.\n\nThe source problem lay in the company\u2019s Falcon Platform, which runs compatible with classic antivirus software on your PC. If the outage wasn\u2019t enough, CrowdStrike also came under fire for presenting Uber Eats vouchers worth $10 as an apology.\n\nCrowdStrike ranked 7th in the top ten news searches for 2024, while the U.S. Election took the top spot. Other searches that were also in the top 10 are Monkeypox, Menendez brothers, Trump shot, Iran Rafah, excessive heat, Olympics, Hurricane Milton, and the typhoon."

Both organizations noted that the familiar barcodes were being used as part of a new type of phishing attack \u2014 dubbed \u201cquishing\u201d \u2014 to trick victims into giving up passwords, financial data, and other personal information.\n\nHow Quishing Attacks Work\n\nQuishing attacks come in a few varieties. Sometimes, they arrive as part of a traditional phishing email, luring victims to scan the code on their phones and sending them to fraudulent websites. In others, they may arrive as part of a PDF attachment. In some cases, criminals will paste the QR codes in public areas or near parking lots to trick pedestrians into scanning them. In England, for example, scammers are pasting these codes onto parking meters.\n\nAccording to Barracuda data, more than half a million phishing emails have been detected with QR codes embedded in PDF documents. From mid-June to mid-September this year, Barracuda found these QR codes in PDFs that leveraged brand impersonation and urgency to trick victims into responding. Previously, these codes tended to appear in the body of the email, so the shift to PDFs marks a change in tactics.\n\nMicrosoft was impersonated in over half of the attacks, followed by DocuSign and Adobe. The PDF documents include the QR code, but there are no other external links or embedded files. Recipients are instructed to scan the code with their mobile phone to see a file or sign a document, and they are then directed to a phishing website to steal login credentials.\n\nThis approach using QR codes is clever and difficult to detect since there are no suspicious links or attachments that traditional security solutions would typically spot, and victims use their personal phones (which are less protected than company-owned devices or desktop systems) to scan the code.\n\nBarracuda researchers also noted in their report that the quishing attacks increasingly target small to midsize businesses (SMBs) and companies in industries like finance, healthcare, and education (which deal in sensitive data).\n\nBest Practices for Protecting your Customers from Quishing Attacks\n\nQuishing is another attack variation that will impact clients across industries. IT solution providers should educate clients about the threat and help them implement best practices to prevent security breaches.\n\nFirst, ensure clients instruct employees to be careful about scanning QR codes they receive via email. They should be 100% certain that the code came from a legitimate source and verify this by checking the website links, email addresses, and phone numbers associated with these queries. End-user education is a critical first line of defense against these types of social engineering attacks. Ensure employees know how to spot these emails and that there is a clear process for reporting potential phishing attacks.\n\nEncourage clients to have employees boost the security of their personal phones \u2014 and discourage them from using those devices to scan QR codes from work emails. Phones should be updated with strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and the most recent operating system version. Companies should also institute clear policies around personal device use at work.\n\nInstall a holistic, multilayered email security solution to block phishing emails. Configure email filters to block or quarantine emails containing QR codes from unknown or untrusted sources. Customize rules to trigger additional scrutiny for emails with QR codes. Regularly audit email logs to identify trends in QR-code phishing attempts. Use these insights to enhance your detection rules and improve user education programs.\n\nLeverage artificial intelligence and other advanced technology to augment client security. Quishing emails are designed to bypass traditional email security. AI-based solutions will analyze the behavior of emails containing QR codes, such as unusual sender-recipient patterns or mismatched headers.\n\nEquip your team with post-delivery automated incident response to remediate malicious emails that bypass initial filters. This will ensure the rapid removal of phishing emails flagged after delivery.\n\nTo mitigate QR-code phishing risks, you should work with clients to implement strict controls over QR-code usage within their organizations. All QR codes used internally should be required to be pre-approved by IT or security teams to ensure they are tied to legitimate and secure URLs. Encourage clients to distribute these QR codes only through secure, authenticated channels like internal portals or encrypted email, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.\n\nQuishing is just the latest in a long line of phishing variations that take advantage of consumer technologies. Advanced security solutions and regular end-user education can help prevent QR code-based attacks from compromising credentials and putting sensitive data at risk."

However, it was only made available as a beta feature for Plus and Teams subscribers. On Tuesday, the company announced that it is bringing Canvas to all users, even at the free tier.\n\nWhile one could easily mistake Canvas for a blatant knockoff of Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts feature, OpenAI is also incorporating a swath of new capabilities into Canvas. For one, Canvas is now integrated directly into the GPT-4o model so that it runs natively within ChatGPT, eliminating the need to select it specifically from the model-picking list.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe platform is now also capable of running Python code within the Canvas interface, allowing ChatGPT to analyze the code and offer suggestions for improving it. And it\u2019s not just Python code; users can text prose or code directly into the Canvas interface, rather than upload it through the standard chat interface, then load it into the Canvas window.\n\nThe newly integrated Canvas is now also compatible with OpenAI\u2019s custom GPTs, which should make them easier to design and build without deep programming knowledge. And if you make a mistake, the Show Changes feature will highlight which bits of prose or code were most recently altered.\n\nCanvas is available on the web and through the Windows desktop app. \u201cWe plan to continue making improvements and launching new features available in Canvas in the near term,\u201d the company wrote in its announcement.\n\nThis news comes amid OpenAI\u2019s inaugural \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d marketing effort. To date, the company has (finally) debuted its Sora video generation system, which can generate 20-second clips in resolutions up to 1080p, as well as released the full version of its o1 reasoning model family and introduced a $200-per-month Pro subscription tier needed to access them."

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

            "article_content": "The recently discovered class of objects known as Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) has a new member: This one is fainter and smaller than previous discoveries and was only detected using an intense study of a small area of the sky. This leads the team responsible to suspect there are many similar examples waiting to be discovered when similar approaches are conducted elsewhere.\n\nA new era in radio telescope capacity has led to the discovery of several new sorts of astronomical objects that had never been seen before. In each case, astronomers were initially baffled by the findings, leading some to be given names that indicate that bewilderment \u2013 for example, Odd Radio Circles originally having been nicknamed WTFs. The source of at least one member of one of these categories \u2013 long-period radio transients \u2013 was revealed last month, but that\u2019s just the start of working out how they are made.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORCs were first announced in 2020, and had astronomers so puzzled they initially suspected equipment error. As the name suggests, they form large, almost perfectly circular areas of the sky from which radio signals are received unlike anything seen before.\n\nThe most astonishing thing about ORCs is their size. When first discovered, astronomers could not tell if they were moderate-sized objects relatively close to us, or gigantic ones further away. Now, however, we know there are galaxies or active galactic nuclei at the heart of each. Measuring the distances to these galaxies revealed the first five ORCs to be discovered are 1-1.5 million lightyears across, a mind-bending size even for astronomers used to working on galactic scales.\n\nThe latest discovery, known as ORC J0219\u20130505, has a diameter of around 370,000 light-years, which would be enormous by any standards other than the previous members of the group. For example, it\u2019s more than twice the size of the galaxy at the circle\u2019s center, which is of similar size to our own Milky Way.\n\nProfessor Ray Norris of CSIRO led both the original ORC discovery and the new one. However, he explained to IFLScience that, at this point, knowledge of its nature is sparse.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAll ORCs are known to be rapidly expanding, so a smaller object might be a younger one. However, Norris told IFLScience he has \u201cNo idea,\u201d if this is the case. \u201cIt could also be about the medium it is expanding into,\u201d he explained. A slightly less complete vacuum between galaxies might restrict the ORC\u2019s expansion. Similarly, Norris said, the team can\u2019t say why this ORC is fainter than all the others.\n\nAlthough they appear circular in two dimensions, we now know that ORCs are spheres surrounding central galaxies, created by some sort of shock around a billion years ago.\n\nThe original ORC, looking very similar. Image Credit: Norris et al/Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, Courtesy of Ray Norris.\n\nSeveral competing explanations for this shock exist, including that it is created by the merging of either supermassive black holes or entire galaxies, or the collective actions of many supernovae blasting vast quantities of gas out of their galaxies. In the last case, electrons stripped from the gas are much lighter and therefore travel further than the gas itself, and could be producing the radio waves while invisible to us by other means.\n\nNorris told IFLScience he previously favored the merging black holes explanation, \u201cBut the offset between the center of ORC J0219\u20130505\u2019s sphere and the supermassive black hole is difficult to account for.\u201d On that basis, Norris thinks collisions between gas clouds during galactic mergers are probably the front-runner. These collisions are thought to create shockwaves that accelerate electrons beyond the merged galaxy, but Norris considers the issue still wide open.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORC J0219\u20130505 was found as part of a 564.2-hour study by the MeerKAT radio telescope of a 20 degree2 area of the sky. Since something this faint would probably not have been detected without such an in-depth survey by an instrument like MeerKAT, the authors expect similar objects are waiting to be discovered once the rest of the sky gets similar attention.\n\nNorris told IFLScience that the most significant part of the discovery is that all previous ORCs are very similar in size, brightness, distance, and age. This led astronomers to wonder if something was special about these conditions, or if the similarity reflected selection bias from the methods used to find them. Adding something significantly smaller and fainter to the mix makes it likely we\u2019ll spot plenty of smaller ORCs (goblins, perhaps?) once suitable techniques are expanded, and there may be other subgroups to come as well.\n\nThe paper has been accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and is posted as a preprint on ArXiv.org.\n\n[H/T Phys.org]"

            "article_content": "A new game from Andrew Gower has been a long time coming.\n\nThe British development veteran is best known for creating the hit 2001 MMORPG RuneScape \u2013 a title that is still very running today \u2013 and co-founding Jagex. In 2010, he departed the studio and, that same year, set up a new outfit, Fen Research, with the aim of creating a brand-new game engine.\n\nThis tech would become known as FenForge.\n\n\"I love making engines, even more than I love making games, believe it or not,\" Gower laughs. \"I saw that the computer game space was very, very competitive. I thought: 'Well, there's only two or three big engines. Maybe I can find a niche there'. I felt there was a lot that I could do to raise the bar in the quality of game engines.\" There was one small obstacle in Gower's mind: in order to sell and market a game engine, you usually need to have a project that showed off exactly what it was capable of.\n\nAndrew Gower, Fen Research\n\n\"It's a bit chicken and egg, really,\" he explains. \"The only way to promote an engine is to make a game to prove that it works because making games now requires a huge investment. No one is going to make that kind of investment on an unproven engine.\"\n\nAs a result, Fen started work on making games that used the FenForge tech as it was being created. Work on one such project began in 2013; 'Chasm game' was a real-time strategy settlement building title with simulation elements.\n\n\"You had people that you could give orders to go do different things. It was a very, very different game,\" Gower explains.\n\nOver the course of three years, two staff at Fen created assets for Chasm, though no code was ever written for the project. But the game came to an end when it became apparent that there were a lot of people out there who wanted Andrew to return to his roots. As such, many of the assets built for Chasm were ultimately repurposed for Brighter Shores, an MMORPG.\n\n\"[While we were working on Chasm] every single person I spoke to asked whether I was working on another MMO,\" Gower says. \"After however many times that happened, I thought: 'Clearly no one is interested in this game I'm making. I'm going to have to make another MMORPG'.\"\n\nWorking on a new MMO allowed Gower to return to a genre he loved with the wealth of experience that he acquired while working on RuneScape. When development began on what would become Brighter Shores in 2016, it had been 18 years since he started working on RuneScape predecessor DeviousMUD and 17 years since Andrew and his brothers began building RuneScape.\n\n\"A lot of the thinking was just what would I do differently if I could start from scratch?\" Gower says. \"When you're working on any sort of large project, over the years you build up a certain amount of history, which shapes the direction you have to go. It was nice to be able to step back and have none of that history, none of that baggage, and say from a completely clean slate, knowing what I know now, how would I make an MMO? So it was nice to be able to start from scratch like that.\"\n\n\"I thought: 'Clearly no one is interested in this game I'm making. I'm going to have to make another MMORPG'\"\n\nThe industry has moved on in many ways since the creation of the original RuneScape. For one, there's a lot more competition than there used to be, ranging from established MMOs to newer titles. Player expectations are very different to over 20 years ago, too.\n\n\"Back in 2000, there wasn't really much else out there; there certainly wasn't anything free-to-play out there,\" Gower says.\n\n\"I spent way longer making this than I previously spent prior to launch and it still feels pretty small on release, even though it's way bigger than anything I've ever made before. It's just because the game's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and it's becoming harder and harder to make a game of the scale people expect.\"\n\nFen Research launched Brighter Shores into Early Access on November 6th. The aim is to be in alpha for six months, though Gower does admit he is sometimes optimistic with these estimates. As alluded to earlier, the idea is to get feedback early and use that to build out the game.\n\n\"I think we're one of the few companies actually using Early Access the way it's meant to be used,\" Gower says.\n\n\"We've launched the game and we've got a ton of feedback that is very much shaping the way we make the game. I'm glad that we're getting that feedback now before we've made too much content and whilst we can really take it on board and actually genuinely listen to our players. It's nice to just build up the game with the player base and just gradually make it bigger and better.\n\n\"I'm expecting to be working on this for many years to come. It's never going to be finished so whenever we launch it, it is going to be unfinished. I just wanted to get it out there and start getting people playing it and start seeing what works and what doesn't work.\"\n\nPassive activities help players gain experience and resources even when they're not playing\n\nOn the face of it, the design of Brighter Shores is cut from the same cloth as RuneScape's. British medieval fantasy setting? Check. A variety of skills to level up? Well, they're called professions now, but (mostly, sort of) check. A rock-paper-scissors-style combat triangle system? Check. But despite these similarities, Gower's approach to game design has in fact changed \u2013 and matured \u2013 a great deal over the last 20 years.\n\n\"I forward plan much more now. I tend to make stuff up as I go along less,\" he says.\n\n\"I have designed this to be a second screen game, because I've realised that's what people want from my games\"\n\n\"I'm still quite iterative because that is a good way to do things; you make things, you try things, you change things. But there are a lot more spreadsheets involved now, let's put it that way. There's a lot more thinking through what the consequences of things are going to be down the line, how things are going to work, planning it out many years in advance so I don't design myself into a corner.\"\n\nThe game is also designed to cater for people who might not have the same amount of free time to play games as they used to. Part of this is Brighter Shores' passive abilities, where player characters can continue to grind automatically when the user isn't even playing the game.\n\n\"As I have grown older, I haven't lost my love of MMOs, but I do have less spare time, which is why this game has been designed the whole passive system,\" Gower explains. \"I was trying to make something where I could still carry on levelling up, even if I could only spend 15 or 20 minutes a day playing it.\n\n\"It's basically targeted at people who love MMOs and grew up playing these games, but maybe don't have as much free time anymore. If they've got a weekend free, they can grind away at it, but they can also set their character passively doing stuff and just do the quests and so on when they want. But I have also tried to make it appeal to people who want to sink the hours in.\"\n\n1 of 4 Attribution\n\nIn some ways, this design philosophy is a reaction to how some RuneScape fans play the MMO. Many enjoy it as a second-screen game while they are doing something else.\n\n\"I have designed this to be a second screen game, because I've realised that's what people want from my games,\" Gower says. \"But I have tried to make it both a second screen game, and I've tried to make it a completely passive experience where you can get rewards overnight if you haven't got the time as well. I've tried to get both of those in there.\"\n\nAt the moment, Brighter Shores has a Mostly Positive user rating on Steam. For Gower and Fen, the launch has also served as a good advertisement for the FenForge tech.\n\n\"There are about two million lines of code and very few issues, a testament to the fact the engine is working\"\n\n\"We had a few little teething issues on the very first day but it's been really very rock solid, much more stable and bug-free than most games in Early Access,\" Gower says. \"It's really proven that the engine does work. It's a massive game. There are about two million lines of code and we've had very few issues, which is a testament to the fact that the engine is working. The launch has also helped us find a lot of the bugs. It's done very well in terms of the performance of the engine.\"\n\nLooking to the future, the plan is still to eventually sell FenForge as an off-the-shelf engine. For now, though, Gower and Fen Research are focused on building out Brighter Shores.\n\n\"Brighter Shores is very much my hobby project,\" he says. \"I'm making it because I want to have an MMO that I can enjoy making, running and sharing with the userbase. The plan is just to keep on making it bigger and bigger. We've got a very strong foundation, so content is the main thing we need more of now.\"\n\nHe concludes: \"In the long run, I still want to launch FenForge, but that's not going to be for at least a couple of years because all my focus is on Brighter Shores at the moment. And it needs some documentation for a start.\""

Overall, not the start of the road trip that we wanted.\u201d\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nThe loss snapped the Bruins\u2019 season-high four-game winning streak and left them 7-3-0 in their 10 games since Sacco took over behind the bench as interim coach. In the previous nine games under Sacco\u2019s watch, they had not allowed the opposition more than three goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeam captain Brad Marchand agreed the blowout was more disappointing when considering the club had cleaned up many of the defensive deficiencies that marked the first 20 games of the season.\n\n\u201cYeah, but this was coming,\u201d said Marchand. \u201cOur practices have been sloppy, our execution\u2019s been off, and it bleeds into games. How you practice is how you play. It starts there and we haven\u2019t been good enough. We have to do a better job in practice and it translates into games.\u201d\n\nBruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, who faced 35 shots, fell to 9-10-2, along with a 3.27 goals-against average and .885 save percentage. David Pastrnak scored the lone Bruins goal, connecting for one of the club\u2019s rare power-play strikes that cut the Jets' lead to 3-1 in the second period.\n\nIt was the most goals Swayman has allowed in a game in the NHL.\n\n\u201cYou gotta stay sharp for 60 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey punished us \u2026 it\u2019s not acceptable. We have to move forward, and luckily we have the group to do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the night\u2019s regret, said Swayman, is that he felt he could have stopped some of the goals \u2014 forever a goalie\u2019s lament.\n\n\u201cLet those in \u2026 that\u2019s not a great feeling,\" he said. \u201cI want to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again \u2026 staying sharp and playing my game, I know I can stop those goals.\u201d\n\nThe Jets scored three power-play goals, the fifth time this season the Bruins have been burned three times on the advantage.\n\nMarchand, before departing the room, paused after being asked whether he \u201cfelt for his goalie\u201d being in there for all eight goals.\n\n\u201cNot really, I mean everyone had a bad night, he\u2019s part of it. He\u2019s not singled out,\u201d said Marchand. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can look at themselves in the mirror and say they had a good game. He\u2019s part of the group. He\u2019s part of the bad loss.\u201d\n\nThe Jets moved out to a 2-0 lead in the first period, landing 14 shots on Swayman. A big part of the Bruins\u2019 success of late has been their ability to suppress shots, outshooting opponents in seven of their previous nine games since Sacco took over behind the bench. But they could not hold back the Jets in the early going.\n\nVladislav Namestnikov knocked home the go-ahead goal, 1-0, a power-play strike with 12:09 gone and Brandon Carlo in the penalty box serving a four-minute penalty for high sticking.\n\nNeal Pionk started off the scoring play with a long one-timer from the center point, which sailed wide of the right post. But the puck worked back into the crease area and Namestnikov was left with an easy forehand chip at an unprotected left post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Jets doubled the lead, 2-0, with only 1:59 remaining in the first period on a turnover deep in Boston\u2019s end. Scheifele provided the finishing touch, the Jets forcing the puck away from Marchand in the Bruins\u2019 end. The quick back-and forth between the dots left Scheifele isolated in the slot against Swayman, free to drive home a smooth dish from Connor.\n\nSimilar to Saturday, when the Bruins rallied back for a 4-3 overtime win over the Flyers, they found themselves down by a pair of goals after the first period.\n\nScheifele\u2019s second of the night, with 7:02 gone in the second, all but put it out of reach for the Bruins. Again on a power play, on a questionable high sticking call against Pastrnak. the Jets made it 3-0 when the Bruins came up porous on their penalty-kill. Josh Morrissey had the puck in the right wing circle and was left with a wide-open lane to toss across the slot for Scheifele to unload a bomb from the opposite circle.\n\nPastrnak, who earlier in the period finally landed his first shot of the night, connected on one of his classic one-timers on the power play with 9:13 gone in the period. Just seconds after missing with a similar shot from the same spot, one that went wide left, Pastrnak leaned into a pinpoint Charlie McAvoy feed and dotted the top right corner.\n\nWinnipeg\u2019s Connor Hellebuyck, among the game\u2019s top goalies, had no shot at turning back Pastrnak\u2019s 10th goal of the season. If the Bruins are going to catch their offensive stride this season, they\u2019ll need Pastrnak to be a central part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "With the end of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, the task of tallying the cost in human lives of a nearly 14-year-long civil war is continuing. Death toll estimates from the conflict are as high as 620,000, a staggering number in a country with a prewar population of 22 million.\n\nExperts say establishing the true scale of death is complicated, as estimates are drawn from different sources and methods and calculated in varying ways. Here\u2019s what we know:\n\nWhat is the latest death toll?\n\nAs of March, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had documented the names of 507,567 people who had died in Syria since the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011. The independent Syrian-run organization, which is based in Britain and collates information from multiple sources, said that it had verified another 110,343 deaths of people who were not named, bringing the total of civilians and combatants killed throughout the war to 617,910.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights, another independent human rights organization that has been tracking the toll since the start of the conflict, had counted a total of 231,495 civilian deaths through June.\n\nWhat does the United Nations say?\n\nThe Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last released an accounting in 2021, when it estimated that at least 580,000 people had been killed to that point, including 350,209 \u201cidentified individuals.\u201d The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, cautioned at the time that the figure was \u201cnot a complete number of conflict-related killings\u201d but that it indicated a \u201cminimum verifiable number, and is certainly an undercount of the actual number.\u201d\n\nBefore 2021, the United Nations had not released a report on deaths in Syria since 2014 because it said conditions on the ground made accurate documentation impossible. However, when the war reached its 10th year, the organization responded to the need for updated information with a new report. By then, the war had shifted from large-scale military hostilities to regional clashes between multiple armed groups, making access and accuracy even more complicated, so the U.N. stopped reporting numbers.\n\nHow is the death toll calculated?\n\nThe U.N. and the Syrian human rights organizations say they rely on on-the-ground interviews, news reports and publicly available information such as death certificates and hospital records. They then identify and exclude duplicates and records with only partial information from the total and check the results against other statistical estimates.\n\nCases where people had been taken into government custody with no documentation \u2014 the forcibly disappeared \u2014 are not part of the total, nor are cases in which victims are killed and their bodies not recovered.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights focuses on tallying civilian deaths. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also tracks deaths among the Syrian military, rebel factions, foreign militias and armed units sent by other governments that are party to the conflict, such as Israel, Russia and Iran.\n\nWill we ever know the final toll?\n\nThe end of the conflict will bring some clarity. When Damascus fell on Dec. 8, rebel groups opened Syria\u2019s prisons, freeing thousands of surviving detainees to the relief of friends and families. But thousands of other people remain missing.\n\nFadel Abdul Ghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, has counted more than 100,000 men, women and children who were \u201cforcibly disappeared\u201d by the Assad regime since 2011 and who were not included in any death toll. So far, he says, very few have emerged from the prisons, and he has been able to identify only about 3,000 death certificates.\n\nBased on what he has seen from the jails and the documents his team has obtained, Mr. Ghany estimated that at least 85,000 of those forcibly disappeared have been killed in al-Assad\u2019s detention centers."

            "article_content": "Russia is already at war with the west. It has been so since its occupation of Crimea in 2014, when Russia sought to secure its access to Sevastopol as a base for its Black Sea Fleet and as a potential lever of influence over Kyiv\u2019s political direction.\n\nEven in 2014 \u2013 at the annual Valdai security conference \u2013 Vladimir Putin was referencing an escalation towards conflict with the west. He later described the west as having \u201ccrossed a line\u201d.\n\nPutin signalled at the time that he was prepared to escalate further and threaten wider military conflict, but mostly the west ignored those messages. It\u2019s taken a long time for Nato and many western nations to realise their significance, and to understand that they are dealing with a continual escalation.\n\nToday Putin has five main reasons for being on a war footing and seeing Russia as in a conflict with the west. These are: the incremental enlargement of Nato and the EU towards Russian borders; western financial and military support for Ukraine to resist the 2022 full-scale invasion; anti-Russian rhetoric and international sanctions on Russian goods; measures to restrict Russian use of the international banking system; and, most recently, Ukraine\u2019s allies allowing the firing into Russia of long-range missiles\n\nThere have been plenty of indications of the Kremlin\u2019s mindset over the intervening years. For instance, in November 2022, Putin said: \u201cOur armed forces \u2026 are fighting on the line of contact that is over 1,000 kilometers long, fighting not only against neo-Nazi units but actually the entire military machine of the collective west\u201d.\n\nIn October 2023 Russian security council deputy chair, Dmitry Medvedev, described the supporters of Ukraine as \u201cactively pushing us towards World War III\u201d. In January 2024 Russia foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, described Russia as the liberator from a revived second world war axis, and suggested that it was tackling another rise in Nazism.\n\nRussia labels different kinds of confrontation according to geographical reach and intensity. At the lowest end of its scale is \u201carmed conflict\u201d. This happens within a single territorial area, such as Chechnya.\n\nOne notch above is a local war. In 2014 the initial movement of the unbadged \u201cgreen men\u201d (Russian soldiers) into Crimea was to maintain deniability but was clearly an act of war. So in many ways at this stage, Ukraine was a local war.\n\nA local war has limited military and political goals and usually takes place over a short period such as in the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, but can also involve repercussions for allies of the states at war. The next two levels of Russian war are regional wars and large-scale wars.\n\nIn regional wars several states work in coalition to secure strategically important military and political goals (such as the Soviet Union\u2019s military engagement in Afghanistan 1979-89, and the 1990-91 Gulf War, which did not involve Russia). It is likely that Russia has seen the Ukraine conflict as a regional war since 2022, with some elements of a large-scale war.\n\nLarge scale war not far off?\n\nHowever, the next level of war \u2013 the \u201clarge-scale war\u201d \u2013 may not be far off. These are wars between coalitions of states: for example, Ukraine and Nato against Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, or a wide number of countries in different parts of the world (such as the second world war). Large-scale wars create \u201cradical military political change\u201d, with intensified fighting and spread. These tend to involve a massive mobilisation of resources.\n\nThese coalitions are not yet in direct conflict with each other, but there has been large-scale mobilisation of weaponry and forces in Russia and Ukraine. North Korea has recently sent 10,000 troops to Russia.\n\nFor the west, large-scale war would significantly increase the risk of nuclear war, cause stock market volatility, cost significantly more money, and subject European citizens to the instability via a large number of physical and cyber attacks.\n\nEuropean policymakers and citizens need to understand more about key Russian aims (such as creating a buffer zone with the EU, or securing the lands it sees as Russian). In doing so, the public will know which politicians are \u2013 in effect \u2013 serving and opposing Putin\u2019s strategic agenda.\n\nRussia has strongly signalled that recent changes in US and British policy, in allowing their long range missiles to be fired into Russia, as escalatory. For example the secretary of the Russian security council, Sergei Shoigu, has said: \u201cWhen the situation \u2026 is not in favour of the Kyiv regime, the West is faced with a choice \u2013 to continue financing it and destroying the Ukrainian population or to recognise the current realities and start negotiating.\u201d\n\nRussia amended its nuclear doctrine in November and then proceeded to fire a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile into Ukraine, bringing it closer to direct conflict with Nato countries. The Russian response to these changes is driving the escalation. Meanwhile, Russian-linked sabotage and espionage operations continue across the globe.\n\nEurope starts to prepare\n\nBelatedly, the Europe and the US are starting to understand that Russia already sees itself at war with the west, even if limited currently.\n\nCountries closest to Russia, such as Sweden, Norway, Finland and Lithuania, have understood this most keenly. Politically, they have sought to align more closely with Nato and European military allies, to actively repel Russian interference. And it\u2019s worth noting that Russian military resources have been stretched by assisting Syria to tackle ongoing insurgent attacks.\n\nBut overall Europe has been fundamentally weakened by decades of under-investment in defence, its inability to coordinate defence and security policy and its over-reliance on the US as its security guarantee.\n\nThere is limited public willingness to spend more money on defence in Europe. The damage done to European politics by Russian political interference and the rise of pockets of far-right populist groups have also made collective European responses hard to muster.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that the EU is better resourced than Russia, with a stronger technology and innovation sector. The Ukrainians have also shown what can be achieved in drone warfare to hold back vastly superior Russian numbers and artillery fire.\n\nEurope needs to manufacture high-end innovations at scale, something it is capable of doing.\n\nDisrupting Russia\u2019s base of support will also be important. Taking steps to prevent military transfers from Iran, North Korea and China are crucial, as is disrupting the ability of the Russian military-industrial complex to function.\n\nOverall, increased understanding of Russian intentions, motivations and capabilities is vital in the west. This could help avoid further escalation into a large-scale war, or, at least, improve its ability to negotiate with Putin."

(NYSE:PATH) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nWall Street's major indexes closed lower on Monday, December 9th, dragged down by a decline in Nvidia. The plunge pressured the broader technology sector, with investors also turning their attention to an important inflation report due this week.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\n\nInvestors expect the consumer price index (CPI) data set to be released on Wednesday, while the producer price index (PPI) is anticipated on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18.\n\nThe plunge, however, seems only temporary, and technology stocks are poised to gain in the future. BlackRock anticipates that infrastructure and cybersecurity investments will \"shine\" in 2025. Jay Jacobs, the firm\u2019s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, considers the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. Jacobs said that AI companies need to build out their data centers and that keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the New Year.\n\n\u201cIf you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable. We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.\u201d\n\nJacobs further stated that even though technology may seem tangible, it is also heavily reliant on physical infrastructure such as energy, materials like copper, and even real estate. These real-world components are essential for supporting the systems that are used every day. He further went on to say that it\u2019s not just the mega-cap tech names that are winning, other semiconductor companies and other data center companies are benefiting from the rise of this theme.\n\nIn this regard, AI ETFs can play a significant role in helping investors gain targeted exposure while mitigating some of the risks associated with investing in individual AI stocks. They are a smart way for investors to invest in a theme for seeking longer-term gains.\n\n\u201cIdentifying future winners can be very difficult \u2013 it\u2019s not always the obvious names that make it in the long-term\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

            "article_content": "Target and touch totals are important but not as important as the market share. \u201cTargets\u201d is mostly a receiver stat (although there are some notable early exceptions). Touches are the currency of the running back.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is really simple. For pass-catchers, market share is targets divided by team pass attempts. For running backs, it is touches divided by team plays from scrimmage (not team touches, to be clear).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnap counts, depth of target and type of touch (running back receptions are far more valuable than carries) are also important but will generally not be discussed here. This is pure market share. Consider this a primary tool for assessing waivers and trades.\n\nHere\u2019s the list. Be sure to select the current week, though all the weeks of the season will be archived, so you can get a multi-week sample on a player if you so desire. Also, note that I put great thought into providing these stats weekly. The objective here is to respond quickly to present trends. Yearly stats smoothen everything out to a somewhat meaningless middle. As our Gene McCaffrey so wisely says, \u201cTo be very right, you have to be willing to be very wrong.\u201d\n\nScoop City Newsletter Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Sign Up\n\nRunning Back Touches\n\nZach Charbonnet was a beast \u2014 No. 1 in the rankings \u2014 but the party is probably ending if Kenneth Walker (calf) is back this week. Charbonnet is playable, but he\u2019s expected to be 50/50 in touches, though with more projected value than Walker, given his involvement in the passing game.\n\nChuba Hubbard is back to being a locked-in bell cow, with Jonathon Brooks suffering another ACL injury. Hubbard is a difference-maker in the fantasy playoffs, of course.\n\nAt No. 10, Tank Bigsby is noteworthy. The Jacksonville Jaguars have a depressed offense with Mac Jones at quarterback \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have a completion on a pass more than 20 yards downfield this year. There is no explosion, nothing for safeties to really worry about.\n\nRico Dowdle has one rushing TD. I get it. But he\u2019s second in rushing yards for the past six weeks, coinciding with his carry share increasing from about 45 percent to 75 percent. Get him in your lineups. The Carolina Panthers, the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Week 15 opponent, are 31st in yards allowed per carry.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the status of Bucky Irving. You can\u2019t play Rachaad White if Irving is active, but White\u2019s a must-play if Irving is out. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are one of the top offenses, averaging over 6.0 yards per play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTyrone Tracy Jr. was in the top 20, but he\u2019s really higher given that he had 10 targets \u2026 Drew Lock targets. But still, get him in there. The New York Giants passed a lot in Week 14 \u2014 49 attempts (21 completions). Tracy\u2019s fumble woes have apparently been forgiven, so Devin Singletary vulturing touches is no longer a worry.\n\nIsaac Guerendo has a foot issue. He says he\u2019s fine, but the San Francisco 49ers play on Thursday. You\u2019ll at least be able to make the early-week decision to use him or replace him in your lineup. The Rams are tough of late against the run, but Guerendo\u2019s still a must-start if active \u2014 the Niners run game has been more explosive without Christian McCaffery. If Guerendo is out, pick up Patrick Taylor. However, I don\u2019t have high confidence Taylor will get the vast majority of carries.\n\nJerome Ford has carved out a committee role with Nick Chubb, a development I did not see coming. Chubb must not be close to 100 percent from a pain perspective. (We knew he would not be, and probably will never be, close to 100 percent of what he was.)\n\nSincere McCormick was 20th, and I don\u2019t see him losing the job as primary ball carrier this week, though the offense will likely be depressed with Desmond Ridder at QB. Ridder faces his former Atlanta Falcons team in Week 15. Atlanta is stingy with rushing TDs but not with points, and we care more about the latter than the former.\n\nUnexpectedly, the Jets running backs were grouped tightly, and if Breece Hall is out again, I\u2019d have Braelon Allen at about RB25 and Isaiah Davis, who is very attainable, at about 32 \u2014 not much difference.\n\nI never veer off the past week\u2019s market share list, but remember, Jaleel McLaughlin (bye last week) is out there. He\u2019s in the RB30 bucket, too. He has no floor.\n\nReceiver Targets\n\nParker Washington was a bust for us in Week 14, mostly because Brian Thomas Jr. was fourth in the rankings at 39 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan Addison was second and has to be played this week, with Sam Darnold on pace for nearly 40 TD passes. The Minnesota Vikings have a narrow passing tree. Addison had 17 more market share points than Justin Jefferson. Darnold is having success passing where the defense isn\u2019t, and that\u2019s often away from Jefferson.\n\nAmari Cooper was No. 5. I\u2019d start him against Detroit. There\u2019s a two-TD game coming at some point.\n\nChristian Watson looks to be the primary receiver for the Green Bay Packers, which does not mean much, I know \u2014 it\u2019s a very tight grouping. But, given his air yards and general explosiveness, Watson is the best bet, by far, for 100-plus yards.\n\nAdam Thielen was 10th, landing him in very plausible starting territory.\n\nJoshua Palmer is also in the start-worthy range, though Ladd McConkey\u2019s status is a big factor for the viability of not just Palmer but also Quentin Johnston. If McConkey is out, Palmer and Johnston are must plays against a bad Tampa Bay pass defense.\n\nRay-Ray McCloud was 15th. I can\u2019t trust anyone on the Falcons. Kyle Pitts has just disappeared, though, which boosts McCloud. Again, the Falcons play the Las Vegas Raiders, an average pass defense, which means no edge matchup-wise.\n\nJalen McMillan was top 30, but the Los Angeles Chargers (his Week 15 matchup) are a top defense.\n\nI can\u2019t trust Xavier Legette despite his similar ranking, even against the Cowboys.\n\nMalik Nabers was 41st at just over 20 percent. But we can\u2019t ignore the team quarterback when making decisions on wide receivers. The Giants\u2019 situation is bad to an outlying degree. New York is home against the Baltimore Ravens, who have a bad pass defense but not as bad a pass defense as Lock is a QB.\n\n(Top photo of Jordan Addison: Matt Krohn-Imagn Images)"

            "article_content": "SkyAlyne and KF Aerospace have confirmed the signing of a purchase agreement with Swiss aerospace manufacturer Pilatus for 19 PC-21 training aircraft, which will be based at 15 Wing in Moose Jaw alongside 23 Grob G 120TP airframes.\n\nThe Grob airframes will serve as the basic flight training vehicles for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Future Aircrew Training (FAcT) program. The PC-21s will serve as advanced fixed-wing training aircraft. The contract includes Pilatus supplying supporting equipment, including mission planning and debriefing systems, and training materials.\n\n\u201cThe PC-21 really is the ideal advanced trainer for the Air Force and we at SkyAlyne are excited to be deploying it as part of the FAcT program,\u201d said Harrison Ruess, SkyAlyne\u2019s head of communications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s state-of-the-art, it\u2019s utilized by several other militaries, and undoubtedly it\u2019s going to serve Canada well for many years to come.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year FAcT program contract was awarded to SkyAlyne in spring 2024 and is currently in a five-year transition period to become the sole pilot and aircrew training program for the RCAF, as the three current separate RCAF training programs conclude and their responsibilities are combined into FAcT. The FAcT program is overseen from a Joint Management Office at SkyAlyne\u2019s Ottawa headquarters, with three operational bases: Moose Jaw, SK, Southport, MB, and Winnipeg, MB.\n\nSkyAlyne was formed through a partnership between CAE and KF Aerospace, which in turn are SkyAlyne\u2019s major subcontractors.\n\nTracy Medve, board chair of SkyAlyne and president/CEO of KF Aerospace, said \u201cThe PC-21 is one of the world\u2019s most capable and reliable training aircraft, expertly built and supported by Pilatus. Its versatility allows it to serve in a dual role as both a general advanced live flying trainer and in advanced jet training, which provides Canada with excellent value and offers a unique advantage for the FAcT program. We\u2019re thrilled to partner with Pilatus to deliver this exceptional platform for Canada\u2019s next generation of aircrew training.\u201d\n\nThe 23 Grob aircraft were confirmed on Nov. 19. The Grob G 120TPs are an upgraded version of the Grob G 120As, which are currently in use by KF Aerospace and the RCAF for military pilot training. The TP variant features updated avionics, higher performance, and a more powerful turboprop engine.\n\n\u201cPart of the Future Aircrew Training program includes infrastructure construction for new facilities to support the new fleet of aircraft that are coming,\u201d explained Ruess. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in the design phase of the infrastructure work, and working diligently on that, with construction activities aiming to begin in the next 12 to 18 months on the base at 15 Wing.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The Meta Quest 3 is confidently the best VR headset out there right now but a report suggests it may cede its top spot to other headset manufacturers while allowing them to use its OS and store.\n\nA report was recent published by The Information (via OC3D) citing an employee at Goertek, the Chinese manufacturer who produces and tests Quests, and two employees at Meta. In this, it is claimed Meta hopes that Goertek and other manufacturers will take on a bigger role in designing and creating headsets by 2030, potentially fully developing them.\n\nTaking a step back from production is said to be a way to allow Meta to focus on software, which is a much more profitable section of the business.\n\nOften times, hardware, specifically cheap and accessible hardware like Meta's budget headset are sold at a loss or barely breaking even, in order to make money back on the software.\n\nWe've seen time and time again the massive costs of Meta's VR and AR division, Reality Labs. It has often spent upwards of a billion dollars per month.\n\nInstead of putting out headsets, Meta could essentially loan the use of its OS and Meta Quest storefront for non-Meta headsets to use.\n\nOf course, coming from just a handful of employees, it's important to note that plans for moving hardware manufacturing away from Meta itself is reported for some time in the future. Meta could always change course over the next few years, especially as the VR market continues to develop.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nHaving just bought a Meta Quest 3 myself, one of the things I'm most pleasantly surprised by is how intuitive that OS is. Everything slots together well and is easy to explore. The idea of Meta essentially loaning its software doesn't seem like a bad idea in theory, especially when it's one of the few things holding back rivals like the Pico 4 Ultra.\n\nNot only does Meta have a big install base but its OS has wider brand recognisability, which is part of why Android is popular today. An Android user can easily swap to almost any Android phone with little problems, which makes it easier for new names to enter the market.\n\nThis is all before mentioning the rather stellar section of titles available on the Meta storefront. Throw in a Meta Quest + Subscription, and access to some of the bigger titles like Asgard's Wrath 2 and Batman Arkham Shadow, and you have an impressive selection to play through.\n\nIn that same article, The Information's report says that Meta is aiming move up to half of the production of its headset to Vietnam, diversifying what has otherwise been predominantly Chinese manufacturing.\n\nThis appears to be an effort to avoid the huge penalties on Chinese imports that will come as a result of the tariffs, proposed by soon-to-be president Donald Trump.\n\nVirtual reality (Image credit: Valve) Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?\n\nBest graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR\n\nBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR\n\nThat production change from China to Vietnam being assisted by Goertek is a further strengthening of Meta's relationship with the Chinese manufacturing company, and one that signals that grander business plan, according to the previously mentioned employees.\n\nAs of right now, Goertek is an essential part of the production and testing of Meta Quest headsets but Meta is said to be encouraging Goertek to also work on designing components like lenses and displays.\n\nMeta has cemented a name for itself in the VR market with great well-priced hardware and it might actually see a greater return on all that digital real estate in the next decade."

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s economy, as the saying goes, data is the new gold \u2014 a valuable asset from a financial standpoint. However, from a company\u2019s existential perspective, there\u2019s an even more fitting analogy. We are all familiar with the theory of evolution, where the Earth began as a rocky planet and eventually teemed with life. A similar transformation has occurred with data. More than 20 years ago, data within organizations was like scattered rocks on early Earth. It was not \u201calive\u201d because the business knowledge required to turn data into value was confined to individuals\u2019 minds, Excel sheets or lost in analog signals.\n\nDigital transformation started creating a digital presence of everything we do in our lives, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) advancements in the past decade dramatically altered the data landscape. We are now deciphering rules from patterns in data, embedding business knowledge into ML models, and soon, AI agents will leverage this data to make decisions on behalf of companies. Data is now \u201calive\u201d like a living organism, flowing through the company\u2019s veins in the form of ingestion, curation and product output. This organism is the cornerstone of a company\u2019s competitive advantage, necessitating careful and responsible nurturing and management.\n\nTo succeed in today\u2019s landscape, every company \u2014 small, mid-sized or large \u2014 must embrace a data-centric mindset. This article proposes a methodology for organizations to implement a modern data management function that can be tailored to meet their unique needs. By \u201cmodern\u201d, I refer to an engineering-driven methodology that fully capitalizes on automation and software engineering best practices. This approach is repeatable, minimizes dependence on manual controls, harnesses technology and AI for data management and integrates seamlessly into the digital product development process. The proposed model illustrates the data management practice through five functional pillars: Data platform; data engineering; analytics and reporting; data science and AI; and data governance."

And I'm not talking about the football. There's been some crazy things going on,' Rodgers began. 'There's been some drones in the sky in Jersey.'\n\nMcAfee then showed a clip on an unidentified large object hovering above Bedminster, New Jersey with blue, green and red flashing lights.\n\nAaron Rodgers has offered yet another conspiracy theory on the extra-terrestrial\n\nThe Jets quarterback discussed mysterious drone activity above New Jersey on Pat McAfee\n\n'What the hell is that?' Rodgers continued, before highlighting that the mysterious sighting came above Bedminster where both president-elect Donald Trump owns a golf course and Jets owner Woody Johnson lives.\n\nThe four-time MVP did admit it could be Trump flying in for a quick round of golf but, of course, it wouldn't be Aaron Rodgers without a conspiracy theory.\n\n'Maybe it's some kids messing around\u2026maybe not, though,' he hinted.\n\n'I'm thinking about having a Friday night 5E experience,' he added, leaving the panel bewildered.\n\n'It's where you have a big kind of meditation circle and then you call in the aliens and you use little green lasers to bring them in,' the NFL veteran explained.\n\nIt wasn't the first time that the former Super Bowl winner has discussed extra-terrestrial experiences.\n\nDuring last season's 'Hard Knocks' series focusing on the Jets, Rodgers claimed he experienced a UFO sighting in 2005.\n\nHe said he was at former Cal teammate Steve Levy's house in New Jersey shortly before he was taken by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft when the sighting occurred.\n\nThe 41-year-old has previously opened up on an experience with a UFO sighting\n\nThe Jets are officially out of the playoffs with a 3-10 record, following last week's slate\n\nRodgers, who has publicly admitted to using hallucinogen ayahuasca, said he was trying to sleep as he had a 5am wake up call the following day but was disturbed by an 'alarm going off in the distance.'\n\n'It just didn't seem like normal, and I heard some rustling downstairs,' Rodgers said on the season finale of 'Hard Knocks.'\n\n'So I got up, walk downstairs, it's a beautiful night, and [we] walked outside, and up in the clouds, we heard this sound, and we saw this tremendously large object moving through the sky. And it was like a scene out of \"Independence Day\" when the ships are coming into the atmosphere, and they're creating this, like, kind of explosion-type fire in the sky.\n\n'We saw this incredibly large object and froze, as anybody would, because, you know, what the hell is going on? Eventually, it went out of sight, and nobody said a word. We just stood frozen.\n\n'And about 30 seconds later we heard the real, recognizable sound of fighter jets that seemed to be chasing this object. Again, we just stood there in disbelief for another few minutes and nobody said a word. And we just looked at each other like, 'did we just see what we think we just saw?'\n\nRodgers said he checked the papers and watched the news in the following days but nothing was mentioned.\n\nHowever, the experience piqued his interest in UFOs, leading him to do more research into them.\n\nRodgers later discovered that the siren was from a nuclear plant around nine miles away and claimed that UFOs are often linked to nuclear energy.\n\nThe Jets quarterback is known for his outlandish theories and techniques opening up on his use of ayahuasca at the start of last season, claiming it helped him to his back-to-back MVP seasons in 2020 and 2021.\n\nHe also underwent a darkness retreat shortly after the end of the 2022 season to contemplate his NFL future."

            "article_content": "Extraterrestrial life may look nothing like life on Earth. So, astrobiologists are coming up with a framework to study how complex systems evolve.\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY 4.0\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off.\n\nChris Impey is University Distinguished Professor of Astronomy at the University of Arizona.

            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained.

'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Google captivated the tech world Monday with Willow, a new quantum chip that outperformed even the world\u2019s best supercomputer on an advanced test, and experts say this week\u2019s revelations are just the start of a new phase of cutting-edge computing.\n\nThe new chip, which even wow'd Tesla CEO Elon Musk, can complete a complex computation in five minutes that would take the most powerful supercomputer 10 septillion years\u2014more than the estimated age of the universe, wrote Hartmut Neven, the founder and lead for Google Quantum AI in a blog post.\n\nGoogle researchers were also able to prove for the first time that the chip\u2019s errors did not increase proportionately as the number of qubits, the basic information processing unit in a quantum computer, rises. The qubits in quantum computing are more prone to mistakes than a regular computer because they are highly sensitive to electromagnetic and other forms of interference and can only remain in a quantum state for very brief periods of time.\n\nBut in order for a quantum chip\u2019s calculations to make sense, it needs to have a very low error rate, Javad Shabani, a physics professor and director of the Center for Quantum Information Physics at New York University, told Fortune.\n\nGoogle\u2019s breakthrough is \u201cone of the highlights of the recent decade,\u201d he said, and could mean quantum computers are a step closer to becoming more useful for practical purposes.\n\n\u201cClassical\u201d supercomputers, including the \u201cFrontier\u201d supercomputer that is commonly recognized as among the most powerful, are used for advanced modeling and simulations. Yet, these supercomputers are more similar to the common laptop than you\u2019d think. They operate on the binary system of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s that less powerful computers use, albeit at a much more advanced level. While supercomputers are undoubtedly powerful, they are huge pieces of machinery that use massive amounts of energy for cooling systems.\n\nQuantum chips like Willow operate on a much smaller scale. The qubits that make up these high powered chips are roughly the size of an atom, and operate via the rules of quantum mechanics. The chips pack a computing punch at a miniscule level and with potentially better energy efficiency than supercomputers, but they\u2019re also limited in their uses.\n\nThe test Google ran on Willow is a \u201cbenchmark\u201d meant to show the quantum chip\u2019s capability relative to other systems, including the best existing supercomputers. Google in 2019 completed a benchmark test with its earlier \u201cSycamore\u201d quantum chip and found at the time that the older chip could complete a calculation in 200 seconds that would take the best supercomputers thousands of years to complete, according to a blog post at the time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Willow chip has around double the qubits used to power its computing than that of the Sycamore chip, and exponentially more computing power than a supercomputer has for some uses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Willow findings show that quantum computers can perform much better than the best available supercomputers in certain cases, an assertion that just a few years ago was more widely doubted. It also possibly shifts the focus of future quantum chip development away from primarily trying to find a way to reduce errors to, instead, trying to increase the number of qubits that make up each chip, according to Rice University physics and astronomy professor and founder of the Rice Quantum Initiative Kaden Hazzard.\n\nGoogle\u2019s discovery is groundbreaking, but that doesn\u2019t mean your standard laptop will be replaced by a quantum computer anytime soon, Hazzard told Fortune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at least a few years away before we reach the kind of capabilities where the quantum computer can be used directly for things that have business applications, for example,\u201d Hazard said.\n\nFears about Willow having the capacity to decrypt even the most advanced encryptions used in banking or tech are also overblown, Rice University assistant professor of computer science Tirthak Patel told Fortune. Solving such advanced cryptography would require a much more advanced chip than Willow, said Patel, and researchers are already finding ways to create quantum-proof encryptions.\n\nInstead, Willow is a stepping stone toward greater progress in quantum computing. Monday\u2019s findings confirmed it outperforms supercomputers in some cases and will do lots to convince naysayers of the potential quantum computing has to eventually help improve human lives, Patel said.\n\nStill, while it may be several years away, advanced quantum computing could be used to accurately simulate miniscule quantum systems like chemical reactions that could help discover new drugs, or solve quantum mechanical problems to build new types of materials or better catalysts for reactions, said Hazzard.\n\nPossibly sooner, the advanced computing ability of quantum chips could help improve weather predictions or streamline supply chain efficiency, all while being potentially less energy intensive than existing supercomputers, Patel said.\n\nBecause these types of applications can already run on quantum chips with fewer qubits and without the advanced error reduction that Google has shown is possible, better quantum chips could revolutionize these areas, said Patel.\n\n\u201cThe biggest task right now that most scientists and engineers working in the quantum computing field are concerned with is demonstrating the utility and practicality of quantum computing for different real world applications,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhile this experiment hasn't done that just yet, it is a major milestone in that step.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nConnections between knowledge areas, introduced by Alena Tensor. Credit: Piotr Ogonowski (created with the support of AI tools)\n\nThe search for quantum gravity has gone on for 100 years, but it is not the only unification challenge in physics. Many of us believe that one day there will be a unification theory\u2014a theory that will reconcile many divergent physical theories.\n\nOur new article published in Physica Scripta brings new hope that such a theory exists. It demonstrates that the use of a certain mathematical object called Alena Tensor reconciles various physical theories, including general relativity, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and continuum mechanics. Will this finally allow scientists to unify descriptions used in physics?\n\nWhat is Alena Tensor?\n\nAny movement under the influence of forces can be mathematically represented as movement along a curved path. Using differential geometry, one may equally well assume that the trajectory was straight, while the space in which the move took place is curved. It may sound complicated, but it can be assumed that there is a mathematical transformation that allows us to describe curved space-time equivalently as flat space-time where certain forces act.\n\nIt has long been suspected that such a transformation exists, although opinions on this matter are divided. Some physicists believe that the metric tensor, a mathematical object describing the curvature of space-time, is simply a feature of space-time. Some physicists, most often mathematical physicists, are of the opinion that such a transformation should exist.\n\nAlena Tensor provides just such a transformation. In short, Alena Tensor can straighten curved space-time while preserving all conclusions from general relativity. This property alone makes Alena Tensor an extremely valuable tool, but this is just the beginning.\n\nAlena Tensor in flat and curved space-time\n\nWe used Alena Tensor to describe a system with an electromagnetic field, obtaining three forces in flat space-time: electromagnetism (which is not surprising), \"against gravity,\" and radiation reaction force.\n\nThe radiation reaction force is already known in physics. It safeguards the principle of conservation of energy and ensures that the energy of an accelerating body does not exceed the energy available in the physical system.\n\nThe \"against gravity\" force generalizes classical Newton's equation for gravity, providing a relativistic description of gravity in flat space-time, fully consistent with general relativity:\n\nIt faithfully reproduces the motion described in curved space-time.\n\nThis force does not act in freefall, respecting the equivalence principle.\n\nGravity in this description is not a force but the counteraction to gravity is.\n\nThe Alena Tensor allows for a smooth transition to the description used in the electromagnetic theory and then it turns out that:\n\nCharged particles cannot remain at complete rest and should have spin, which agrees with quantum mechanics.\n\nThe reason for the existence of mass (and energy) of charged particles is the magnetic moment.\n\nThe above result basically explains what matter is, although so far it only applies to charged elementary particles and requires generalization to other fields.\n\nThe Alena Tensor also allows a smooth transition to the equations of general relativity. The obtained results provide some answers to the questions that have long puzzled physicists, concerning, e.g., singularities of black holes, cosmological constant, dark energy and dark matter.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Alena Tensor completely reverses this approach. It is much easier now to describe gravity in flat space-time in a way that mathematically reproduces general relativity and then uses the known tools of quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, in the article we derived quantum equations describing the entire physical system with all previously mentioned forces. It turns out that these are three currently known main quantum equations. This leads to the completely surprising conclusion: It would mean that gravity has been present in quantum mechanics from the very beginning. It must be admitted that probably no one expected such a solution to the puzzle. In the article we also explain why it was so hard to spot gravity in quantum equations.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere are interesting times ahead, but no one should expect an immediate revolution. Science does not develop at the pace of messages on social networks. It will take several months for this research paper to get noticed, several months before researchers take an interest in it, read it and use its results. It also takes many months to conduct and describe research using the new mathematical apparatus, then go through the peer review process and publish it.\n\nIn the first articles, we should expect attempts to falsify Alena Tensor, because in physics, like in all science, we need to be sure that our next steps lead in the right direction. If falsification deceives and further research and experiments confirm the results obtained from Alena Tensor, we may hope that in the next three to 10 years, this will lead to the unification and reconciliation of many descriptions currently used in physics.\n\nIt is also entirely possible that the article will go unnoticed or no one will pursue further research, as has happened many times before with innovations in science. Contrary to popular belief, for most readers, the innovation of the article is a disadvantage\u2014it is harder to read, understand and accept. The difficulties during the long publication process also indicate that many scientific journals see too much risk in publishing innovative research, especially if its authors are not widely known scientists.\n\nFortunately, this article was eventually published by a highly respected and inclusive journal that assesses the scientific value higher than non-meritorious criteria, for which I would like to publicly express my highest respect. The editor and reviewers provided constructive criticism, and their substantive comments helped to significantly improve the article, exactly the way science should function. However, it seems that research on non-mainstream methods of unifying physics (and Alena Tensor is one) may require much more time and perseverance.\n\nThe hope remains that future generations of physicists will complete the development of this method despite the obstacles, and in 20 to 40 years, Alena Tensor will inspire the scientific community to unify physics.\n\nThis story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

            "article_content": "Most of us are aware of the deep problems in the current US pharmaceutical industry. Yet few may realize that today\u2019s issues stem from changes that occurred centuries ago.\n\nAs I explain in The Apothecary\u2019s Wife: The Hidden History of Medicine and How it Became a Commodity, the current medication system was established between 1650 and 1740, when professionals used the scientific revolution to push women out of the medical space. At that time, domestic medicine was dominant. Women were the primary sources of medicine in their communities, making medication from organic ingredients at home. Despite using the exact same ingredients for their own medicines, apothecaries and physicians persuaded the public of the superiority of their treatments and began charging for them. Medicinal substances transformed from free, household goods for everyone into commodities available only to those with means. This transformation normalized the practice of withholding life-saving medications from people who could not afford it \u2014 and valuing the economic success of corporations over the lives of some citizens.\n\nThe forces that transformed medication into a commodity are still with us. For example, domestic medicine encouraged sharing recipes to maximize healing, but today\u2019s commercial medicine attempts to keep recipes secret to maximize profit. The US patent system and the battles between corporations making generic and brand-name drugs is a logical result, even when those mechanisms imperil patients\u2019 health and lives. (See also Victor Roy\u2019s Capitalizing a Cure: How Finance Controls the Price and Value of Medicines.)\n\nRegulation is another legacy of medication\u2019s economic transformation. In an attempt to exclude quacks from the medical marketplace and to protect consumers, 17th- and 18th-century professionals began testing competitors\u2019 medicines to prove their inferiority and then publicizing the results. Joshua Ward (ca. 1685-1761), for instance, widely sold \u201cmedications\u201d made of metals such as lead and antimony despite knowing that ingesting them could be fatal (Chapter 7 in The Apothecary\u2019s Wife has a lot to say about him). Regulatory entities such as the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency should do this work now. History provides ample proof that when guided by science, regulation works. It has also shown us that lax oversight, such as in the famous case of thalidomide, the furor over aduhelm, and today\u2019s generic drug industry, endangers patients.\n\nWe also continue to experience the fallout from the campaign to elevate \u201cthe New Science.\u201d Its 17- and 18-century advocates made it seem more impressive by casting this new way of thinking and discovering as too difficult for ordinary people. That strategy generated an ongoing suspicion of science and a profound misunderstanding of how science functions. Although particularly virulent in the United States, this skepticism and ignorance of science abounds worldwide.\n\nFor the United States, this legacy will be even more obvious and determinative after the new government is sworn in on January 20, 2025. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) is America\u2019s only attempt so far at a public health system. For decades, the Republican party on the whole has been opposed to the ACA and national health care more broadly, drawing on the value system that displaced domestic medicine\u2019s ethos with one that prioritizes corporate health over human health. 17- and 18-century professionals recognized this issue in converting medication into a commodity, but decided against adding a mechanism for treating the impoverished. Repealing the ACA would be returning to the three-hundred-year-old roots of today\u2019s system. Similarly, the current nominee to lead the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mehmet Oz, has pursued profit opportunities in medicine with disregard for science and the health of ordinary people. He has even promoted colloidal silver (more upscale than Joshua Ward, but an equally ancient claim). It is likely that the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requiring the CMS to negotiate the prices that it pays for pharmaceuticals will be ignored or removed.\n\nSkepticism and suspicion of science undoubtedly will bear down on federal divisions, departments, and institutes responsible for health care and science. Regulation is a probable early casualty. The nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., harbors these views, exemplified by his opposition to vaccines, fluoridated water, and pasteurized milk. Kennedy\u2019s misunderstanding of how science works, not to mention the role of regulation, leads to a hostility toward scientists that has much in common with witchcraft fears. History suggests that under such leadership, HHS and the CMS will authorize the use of unscientifically tested treatments, reject the scientific foundations of the regulation process, and nurture a national hostility to science and scientists.\n\nThe consequences of this approach will appear quickly. Federal opposition to vaccines, for instance, will swiftly raise the mortality rate, especially the infant and child mortality rates, to spectacular highs. As Olivia Craighead drily wrote after Mehmet Oz\u2019s nomination, \u201cFingers crossed colloidal silver works for measles.\u201d Outbreaks of easily prevented, highly communicable, frequently fatal or permanently debilitating diseases such as measles and pertussis (whooping cough) will likely negatively impact the economy. Tourism will drop as visitors choose to avoid such a perilous environment. The national failure to provide a reliably healthy, sound workforce will curtail domestic productivity and obstruct foreign investment.\n\nPrognostication in this case is fairly easy. Addressing these values and beliefs about the role of medication is not. They are rooted in medication\u2019s transformation into a commodity. Knowing where these ideas came from, however, offers insight into the current system, and as history shows, insight is a step toward action."
