One expert explained that the lights were only a phenomenon that shows nothing but a reflection in the night sky.\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.

            "article_content": "For centuries, humans have used actuarial tables to figure out how long they're likely to live. Now artificial intelligence is taking up the task - and its answers may well be of interest to economists and money managers.\n\nThe recently released Death Clock, an AI-powered longevity app, has proved a hit with paying customers - downloaded some 125,000 times since its launch in July, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThe AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. It uses information about diet, exercise, stress levels and sleep to predict a likely date of death. The results are a \"pretty significant\" improvement on the standard life-table expectations, says its developer, Brent Franson.\n\nDespite its somewhat morbid tone - it displays a \"fond farewell\" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper - Death Clock is catching on among people trying to live more healthily. It ranks high in the Health and Fitness category of apps. But the technology potentially has a wider range of uses.\n\nLife expectancy is key to all kinds of financial and economic calculations, by governments, companies and individuals - from retirement income needs, to policy coverage at life insurance and pension funds, and financial planning.\n\nIn the US - which has lagged behind other developed economies in the life expectancy of its citizens in recent years - the Social Security Administration has its own table for mortality rates, which features in the annual financial report to trustees.\n\nThe government agency currently predicts that an 85-year-old man in the US has a 10% probability of dying within a year, and an average 5.6 years to live. But averages like that can be off by wide margins, says Franson, and the new algorithms can deliver a more tailored measure - a customized death clock.\n\nThat such findings are of interest in economics is demonstrated by the publication - in just the past month or so - of two papers around the topic by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n'Harness The Benefits'\n\nOne of them, titled \"On the Limits of Chronological Age,\" looks at the diverse ways that the aging process affects physiological capacities. It finds that many aspects of economic behavior, like readiness to join the labor force, may not be well captured by people's calendar age - even though that's what policies such as statutory retirement are typically based on.\n\nBy continuing to rely on chronological age as a proxy for how well people can function, societies may end up failing to \"fully harness the benefits of increasing longevity,\" the researchers from Harvard and the London Business School conclude.\n\nAnother working paper examined the \"value per statistical life\" or VSL - a callous-sounding measure that's used for cost-benefit analysis in areas like regulation of pollution or compensation for workplace accidents. It's typically calculated based on compensation for workers in high-risk jobs.\n\nThe researchers behind the NBER study \"The value of Statistical Life for Seniors\" drew on a different dataset: the propensity of older Americans to spend money on medical services that reduce mortality risk. They found a mean VSL at age 67 of just under $2 million for people reporting their health as \"excellent,\" compared with $600,000 for those in \"good\" health.\n\nWhen it comes to personal finances, better measures of life expectancy will have profound implications for people saving for retirement, according to Ryan Zabrowski, a financial planner with investment advisory firm Krilogy.\n\n\"A huge concern for elderly people, our retirees, is outliving their money,\" says Zabrowski, who touches on the issue in his soon-to-be-released book, \"Time Ahead\".\n\n'Out The Window'\n\nDecisions such as how much to save and how fast to withdraw assets are often based on broad-brush and unreliable averages for life expectancy. AI-driven tests that can potentially reduce that uncertainty are largely unheard-of now, but likely won't be such an unusual idea in the future.\n\nWhat's more, the AI technology itself along with advances in medicine has the potential to boost life expectancy - and with it the risk of running out of savings. Zabrowski reckons one consequence is clear: longer retirements will mean savers need higher-return investments for their old age, which will push them to allocate more stocks over fixed-income securities.\n\n\"The conventional method of measuring demand for equities will be thrown out the window,\" he writes his forthcoming book. As people start expecting to live longer, there will be a \"massive escalation in demand for equities.\"\n\nThere are plenty of technologies already out there - like heart-rate monitors and maximal oxygen-consumption gauges from wearables - that have the potential, in tandem with new AI-powered devices, to reduce the uncertainty around personal mortality.\n\nOf course, there'll always be limits. On top of entirely unpredictable variables, like accidents or even pandemics, there are plenty of intangibles.\n\nLongevity Gap\n\nLoneliness, for instance, is often reckoned to reduce life expectancy. Gratitude may increase it. A Harvard study found that women who reported feeling the most grateful had a 9% lower risk of dying within three years than those who reported feeling the least.\n\nThen there's the question of inequality. For life expectancy, money matters. Multiple studies - including the work of Nobel prize-winning economist Angus Deaton on \"Deaths of Despair\" - have found a clear gap between rich and poor Americans.\n\nResearch published by the American Medical Association found the longevity gap between the wealthiest and poorest 1%, at age 40, was nearly 15 years for men and 10 for women.\n\nFor Death Clock users, who have to pay $40 a year to subscribe, the app suggests lifestyle changes that can hold mortality at bay - along with a second-by-second countdown of estimated time remaining.\n\n\"There's probably not a more important date in your life than the day that you're going to die,\" Franson says."

From hauntings and Bigfoot sightings to UFOs and the mysterious appearances of coins falling out of thin air \u2014 all of it happened on his watch, and all of it left a mark.\n\nMilford, of Navajo and Cherokee descent, is a Fort Lewis College graduate who recently published his memoir.\n\nThe Paranormal Ranger is an account of Milford\u2019s time as a Navajo Ranger, during which he investigated supernatural occurrences around the reservation. The author juxtaposes his personal accounts with Navajo creation stories.\n\nThe book is a personal account of Milford\u2019s 23 years as a Navajo Ranger. The Rangers are part of the Navajo Nation\u2019s Division of Natural Resources, and they're tasked with protecting the lands and natural sites on the reservation.\n\n\u201cWe were assigned to investigate cases that were out of the ordinary,\u201d said Milford, \u201cinvolving what is commonly referred to as paranormal or supernatural haunting cases, Bigfoot cases, UFOs, extraterrestrial witchcraft, and Skinwalker-related cases.\u201d\n\nStanley Milford, Jr.'s book, The Paranormal Ranger, shares his experiences working with supernatural cases as a Navajo Ranger.\n\nSkinwalkers are evil spirits that can take animal form and often move on all fours. They\u2019re rarely discussed with outsiders unfamiliar with Navajo culture and beliefs. In The Paranormal Ranger, Milford shares some of these guarded stories, hoping to shed light on Navajo traditions and supernatural experiences.\n\nHe details an investigation he was a part of in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIn two days, there were 66 U.S. coins that would apport or just appear out of thin air and fall on the floor, or they would come flying across the room,\u201d said Milford. \u201cSometimes, they would hit us investigators. Out of all of those 66 coins, they all landed heads up.\n\nI witnessed with my own eyes at least 10 of these coins falling out of thin air, out of nothingness. That, for me, was a life-changing experience. It made me realize that the coins had to be coming from somewhere, some other space.\n\nFrom that time, this phenomenon followed me. I began having the coins appear in my home that would fall on the floor or fly across the room,\u201d said Milford.\n\nMilford juxtaposes his personal accounts of paranormal activities with Navajo creation stories in the book. These are the origin stories of the world and the Din\u00e9 people. He says he drew parallels between the Navajo emergence stories and what he experienced with these paranormal cases.\n\n\u201cThere's a different world that the Navajo people came [from]. They came into the physical world from four worlds or five lower worlds. When you look at the descriptions of the beings described in those tales, [they] fit with what I saw with the descriptions of the Bigfoot and extraterrestrial or alien beings,\u201d said Milford.\n\nMilford noted that he worked alongside 40 to 50 rangers as a Navajo Ranger. Today, there are less than ten.\n\nCopyright 2024 Four Corners Public Radio"

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe source of energy is a binary star system\n\nAstronomers discover record burst of energy coming from deep space\n\nBy Akash Pandey 07:14 pm Nov 30, 202407:14 pm\n\nWhat's the story A team of astronomers from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) has detected a record-breaking energy burst from deep space. The source of this intense energy pulse, dubbed GLEAM-X J0704-37, is a binary system consisting of a small red dwarf star and a white dwarf, the remnant of a dead star. They made the discovery using archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).\n\nUnique phenomenon\n\nGLEAM-X J0704-37: A unique long-period radio transient\n\nThe energy pulse, GLEAM-X J0704-37, is a one-of-a-kind long-period radio transient that erupts every three hours and lasts for 30-60 seconds. This makes it the longest-lasting case of such a phenomenon ever recorded. Since their first detection in 2006, these transients have baffled astronomers with their ability to generate radio waves. The latest discovery could shed light on the source of these energy bursts.\n\nResearch hurdles\n\nChallenges in studying long-period radio transients\n\nThe study of long-period radio transients has been difficult because they are located in densely populated regions of the Milky Way. This makes it hard to figure out what is producing these bursts of radio waves. Natasha Hurley-Walker, a member of the discovery team and researcher at Curtin University, said an optical image is required to understand these transients but there are often too many stars blocking the view.\n\nStar system\n\nGLEAM-X J0704-37's origin traced to specific star system\n\nThe discovery of GLEAM-X J0704-37 was a stroke of luck since it came from a less crowded region of the Milky Way, around 5,000 light-years away. \"Our new discovery lies far off the galactic plane, so there are only a handful of stars nearby, and we're now certain one-star system, in particular, is generating the radio waves,\" Hurley-Walker said. The team traced the origin of this peculiar long-period radio transient to one particular star system using South Africa's MeerKAT telescope.\n\nBinary system\n\nBinary system of red and white dwarf powers radio emission\n\nThe researchers found one of the stars in the GLEAM-X J0704-37 emitting system to be a low-mass red dwarf star or M-dwarf. However, an M-dwarf alone couldn't generate the observed energy levels. Additional analysis indicated that this red dwarf is part of a binary system with another object, possibly a white dwarf. \"Together, they power radio emission,\" Hurley-Walker said, explaining the source of these powerful energy bursts.\n\nTheory\n\nMagnetic fields and energy blasts: A new theory\n\nThe research team suggested that strong magnetic fields in this binary system could be causing the periodic energy blasts. These are similar to those seen from rapidly spinning neutron stars or pulsars. The unique location of the GLEAM-X J0704-37 emitting system helped researchers rule out a highly magnetic neutron star, or magnetar, as its source. The team is now working on confirming this binary system's nature and explaining how it launched GLEAM-X J0704-37."

            "article_content": "Footprints dating back 1.5 million years made by two different species of human ancestors have been found at the same spot\u2014a fossil first\u2014and the individuals likely passed within an hour from each other.\n\nMore than a million years ago, on a hot savannah teeming with wildlife near the shore of what would someday become Lake Turkana in Kenya, two completely different species of hominins may have passed each other as they scavenged for food.\n\nScientists know this because they have examined 1.5-million-year-old fossils unearthed here and have concluded they represent the first example of two sets of hominin footprints made about the same time on an ancient lake shore.\n\nThe discovery will provide more insight into human evolution and how species cooperated and competed with one another, said scientists who explained that \u201chominin\u201d is a newer term that describes a subdivision of the larger category known as hominids. Hominins includes all organisms, extinct and alive, considered to be within the human lineage that emerged after the split from the ancestors of the great apes, believed to have occurred about 6 million to 7 million years ago.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the journal Science, offers hard proof that different hominin species lived contemporaneously in time and space, overlapping as they evaded predators and weathered the challenges of safely securing food in the ancient African landscape. Making the footprints were the two most common human species of the Pleistocene Epoch\u2014Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cTheir presence on the same surface, made closely together in time, places the two species at the lake margin, using the same habitat,\u201d said Rutgers University Professor Craig Feibel, an author of the study.\n\nFeibel, who has conducted research since 1981 in that area of northern Kenya, a rich fossil site, applied his expertise in stratigraphy and dating to demonstrate the geological antiquity of the fossils at 1.5 million years ago. He also interpreted the depositional setting of the footprint surface, narrowing down the passage of the track makers to a few hours, and showing they were formed at the very spot of soft sediments where they were found.\n\nIf the hominins didn\u2019t cross paths, they traversed the shore within hours of each other, Feibel said.\n\n\u201cFossil footprints are exciting because they provide vivid snapshots that bring our fossil relatives to life,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, the study\u2019s first author, and an associate professor of biology at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nAMAZING: Fossil of Neanderthal Child with Down\u2019s Syndrome Hints at Early Humans\u2019 Compassion\n\nProf. Hatala has been investigating hominin footprints since 2012, and says they reveal how living individuals, millions of years ago, were moving around their environments and potentially interacting with each other, or even with other animals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that we can\u2019t really get from bones or stone tools.\u201d\n\nWhile skeletal fossils have long provided the primary evidence for studying human evolution, new data from fossil footprints are revealing fascinating details about the evolution of human anatomy and locomotion, and giving further clues about ancient human behaviors and environments.\n\nAn expert in foot anatomy, Hatala found the prints reflected different patterns of anatomy and locomotion. He and several co-authors distinguished one set of footprints from another using new methods they recently developed to enable them to conduct a 3D analysis.\n\n\u201cIn biological anthropology, we\u2019re always interested in finding new ways to extract behavior from the fossil record, and this is a great example,\u201d said Rebecca Ferrell, a program director at the National Science Foundation who helped fund this portion of the research. \u201cThe team used cutting-edge 3D imaging technologies to create an entirely new way to look at footprints, which helps us understand human evolution and the roles of cooperation and competition in shaping our evolutionary journey.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Prehistoric \u2018Axe Factory\u2019 Found in Britain Triggers Search for More Artifacts\n\nMs. Feibel described the discovery as \u201ca bit of serendipity\u201d for researchers in 2021 organized by Louise Leakey, a third-generation paleontologist.\n\nFeibel noted it had long been hypothesized that these two human species coexisted. According to fossil records, Homo erectus, a direct ancestor of humans, persisted for 1 million years more. Paranthropus boisei, however, went extinct within the next few hundred thousand years (but scientists don\u2019t know why).\n\nBoth species possessed upright postures, bipedalism, and were highly agile. Little is yet known about how these coexisting species interacted, both culturally and reproductively.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Humble Stick Reveals Wealth of Information About Extinct Heidelberg Hominids as Hunters and Craftsmen\n\nThe footprints are significant, Feibel said, because they fall into the category of \u201ctrace fossils\u201d, which cannot be moved\u2014not part of an organism, but offering important evidence of behavior.\n\n\u201cThis proves beyond any question that not only one, but two different hominins were walking on the same surface, literally within hours of each other,\u201d Feibel said. \u201cThe idea that they lived contemporaneously may not be a surprise. But this is the first time demonstrating it. I think that\u2019s really huge.\u201d\n\nSHARE THE AMAZING SCIENCE With Paleo-Lovers on Social Media\u2026"

            "article_content": "Fabric\u2019s Real-Time Intelligence features are, for me, the most interesting things to learn about in the platform. I\u2019m not going to pretend to be an expert in them \u2013 far from it \u2013 but they are quite easy to use and they open up some interesting possibilities for low-code/no-code people like me. The other day I was wondering if it was possible to send events and data from Power Automate to Fabric using Eventstreams and it turns out it is quite easy to do.\n\nHere\u2019s a really simple illustration. I created a new Eventstream in a Fabric workspace, then clicked the \u201cUse custom endpoint\u201d option and published the Eventstream so it was ready to send data to:\n\nThen, in Power Automate, I built a super-simple flow with a \u201cManually trigger a flow\u201d trigger and then the \u201cSend event\u201d action from the Event Hubs connector:\n\nThis works because you can send data from Power Automate to the Eventstream custom endpoint using the Event Hub protocol. To set up the connection to the Eventstream in Power Automate I entered a name for the connection, chose the \u201cAccess Key\u201d authentication type and then copied the \u201cConnection string-primary key\u201d value from the Eventstream custom endpoint, shown in the first screenshot above (you need to click the eye icon next to it in order to copy it to the clipboard) and pasted it into the \u201cConnection String\u201d property in the Power Automate connector:\n\nThen I configured the \u201cSend event\u201d action like so:\n\nI had to manually paste the Event Hub Name, shown in the first screenshot above, as a custom value because I got an error when I tried to use Power Automate\u2019s dropdown box to find the name. I put the Timestamp from the \u201cManually trigger a flow\u201d trigger into the Content property.\n\nAfter saving the flow I was then able to trigger it from my browser or the Power Automate mobile app, and every time the flow ran it sent the time of the run to my Eventstream:\n\nVery basic but it proves the point. What could you use this for? Power Automate has a huge number of connectors for Microsoft and third party services: for example you can trigger a flow when a file stored in OneDrive for Business is modified or when new content is published to an RSS feed. Sending these events and their related data on to a Fabric Eventstream not only means you can capture them for analysis in OneLake or an EventHouse but also send the events on to Fabric Activator, which can apply sophisticated rules so you can be alerted when something happens and specific conditions are met in Teams or via email, run Fabric items such as notebooks or even trigger Power Automate flows. I\u2019ll explore some of these scenarios in more detail in future blog posts.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFacebook\n\n"

            "article_content": "The Golf represents \u201cthe heart\u201d of the Volkswagen brand, the automaker said at the start of 2024, as the iconic model celebrated five decades of existence.\n\nA 50th anniversary also seems like the right occasion to fully bring the Golf into the 21st century: While we already knew that VW is reviving an electric version of the model, the German automaker just revealed the next-gen Golf will also benefit from Rivian\u2019s cutting-edge software and electrical systems.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nVW, like global automakers, is transitioning toward producing \u201csoftware-defined vehicles\u201d (SDVs) with functionalities and digital experiences that can be upgraded over time. That transition became official back in June when VW announced a joint venture with Rivian.\n\nMeanwhile, the automaker also announced last summer it would delay the launch of a new flagship electric vehicle (EV) called Trinity, initially planned for 2026. German press reports at the time suggested the delay was to make room for none other than the next-gen electric Golf.\n\nAnd now that VW\u2019s venture with Rivian has officially kicked off earlier this month, all the pieces are coming together.\n\n\u201cWe decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle,\u201d VW CEO Thomas Schafer said during a media roundtable. \u201cIt will happen with the joint venture, where we put the new electric-electronics architecture together. But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So we\u2019ll start with the Golf.\u201d\n\nThe next-gen electric Golf is now expected for 2029, followed by Trinity in the following years.\n\nThe Volkswagen-Rivian venture first plans to use Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture and software technology stack to enable the launch of Rivian\u2019s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 and support the launch of Volkswagen models by 2027."
