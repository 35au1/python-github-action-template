            "source": "Daily Mail",
            "article_content": "A book classified by the CIA for more than 50 years contains a shocking theory about how the world will end.\n\n'The Adam and Eve Story,' written by former US Air Force employee, UFO researcher and self-acclaimed psychic Chan Thomas, was written in 1966 but its publication was halted by the agency.\n\nIt was quietly declassified in 2013, at least in part, but remained hidden in the CIA's database \u2014 until now.\n\nIn the book, Thomas claims that every 6,500 years, a major disaster on the scale of the Biblical 'Great Flood' strikes the Earth.\n\nWhile experts debate the exact date of that flood in the Book of Genesis, Thomas asserts that it happened roughly 6,500 years ago, and there is some archaeological and geological evidence to support that claim.\n\nBy that logic, Thomas argues that the next catastrophe is imminent.\n\nAs for what the end of the world will look like, Thomas believes that Earth's magnetic field will suddenly, drastically shift, wreaking havoc across the planet.\n\nThe reason behind the book was classified remains unclear, but some have suggested the agency was concerned the book would cause mass panic, or leak information related to secret government research.\n\nThomas had connections to classified projects during his time at the defunct aerospace company McDonnell Douglas. He was part of a small team of scientists assembled by the company to investigate reports of UFOs.\n\nWhile there are no official records of Thomas working directly for the CIA, the agency's secrecy agreement means past employees need to get approval before publishing books and other works of communication.\n\nA book that was classified by the CIA for more than 50 years contains a shocking theory about how the world will end (STOCK)\n\n'In California, the mountains shake like ferns in a breeze; the mighty Pacific rears back and piles up into a mountain of water more than two miles high, then starts its race eastward,' Thomas wrote in his book.\n\n'In a fraction of a day all vestiges of civilization are gone, and the great cities \u2014 Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, New York \u2014 are nothing but legends,' he writes. 'Barely a stone is left where millions walked just a few hours before.'\n\nThe first chapter, titled 'The Next Cataclysm,' starts with: 'Like Noah's 6,500 years ago... Like Adam and Eve's 11,500 years ago... This, too will come to pass...'\n\nThe cryptic opening suggests that the next cataclysm is poised to occur any day now.\n\nThe book features 55 pages, but Thomas wrote more than 200. The rest are still kept top-secret to this day. And the reason for the CIA's involvement remains a mystery.\n\nThe apocalyptical tale begins with the destruction of California, explaining how winds 'with the force of a thousand armies' will shred everything in sight with its 'supersonic bombardment,' as the Pacific tsunami drowns Los Angeles and San Francisco 'as if they were but grains of sand.'\n\nThomas claims these impacts will overtake the entire North American continent 'within three hours,' as an earthquake simultaneously creates massive cracks in the ground that allow magma to rise to the surface.\n\n'The Adam and Eve Story,' written by Chan Thomas, was published in 1966 and partly declassified in 2013\n\nThe book's author Chan Thomas was a former US Air Force employee, UFO researcher and self-acclaimed psychic\n\nBut it won't just be North America that is swallowed by the destruction.\n\nNone of the seven continents will be able to escape the onslaught, Thomas writes, with each one experiencing slightly different versions of the same dramatic end.\n\nBy the seventh day, 'the horrendous rampage is over,' and the entire Earth has changed, he writes.\n\n'The Bay of Bengal basin, just east of India, is now at the North Pole. The Pacific Ocean, just west of Peru, is at the South Pole,' Thomas explains.\n\nEven Greenland and Antarctica have been thrown toward the equator, and 'find their ice caps dissolving madly in the tropical heat.'\n\nThomas paints a terrifying picture of civilization-destroying climate change and tectonic rearrangement. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest that such a cataclysm is possible.\n\n'It's just unfortunate that these things are being put out there,' Martin Mlynczak, a senior research scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center, told The Verge.\n\n'Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. And there's no proof and no science and no physics behind any of the claims about the magnetic field change being associated with climate change.'\n\nWhat's more, there is no evidence to suggest that the Earth's magnetic field ever has, or ever will, make the 90-degree flip that Thomas describes.\n\nEarth's magnetic poles do shift, and have done so hundreds of times throughout the planet's history. But this never causes the kind of widespread devastation that Thomas described\n\nThomas states that the last catastrophe of this nature \u2014 Noah's Biblical flood \u2014 happened 6,500 years ago, and that this means we're due for the next one. But this date is contested\n\n'That is totally bogus. If that's what happened every 6,500 years, we would certainly see it; it would be in all the records... The amount of energy to bring that about is tremendous. And you know, there's nothing to initiate it,' Mlynczak said.\n\nThat said, Earth's magnetic poles do shift and have done so hundreds of times throughout the planet's history, according to NASA.\n\nThis phenomenon is called a 'pole reversal.' Paleomagnetic records suggest it occurs about every 300,000 years on average, though the actual time intervals vary widely.\n\n'During a pole reversal, the magnetic field weakens, but it doesn\u2019t completely disappear,' NASA states.\n\n'The magnetosphere, together with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, continue protecting Earth from cosmic rays and charged solar particles, though there may be a small amount of particulate radiation that makes it down to Earth\u2019s surface.\n\n'The magnetic field becomes jumbled, and multiple magnetic poles can emerge in unexpected places.'\n\nBut this never causes the kind of widespread devastation that Thomas described in his book.\n\nEven if his theory about why and how the world will end had scientific merit, there would still be reason to question his claim that the apocalypse is imminent.\n\nHe states that the last catastrophe of this nature \u2014 Noah's Biblical flood \u2014 happened 6,500 years ago, and that this means we're due for the next one.\n\nThere is some geological and archaeological evidence to suggest that date may be correct. For example, a 2006 study claimed that 6,500-year-old wood recovered from the 'landing site of Noah's ark' was actually part of the ark itself.\n\nBut the wood's age has been challenged by other experts.\n\nThe more widely accepted date-range for the flood is between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago. If this event truly occurred during that time, then Thomas' estimated timing for the end of the world would be more than 1,000 years off.\n\nTherefore, all the evidence suggests that the violent disaster detailed in 'The Adam and Eve Story' will not actually come to pass."

In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly to promote his new film, Better Man, Williams, 50, dished on his favorite gifts that he\u2019s received [\u2026]\n\nFor more fun facts from Williams \u2014 including why Better Man, a musical fantasy film based on his life and career in theaters now, is the movie he would watch for the rest of his life \u2014 keep scrolling:\n\n1. I\u2019ve given all of my awards away for two reasons: I don\u2019t want my success to be constantly reaffirmed every day as something that happened in the past, and I also retain great cynicism when it comes to awards and awards ceremonies. You don\u2019t get to meet the people that nominate you and figure out whether you want them to tell you if you are good or not. Let me also say I\u2019m very grateful to be invited to the party and I\u2019m a very sensitive person that if you don\u2019t tell me I exist, then I don\u2019t exist. So it\u2019s a very interesting conundrum in the industry that I find myself in.\n\n2. My dream collaborator is Dolly Parton.\n\n3. The song I\u2019m most proud of is \u201cAngels\u201d because it gave me my career. It is the song that exists outside of myself that means so much to lots of people. It\u2019s like the national anthem of Robbie. I\u2019ve written nearly a thousand songs now, and I\u2019ve not managed to recreate that.\n\n4. My favorite tattoo that I have is a teddy bear for my eldest daughter, Teddy.\n\n5. I don\u2019t drive \u2014 I never learned \u2014 and I don\u2019t have a license.\n\nRelated: Kyle Richards Comes Clean: \u2018I Don\u2019t Care What People Think of Me Anymore\u2019 Kyle Richards is showing off her 10 tattoos. It\u2019s the first day of October, and she\u2019s just sat down in the spacious living room of her 10,000 square-foot Colonial-style Los Angeles home \u2014 which is decked out for Halloween with pumpkins and autumnal decor \u2014 to talk to Us Weekly about being crowned Reality Star [\u2026]\n\n6. Ryan Reynolds is the most famous person in my phone book.\n\n7. My computer is my most valuable possession.\n\n8. I always get starstruck around comedians \u2014 like Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler and Chris Rock \u2014 and also Brad Pitt. Movie stars [have] a quality that is unusual, beguiling and magical, but at the same time means nothing. It\u2019s so strange. And it\u2019s not their fault.\n\n9. I\u2019m a good raconteur.\n\n10. If I could watch one movie for the rest of my life, it would be Better Man, genuinely. I\u2019m not just saying that for promo.\n\n11. Lynda Carter and Kylie Minogue were my celebrity crushes growing up.\n\n12. My alternate profession would be an artist, and I\u2019ve actually got a [few] exhibitions.\n\n13. The proudest moment of my career is that I\u2019m still here.\n\n14. All I do is listen to and watch podcasts. Right now, I\u2019m back on the UFO and paranormal trail, so that\u2019s where I get all of my entertainment needs, [including] finding out what the drones are in New Jersey.\n\n15. Dean Martin, Bing Crosby and Chuck D were the entertainers I looked up to when I was younger.\n\n16. I love the Housewives franchise. Right now, I\u2019m into The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Kathy Hilton doesn\u2019t get enough airtime.\n\n17. I collect ideas that form in my head, and then I try to draw them and make them funny.\n\n18. The most exciting moment from my time in Take That was being No. 39 on the charts with \u201cPromises.\u201d It was the happiest I\u2019ve been for the shortest amount of time.\n\n19. I sold double glazing \u2014 which are windows in the U.K. \u2014 door-to-door for two weeks before I joined Take That.\n\n20. The childhood memory that makes me smile is the round of applause that I got when I played the Artful Dodger when I was 12 years old. I got a standing ovation, and it made me believe that I had a future in showing off.\n\n21. My bucket list includes building hotels, building entertainment venues and creating a university of entertainment and writing the syllabus.\n\n22. My favorite comfort meal is sweet and sour chicken or pork Chinese [food].\n\n23. I can\u2019t leave the house without my phone, Mac [laptop] and sunglasses.\n\n24. I\u2019m an introvert and don\u2019t do parties unless I\u2019m paid to or I have to promote something.\n\n25. My favorite place to vacation is Mustique.\n\nWith reporting by Leanne Aciz Stanton"

            "article_content": "A staple in Minnesota\u2019s science innovation and education has hit a major milestone. The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis is celebrating 50 years of bringing electricity and scientific education to life.\n\nThe museum has become a hub for scientific research, exhibition and archiving, including a rare book and instrument collection, as well as exhibits about electricity, architecture and more.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just a profound love of learning and exploring and discovery at this organization,\u201d the museum\u2019s vice president of programs Anika Taylor said. \u201cI absolutely adore opportunities to work with visitors who are here exploring something and to see them make a connection or make a discovery, or have a moment of sort of lighting up.\u201d\n\nEarl Bakken, famous for co-founding Medtronic and creating the first external wearable battery-powered pacemaker, founded the museum in 1975 in hopes of becoming a research center focused on \u201cElectricity in Life.\u201d It now also includes exhibits about plants, medicine and even Mary Shelley and her book \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d a special inspiration of Bakken\u2019s.\n\nTurn Up Your Support MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all.\n\nAs a child, Bakken spent his time building and taking apart different electronic devices. When he saw the movie version of \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d he knew he wanted to pursue a career in electrical engineering, which he studied at the University of Minnesota.\n\nTaylor says the Mary Shelley exhibit is truly a favorite.\n\n\u201cI just love it, because there are so many fun stories and ideas that connect to this exhibit, the story of who Mary Shelley was and what led her to write that story, the notion that this is sort of our first example of science fiction, and that science fiction has, in turn, also inspired science and inspires the public to consider the science that we do in different ways because we can explore it in fictional realms.\u201d\n\nThe Bakken Museum. pictured on Sept. 18, 2020, is located on the West shore of Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis. Found by Earl Bakken in 1975, it is features interactive exhibits for all ages and STEM education programs. Courtesy of the Bakken Museum\n\nInterim Vice President of Advancement Stu Silberman says what makes the Bakken special is how it \u201cinvests in the future of the state of Minnesota while leveraging its wonderfully historic past.\u201d A past that started before the museum became a nonprofit and was established at its current location on Bde Maka Ska in 1975. Before that, Bakken had been collecting artifacts and literature at his company\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe Bakken is a popular field trip destination with hands-on opportunities like the shock circle that plays with static electricity that sticks students\u2019 hair on its ends or the Bakkenspiel, an interactive musical workshop. Heather Walch, a board member, loves seeing students light up.\n\n\u201cMy absolute favorite part is the kids that are visiting the Bakken when they learn something new, and they don\u2019t really realize they\u2019re learning anything because it\u2019s fun and it's just filled with giggles,\u201d Walch said.\n\nThrough its STEM education program, the Bakken Museum has begun taking educational programs on the road to sites and schools across the state where educators spend a week with students.\n\nTaylor hopes the museum continues to change its \u201chidden gem\u201d persona.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming to visit our museum or whether it\u2019s bringing us out to whatever corner of the state folks are in, we\u2019d love to get as many people involved in celebrating this 50th year,\u201d she said.\n\nThe museum will be hosting events throughout the year to mark its milestone birthday, including a party in October and family discovery day events throughout the year, as well as their \u201cBakkenalia\u201d 21+ events."

These stellar streams were hard to detect in the past, but with the help of Gaia, a space observatory mapping the Milky Way with incredible precision, astronomers are now discovering more of them.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan launches first EO-1 satellite but internet is laughing at it. Here's why\n\nAdvertisment\n\nResearchers led by Gieles used advanced simulations to study how the stars in Palomar 5 might have spread out to form this tidal stream. They found that the cluster's stars were likely pushed into the stream by the gravitational pull of black holes. These black holes, which are created when massive stars collapse, interact with the cluster\u2019s stars and send them careening away. The simulations also showed that the number of black holes in Palomar 5 is higher than expected, helping explain the current structure of the cluster.\n\nAlso Read | What's life post TikTok ban? Here's what US should learn from India\n\nThe discovery that black holes are common in globular clusters is exciting for astronomers. These regions are thought to be the birthplace of many black hole mergers, which occur when black holes collide. These mergers are important because they can help scientists learn about the elusive \"middleweight\" black holes\u2014those that are bigger than stellar-mass black holes but smaller than the supermassive ones at the centres of galaxies.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAstrophysicist Fabio Antonini, of Cardiff University, says, \"It is believed that a large fraction of binary black hole mergers form in star clusters.\""

            "article_content": "Sam Altman Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nOpenAI, as you likely know, is one of tech\u2019s biggest unicorns.\n\nA group of entrepreneurs and researchers, including Elon Musk and the company\u2019s current CEO Sam Altman, founded the artificial intelligence company in 2015. Today, OpenAI is valued at a whopping $157 billion \u2014 putting it on par with the market capitalizations of public companies like AT&T, Goldman Sachs and Uber, per The Wall Street Journal. Its flagship offering, ChatGPT, launched in 2022, and today reportedly has 250 million weekly users and 11 million paid subscribers.\n\nAmong OpenAI\u2019s investors are Microsoft, which invested $13 billion in the company, Nvidia, which invested $100 million and SoftBank, to the tune of $1.5 billion. In October, OpenAI received a $4 billion credit line \u2014 with the option to extend it another $2 billion \u2014 from JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, UBS and other institutional investors.\n\nBut OpenAI hasn\u2019t turned a profit. The company projected $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue for 2024. It announced at the end of the year it would change its corporate structure, essentially going from a nonprofit to a company with investors and the potential for stock shares. \"We once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined,\" OpenAI\u2019s board wrote in a statement.\n\nAltman has since said the company is losing money on its $200-per-month Pro subscriptions, which offer limitless access to its most recent model, OpenAI o1, and to its video generator, Sora AI. \"People use it much more than we expected,\" he wrote in a post on X. The company\u2019s biggest cost, according to The New York Times, is powering the supercomputers that run its AI.\n\nIn a 6,000-word Q&A with Altman, Bloomberg inquired how the company prices \"technology that\u2019s never existed before.\" \"Is it market research?\" the publication asked. \"A finger in the wind?\"\n\n\"We launched ChatGPT for free, and then people started using it a lot, and we had to have some way to pay for it,\" Altman said. He said the company tested two prices for its most popular product, ChatGPT Plus: $20 and $42. Users didn\u2019t like the $42 price point, Altman said, so the company picked $20.\n\n\"It was not a rigorous \u2018hire someone and do a pricing study\u2019 thing,\" Altman said.\n\nIf history tells us much, the vast dollars-and-cents discrepancy between what investors think OpenAI is worth and the company\u2019s profits, or lack thereof, doesn\u2019t spell doom. OpenAI is far from the first tech brand to score a sky-high valuation from financial institutions despite not generating any financial returns. In 2017, roughly 76% of the companies that went public were unprofitable the year before, CNBC reported.\n\nStory Continues"

When the attacker could not reach Jeh, he attacked Mr Khan multiple times, she said.\n\nHours after the incident, terrified Ms Kapoor went to her sister Karisma's house and Mr Khan underwent surgery.\n\n\"After the attack, I was terrified, so Karisma took me to her house,\" she said.\n\nAlso Read | Dark Skin, Slim Build: Nanny Describes Intruder Who Attacked Saif Ali Khan\n\nMr Khan sustained serious injuries after he was stabbed six times by an intruder at his residence in Mumbai's Bandra area on Thursday. The incident took place when the accused allegedly entered Mr Khan's house on the 11th floor of the Satguru Sharan building for a burglary. Left bleeding after the attack, Mr Khan was rushed to a nearby hospital where he underwent surgery as his spinal fluid leaked out after shards of the attacker's knife lodged into his spine.\n\nDoctors at the Lilavati Hospital - where Mr Khan is undergoing treatment - said that Mr Khan is recovering well post-surgery. He is likely to be discharged in a couple of days, sources said.\n\nWhat initial investigation revealed\n\nAccording to preliminary investigation, the attacker's breaking in at Mr Khan's house lasted for nearly 30 minutes. Police sources said that the intruder had scaled the wall of an adjacent compound to enter the premises. He was familiar with the layout of the building and took the stairs on the rear side of the building to reach the floor where the actor lives and entered the house through the fire escape, they added.\n\nA nurse caring for Jeh Eliyama Philips was the first one to encounter the intruder who stabbed Mr Khan. According to her, he demanded Rs 1 crore before Mr Khan intervened.\n\nTwo CCTV footage have emerged so far showing the man who stabbed Mr Khan.\n\nAlso Read | New Videos Emerge Of Saif Ali Khan's Attacker, He's Seen Buying Headphones\n\nIn one of the videos, the accused - who had his face covered and was carrying a bag - can be seen climbing the stairs before entering the actor's house. In another footage from the building's sixth floor, the intruder was seen taking the stairs while fleeing after the incident. He was not seen thereafter.\n\nOver 30 statements recorded, no arrests yet\n\nThe Mumbai police have recorded statements of over 30 people in connection with the attack, including a carpenter who worked at Mr Khan's place two days before the incident. One person was also detained on Friday, but released hours later as he had nothing to do with the attack, police said.\n\nNo arrest has been made so far in the case.\n\nThe cops have formed 20 teams, along with 10 teams from the Crime Branch, to investigate the case. CCTV footage from the Bandra area has also been seized."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nUS regulators and government officials in Turks and Caicos are looking into reports of property damage in the island nation caused by debris falling after a SpaceX Starship vehicle exploded over the ocean during a test mission Thursday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nFlights of the spacecraft and rocket system are now grounded pending an investigation into the mishap, the agency confirmed in a Friday statement. The FAA and Turks and Caicos officials both said Friday there were no reported injuries.\n\nAuthorities routinely halt flights of rockets to carry out what is referred to as a \u201cmishap investigation\u201d when launches and flights do not go according to plan.\n\nSpaceX will lead the investigation, as the company confirmed yesterday. The FAA will then issue a list of corrective actions the company needs to take in order to get Starship back on the launchpad for another test flight.\n\nThe SpaceX vehicle disintegrated partway through the seventh uncrewed test flight of the rocket system \u2014 about 10 minutes into a mission that launched out of South Texas.\n\nA shower of debris prompted the FAA to briefly create a \u201cDebris Response Area\u201d that forced planes to reroute, causing a string of travel delays.\n\nIn an advisory issued Friday, the Turks and Caicos National Security Secretariat also said the \u201cTurks and Caicos Islands Airport Authority diverted all flights in (Turks and Caicos Islands) airspace as well as grounded all flights until an all clear had been given.\u201d\n\nThe FAA implements a \u201cDebris Response Area\u201d only when debris from a rocket mishap falls outside of predefined hazard areas that are closed to aircraft, according to the agency. However, SpaceX asserted in a Thursday statement that \u201csurviving pieces of debris would have fallen into the designated hazard area.\u201d (Initially, the statement described debris as falling \u201cinto the Atlantic Ocean\u201d \u2014 but the language was amended by Friday afternoon to remove that phrase.)\n\nWhen asked to clarify what constituted a \u201chazard area\u201d and which locations were closed to air traffic during launch, the FAA said that its \u201cinvestigation is ongoing\u201d and \u201cinformation is preliminary and subject to change.\u201d The agency added that the amount of airspace closed for rocket launches can vary from launch to launch depending on a variety of factors, including the safety record of the launch vehicle.\n\nAfter Starship exploded Thursday, photos and videos flooded social media, showing debris that glowed bright orange and white as it streaked across the sky. Much of the footage was captured from Turks and Caicos or cruise ships and other islands in the surrounding area.\n\nClint Gerald posted this footage to Facebook after witnessing the Starship debris rain down while aboard the Carnival cruise ship Mardi Gras on Thursday. When reached for comment, Gerald told CNN the experience was \"eerie yet awesome.\" Clint Gerald\n\nJonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told CNN his analysis of Starship\u2019s trajectory showed that the vehicle likely exploded \u201cover Bahamas, (with) debris passing over Turks and Caicos a couple minutes later at ~120 km altitude (~75 miles).\u201d\n\nThe FAA said in its statement Friday that the agency is working alongside SpaceX and local authorities to investigate reports of debris striking Turks and Caicos.\n\nIn its advisory, the Turks and Caicos government said it convened a meeting of officials on Friday \u201cwith relevant partners in the United Kingdom including the UK Space Agency, who are supporting the post incident response, including technical expertise on the handling of debris, health and safety risks, protocols and procedures.\u201d The government also acknowledged the \u201cactive investigation\u201d from the FAA.\n\nSpaceX and Turks and Caicos authorities are urging members of the public who may find a piece of debris not to handle the object, but to contact local authorities or the company. The local government shared the following email address for reports: nationalsecurity@gov.tc.\n\nSonic booms and reported damage\n\nTurks and Caicos authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment about how many damage reports have been received.\n\nSome unverified social media reports have shown physical debris on the island. But Dr. Benjamin Fernando, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Earth and planetary sciences at Johns Hopkins who studies seismology, told CNN that it\u2019s also possible that loud sonic booms created by the falling pieces of Starship fragments could have caused minor damage.\n\n\u201cThis event was over one of the most populated areas in the Caribbean, with one of the largest things we\u2019ve ever seen re-enter the atmosphere,\u201d Fernando said. \u201cSo if (sonic boom property damage) is going to happen, it\u2019ll be an event like this that does cause it.\u201d\n\nFernando said he analyzed data collected by existing seismic stations in the Turks and Caicos Islands \u2014 and he found the instruments recorded an event consistent with a sonic boom at the time the Starship exploded.\n\nThe ground velocity of the event was \u201cabout 10 micrometers per second\u201d \u2014 which is an event equivalent to standing near a road and feeling a truck drive by.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not huge,\u201d Fernando said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll still feel and notice them. So this isn\u2019t the sort of thing that you need to be worried about, that it\u2019s going to collapse your house \u2014 but (it) can cause damage to things like windows, roofing tiles, etc.\u201d\n\nPilots react to debris\n\nMatt Morley, a 39-year-old charter pilot who works for Minnesota-based Club Jet, was flying a business jet from the Chicago Midway International Airport bound for Turks and Caicos when he caught sight of the spacecraft debris falling in the sky.\n\nMorley told CNN he initially thought it was a meteor shower, which he reported to an air traffic controller over the radio. But the air traffic controller clarified that it was a rocket, according to Morley.\n\n\u201cThen my next thought was, \u2018Oh man I hope there was no one on that,\u2019\u201d Morley said.\n\nMorley said he had to divert his plane to Exuma International Airport in the Bahamas after the airspace was shut down.\n\nHe added that the flight he was piloting had taken off 15 minutes late. \u201cHad our flight left on time (the debris) would have been much closer,\u201d Morley said.\n\nThere were two commercial aircraft in front of Morley\u2019s plane that had to declare fuel emergencies and divert safely to Exuma International Airport, he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we took extra fuel,\u201d Morley said. \u201cIt gave us lots of options and I had a really good second in command with me who made my job easier calculating our fuel reserves and finding a suitable alternate.\u201d\n\nMorley described this encounter as \u201cnot too stressful, just crazy to witness.\u201d\n\nYou can hear more from pilots captured on air traffic control audio here.\n\nA fiery mishap\n\nSpaceX has been aggressively pursuing a test and development campaign since 2023 in an effort to hash out the design of its Starship launch system, which consists of two parts: The Super Heavy rocket booster, which gives the initial burst of power at liftoff and the Starship spacecraft that rides atop it.\n\nSpaceX recovered the Super Heavy booster after launch on Thursday \u2014 guiding it to a precision landing back at the launchpad. After separating from Super Heavy a few minutes into flight, the Starship spacecraft fires up its own engines and continues its own journey \u2014 one that, this time, it did not survive.\n\nSpaceX is known to embrace fiery mishaps during test flights, as the company favors launching relatively cheap prototypes to learn quickly rather than relying on extensive ground testing and simulations.\n\nEventually, SpaceX aims to send Starship to orbit to drop off satellites or carry convoys of people to the moon or Mars. But on Thursday\u2019s test flight, the vehicle was slated to travel a suborbital trajectory and splash down in the Indian Ocean about an hour after launch \u2014 following a path similar to those it has taken on the last several demonstration missions.\n\nSpaceX's megarocket Starship launches for a test flight from Starbase, near Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday. Eric Gay/AP\n\nStarship has attempted controlled landings in the Indian Ocean on the last several flights. But on Thursday, SpaceX said it was testing substantial \u201cupgrades\u201d to the vehicle that included larger fuel tanks that stretched its size by 2 meters (6.6 feet), a new flight computer and changes to the vehicle\u2019s avionics.\n\nFor the first several minutes, the mission appeared to be going smoothly, as Starship fired up its six engines after separating from Super Heavy. About five minutes later, however, one of Starship\u2019s engines flamed out.\n\nBy the 8 minute, 30 second mark \u2014 five of the six engines were offline. SpaceX\u2019s Dan Huot and Kate Tice, who hosted a webcast of the test flight, confirmed about 10 minutes later that the Starship spacecraft was lost.\n\nStarship\u2019s future\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the mishap investigation will force significant delays for Starship testing.\n\nExplosive accidents during Starship test flights have occurred in the past, particularly early in the test campaign. But most of the \u201crapid unscheduled disassemblies\u201d \u2014 as SpaceX calls the explosive accidents \u2014 have occurred closer to launch or designated landing sites. Those mishaps have also prompted investigations that left Starship grounded for weeks.\n\nNotably, the explosion that occurred Thursday happened less than midway through Starship\u2019s flight path over an area that is speckled with populated islands.\n\nFAA-related delays with Starship have frequently drawn SpaceX CEO Elon Musk\u2019s ire.\n\nMusk appeared to signal on Thursday that he did not anticipate significant delays, despite the Starship loss. He said in one social media post that, based on a \u201cpreliminary\u201d look at the problem, \u201cNothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month.\u201d\n\nEarly analysis \u201cindicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d SpaceX said in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Musk\u2019s role in the incoming presidential administration may affect oversight of SpaceX.\n\nMusk was also tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to co-lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d and his stated goals are to downsize the federal budget and operations by slashing spending, curbing regulations and cutting the workforce.\n\nTrump\u2019s inauguration takes place Monday. Musk is expected to be in attendance."

            "article_content": "The Apache Software Foundation has recently announced the general availability of Apache Hudi 1.0, the transactional data lake platform with support for near real-time analytics. Initially introduced in 2017, Apache Hudi provides an open table format optimized for efficient writes in incremental data pipelines and fast query performance.\n\nOriginally developed at Uber as an incremental processing framework on Apache Hadoop and submitted to the Apache Software Foundation in 2019, Hudi is designed to bridge the gap between database-like functionality and open data lakehouse architectures. Hudi\u2019s main strength lies in its ability to support both near real-time and batch queries simultaneously.\n\nThe latest release introduces new features aimed at transforming data lakehouses into what the project community considers a fully-fledged \"Data Lakehouse Management System\" (DLMS). Vinoth Chandar, creator of the Hudi Project at Uber and CEO at Onehouse, writes:\n\nHudi shines by providing a high-performance open table format as well as a comprehensive open-source software stack that can ingest, store, optimize and effectively self-manage a data lakehouse. This distinction between open formats and open software is often lost in translation inside the large vendor ecosystem in which Hudi operates. Still, it has been and remains a key consideration for Hudi\u2019s users to avoid compute-lockin to any given data vendor.\n\nReleased under an Apache License 2.0, Hudi 1.0 introduces a new secondary indexing system designed to enhance query performance and reduce data scanning costs. Users can now create SQL-based indexes on secondary columns, significantly speeding up query execution. The release also includes expression-based indexing, similar to a feature in PostgreSQL, which replaces traditional partitioning strategies to enable more flexible and efficient data organization. When the preview was announced last year, Boris Litvak, principal software engineer at Snyk, wrote:\n\nAmong the big 3 ACID storage formats on Object Storage, Apache Hudi 1.0 (beta) is the first one introducing \"functional indexes\" over the data. We usually call it \"secondary indexes\" in SQL DB jargon. When will Delta.io and Apache Iceberg follow?\n\nSource: Apache Hudi Blog\n\nThe release introduces support for partial updates, which improves storage and compute efficiency by allowing updates to specific fields instead of entire rows. Additionally, non-blocking concurrency control enables multiple streaming jobs to write to the same dataset without causing bottlenecks or failures. Discussing the database architecture, Chandar adds:\n\nRegarding full-fledged DLMS functionality, the closest experience Hudi 1.0 offers is through Apache Spark. Users can deploy a Spark server (or Spark Connect) with Hudi 1.0 installed, submit SQL/jobs, orchestrate table services via SQL commands, and enjoy new secondary index functionality to speed up queries like a DBMS.\n\nHudi 1.0 introduces enhancements to the storage engine, including the adoption of a log-structured merge (LSM) tree for efficient timeline management. This supports long-term data retention and ensures high-performance query planning, even for datasets containing billions of records. Bhavani Sudha Saktheeswaran, software engineer at Onehouse and Apache Hudi PMC, comments:\n\nWhether you're building an open data platform, streaming into the data lakehouse, moving away from data warehouses, or optimizing for high-performance queries, Hudi 1.0.0 makes it easier than ever to work with lakehouses.\n\nSaktheeswaran and Saketh Chintapalli, software engineer at Uber, presented a session on incremental data processing with Apache Hudi at QCon San Francisco. The session recording is available on InfoQ."

            "article_content": "Obesity can lead to several lifestyle diseases. Reducing weight to the optimum level can help prevent several diseases. Once someone becomes obese, it is tough to lose weight. If someone knows about the risk of becoming obese, they can take corrective measures.\n\nWoxsen University Researchers, along with US scientists, developed an AI-based prediction model to detect what they call \u2018Obesity Risk\u2019.\n\nThe team, which includes Shahid Mohammad Ganie, Hemachandran Kannan, and Bobba Bharath Reddy, along with Manjeet Rege, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, USA, have explored how combining multiple machine learning methods can predict the risk of obesity based on lifestyle data.\n\nThey introduced an AI-based prediction model that leverages boosting techniques to assess the risk of obesity more effectively.\n\nTheir research paper, \u2018An Investigation of Ensemble Learning Techniques for Obesity Risk Prediction Using Lifestyle Data,\u2019 was published in the Decision Analytics Journal by Elsevier.\n\n\u201cIdentifying the underlying causes of obesity risk in its early stages has become a challenge for medical practitioners,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to use technology to create meaningful solutions to real-world problems. By focusing on lifestyle factors and ensemble learning methods, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights while empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their well-being,\u201d Hemachandran Kannan said.\n\nThe researchers observed that while BMI (body mass index) is commonly used as the primary indicator of obesity risk, it has limitations in capturing the full complexity of obesity, which is influenced by behavioural, environmental, and genetic factors.\n\n\u201cThey noted that BMI does not account for critical health indicators such as muscle mass, fat distribution, or other variables, potentially reducing the precision of obesity classification,\u201d they argued.\n\n\u201cOur study highlighted that while some machine learning models for obesity classification incorporate lifestyle factors, sex, and 3D body scans without relying solely on BMI, the datasets used in these models often stem from smaller sample sizes in specific regions or countries,\u201d they said.\n\nThis limited scope restricts the models\u2019 ability to generalise findings to broader or global populations.\n\nThe study also noted that the perfect climate for obesity to flourish has been created by traditional diets heavy in processed foods and low physical activity as technology develops and urbanisation picks up speed. The resultant effects include an increase in disorders linked to obesity, such as diabetes, heart problems, and other ailments.\n\nThe researchers utilised a publicly available dataset drawn from diverse populations in countries like Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. The dataset incorporated factors such as eating habits, age, sex, physical condition, water and alcohol consumption, and the frequency of vegetable intake.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

Moscow called the attack retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, which in recent weeks appear to have intensified.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said that four ballistic missiles and 39 attack drones had been launched in the assault and that two of the ballistic missiles had been shot down in the Kyiv region. Although the city comes under drone attack almost nightly, ballistic missile launches targeting the capital are less frequent.\n\nThe pre-dawn attack ruptured a water main near the city center, sending water cascading through the streets around the battered facade of the Lukianivska subway station. Nearby, smoke was rising from a charred van with at least two burned bodies inside."

            "article_content": "Britain\u2019s medics are rewriting their plans for a full-scale war as they learn lessons from the conflict in Ukraine, a leading NHS trauma surgeon has said.\n\nEvolutions in drone warfare and a return of First World War-style superbugs have presented new challenges as Western countries take steps to put their health systems on a war-footing, according to Dr Shehan Hettiaratchy.\n\nDr Hettiaratchy, the lead trauma surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, suggested the NHS would have to be all but shut down to only deal with war casualties if Britain was to be dragged into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHe warned the health service would also be worse off compared to its European counterparts because it lacks the same headroom to expand, unlike France and Germany.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast year, General Sir Roland Walker, the head of the Army, warned Britain must be ready to fight a war against Russia in three years.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to prepare\u2026 I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s not possible to prepare, because the Ukrainians weren\u2019t prepared and the Ukrainian military clearly had spent a lot of time thinking hard about if there was to be an invasion from Belarus, from Russia,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said on the fringes of a DGA Group event with the UK and Ukrainian governments in support of Kyiv\u2019s healthcare system.\n\n\u201cIf we get to a scenario where we are having that level of casualties and that kind of war-fighting, the health system would be only doing that. That\u2019s where we\u2019re scaled at now,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you look at us compared to other European countries \u2013 Covid showed it \u2013 we have less capacity, less redundancy in our health system compared to other European partners.\u201d\n\nInjured soldiers are treated in a hospital bus in Donetsk. Experts say Ukraine was not ready to handle the number of casualties despite having time to prepare - Anadolu/Getty\n\nThe event held at the British ambassador\u2019s residence called for governments to do more work with private businesses to support Ukraine\u2019s war-stricken healthcare system.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr Hettiaratchy has been working to train Ukrainian surgeons since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nHe said the challenges faced by his Ukrainian counterparts were entirely different to those faced by Western medics in Afghanistan, where he served as a combat surgeon with the British military.\n\nThe sheer number of Russian drones and Ukraine\u2019s lack of air superiority means Kyiv\u2019s combat medics don\u2019t enjoy the same luxuries experienced by Nato armies in the Middle East.\n\nWestern troops knew that in order to save as many of the injured as possible they had to get the casualties back to the field hospital at Camp Bastion within the \u201cGolden Hour\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is great if you\u2019ve got a helicopter which can fly you back to a hospital, back to a surgeon, back to someone like me,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe problem you have in Ukraine is you don\u2019t have that scenario because of the lack of air superiority, because of drone warfare.\u201d\n\nThe number of drones and a lack of armoured personnel carriers mean Ukrainian medics are often unable to evacuate wounded troops from the frontlines for hours.\n\nThis has led to a rise in the number of amputations carried out on casualties who were strapped up with tourniquets, which are used to stop life-threatening bleeding.\n\n\u201cThese people have tourniquets on for five, 12, 24 hours, because they can\u2019t be moved back to the next line of medical support, which means they are having a high level of amputation,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nHealth risks change in line with new weapons\n\nThe use of tourniquets has triggered a long-term challenge for Ukrainians who survive an initial attack. This is because when the blood circulation is cut off by the medical device, the wounded muscle starts to die and releases poison into the rest of the body.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a much higher rate than we would have seen before of kidney injuries, and this is how warfare changes,\u201d the surgeon added.\n\nKeir Starmer visits a hospital in Ukraine in January to shore up support for Kyiv three years after the war started - CARL COURT/AFP\n\nDr Hettiaratchy has been training Ukrainian surgeons in London as well as travelling to Western Ukraine to help improve their skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see how they have responded and developed and grown their capabilities and their capacity to meet the challenge,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe number of casualties they\u2019ve got coming through, the types of casualties, the challenges they are facing are things we\u2019ve not seen \u2013 because we haven\u2019t had this kind of peer-on-peer fighting between two equally matched military powers going at it \u2013 since the Second World War.\u201d\n\nDespite offering his contemporaries high praise, Dr Hettiaratchy said Ukraine\u2019s healthcare system has \u201ccritical gaps\u201d which need addressing, including a lack of types of surgeons, nurses, therapists and infection control.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs\n\nHe said Western planners would have to consult First World War history books to adapt to the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got bugs that are not cured by antibiotics. What they are describing is going back almost to the First World War, pre-antibiotic-era of surgery,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThese people now have wounds that are uncontrolled, infections are uncontrolled and uncontrollable with antibiotics, and you have to revert to First World War techniques.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before Britain unveiled \u00a3100 million in funding for Ukraine\u2019s health system, Dr Hettiaratchy urged Western governments to improve their offerings of non-lethal aid for Ukraine.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, revealed in December that almost 400,000 Ukrainian troops had been wounded since the start of the war.\n\nThe surgeon warned these would become a generational burden on the Ukrainian state if more isn\u2019t done to pick up the mantle of almost three years of brutal conflict.\n\n\u201cThere is an absolute economic society component to make sure society functions afterwards, because the volume is so high,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that Ukrainian society picks up the mantle of dealing with the consequences of their years of war, fighting, which are going to be human costs as well as other infrastructure costs\u2026 the human cost is the one that kind of almost endures and probably has the most consequence, because it\u2019s a lifetime burden.\u201d\n\nThis support must come from foreign governments and private companies, Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nOne of the ways businesses could help is by innovating production techniques of creating prosthetics with 3D printers to manufacture them much faster to meet demand, he added.\n\nAt least 50,000 Ukrainians have lost limbs in nearly three years of war according to the country\u2019s health ministry.\n\nDr Hettiaratchy concluded: \u201cClearly, no one has the experience that Ukraine has in terms of volume and how wide it\u2019s affected, but there are things we can do to help them understand how to tackle the problem. In many ways, they can\u2019t afford to mess this up, because the scale is so large if they get it wrong.\u201d\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

            "article_content": "What silently pulls the levers and gives liquidity to markets? Automation and complex algorithms trade securities at a blistering speed, shaping financial exchanges \u2013 and investors can use this algorithmic trading to their advantage.\n\nHere, Telegraph Money explains what algorithmic trading is and how it works in live markets.\n\nSimply, algorithmic trading is the use of computer functions to automatically make trades in financial markets.\n\nThe algorithms are pre-programmed to execute buy and sell orders based on certain variables, or a set of variables, taking place without human intervention.\n\nIn forex markets, roughly 90pc of trades are done using algorithms. In equities, roughly 60-75pc of trades in American, European and Asian capital markets are done through pre-programmed functions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAn individual or, as is predominantly the case, an institutional investor will use automated algorithmic strategies to execute trades.\n\nInstitutional investors dominate the space through sheer position size, placing large trades to reduce transaction costs.\n\nGiven that size, one large trade from a hedge fund or investment bank has the ability to disrupt the market. Algorithmic trading can break up that trade into smaller increments to be deployed at coordinated times.\n\nFor instance, an order of 1 million shares would send a strong signal to the market, whereas an algorithm trading instruction of 1,000 shares every 15 seconds is more palatable and, in some cases, less noticeable.\n\nInitially, algorithmic trading can appear daunting. Indeed historically, trading platforms required a knowledge of coding to build the algorithms.\n\nNow, platforms cater for those with minimal coding experience and a degree in computer programming isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nTo use it, the first step is to gain an understanding of common algorithmic strategies, such as trend-following, mean reversion, high-frequency trading and arbitrage (more on these later).\n\nThen develop a strategy based on data and knowledge of the market. Consider: how will the algorithm react to certain trading signals? What has to happen for it to place orders according to those signals?\n\nBacktesting the algorithm \u2013 that is testing it using historical data \u2013 may not be necessary for a pre-existing algorithm. That said, thorough testing of how the algorithm works and its suitability for live markets is key.\n\nLike all trading strategies, implementing good risk management, like stop-losses, position sizing and diversification, is essential."

            "article_content": "The inauguration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last Friday ushers in a new chapter for Venezuela, marked by deep socioeconomic wounds. The ongoing financial crisis \u2014 arguably the population\u2019s greatest source of discontent \u2014 persists despite a modest reactivation of consumption. Crisis and political conflict remain intertwined, and after a decade of catastrophic governance and escalating tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, the Maduro government now faces an especially turbulent period.\n\nThe evidence of electoral fraud, which Maduro has been unable to convincingly refute, have heightened international pressure. Both the United States and the European Union have stepped up sanctions, and Maduro is bracing for a new wave of isolation. As in the past, this isolation is likely to exacerbate the nation\u2019s economic struggles.\n\nThe start of Maduro\u2019s new mandate follows three years of moderate economic recovery, a relative improvement considering the depths from which Venezuela has emerged. This recovery was preceded by a historic economic contraction that drastically altered the nation\u2019s landscape over the past decade. Amid this unprecedented economic crisis \u2014 exacerbated by the political isolation of Chavismo \u2014 in 2020, the Maduro government began to distance itself from the statist orthodoxy outlined in the Plan de la Patria, its flagship economic program. Instead, it adopted a series of market-oriented reforms in an effort to stabilize the economy.\n\nThe partial dollarization of the monetary system, the introduction of new exchange and fiscal policies, a more business-friendly stance, and a shift in the treatment of international capital have led to a reduction in year-on-year inflation, a recovery in purchasing power, and some improvement in trade. However, the damage to Venezuela\u2019s productive and social fabric had already been done. The socioeconomic collapse experienced between 2014 and 2020, during Maduro\u2019s presidency, delivered a devastating blow to the nation\u2019s economic framework. This trauma has left many Venezuelans struggling to fully recover from its far-reaching effects.\n\nDuring the years of strict economic controls, company takeovers, conflicts with capital, and excessive bureaucratization, Venezuela\u2019s economy contracted by more than 80%. The local industrial sector was decimated, and now operates at just 30% of its capacity. Thousands of businesses went bankrupt. A wave of nationalizations severely undermined the country\u2019s ability to respond to economic challenges. Hyperinflation, which peaked at an astronomical 9,500% in 2019, wreaked havoc on the economy, devastating the financial stability of millions. Meanwhile, the oil industry, once the backbone of Venezuela\u2019s economy, collapsed under the weight of a fixed exchange rate policy and pervasive corruption in the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Income poverty doubled, and now affects an estimated 80% of the population, according to the Venezuelan Academy of Economic Sciences (ANCE).\n\nAccording to the ANCE, the current level of income poverty in Venezuela is 2.6 times higher than the Latin American average. Income distribution is also among the most unequal in the region, with the wealthiest 10% controlling 37% of the nation\u2019s income.\n\nThe crisis of the past decade left profound scars: wages were decimated, prices soared, shortages of essential goods became widespread, and public services deteriorated dramatically. This collapse triggered a mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans, many of whom fled the country on foot, seeking refuge across South America.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of Venezuela, under Maduro\u2019s control, stopped publishing monthly economic data. Media censorship also worsened. The ruling party\u2019s popularity, which began to decline in 2014, has not recovered since. In 2019 and 2020, the national economy displayed metrics comparable to those of a war-torn nation, with GDP contracting by a staggering 30 percentage points, according to estimates from private consulting firms.\n\nThe popular social assistance programs created by the Chavista government \u2014 such as the Barrio Adentro preventive health initiative, the Mi Casa Bien Equipada goods transfer program, Mercal\u2019s cheap food markets, and the Cuban-assisted Comprehensive Diagnostic Centers \u2014 collapsed during the crisis, largely due to widespread corruption among government officials.\n\nThe minimum monthly wage, traditionally around $400, has dropped to just $3. The government provides periodic bonuses every four weeks, but without retroactive benefits, these only raise the effective minimum wage to $150 per month.\n\nInternational sanctions, particularly from the United States, were introduced in 2016 in response to the political crisis driven by popular discontent. These sanctions significantly restricted Maduro\u2019s ability to explore alternative trade options or revitalize the oil industry. The global search for new markets, spurred by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, fostered a period of cautious d\u00e9tente between Caracas and Washington, leading to a modest revival in the oil sector. However, with the return of Donald Trump to the White House, it is likely that sanctions on Venezuelan oil will tighten further.\n\nNational revenues, heavily reliant on crude oil extraction, hit a critical low point in the last decade, with production dropping from nearly 3 million barrels per day to just 300,000 in 2019. Today, after significant challenges, production is slowly approaching the 1 million mark again.\n\nSince 2016, for the first time in its history, remittances from emigrants have become a significant source of Venezuelan tax revenues. The exodus of between seven and eight million people, according to United Nations estimates, represents an unprecedented event in recent Latin American history, highlighting the severity of Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and the erosion of its citizens\u2019 political rights. Despite implementing measures like food rationing based on the last digit of each citizen\u2019s identity card, the Maduro government has refused to acknowledge its responsibility for the crisis or the existence of a Venezuelan diaspora.\n\nThe disastrous performance of the Chavista administration triggered a political shift. In December 2015, the Venezuelan opposition achieved a decisive victory in the parliamentary elections, sending shockwaves through Chavismo. In response, Chavismo moved quickly to consolidate control over all state institutions. This led to the absolute concentration of power in the hands of Maduro and a select group of loyalists, while the government implemented social programs aimed at maintaining Chavista support and building networks of loyalty.\n\nMaduro introduced the Carn\u00e9 de la Patria, a document offering access to a range of digital subsidies, though the contributions are now minimal, along with the CLAP food bags, which are part of the Local Supply and Production Committees. While the population continues to accept these initiatives, surveys consistently show a sharp decline in popularity. However, any assistance remains inadequate given the collapse of the country\u2019s productive activity. In the meantime, Venezuelans are facing a period marked by political uncertainty and looming economic instability.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

            "article_content": "PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nLast week's CES included the introduction of a variety of new processors for running desktops and notebooks, including new CPUs and graphics solutions. But in looking over the announcements from AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, what stands out to me is just how potentially confusing 2025 could be for buyers of such systems.\n\nIt looks like we're all going to have to make some tradeoffs between raw performance (particularly for graphics), power consumption, and AI capabilities. While just about every new system now will come with a Copilot key, not all will really be suited for running local AI features, such as those in Microsoft's Copilot+ PC program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seems like we're in a transitional phase, and I won't be surprised if the 2026 offerings all offer at least the minimum 40 TOPS neural processing unit (NPU) that Microsoft is requiring for Copilot+ status. But for now, that's still lacking in the most powerful chips.\n\nAs usual, every vendor shared benchmarks that showed how much faster their new entrants are compared to previous offerings and particularly competitors. And as always, I suggest taking these with a grain of salt; of course vendors show the benchmarks where they look good.\n\nAt first glance, it appears that Intel may have some advantage in single-threaded performance while AMD has some in multi-threaded performance. But again, we won't really know until real machines get tested. And Qualcomm talks about how much better its performance is when running on battery power as opposed to being plugged in (which is how most people run performance benchmarks).\n\nIntel Pushes Lunar Lake vPro for Commercial, Arrow Lake for Performance\n\nNo company better shows how incomplete the transition is than Intel. Its well-received Lunar Lake chips, which came to market late last year targeting premium thin and light laptops, are more power-efficient than previous generations with better graphics. Most notably, they include an NPU that can run at up to 48 trillion operations per second (TOPS), enabling what Intel has called \"AI PCs,\" and more importantly what Microsoft has called \"Copilot+ PCs.\" These have up to four performance cores and four efficient cores, and require 10 to 30 watts of power. These are now being sold as the Core Ultra 200V series.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt CES, the company unveiled the vPro versions of these chips, meaning that they have features used by large enterprises for things like management of a fleet of laptops.\n\n\"A great AI PC starts with a great PC,\" said Jim Johnson, SVP of Intel's Client Computing Group, noting that this includes performance, battery life, and especially compatibility. \"Everything must just run,\" he added, clearly taking a swipe at Snapdragon-based PCs.\n\nJohnson talked about how vPro's out-of-band management can help in dealing with things like the recent CrowdStrike outage by deploying fixes before Windows boots. I was pleasantly surprised to see the company has made the first major update to vPro in many years, adding features such as support for Microsoft's Pluton encryption and cloud-based fleet management, which looks much easier to implement than the older system that relies on on-premise servers.\n\nAll this sounds like a big win for enterprise management of laptops with AI features.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Intel also introduced new chips in the Arrow Lake family. These are heftier chips with the Arrow Lake H family aimed at thin and light laptops with 28 to 45 watts of power draw, with 16 CPU cores (six performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and two low-power efficiency ones) at a maximum speed of up to 5.4GHz, eight graphics cores, and an NPU that tops out at 13 TOPS, due early this quarter\n\nThe Arrow Lake HX family is for larger laptops requiring 55 watts of power or more but including up to 24 cores (eight performance cores plus 16 efficiency cores), with a top speed of up to 5.5GHz, but with only four graphics cores, reflecting that it is designed for systems with discrete graphics. This also has the 13 TOPS NPU and is due out toward the end of the quarter.\n\nThe Arrow Lake chips will be marketed as the Core Ultra 200H and 200HX families.\n\nIntel also has the Core Ultra 200S series, which are Arrow Lake processors designed for desktops; and the Core Ultra 200U series, which is a lower-power Arrow Lake variant aimed at less expensive and less performant notebooks.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus the letter designation becomes more important. The H and HX systems should offer somewhat better performance and better graphics, but only the V systems have the ability to run the \"Copilot+ PC\" applications.\n\nLooking forward, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, CEO of Intel Product and interim co-CEO of Intel, showed off the company's forthcoming \"Panther Lake\" chip based on its 18A process, which the company has said will be when it catches up to rival TSMC. Holthaus said the chip is running and Intel has already provided samples to its big customers; it's on track to launch in the second half of the year. It's an ambitious roadmap, but I can see where all the choices could be quite confusing.\n\nAMD Broadens Mobile Line With Gaming and Commercial Choices\n\nIn contrast, AMD\u2014while introducing a wide variety of chips for laptop machines\u2014seems to be largely focused on a single architecture centered around its \u201cZen 5\u201d cores.\n\nAMD's current high-end entrant in the mobile PC market is the AMD Ryzen AI 9 300 family, known as \"Strix Point,\" which also came out in the second half of last year, and I\u2019ve already tested in some machines. This has 12 cores\u2014four of the full-performance Zen 5 cores and eight lower-power, lower-performance cores\u2014all able to run two threads for a total of 24 threads. These have a base frequency of 2GHz with a 5.1GHz turbo, Radeon 890M graphics with 16 compute units; and the XDNA 2 NPU with 50 TOPS, made on TSMC's 4nm process.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt this year\u2019s show, Rahul Tikoo, SVP and GM of AMD's Client Business Unit, announced a variety of new chips to expand the family. These include the \"Krackan Point\" family of Ryzen AI 7 and 5 chips, led by the AI 5 340 and 350 processors, with eight cores/16 threads or six cores/12 threads, and a 50 TOPS NPU, designed for 15-to 54-watt systems. These should be out this quarter.\n\nAbove this will be the \"Strix Halo\" family, now called Ryzen AI Max. This is available with up to 16 Zen 5 cores with 32 threads, up to 40 RDNA 3.5 graphics compute units, and up to 50 TOPs NPU, but with a new memory bandwidth that takes it up to 256GB/s, requiring 45 to 120 watts of power. These are designed for mobile workstations and high-end gaming laptops and looks like it will power some of the highest performing laptops in the market.\n\nI was particularly interested in AMD doing a big push for its commercial line, with versions of the Ryzen AI 5, AI 7, and AI Max processors coming in the second quarter with Ryzen AI Pro and AI Max Pro designations. Tikoo told me AMD is putting more of a focus on this, saying its \"Pro\" features match vPro for security and manageability, and it too now supports Microsoft's Pluton encryption. These should be out in the second quarter.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Tikoo was joined on stage by Dell's Sam Bird, who announced that Ryzen AI Pro would now be part of Dell's commercial offerings for the first time. (AMD and Lenovo representatives also appeared via video; the three companies\u2014which together constitute the bulk of the enterprise PC market now all support AMD, Intel, and to a lesser extent, Qualcomm.) All this is designed to make Ryzen Pro a stronger competitor to Intel's vPro.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, AMD announced its Ryzen and Ryzen Pro 200 series, with four core/eight thread, six core/12 thread, and eight core/16 thread options, designed for lower price points and requiring less power, but with only a 16 TOPS NPU (thus making it ineligible for use in Copilot+ PCs, which require 40 TOPS). These will be available in the second quarter.\n\nFor the highest-end gamers, AMD announced its \"Fire Range\" HX3D mobile processors, although these are only promised for later in the first half of the year. The top end here is the Ryzen 9 9955HX with 16 of the company\u2019s \u201cZen 5\u201d CPU cores, 32 threads; they can run at up to 5.4GHz max boost, with up to 144MB of cache, and uses 54 watts of TDP. Effectively, this is a mobile version of a desktop chip, again without the more powerful NPU.\n\nFor desktops, AMD introduced its top-end Ryzen 9 9950X3D chip aimed at gamers and content creators. This has 16 of the company\u2019s \u201cZen 5\u201d CPU cores, 32 threads, can run at up to 5.7 GHz, and with up to 144 MB of cache, and uses 170 watts of TDP. This looks quite powerful and will likely be paired with a discrete graphics card. This will be available in the first quarter.\n\nSpeaking about discrete graphics, AMD sort of announced its forthcoming RDNA 4 architecture and upcoming new Radeon RX 9070 graphics. Some details were included in press briefings, and I saw several machines that will have this, but AMD chose not to formally announce it at its press conference, saying it didn't have enough time to discuss the details. I expect we'll hear more about that in the next couple of months.\n\nQualcomm Expands Snapdragon Line for Laptops\n\nQualcomm, whose chips powered the initial Copilot+ PCs, broadened its line by introducing the Snapdragon X processor, joining the initial Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus in its lineup for Windows laptops.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe X Elite has 12 of the company's Oryon CPU cores running at 3.4 to 3.8GHz with a boost up to 4.3GHz; and the X Plus has eight or 10 cores, running at 3.2 to 3.4GHz with a boost up to 4.0GHz. In comparison, the plain X has eight cores running at 3.0GHz with no boost. It also has a less powerful Adreno GPU, but the same 45 TOPS Hexagon NPU, making it eligible for Copilot+ PC applications.\n\nThat's important because it means this should power the least expensive Copilot+ laptops, down to about a $600 price point. And Qualcomm continues to talk about how it offers the best performance per watt, discussing how many applications run faster on its machines than on Intel-based machines when running on battery power.\n\nMy experience is that earlier Snapdragon-based Copilot+ PCs showed competitive performance with Intel and AMD machines on applications that have native ARM-architecture versions, such as the Microsoft Office suite, but there are still a number of enterprise applications and games that don't work properly. So, it's an option for some businesses, but not all, at least not yet.\n\nNvidia's Blackwell Pushes Desktop Mobile GPU Performance\n\nAnd then there was Nvidia, which riding high on its successes with AI chips in the datacenter and in discrete graphics, introduced its GeForce RTX 50 series for both desktops and notebooks, both based on the company's \"Blackwell\" design. The introduction came as part of a larger keynote by CEO Jensen Huang, in which he also gave a vision for how GPU-enabled AI was transforming all sorts of industries.\n\nOn the desktop side, the high end is the RTX 5090 with 21,760 CUDA cores, 32GB of GDDR7 memory and a 512-bit wide memory interface, with the board itself requiring 575 watts of power and designed for systems with a 1,000-watt power supply. Nvidia's announcement said the board was capable of 3,352 TOPS and in his keynote, Huang said it could do up to 4,000 AI TOPs, three times that of the previous generation. These boards will have a list price of $1,999 and my guess is they will primarily be used by developers of AI applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMore mainstream are the RTX 5080 with 10,752 cores at 2.3GHz and a 256-bit memory interface at $999, the RTX 5070Ti at $749 and RTX 5070 at $549. Huang said they'll be as fast as the company's previous high-end RTX 4090, which has a list price of $1,599, so delivering a lot more performance for the price than the previous generation. The first of these will be available at the end of the month, with the others slated to launch in February.\n\nThe RTX 50 series will also be available in laptops, including the top-end RTX 5070, which will be in systems starting at $1,299. Again, in the keynote, Huang said it would offer the performance of a 4090 but with half the power. Indeed, many vendors showed gaming laptops with the RTX 50 series in it, including all the high-end gaming laptops I saw announced at the show. (AMD, which historically has been a competitor for mobile discrete graphics seems to be focusing on data center and entry-to-mid-range GPUs right now.)\n\nIn the keynote, Huang talked about how agentic AI is coming to the PC and other devices and talked about making Windows a \"world-class AI PC.\" He also announced a variety of new AI foundation models called Nemotron.\n\nBut Huang's biggest focus was on bringing AI to the physical world through the combination of a new \"world foundation model\" called Cosmos and its Omniverse software for mapping the physical world for things like digital twins. He said this would impact everything from agents and warehouse automation to self-driving cars to humanoid robotics. It was a very expansive vision, with Huang saying the \"ChatGPT moment of general robotics is just around the corner.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he announced a small desktop \"AI supercomputer\" called Digits designed to work like a cloud instance of the company's DGX AI training systems for AI developers."

            "article_content": "MAJMA\u2019 Lagos Graduates New Set Of Students\n\nThe Secretary General, Association of Arab Universities, and Egypt former Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Professor Amr Ezzat Salama, has said that societal progress should not solely be measured by advancements in natural sciences, because unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity.\n\nSpeaking at the graduation ceremony of the 2023 and 2024 classes from the MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Lagos in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah studies, Salama stated that human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\n\nHe, therefore, underscored the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness.\n\nSalama urged the graduates to remain steadfast in adhering to the values derived from the Holy Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah, adopting a balanced approach in faith, conduct, and service to their communities while spreading noble values.\n\n\u201cThe Arabic language, chosen by Allah as the medium for His final revelation, is the language of the Holy Qur\u2019an, the Sunnah, prayer, pilgrimage, supplication, and the rich Islamic civilization that has flourished across centuries. For every Muslim, understanding Islam in its true essence cannot rely solely on translated works but must come directly from the original texts written in Arabic.\n\n\u201cDuring the medieval era, the Islamic kingdoms that thrived in East and West Africa played a significant role in rooting the Arabic language among local populations and transferring Islamic civilization and thought.\u201d\n\nCongratulating the graduates, Salama stated that the academic degrees are the fruit of hard work and dedication which will serve as keys to their next endeavours.\n\n\u201cI also encourage you to equip yourselves with Islamic knowledge while keeping pace with advancements in science and technology, particularly in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This revolution has introduced a new reality, demanding advanced skills in fields like artificial intelligence, automation, and big data.\n\n\u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution and AI technologies have significantly transformed the nature of jobs, creating an urgent need to balance applied sciences and humanities. This ensures that technological progress becomes a tool for building societies, not a threat to them.\n\n\u201cI must stress the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness. Societal progress is not solely contingent on advancements in natural sciences.\n\n\u201cThe unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity. Human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\u201d\n\nSalama argued that the youths are the primary drivers of development and its ultimate beneficiaries. \u201cTherefore, we must continue investing in young people through education, training, and skill development to ensure they remain innovative and distinguished in this era of rapid transformation.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Association of Arab Universities is to solidify the true image of Islam and its noble message to humanity. The association supports academic and scientific endeavours aimed at spreading the teachings of Islam based on its primary sources, the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah.\n\n\u201cNotably, the Association\u2019s Sharia Colleges Network plays a leading role in publishing research and studies in Islamic sciences across Arab universities.\n\n\u201cIn our discussions with leaders in Nigeria, the Association seeks to strengthen collaboration with Nigerian academic institutions, particularly in Arabic language education, Islamic studies, and historical research. The Association has also organised training programmess for students of the Research and Training Complex at Arab universities, reaffirming its commitment to supporting higher education and serving the issues of the Islamic nation.\u201d\n\nIn his presentation on the goals and aspirations of the institute, President, MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Professor Saheed Ahmed Rufai, highlighted the centre\u2019s area of focus to principally be around training in Islamic Revealed Studies (English, Arabic), Arabic Studies (Arabic, English), Educational Studies (English, Arabic), General Studies (English) and other possible areas of societal need.\n\nHe also said that the centre would be engaging in research and publications, counseling as well as speaking with the target audience being residents of Nigeria who want to learn Arabic and/or further their Islamic education though it would not be blind to interested persons from outside Nigeria if they are willing and able to sponsor the above persons.\n\nRufai said that the channel of engagement for its training, publications and public speaking will be through website, social media and conventional media along with in-person classes, online instruction, distance learning and directed self-study.\n\nAs the centre looks into the future including expanding its reach, Rufai said that it needs support to have its own building, computers, office furniture, office equipment, bus, library and broadband internet.\n\nOne of the special guests at the event, Pro-chancellor/ Chairman, Governing Council of Summit University, Offa, Kwara State, Alhaji Rafiu Adisa Ebiti, also tasked Muslims to learn and deeply understand Arabic language as a pathway to understanding the teachings of Qur\u2019an and the voice of Allah.\n\nAt the event, diploma, advanced diploma and post graduate diploma certificates in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah were presented to graduates trained through MAJMA Training and Research Centre, Lagos.\n\n"

This university played an important role in the movement,\" the press secretary said.\n\nNoting that this image should be conveyed to the world as the future of the students is related to the image, he said, \"We have to work to preserve the history of the movement of this university.\"\n\nHe said the names of the halls that still remain in the name of the dictator need to be changed to the martyrs' names.\n\nThe press secretary said the aspirations of people are being fulfilled through reform commissions to build a new Bangladesh.\n\nThe reports of commissions are the outcomes of the July Uprising, he said, urging all students to read these reports and join debate on those on the campus.\n\nChaired by Chairman of IU Communication and Multimedia Journalism Department Professor Dr Rashiduzzaman, the seminar was addressed, among others, by IU Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Nakib Muhammad Nasrullah, Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Yeaqub Ali, treasurer Professor Dr Jahangir Alam and treasurer of Jashore University of Science and Technology Professor Dr Hossain Al Mamun.\n\nSM Rashidul Islam, special correspondent of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), also spoke at the seminar as a discussant.\n\nSource: BSS"
