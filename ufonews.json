That's not an issue.\n\n\"It's going to be which president is most likely to step forward and confirm the ET presence.\"\n\nAfter the bill is passed, the pressure from the public will be so great that a sitting president would have no choice but to allow disclosure, Bassett claimed.\n\nHe said: \"The sooner they get in front of the people the better.\n\n\"We're one play away from ending this truth embargo 77 years after the press release in Roswell announcing that the Army Air Force had a crashed flying saucer.\n\n\"Those who are frustrated and leave the field right now are not going to get to join us in the in the locker room, but that's how close we are.\"\n\nThe sooner they get in front of the people the better\n\nAnother way disclosure of alien life could come would be if a Senate hearing with experts testifying came during the lame duck period.\n\nInstead of waiting for a new president and Congress, the current one would step forward in November or December and reveal the information, Bassett said.\n\nHe added: \"That hearing which I've described in countless interviews that I've given, it'll be one of the most important hearings in history, watched by millions.\n\n\"That sets the stage for President Biden to come forward and be the disclosure President by confirming what this hearing is just demonstrated.\n\n\"In which case Joe Biden would be the disclosure president.\n\n\"It would be an extraordinary legacy for him, and he would go out the door at the peak of his service to the country.\"\n\n11 Former DoD UFO worker David Grusch testifies before a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing about UFOs Credit: EPA\n\n11 Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray plays a video of a UFO Credit: EPA\n\n11 Trump revealed aliens isn't 'his thing' in an interview with Joe Rogan Credit: Joe Rogan Experience\n\n11 Bassett said Joe Biden may also choose to release information during his lame duck period Credit: The Mega Agency\n\nTrump has spoken about aliens during the election campaign telling popular American podcaster Lex Fridman that he would \"surely\" make secret footage of alleged UFO sightings public.\n\nDuring the chat, Fridman asked Trump: \"Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?\"\n\nTo which Trump readily agreed and said: \"Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that.\"\n\nTrump also spoke about \"people coming from space\" with Joe Rogan in their three-hour interview.\n\nWhen Rogan asked Trump if he thought aliens were \"flying around\" he said there was \"no reason not to\".\n\nTrump said: \"There's no reason to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.\"\n\nWhen Rogan suggested that some of the more recent sightings could have been advanced drones, Trump repeatedly says: \"could be\".\n\nTrump said: \"I interviewed a few people, it's never been my thing to be honest, I have never been a believer.\n\n\"It's not a great interest for me, but it's still of a little interest.\n\n\"I interviewed jet pilots that were solid people, perfect, great pilot great everything, they said: 'We saw things, sir, that were very strange'.\"\n\nTrump has previously commented on UFOs while in office when the Pentagon released three infrared videos of flying objects in 2020.\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder if it\u2019s real... that\u2019s a hell of a video.\"\n\nIn 2019, he told George Stephanopoulos that \"we\u2019re watching\" for aliens, \"and you\u2019ll be the first to know.\"\n\nThe Trump and Harris campaigns have been contacted for comment.\n\n11 Mexican journalist and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan claims this specimen is not related to any known Earthly species Credit: Getty\n\n11 Steve Bassett is the only registered UFO lobbyist in Washington DC Credit: STEVE BASSETT"

        "article_content": "King Charles is known as a man of discerning tastes and strong opinions. He has a long-held interest in alternative beliefs and mystical therapies, and we all know his thoughts on leaky pens.\n\nBut who would have thought His Majesty may also have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO?\n\nThat is the bizarre claim being made in a new TV documentary which examines the royals' interest in UFOs and other paranormal mysteries.\n\nKing Of UFOs, made by British musician and UFO buff Mark Christopher Lee and now available on Amazon Prime, asks the question: does the Royal Family know what's really out there?\n\nIn it, he speaks to a diver, Dan Costello, who says he witnessed Charles, then Prince of Wales, at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975.\n\nKing Charles may have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO\n\nThe then dashing 27-year-old prince was one of three pilots spotted steering the 'odd-looking' object, while serving as a qualified helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy, he claims.\n\nDescribing the aircraft, he says: 'It would sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on [rotating] with no sound of propulsion, just a faint crackle of electromagnetism.'\n\nWhile, sadly, Costello goes on to admit that the aircraft Charles was allegedly flying was most probably not of alien origin, but part of a secret military operation, involving the British and Canadian governments \u2013 plus it hasn't been confirmed that Charles was anywhere near Canada at the time \u2013 it does bring into focus a royal fascination with all things 'other worldly', that goes back generations.\n\nIndeed, as I can exclusively reveal, the King may well have inherited a keen interest in the subject from his late father, Prince Philip, and his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, both of whom were avid enthusiasts.\n\nPhilip had a lifelong interest and curiosity in a range of fringe subjects, including UFOs, crop circles and the Loch Ness monster.\n\nMountbatten's fascination, meanwhile, reached its zenith between 1950 and 1959, shortly before his appointment as Chief of Defence Staff, the highest position in the British military. And it prompts Lee, in the documentary, to ask of our new King: 'Does he know the truth? If so, he should release this truth to the public.'\n\nAs an investigative journalist, university lecturer and committed ufologist, I first heard of the active role the royals had played in seeking the answer to the ultimate question \u2013 Are we alone? \u2013 as part of my research back in the early 2000s.\n\nI was able to examine Mountbatten's private papers at the Broadlands Archive, which prove he had a thing for space travel and avidly consumed the early literature on flying saucers, as UFOs were known at that time.\n\nPrince Charles, then Prince of Wales, was seen at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975\n\nLord Mountbatten and his nephew Prince Philip at the Royal Marines barracks in October 1965\n\nThe term 'flying saucer' was first used in 1947 after pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a chain of nine objects in the sky while flying over Washington State, describing them as flying at great speed and skipping like a 'saucer on water'.\n\nThe world was gripped and, before long, saucers were being spotted everywhere.\n\nIn 1950, Mountbatten encouraged newspaper editor Charles Eade, who had served as his press secretary during the war in the Far East, to publish 'all the available evidence' in his paper, the Sunday Dispatch.\n\nEade wanted Mountbatten to allow his name to be used in his series as it would add to its credibility \u2013 but Mountbatten refused.\n\nInstead, Eade's front-page splash, under the headline 'Flying saucers... the story that may be bigger than atom bomb wars', was credited to a source whom he described as 'one of the most famous men alive today' who 'commands universal respect and admiration'.\n\nMountbatten's theory was that they were craft from other planets, as his letters to Eade reveal: 'The available evidence shows they are not of human agency, that is to say they do not come from our Earth.\n\n'If that is so, then presumably they must come from some heavenly body, probably a planet. Maybe it is the Shackletons and Scotts of Venus or Mars who are making their first exploration of our Earth.' This interest was shared by Charles and by Prince Philip, who was among the first subscribers to the magazine Flying Saucer Review, launched in London during 1955 and edited by retired RAF pilot Derek Dempster.\n\nAccording to one of its later editors, Gordon Creighton, every copy was sent to Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn 2002 I was invited to tea by Mountbatten's youngest daughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, now 95, at her stately home in Oxfordshire to discuss the subject.\n\nShe told me how her father was fond of asking, 'Do you believe in flying saucers?' as a conversation opener during visits to royal courts and capitals across Europe.\n\nShe described a lunch with the then King Idris of Libya, when her father was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean. 'After the usual pleasantries there was quite a long silence and my father decided to break it by asking [through an interpreter] what for him was the burning question, 'Will you ask his majesty if he believes in flying saucers?'\n\n'There was this frightful pause, as the king thought his leg was being pulled. But when it was established that it was a genuine question, he said that of course he believed in them.\n\n'He said he had seen two of them himself and added that the Prophet recorded how a close companion of his had seen one of the fiery sphere types \u2013 as had his camel.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh's voracious appetite for information on flying saucers was confirmed to me by RAF Air Marshal Sir Peter Horsley, who served as his equerry from 1952 to 1955.\n\nLord Mountbatten with Prince Philip and Charles at a polo match in 1977\n\nWhen I spoke to him in 2001, the year he died, he revealed he'd been tasked by his employer with finding out as much as he could on the subject and was given carte blanche to read any reports and to interview fighter pilots who had reported seeing unusual phenomena in the sky.\n\nHe told me he had arranged, with the duke's personal approval, for RAF Fighter Command to send copies of the latest sightings made by aircrew for examination at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPerhaps the strangest outcome of this inquiry was Peter Horsley's role in inviting several UFO witnesses to discuss their experiences at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThese included the captain of a BOAC airliner, James Howard, who witnessed, along with other crew members and passengers, a strange formation of UFOs while flying over the North Atlantic in June 1954.\n\nAnother visitor to the palace was schoolboy Stephen Darbishire who obtained two photographs of a 'saucer' hovering above the slopes of the Old Man of Coniston in the Lake District, in February of that year.\n\nHorsley explained his reason for inviting UFO witnesses to the palace was partly to 'put them on the spot' and to test their honesty in the presence of royalty \u2013 a method as effective as any truth serum.\n\nThey both passed the test with flying colours, convincing their esteemed hosts \u2013 and Horsley himself \u2013 that Earth had indeed had visitations from outer space.\n\nHorsley was scathing about a growing movement of cranks and fantasists, however, who he thought were making a mockery \u2013 and quite a bit of money \u2013 out of the flying saucer craze.\n\nAmong those Horsley accused of making a joke out of a very serious subject was the notorious Polish-American writer George Adamski, who co-authored the 1953 best-seller Flying Saucers Have Landed with Desmond Leslie, a former Second World War Spitfire pilot who had his own contacts in the British establishment.\n\nLeslie was friends with General Sir Frederick 'Boy' Browning, the husband of author Daphne du Maurier. After retiring from the military, Browning had become head of Princess Elizabeth's staff and, following her accession, worked for Prince Philip.\n\nBrowning was another member of what Horsley described as 'the flying saucer club' at the palace.\n\nAdamski's book contained his personal account of an alleged meeting with the Venusian pilot of a flying saucer 'scout-ship' that landed in the Mojave Desert of California, communicating with its angelic occupant by telepathy.\n\nIn April 1959, Adamski embarked on a European lecture tour that included an audience with the Dutch royal family \u2013 proving they too had caught the alien bug \u2013 and, shortly before he arrived in London, Leslie wrote to the Duke of Edinburgh, enclosing a personal invitation for them to meet Adamski, in secret if necessary.\n\nPrince Philip clearly realised the public relations danger this could place him in as he annotated Leslie's letter \u2013 now preserved in the Imperial War Museum archives \u2013 with the words, 'Not on your Nellie!', adding in a later note: 'He may not be a crank but he's a bit too fanciful for me!'\n\nHowever, despite the royal disapproval, both General Browning and Peter Horsley met Leslie and Adamski during their visit at a private address in London.\n\nHorsley told me he was not impressed by either. He felt that Desmond Leslie was 'probably sincere but gullible, sucked into the saucer cult by people who hoped to profit from it, such as Adamski' and he warned Browning against having any further contact with them.\n\nPeter Horsley's direct knowledge of the duke's interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena ended when he left the palace in 1955 to return to RAF duties. Yet the royal fascination remained.\n\nIn 1978, Lord Mountbatten joined Prince Philip and the Queen at the star-spangled royal premiere of Steven Spielberg's Hollywood blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Odeon in Leicester Square. The film tells the story of government conspiracy to hide the first arrival of UFOs and their friendly alien crews on Earth.\n\nOver the decades the duke had maintained an active interest in a range of esoteric subjects.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he became involved in plans for a full-scale investigation in search of the Loch Ness monster.\n\nA Conservative MP, David James, persuaded him to use his connections with the Royal Navy to push for a publicly funded expedition to Loch Ness. The MoD's Chief of Defence Staff, Sir Solly Zuckerman, raised the idea with the navy's Chief Scientist, Sir John Caroll, arguing that 'if a sonar investigation were to reveal something extraordinary in the loch, it would be of considerable scientific interest'. But Caroll blocked the idea, saying it would be too costly.\n\nRoyal interest in the arcane also extended to the crop circle phenomenon which, some argue, are created by extra-terrestrial life. One of the leading promoters of the mystery, Colin Andrews, sent a copy of his book Circular Evidence, co-written with Pat Delgado, to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn August of that year, The Times revealed that the book had been added to the Royal Family's 'holiday reading list'. Shortly afterwards, Andrews received a note from Buckingham Palace asking if he would provide updates 'on the latest developments on the Circles Phenomenon' for the Duke of Edinburgh, who had become a paid subscriber to his Crop Circles newsletter.\n\nBut the royals turned down Andrews' offer to provide a personal briefing on the subject, perhaps having learned lessons from the duke's earlier flirtation with George Adamski and his friends.\n\nNo one has been able to establish the full extent of the Duke of Edinburgh's personal interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena as he never mentioned the subject in media interviews.\n\nHowever, several contributors to the documentary, King Of UFOs, say that the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle include sealed files that are not to be opened until 90 years after his death \u2013 so more may yet be revealed.\n\nIn 2017, I wrote to Prince Philip to ask if correspondence on UFOs and crop circles had been preserved. I said there was considerable public interest in its contents, in particular the private study of the subject, completed on his behalf by Peter Horsley in 1955.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, Prince Philip's private secretary, Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, responded: 'I am afraid that extensive searches have not yielded any papers that would be of help to your research. This letter comes with His Royal Highness's best wishes.'\n\nIf he did know the truth, the duke \u2013 private, discreet and careful to the end \u2013 took it with him. But what about King Charles?"

        "article_content": "Sleep is really important. Plenty of us don\u2019t do what it takes to get enough sleep \u2014 not to mention the fact that a large portion of people have sleep disorders that they don\u2019t even know about. We\u2019ve had sleep trackers and sleep-tracking tech to help us get a better understanding of our sleep for some time now, but AI could help supercharge the tech.\n\nIn fact, there are already plenty of AI-powered sleep apps already available. Curious about whether or not AI might be able to help you sleep? Here are some of the best AI-powered sleep apps.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple Watch Series 10 introduces a new sleep apnea feature\n\nSleeptracker-AI\n\nSleeptracker has long been a favorite for tracking sleep and gaining a better understanding of it, but in recent years, the company has been leveraging AI tech to improve on what the app can offer. Sleeptracker is used in conjunction with a hardware tracker, which is placed under your mattress, and can track sleep of two people, with sensors on each side of the bed. The AI part of the app comes from the fact that Sleeptracker has trained its algorithms on data from over 1 million smart devices, combined with over 70 research studies, and vetted by Stanford Sleep Medicine and UCSF. The underlying tech was developed by Fullpower-AI, and it\u2019s considered one of the more accurate sleep-tracking systems out there.\n\nSleepScore\n\nSleepScore, by SleepScore Labs, is another much-loved sleep-tracking system, and another of the most accurate ones. SleepScore was developed by ResMed, and it uses the microphones and speakers on your phone to analyze your movements and your breathing patterns. SleepScore Labs also has another app, called \u201cDo I Snore or Grind,\u201d and it uses the same tech to detect how regularly you snore or grind your teeth.\n\nNightly\n\nNightly leverages AI a little more than some of the competition. Nightly tracks your sleep, to be sure, but it also plays AI-generated sounds designed to help you sleep better, and based on your environment, how your day went (based on your input), and more. It has various white noise sounds and beats that Nightly says will help users get deeper sleep, and more.\n\nSleep Cycle\n\nSleep Cycle is built around tracking your sleep with AI-powered algorithms, and actually using that information to help you feel better when you wake up. When you set an alarm in the app, it\u2019ll use your sleep cycle information to wake you up at the point of your lightest sleep, helping ensure that you start your day feeling great. It also uses ambient sounds to detect your sleep, so you don\u2019t need to wear anything or use other devices, if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nPillow\n\nPillow is designed to take some of the guesswork out of sleep-tracking. It leverages AI to process a massive range of data points around your sleep, and if you use it with an Apple Watch, you don\u2019t need to do anything to start tracking \u2014 it\u2019ll automatically track your sleep when it thinks you\u2019re sleeping. It\u2019ll even record audio when it detects you snoring, and use machine learning to give you a detailed sleep analysis after each night."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s important to have a home with a look you love. The difference between coming home to a poorly organized setup, versus one that looks intentional and put together, can be huge. But not everyone can afford to spend cash on an interior designer.\n\nThankfully, with AI, you don\u2019t have to spend that money. There are tons of great AI interior design apps to help you get the most out of your home, both when it comes to shopping for furniture and other items to round out your living space, and when it comes to maximizing the space with the items you already have.\n\nSEE ALSO: IKEA's new furniture line attempts to take gamers out of the basement\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the best AI interior design apps:\n\nHomestyler\n\nHomestyler is one of the most-loved AI interior design apps, not only leveraging AI tech, but also augmented reality (AR), to help you visualize a design in your actual space. You can upload images of your space to place furniture, decorations, and more in, and you can choose from a variety of styles, including Glam, Contemporary, Bohemian, and more.\n\nSpecific to AI is the fact that you can have the built-in AI Designer generate ideas of its own using your uploaded images, and based on your filters around style. You can even upload floor plans, and switch from interior designer to exterior design, so you can design every aspect of your home.\n\nRoom Planner\n\nRoom Planner is a little more minimalistic than some of the others, but that also means it\u2019s a little easier to use, and takes less time to get to actual ideas. You can have the app maintain your room\u2019s color-scheme, ensuring that you won\u2019t have to start from scratch when it comes to decorations and furniture. It\u2019s also free, and lets you generate as many images as you want. The service is in beta, so it might generate some weird ideas from time to time, but because it\u2019s free, it\u2019s hard to have a big issue with that.\n\nDreamhouse AI\n\nDreamhouse AI is one of the more powerful options on this list, and while it\u2019s not free, it is considered to offer some of the best designs. The service has a very user-friendly interface, and makes it easy to get up and running quickly, with high-quality designs and inspirations you can use to create your space.\n\nThe service has a monthly and yearly plan, and if you\u2019re moving into a new home, it\u2019s worth signing up for a month to get ideas for all the rooms in your new home \u2014 after which you can simply unsubscribe.\n\nREimagineHome\n\nPerhaps you\u2019d prefer to use a web-based app than one on your phone, in which case REimagineHome is the way to go. This service also lets you upload images of your space, and allows you to stage bare rooms, or redesign rooms that are already furnished.\n\nCoohom\n\nMost of the AI interior design apps so far can generate great ideas and inspirations, but what if you want ideas using furniture you already have? Coohom has a huge library of furniture that you can match to what you own, or at least find something pretty close \u2014 so you don\u2019t have to try and imagine what your furniture will look like in a space. You can even import 3D renders from other sources. The software is a little more advanced than others, and there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve \u2014 but if you\u2019re willing to spend some time learning how to use the software, you might get more personalized results."

        "article_content": "Claude has a new \u201capp\u201d for Windows 11/10, and I tried it out. And guess what? It simply loads https://claude.ai/ in an Electron Chromium container. For those who are unaware, Chromium powers most of the browsers you use today, such as Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and Arc.\n\nThere used to be a time when companies and developers tried building full-fledged apps, native apps that matched the look and feel of Windows. Native apps are still shipped on MacOS or iOS, but I feel that the \u201cera\u201d is long gone on Windows 11/10 and is not coming back unless somebody is building advanced apps.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new apps are mostly based on Edge WebView, and its competitors also prefer to ship web-based apps. Worse, they use the slower Chromium instead of Microsoft Edge (Edge WebView). After ChatGPT\u2019s Chromium Windows app, Claude has also shipped a similar app.\n\nLike ChatGPT, Claude\u2019s app for Windows 11 (and Windows 10) is powered by Electron.\n\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that the Claude AI\u2019s app is using an Electron (Chromium) wrapper. We can tell because there are several files typically found in Electron applications. For example, files like \u201cchrome_100_percent.pak\u201d and \u201cchrome_200_percent.pak\u201d are often part of the Chromium engine.\n\nWe also spotted files like \u201clibEGL.dll,\u201d \u201clibGLESv2.dll,\u201d and \u201cvulkan-1.dll\u201d, which confirms Claude is using Chromium\u2019s rendering engine.\n\nThese are used by Electron to render web content. Electron itself is not necessarily bad, and apps like Notion Ink or Slack also use Electron but deliver a good experience.\n\nIn the case of Claude, it\u2019s simply loading the AI\u2019s website. It doesn\u2019t make sense to use Electron when all it tries to load is the website in a Chromium shell.\n\nAn Electron Chromium wrapper is heavier than using Edge WebView2 (pre-installed in Windows 11). Claude is installing its own Chromium bundle, which is why it could take more than 200 MB of storage space after some use.\n\nThis is more than the new Copilot app, another web wrapper, but it takes less than a megabyte of space on your PC.\n\nThe large size and increased resource consumption come from the fact that it\u2019s shipping its own version of Chromium. This is similar to carrying an entire instance of Chrome inside it, which could contribute to increased RAM usage when you use the app.\n\nThis goes for the ChatGPT app for Windows 11, too.\n\nClaude\u2019s new app for Windows 11 (and Windows 10) is completely free, and anyone, including those with paid subscription ($20) can access it. For some reason, Claude\u2019s app is not available in the Microsoft Store, so you\u2019ll need to download it from the company\u2019s website.\n\nWe absolutely see no reason to use the Electron-based Claude over its webpage unless you want to try the Ctrl+Alt+Space keyboard shortcut to open Claude AI anywhere on Windows in a small flyout.\n\nDo you really need these AI apps on Windows?\n\nIf you want to use ChatGPT or Claude on Windows, we recommend accessing them via your browser unless you really want to use some of the desktop-exclusive features.\n\nClaude offers no advantage over its website except the picture in picture mode, which is also available in ChatGPT (screenshot below).\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT app has another advantage over the website: advanced voice mode on the desktop. This allows you to talk to ChatGPT like a human.\n\nCopilot has a similar feature called \u201cVision,\u201d which is more advanced than ChatGPT\u2019s integration. However, it\u2019s still being tested in Microsoft Edge, and we don\u2019t know when it will ship to everyone.\n\nWith Copilot Vision, you\u2019ll be able talk about the Microsoft Edge screen using your voice in real time."

        "article_content": "ChromeOS 130 is rolling out to all Chromebooks, and it brings new features to both Chromebook and Chromebook Plus platforms, including a built-in recorder app and AI features. Here\u2019s everything new in ChromeOS 130.\n\nWhat\u2019s New in ChromeOS 130?\n\nThe first major addition is the new Recorder app, which is rolling out to all Chromebooks. It looks quite similar to the one you find on Pixels with Material You theming and on-device transcription. On Chromebook Plus, you also get title suggestions and three-point summaries. The app seems to be rolling out to Chromebook Plus first, as we couldn\u2019t find it on our non-Plus unit.\n\nQuick Insert is another great feature rolling out in ChromeOS 130. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is the first Chromebook to get a dedicated Quick Insert key. With this, you can now use a keyboard shortcut Launcher + F to emulate the same key on other Chromebooks.\n\nSimilarly, Focus Mode turns on DND and integrates Google Tasks in the UI, allowing you to work efficiently and be more productive without distractions. I\u2019ve tried the new Focus Mode, and it has how it helped me get things done quickly. So, I\u2019m sure you all will like it too.\n\nWelcome Recap is also rolling out in ChromeOS 130, and it shows you the files and apps you were working on before you last shut down your Chromebook. You can restore all the apps in a jiffy, and it can also serve as a reminder if you usually forget what you were working on last night.\n\nBesides, there\u2019s now support for multiple calendars, and an option to adjust keyboard backlight brightness in Settings. There\u2019s a similar slider in display settings with Ambient brightness control, but we couldn\u2019t find it on our Chromebook.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nAs for the Chromebook Plus-specific new AI features, there are two new features \u2014 Studio-style mic and Help me Read. The Studio-style mic feature is pretty straightforward. It uses AI to enhance the input sound quality and processes it to give it a studio feel.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nThe Help me read feature, on the other hand, also uses AI to summarize websites and PDFs. Users will see a text field where they can ask questions about the documents or pages and get summaries for the same.\n\nThat\u2019s not it. There are some other notable additions that Google has shared in its Chromebook support thread like the ability to access Google Drive files from the shelf, privacy controls that are more accessible in Chrome, and suggestions in Tote.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on ChromeOS 130?

        "article_content": "King Charles is known as a man of discerning tastes and strong opinions. He has a long-held interest in alternative beliefs and mystical therapies, and we all know his thoughts on leaky pens.\n\nBut who would have thought His Majesty may also have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO?\n\nThat is the bizarre claim being made in a new TV documentary which examines the royals' interest in UFOs and other paranormal mysteries.\n\nKing Of UFOs, made by British musician and UFO buff Mark Christopher Lee and now available on Amazon Prime, asks the question: does the Royal Family know what's really out there?\n\nIn it, he speaks to a diver, Dan Costello, who says he witnessed Charles, then Prince of Wales, at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975.\n\nKing Charles may have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO\n\nThe then dashing 27-year-old prince was one of three pilots spotted steering the 'odd-looking' object, while serving as a qualified helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy, he claims.\n\nDescribing the aircraft, he says: 'It would sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on [rotating] with no sound of propulsion, just a faint crackle of electromagnetism.'\n\nWhile, sadly, Costello goes on to admit that the aircraft Charles was allegedly flying was most probably not of alien origin, but part of a secret military operation, involving the British and Canadian governments \u2013 plus it hasn't been confirmed that Charles was anywhere near Canada at the time \u2013 it does bring into focus a royal fascination with all things 'other worldly', that goes back generations.\n\nIndeed, as I can exclusively reveal, the King may well have inherited a keen interest in the subject from his late father, Prince Philip, and his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, both of whom were avid enthusiasts.\n\nPhilip had a lifelong interest and curiosity in a range of fringe subjects, including UFOs, crop circles and the Loch Ness monster.\n\nMountbatten's fascination, meanwhile, reached its zenith between 1950 and 1959, shortly before his appointment as Chief of Defence Staff, the highest position in the British military. And it prompts Lee, in the documentary, to ask of our new King: 'Does he know the truth? If so, he should release this truth to the public.'\n\nAs an investigative journalist, university lecturer and committed ufologist, I first heard of the active role the royals had played in seeking the answer to the ultimate question \u2013 Are we alone? \u2013 as part of my research back in the early 2000s.\n\nI was able to examine Mountbatten's private papers at the Broadlands Archive, which prove he had a thing for space travel and avidly consumed the early literature on flying saucers, as UFOs were known at that time.\n\nPrince Charles, then Prince of Wales, was seen at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975\n\nLord Mountbatten and his nephew Prince Philip at the Royal Marines barracks in October 1965\n\nThe term 'flying saucer' was first used in 1947 after pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a chain of nine objects in the sky while flying over Washington State, describing them as flying at great speed and skipping like a 'saucer on water'.\n\nThe world was gripped and, before long, saucers were being spotted everywhere.\n\nIn 1950, Mountbatten encouraged newspaper editor Charles Eade, who had served as his press secretary during the war in the Far East, to publish 'all the available evidence' in his paper, the Sunday Dispatch.\n\nEade wanted Mountbatten to allow his name to be used in his series as it would add to its credibility \u2013 but Mountbatten refused.\n\nInstead, Eade's front-page splash, under the headline 'Flying saucers... the story that may be bigger than atom bomb wars', was credited to a source whom he described as 'one of the most famous men alive today' who 'commands universal respect and admiration'.\n\nMountbatten's theory was that they were craft from other planets, as his letters to Eade reveal: 'The available evidence shows they are not of human agency, that is to say they do not come from our Earth.\n\n'If that is so, then presumably they must come from some heavenly body, probably a planet. Maybe it is the Shackletons and Scotts of Venus or Mars who are making their first exploration of our Earth.' This interest was shared by Charles and by Prince Philip, who was among the first subscribers to the magazine Flying Saucer Review, launched in London during 1955 and edited by retired RAF pilot Derek Dempster.\n\nAccording to one of its later editors, Gordon Creighton, every copy was sent to Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn 2002 I was invited to tea by Mountbatten's youngest daughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, now 95, at her stately home in Oxfordshire to discuss the subject.\n\nShe told me how her father was fond of asking, 'Do you believe in flying saucers?' as a conversation opener during visits to royal courts and capitals across Europe.\n\nShe described a lunch with the then King Idris of Libya, when her father was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean. 'After the usual pleasantries there was quite a long silence and my father decided to break it by asking [through an interpreter] what for him was the burning question, 'Will you ask his majesty if he believes in flying saucers?'\n\n'There was this frightful pause, as the king thought his leg was being pulled. But when it was established that it was a genuine question, he said that of course he believed in them.\n\n'He said he had seen two of them himself and added that the Prophet recorded how a close companion of his had seen one of the fiery sphere types \u2013 as had his camel.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh's voracious appetite for information on flying saucers was confirmed to me by RAF Air Marshal Sir Peter Horsley, who served as his equerry from 1952 to 1955.\n\nLord Mountbatten with Prince Philip and Charles at a polo match in 1977\n\nWhen I spoke to him in 2001, the year he died, he revealed he'd been tasked by his employer with finding out as much as he could on the subject and was given carte blanche to read any reports and to interview fighter pilots who had reported seeing unusual phenomena in the sky.\n\nHe told me he had arranged, with the duke's personal approval, for RAF Fighter Command to send copies of the latest sightings made by aircrew for examination at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPerhaps the strangest outcome of this inquiry was Peter Horsley's role in inviting several UFO witnesses to discuss their experiences at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThese included the captain of a BOAC airliner, James Howard, who witnessed, along with other crew members and passengers, a strange formation of UFOs while flying over the North Atlantic in June 1954.\n\nAnother visitor to the palace was schoolboy Stephen Darbishire who obtained two photographs of a 'saucer' hovering above the slopes of the Old Man of Coniston in the Lake District, in February of that year.\n\nHorsley explained his reason for inviting UFO witnesses to the palace was partly to 'put them on the spot' and to test their honesty in the presence of royalty \u2013 a method as effective as any truth serum.\n\nThey both passed the test with flying colours, convincing their esteemed hosts \u2013 and Horsley himself \u2013 that Earth had indeed had visitations from outer space.\n\nHorsley was scathing about a growing movement of cranks and fantasists, however, who he thought were making a mockery \u2013 and quite a bit of money \u2013 out of the flying saucer craze.\n\nAmong those Horsley accused of making a joke out of a very serious subject was the notorious Polish-American writer George Adamski, who co-authored the 1953 best-seller Flying Saucers Have Landed with Desmond Leslie, a former Second World War Spitfire pilot who had his own contacts in the British establishment.\n\nLeslie was friends with General Sir Frederick 'Boy' Browning, the husband of author Daphne du Maurier. After retiring from the military, Browning had become head of Princess Elizabeth's staff and, following her accession, worked for Prince Philip.\n\nBrowning was another member of what Horsley described as 'the flying saucer club' at the palace.\n\nAdamski's book contained his personal account of an alleged meeting with the Venusian pilot of a flying saucer 'scout-ship' that landed in the Mojave Desert of California, communicating with its angelic occupant by telepathy.\n\nIn April 1959, Adamski embarked on a European lecture tour that included an audience with the Dutch royal family \u2013 proving they too had caught the alien bug \u2013 and, shortly before he arrived in London, Leslie wrote to the Duke of Edinburgh, enclosing a personal invitation for them to meet Adamski, in secret if necessary.\n\nPrince Philip clearly realised the public relations danger this could place him in as he annotated Leslie's letter \u2013 now preserved in the Imperial War Museum archives \u2013 with the words, 'Not on your Nellie!', adding in a later note: 'He may not be a crank but he's a bit too fanciful for me!'\n\nHowever, despite the royal disapproval, both General Browning and Peter Horsley met Leslie and Adamski during their visit at a private address in London.\n\nHorsley told me he was not impressed by either. He felt that Desmond Leslie was 'probably sincere but gullible, sucked into the saucer cult by people who hoped to profit from it, such as Adamski' and he warned Browning against having any further contact with them.\n\nPeter Horsley's direct knowledge of the duke's interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena ended when he left the palace in 1955 to return to RAF duties. Yet the royal fascination remained.\n\nIn 1978, Lord Mountbatten joined Prince Philip and the Queen at the star-spangled royal premiere of Steven Spielberg's Hollywood blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Odeon in Leicester Square. The film tells the story of government conspiracy to hide the first arrival of UFOs and their friendly alien crews on Earth.\n\nOver the decades the duke had maintained an active interest in a range of esoteric subjects.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he became involved in plans for a full-scale investigation in search of the Loch Ness monster.\n\nA Conservative MP, David James, persuaded him to use his connections with the Royal Navy to push for a publicly funded expedition to Loch Ness. The MoD's Chief of Defence Staff, Sir Solly Zuckerman, raised the idea with the navy's Chief Scientist, Sir John Caroll, arguing that 'if a sonar investigation were to reveal something extraordinary in the loch, it would be of considerable scientific interest'. But Caroll blocked the idea, saying it would be too costly.\n\nRoyal interest in the arcane also extended to the crop circle phenomenon which, some argue, are created by extra-terrestrial life. One of the leading promoters of the mystery, Colin Andrews, sent a copy of his book Circular Evidence, co-written with Pat Delgado, to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn August of that year, The Times revealed that the book had been added to the Royal Family's 'holiday reading list'. Shortly afterwards, Andrews received a note from Buckingham Palace asking if he would provide updates 'on the latest developments on the Circles Phenomenon' for the Duke of Edinburgh, who had become a paid subscriber to his Crop Circles newsletter.\n\nBut the royals turned down Andrews' offer to provide a personal briefing on the subject, perhaps having learned lessons from the duke's earlier flirtation with George Adamski and his friends.\n\nNo one has been able to establish the full extent of the Duke of Edinburgh's personal interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena as he never mentioned the subject in media interviews.\n\nHowever, several contributors to the documentary, King Of UFOs, say that the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle include sealed files that are not to be opened until 90 years after his death \u2013 so more may yet be revealed.\n\nIn 2017, I wrote to Prince Philip to ask if correspondence on UFOs and crop circles had been preserved. I said there was considerable public interest in its contents, in particular the private study of the subject, completed on his behalf by Peter Horsley in 1955.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, Prince Philip's private secretary, Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, responded: 'I am afraid that extensive searches have not yielded any papers that would be of help to your research. This letter comes with His Royal Highness's best wishes.'\n\nIf he did know the truth, the duke \u2013 private, discreet and careful to the end \u2013 took it with him. But what about King Charles?"

        "article_content": "Samsung 990 Pro MSRP $180.00 Score Details \u201cLet's not mince words \u2014 the Samsung 990 Pro is insanely fast.\u201d Pros Crazy fast\n\nOptions with and without a heatsink\n\nCapacity up to 4TB\n\nSeveral features through Samsung Magician Cons Overkill for the PS5\n\nHeatsink is impractical for most\n\nI won\u2019t waste your time here. The Samsung 990 Pro is the best SSD you can buy right now. It\u2019s crazy fast, particularly when it comes to large file transfers, and despite a relatively high price, Samsung justifies the cost with extra features that few other brands go out of their way to fuss with.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe particular model I\u2019m looking at here, the Samsung 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink, may not be the right pick for everyone, though. Although it\u2019s a very fast drive, the extra cost of the heatsink and its slant toward expanding the storage inside the PlayStation 5 doesn\u2019t make sense, and you can save some money with a slower drive while achieving similar levels of gaming performance.\n\nPerformance outside of games is a different matter, however, which is where the 990 Pro truly stands out. If you want to learn more about SSD performance and how it varies between applications, make sure to check out our SSD buying guide.\n\nPricing and specs\n\n1TB 2TB 4TB Sequential read/write Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Random read/write Up to 1.2M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Up to 1.4M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Up to 1.6M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Cache 1GB low power DDR4 2GB low power DDR4 4GB low power DDR4 Memory Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Interface PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 Form factor M.2 2280 M.2 2280 M.2 2280 Max power consumption 7.8W 8.5W 8.6W Dimensions 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm Price $130 $180 $330\n\nSamsung has remained the go-to brand for NVMe SSD for many years, and it\u2019s clear why. You\u2019re getting close to the maximum bandwidth of a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface, with Samsung touting sequential read speeds of up to 7,450MB/s. My testing backs up Samsung\u2019s claims, making this one of the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs you can currently buy.\n\nUnlike most other SSDs on the market, Samsung is using its own in-house NAND and controller for the 990 Pro, which generally makes it less prone to hardware swaps after launch. Other SSD brands that outsource NAND and controllers can run into supply issues and swap out components, sometimes at the cost of advertised speed. Thankfully, that\u2019s not the case here. You\u2019re also getting small amount of DDR4 as a cache, speeding up the performance of the drive.\n\nPricing is where things get interesting. This model of the 990 Pro is heavily targeted toward the PS5 due to having its own heatsink. That bit of extra metal drives up the price. At 2TB, you can save $10 by going with the 990 Pro model without a heatsink. And if you go up to 4TB, you\u2019ll save $30. That\u2019s compared to Samsung\u2019s own 990 Pro, too. If you shop for a drive like the WD Black SN850X, you\u2019ll get similar speeds for much less money \u2014 sans the heatsink.\n\nMost modern motherboards have heatsinks for the SSD drives, and in fact, the extra heatsink size can interfere with your other components. This is really a drive built for other applications, such as the PS5 Pro, or a mini PC with enough space but no heatsink, such as the Minisforum AtomMan G7 Ti.\n\nSoftware and features\n\nSamsung may have fast drives, but it also has excellent management software. I wouldn\u2019t blame you for ignoring the bundled software with most SSDs, but Samsung Magician has a lot of options, and it\u2019s worth taking up a bit of space to install the application.\n\nYou get some high-level stats, such as drive health, and you can perform a benchmark and diagnostic to see how your drive is performing. More importantly, Samsung gives you a ton of options to tweak the performance of your drive. You can turn on TRIM to let deleted blocks surface again for writing, as well as prevent the SSD from sleeping for maximum performance. Samsung also has over-provisioning options to increase the life span of the drive.\n\nBeyond performance, you have encryption options, data migration, and a proper erase function. This will restructure all of the data on the drive so it can\u2019t be recovered with forensics.\n\nPerformance\n\nSetting the scene, CrystalDiskMark shows that the 990 Pro with heatsink actually reaches a bit above Samsung\u2019s advertised speeds, both for sequential reads and writes. We\u2019re getting close to maxing out the available bandwidth on a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface, at least for sequential reads and writes. That\u2019s not what your drive is going to be doing most of the time, however.\n\nLooking at real applications provides some important context, as the margins between the 990 Pro 2TB and a much cheaper (and slower) drive like the WD Blue SN5000 shrink considerably. In large file transfers, which you can see in my AJA Video Systems test, the 990 Pro reigns supreme. There are some minor differences between the 1TB and 2TB models I tested, but not a big enough difference to note.\n\nSamsung 990 Pro 2TB w/ Heatsink WD Blue SN5000 4TB Samsung 990 Pro 1TB AJA Video Systems (read/write) 6,090 / 5,994MB/s 4,353 / 4,589MB/s 6,040 / 5,921MB/s PCMark 10 3,677 3,523 3,811 3DMark 3,372 3,621 3,650 Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail (seconds, lower is better) 7.59 seconds 7.11 seconds 7.24 seconds\n\nIn games, however, the 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink actually fell behind the pack. Both the SN5000 and regular 990 Pro posted better results in 3DMark \u2014 which actually loads games through the benchmark \u2014 and Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail. The 2TB 990 Pro isn\u2019t far behind, and when we\u2019re talking about margins of half a second, you\u2019ll never notice a meaningful difference in performance. On paper, however, it\u2019s a bit behind.\n\nShould you buy the Samsung 990 Pro?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the fastest SSDs on the market for your PC, the Samsung 990 Pro hits that mark squarely. There\u2019s no doubt that the Samsung 990 Pro is a fast SSD, but I\u2019m not sure going with this specific model is the right call for the PS5. There are a couple of important reasons why.\n\nFirst, the heatsink. There are only a few instances where an SSD calls for a heatsink, and even in those cases, you probably won\u2019t reach damaging temperatures without one. If you plan on putting the 990 Pro inside a PC, save yourself some money and go with the heatsink-free model.\n\nThe bigger issue is the speed for gaming. This drive is heavily targeted toward the PS5, which is a platform that really can\u2019t take advantage of the extra speed on offer. In games, even the objectively slower SN5000 is putting up similar results, and you can pick up that drive for $120 \u2014 a clean $60 less than the 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink.\n\nThe best use case for a drive this fast isn\u2019t gaming \u2014 most PCIe 4.0 SSDs are plenty for gaming, with only minor differences in loading speed. The 990 Pro really shines when it comes to large file transfers, where its sustained speed advantage really shows up clearly. In that context, the 990 Pro is worth spending up for."
