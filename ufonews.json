        "article_content": "The majority of horror shows often focus on sensationalized fear. Ugly and unsettling visuals and intense traumatic scenarios take center stage, making emotional storytelling an actual fear taking over viewers. Breaking away from this typical trend, MTV Dark Scroll- Muqabla Anjaan Se, India\u2019s premier paranormal reality show, seeks to redefine the genre by offering an authentic and chilling experience. Hosted by Amit Sadh, the show features nine seekers exploring seven haunted locations in Uttarakhand, guided by renowned paranormal expert Sarbajeet Mohanty and psychic Pooja Vijay.\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with The Hans India, Amit Sadh speaks about MTV Dark Scroll, a first-of-its-kind show in India, redefining the very definition of fear. He also shares insights from his personal journey on the show.\n\nQ1: What inspired you to host MTV Dark Scroll, India\u2019s first paranormal reality show?\n\nWhen the team from MTV approached me about hosting \u2018Dark Scroll\u2019, I was initially surprised. I had never hosted before in my life. However, the concept of exploring the unknown and engaging with viewers on topics that push boundaries really resonated with me. Also, the fact that it\u2019s a premier paranormal reality show added an exciting layer, offering a chance to present something both innovative and impactful. Further, the team\u2019s scientific and practical approach to the subject was something that really drew me in.\n\nQ2: How did the presence of paranormal research experts Sarbajeet Mohanty and Pooja Vijay shape the overall direction of the show?\n\nSarbajeet and Pooja brought incredible expertise to the show. Their knowledge of paranormal phenomena added depth to our investigations. They guided our seekers with advanced techniques and equipment, which helped us approach each location with a serious and respectful mindset. Their insights shaped not just the direction of the show but also my understanding of the paranormal.\n\nQ3: What factors influenced the decision to choose Uttarakhand as a primary location for the show\u2019s explorations?\n\nI've always believed that the mountains possess a unique magnetism and energy, which makes them a powerful backdrop for paranormal activity. The old saying \u2018the hills have eyes\u2019 truly resonates with me; there's something about the vastness and mystery of the mountains that seems to draw entities to manifest themselves. Each site we visited had a unique story. The mountains not only provide a stunning visual landscape but also enhance the emotional and spiritual weight of our investigations, making Uttarakhand an ideal setting for the first season of \u2018Dark Scroll\u2019.\n\nQ4: While filming Dark Scroll did you ever feel a shift in your perception of reality, even momentarily? How did you regain your sense of normalcy?\n\nI mean, when you're surrounded by the haunting echoes of the past and the palpable energy of the mountains, it\u2019s hard not to feel a shift in awareness. But here's the thing: I was more focused on the seekers and their journeys than on my own sense of normalcy. After all, in the face of the paranormal, it\u2019s the seekers who need the guidance, and I\u2019m just here to help them navigate through the shadows.\n\nQ5: Recently, one of the seekers experienced something unexplainable. How do you and the team handle such situations?\n\nWhen something unexplainable happens, we approach it with both curiosity and caution. We discuss the experience as a team, analyzing what occurred and how we can understand it better. It's important to keep an open mind while also grounding ourselves in research and rationality. And most importantly we have to be humane - I also feel deeply protective of the seekers and I understand this is a show but I want to ensure they all go back unharmed. I also want to compliment the seekers here because even when things got really tough for them they helped each other out as well.\n\nQ6: Can you share a specific moment or encounter from the show that genuinely unsettled you?\n\nThere were several moments where we felt the presence of the paranormal, but one that stands out was during an investigation at the haunted tea estate. It was not just me, even the crew could feel something was amiss. So on most locations I had to do a photoshoot for marketing and I was fine going into almost each location but here - at the tea estate - I didn\u2019t go inside, the vibe of the place was very off.\n\nQ7: How do you think Dark Scroll, as a pioneering reality TV show, is redefining the portrayal of fear, an element used to engage audiences in the paranormal genre?\n\nYes, it is remarkably redefining fear by focusing on genuine investigations rather than sensationalism. We aim to engage audiences by encouraging them to explore their fears and the unknown thoughtfully. By presenting real experiences and expert insights, we hope to foster a deeper understanding of fear and what it means to confront the unknown."

        "article_content": "A new algorithm tested on NASA\u2019s Perseverance Rover on Mars may lead to better forecasting of hurricanes, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that impact millions globally.\n\nGeorgia Tech Ph.D. student Austin P. Wright is first author of a paper that introduces Nested Fusion. The new algorithm improves scientists\u2019 ability to search for past signs of life on the Martian surface.\n\nThis innovation supports NASA\u2019s Mars 2020 mission. In addition, scientists from other fields working with large, overlapping datasets can use Nested Fusion\u2019s methods for their studies.\n\nWright presented Nested Fusion at the 2024 International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2024) where it was a runner-up for the best paper award. KDD is widely considered the most prestigious conference for knowledge discovery and data mining research.\n\n\u201cNested Fusion is really useful for researchers in many different domains, not just NASA scientists,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThe method visualizes complex datasets that can be difficult to get an overall view of during the initial exploratory stages of analysis.\u201d\n\nImage Figure showing how Nested Fusion learns latent structures at high resolution to produce distributions at greater impact. Above graphic focuses on the PIXL instrument the Perseverance Rover uses to scan Mars' surface.\n\nNested Fusion combines datasets with different resolutions to produce a single, high-resolution visual distribution. Using this method, NASA scientists can more easily analyze multiple datasets from various sources at the same time. This can lead to faster studies of Mars\u2019 surface composition to find clues of previous life.\n\nThe algorithm demonstrates how data science impacts traditional scientific fields like chemistry, biology, and geology.\n\nEven further, Wright is developing Nested Fusion applications to model shifting climate patterns, plant and animal life, and other concepts in the earth sciences. The same method can combine overlapping datasets from satellite imagery, biomarkers, and climate data.\n\n\u201cUsers have extended Nested Fusion and similar algorithms toward earth science contexts, which we have received very positive feedback,\u201d said Wright, who studies machine learning (ML) at Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cCross-correlational analysis takes a long time to do and is not done in the initial stages of research when patterns appear and form new hypotheses. Nested Fusion enables people to discover these patterns much earlier.\u201d\n\nWright is the data science and ML lead for PIXLISE, the software that NASA JPL scientists use to study data from the Mars Perseverance Rover.\n\nPerseverance uses its Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) to collect data on mineral composition of Mars\u2019 surface. PIXL\u2019s two main tools that accomplish this are its X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometer and Multi-Context Camera (MCC).\n\nWhen PIXL scans a target area, it creates two co-aligned datasets from the components. XRF collects a sample's fine-scale elemental composition. MCC produces images of a sample to gather visual and physical details like size and shape.\n\nA single XRF spectrum corresponds to approximately 100 MCC imaging pixels for every scan point. Each tool\u2019s unique resolution makes mapping between overlapping data layers challenging. However, Wright and his collaborators designed Nested Fusion to overcome this hurdle.\n\nIn addition to progressing data science, Nested Fusion improves NASA scientists' workflow. Using the method, a single scientist can form an initial estimate of a sample\u2019s mineral composition in a matter of hours. Before Nested Fusion, the same task required days of collaboration between teams of experts on each different instrument.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest lessons I have taken from this work is that it is valuable to always ground my ML and data science problems in actual, concrete use cases of our collaborators,\u201d Wright said.\n\n\u201cI learn from collaborators what parts of data analysis are important to them and the challenges they face. By understanding these issues, we can discover new ways of formalizing and framing problems in data science.\u201d\n\nImage Portrait of ML Ph.D student Austin P. Wright, lead developer of Nested Fusion\n\nWright presented Nested Fusion at KDD 2024, held Aug. 25-29 in Barcelona, Spain. KDD is an official special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery. The conference is one of the world\u2019s leading forums for knowledge discovery and data mining research.\n\nNested Fusion won runner-up for the best paper in the applied data science track, which comprised of over 150 papers. Hundreds of other papers were presented at the conference\u2019s research track, workshops, and tutorials.\n\nWright\u2019s mentors, Scott Davidoff and Polo Chau, co-authored the Nested Fusion paper. Davidoff is a principal research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Chau is a professor at the Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).\n\n\u201cI was extremely happy that this work was recognized with the best paper runner-up award,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis kind of applied work can sometimes be hard to find the right academic home, so finding communities that appreciate this work is very encouraging.\u201d"
