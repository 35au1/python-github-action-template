            "article_content": "Nick Drake\u2019s unlikely connection to the cult sci-fi TV show \u2018UFO\u2019\n\nIn April of 1969, Nick Drake\u2014still a couple of months shy of his 21st birthday\u2014was toiling away at Sound Techniques studio in London, wrapping up the final recording session for his debut album, Five Leaves Left. At the same time, about 15 miles away at the MGM film studios in Borehamwood, Nick\u2019s older sister Gabrielle Drake, 25, had just started principal photography on the biggest acting gig of her career\u2014a new live-action science fiction series called UFO, produced by the creators of the beloved marionette TV shows Thunderbirds and Stingray.\n\nMore than half a century later, Fives Leaves Left and UFO each have considerably more fans and cultural relevance than they ever did in their own time. Even the term \u201ccult classic\u201d might be underselling them at this point. Nick Drake, of course, posthumously became one of Britain\u2019s most revered and influential singer/songwriters, while UFO\u2014despite running for just one series between 1970 and \u201971\u2014has gradually built a devoted following nearly on par with that of other iconic TV hits of its era like The Avengers and The Prisoner.\n\nThis makes it all the more bizarre to realise that the Drake siblings likely came home for Christmas in 1969, believing that their big projects\u2014one set in pastoral England and one in futuristic outer space\u2014had both failed.\n\nNick\u2019s debut folk album had disappointingly flopped in the summer after a head-scratching lack of promotion from his label, Island Records. Gabrielle, meanwhile, dropped out of her role on UFO before a single episode had even aired. MGM\u2019s British studios had closed down in the middle of production, forcing a long filming hiatus that she felt would conflict too much with other opportunities.\n\nGabrielle did eventually opt to return and continue playing Lieutenant Gay Ellis for a few more shoots in 1970, but despite her prominent role in the show\u2019s cast, she only wound up appearing in about half of UFO\u2019s 26 episodes. Her character, a purple-wigged moonbase commander in a tight silver catsuit, hadn\u2019t exactly felt like the role of a lifetime anyway. For better or worse, though, it\u2019s probably the one she\u2019s still best remembered for.\n\n\u201cIn a funny way, I feel more pleased to have done it in retrospect than at the time,\u201d Gabrielle Drake later acknowledged at a UFO fan convention in the year 2000, \u201cBecause I do think that it was actually a fairly innovative series and something which was perhaps a bit ahead of its time. It\u2019s very good to look back and to have been associated with it.\u201d\n\nIn the same way that her brother Nick had a capable hand at the wheel in the form of producer Joe Boyd, Gabrielle Drake also benefited from the guidance of UFO series producer Gerry Anderson, one of the legends of early sci-fi television. At the time, Anderson\u2019s background was more in kids TV and marionettes than live-action work with full-size humans, but Gabrielle remembered him as \u201ca very benevolent presence\u201d and someone \u201cyou always felt that you could go up and see at any time. . . . And very easy to get on with, always.\u201d\n\nDespite Anderson\u2019s credentials, though, Drake admitted that she never believed at the time, \u201cnot for one moment,\u201d that the cheap space show she was making would still be remembered or talked about by anybody in the 21st century. \u201cBut then you never do think that in our business,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is such a strange old business, too, because the one thing you think is going to be a surefire hit is bound to flop.\u201d\n\nSadly, we don\u2019t know if Nick Drake ever visited his sister on set or even if he ever bothered to watch a single episode of UFO (it\u2019s strangely difficult to imagine him watching any TV show). As those episodes were finally airing on British televisions in 1970 and \u201871, Nick was mostly hard at work recording and releasing his second album, Bryter Layter, which he believed would be a surefire success, but once again flopped, not to be properly appreciated until decades later. Such is the strange old world of show business."

He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

Meta clarified that this is part of its broader plan to integrate more AI-generated content into its feeds read more\n\nMeta seems intent on embedding AI-driven content deeper into its apps, even using AI-generated versions of users themselves to fill feeds with tailored, playful visuals. Image Credit: Reuters\n\nInstagram has started experimenting with a new feature where Meta\u2019s AI generates images of users in imaginative scenarios and slips them into their feeds. The feature recently caught attention when a Reddit user shared their experience of seeing AI-generated images of themselves standing in a surreal \u201cmaze of mirrors\u201d while scrolling. These images weren\u2019t part of an ad but appeared as personalised content directly on their timeline.\n\nThe user explained that they had previously uploaded selfies to Meta\u2019s AI-powered \u201cImagine\u201d tool, a feature that lets people create AI-enhanced versions of their photos. However, they were surprised to see the tool take it a step further, automatically generating scenarios like the reflective maze and placing them on their feed with a playful caption about \u201creflecting on life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom scepticism to confirmation\n\nWhen the Reddit post first surfaced, it was met with disbelief. Comments ranged from outright dismissal to conspiracy theories, with people calling it fake or accusing the poster of making it up. The user had to repeatedly clarify that the images were real, even sharing screenshots as proof.\n\nMeta eventually stepped in to confirm that this was not a hoax. According to the company, the AI-generated images are not advertisements but part of a September-announced feature designed to create personalised content based on user interests or trends. Meta\u2019s AI can now generate visual interpretations of users\u2019 selfies, imagining them in various roles like astronauts or video game characters.\n\nHow the \u201cImagine Yourself\u201d feature works\n\nThe \u201cImagine Yourself\u201d tool allows users to upload multiple selfies, which Meta\u2019s AI uses to create unique versions of them in creative settings. The tool\u2019s prompts can inspire anything from mundane scenarios to extraordinary roles, such as being placed in outer space. Once activated, the AI sometimes generates content automatically, inserting these whimsical images into users\u2019 feeds without prior prompts.\n\nMeta clarified that this is part of its broader plan to integrate more AI-generated content into Facebook and Instagram feeds. The company explained that users can engage with these images by swiping to explore other ideas or tapping prompts to tweak the generated content further.\n\nThe bigger picture: AI everywhere\n\nThis incident is just one example of how AI is becoming a more prominent part of social media. Over the same weekend, Meta\u2019s AI-generated profiles also went viral but were later removed from the platform. Meta seems intent on embedding AI-driven content deeper into its apps, even using AI-generated versions of users themselves to fill feeds with tailored, playful visuals.\n\nWhile some find this new approach entertaining, others are uneasy about the increasing use of AI in personal content, with concerns about privacy and consent looming large. Meta, however, appears confident that its users are ready for more AI in their digital lives. Whether they actually are remains to be seen."

            "article_content": "If you were looking for your own personal AI supercomputer, Nvidia has you covered.\n\nThe chipmaker announced at CES it\u2019s launching a personal AI supercomputer called Project Digits in May. The heart of Project Digits is the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which packs enough processing power to run sophisticated AI models while being compact enough to fit on a desk and run from a standard power outlet (this kind of processing power used to require much larger, more power-hungry systems). This desktop-sized system can handle AI models with up to 200 billion parameters, and has a starting price of $3,000. The product itself looks a lot like a Mac Mini.\n\n\u201cAI will be mainstream in every application for every industry. With Project Digits, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release. \u201cPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.\u201d\n\nProject Digits looks like a mini PC. Image: Nvidia\n\nEach Project Digits system comes equipped with 128GB of unified, coherent memory (by comparison, a good laptop might have 16GB or 32GB of RAM) and up to 4TB of NVMe storage. For even more demanding applications, two Project Digits systems can be linked together to handle models with up to 405 billion parameters (Meta\u2019s best model, Llama 3.1, has 405 billion parameters).\n\nThe GB10 chip delivers up to 1 petaflop of AI performance (which means it can perform 1 quadrillion AI calculations per second) at FP4 precision (which helps make the calculations faster by making approximations), and the system features Nvidia\u2019s latest-generation CUDA cores and fifth-generation Tensor Cores, connected via NVLink-C2C to a Grace CPU containing 20 power-efficient Arm-based cores. MediaTek, known for their Arm-based chip designs, collaborated on the GB10\u2019s development to optimize its power efficiency and performance.\n\nThe Digits supercomputer specs. Image: Nvidia\n\nUsers will also get access to Nvidia\u2019s AI software library, including development kits, orchestration tools, and pre-trained models available through the Nvidia NGC catalog. The system runs on Linux-based Nvidia DGX OS and supports popular frameworks like PyTorch, Python, and Jupyter notebooks. Developers can fine-tune models using the Nvidia NeMo framework and accelerate data science workflows with Nvidia RAPIDS libraries.\n\nUsers can develop and test their AI models locally on Project Digits, then deploy them to cloud services or data center infrastructure using the same Grace Blackwell architecture and Nvidia AI Enterprise software platform."

            "article_content": "Few developers did a better job of figuring out how to effectively use AI than Simon Willison. In his article \u201cThings we learned about LLMs in 2024,\u201d he simultaneously susses out how much happened in 2024 and why it\u2019s confusing. For example, we\u2019re all told to aggressively use genAI or risk falling behind, but we\u2019re awash in AI-generated \u201cslop\u201d that no one really wants to read. He also points out that LLMs, although marketed as the easy path to AI riches for all who master them, are actually \u201cchainsaws disguised as kitchen knives.\u201d He explains that \u201cthey look deceptively simple to use \u2026 but in reality you need a huge depth of both understanding and experience to make the most of them and avoid their many pitfalls.\u201d\n\nIf anything, this quagmire got worse in 2024. Incredibly smart people are building incredibly sophisticated systems that leave most developers incredibly frustrated by how to use them effectively. \u201cThe default LLM chat UI is like taking brand-new computer users,\u201d Willison argues, \u201cdropping them into a Linux terminal and expecting them to figure it all out.\u201d It\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s getting worse, not better.\n\nSmall wonder that the biggest AI flops of 2024, as captured by MIT Technology Review, largely relate to our collective inability to turn AI into applications that normal people want to use. Even basic things, like Apple\u2019s attempt to summarize my incoming text messages, are more confusing than useful. Some of this stems from the inability to trust AI to deliver consistent results, but much of it derives from the fact that we keep loading developers up with AI primitives (similar to cloud primitives like storage, networking, and compute) that force them to do the heavy lifting of turning those foundational building blocks into applications."

            "article_content": "After finding a Ouija board in her new home, a woman has been experiencing strange happenings for the past three months.\n\nIn a five-minute video posted to social media, mother-of-two Brandi Nettleton claims to have \u201cfinally\u201d caught her suspicions on camera. She filmed the seemingly paranormal activity that she has been experiencing ever since she moved into her sister\u2019s house.\n\nFilming herself walking around her new place, Brandi tells viewers she's home alone with her daughter, while her son, who lives in the upstairs part of the house, has left to go to a party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a mimic here for a couple of weeks. When my daughter\u2019s not at home I hear her say my name and she\u2019s not there\u201d, she explains. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s at home but my son is not, and my son is the only one who lives upstairs. All night since he\u2019s been gone I keep hearing the door close but there\u2019s nobody up there.\u201d\n\nImage: Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Image: Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003)\n\nShe then reveals her plan to try and catch the sound on video, and sits in silence, still filming. She begins to talk about how she\u2019s been upstairs to check whenever similar things happen, when her dog begins to bark, which prompts her to slowly walk to the stairs leading up to her son\u2019s bedroom, with the camera facing the ceiling.\n\nViewers can then hear a loud and repetitive clicking sound, followed by a thud. Brandi reacts by walking up the stairs and showing the audience: \u201cLook, nobody\u2019s up here. Oh my god look, his door is closed.\u201d\n\nThe door to her son\u2019s bedroom then clicks open, untouched, and Brandi runs downstairs to tell her daughter what just happened. \u201cIt sounds like somebody\u2019s in your brother's room. I went up there to show that his door was closed. Tell me why his door opened when I went up there. I swear I ran down here by myself, I\u2019m recording it\u201d, she says.\n\nBoth of them then go upstairs to show, with a flashlight, that the upstairs bedroom is empty. Just as they are back on the stairs, the door clicks open again, making mother and daughter scream in horror.\n\nBrandi said she associates the strange occurrences to an Ouija board - an instrument some use to try to call spirits forward - she had found and thrown away upon moving in.\n\n\u201cI found out after my sister moved out that she had a Ouija board here and I found it when I was packing her stuff. I got rid of it right away. There are still things that go on almost every single night\u201d, she explained.\n\nBrandi\u2019s video was viewed by more than three million people across social media platforms, and part of the audience reacted by sharing advice, empathy for her situation, and similar situations they had been through.\n\n\u201cThis is the most in time realistic non staged video I think I\u2019ve seen\u201d, one commented. Another advised: \u201cRemember if you are scared they tend to react more\u201d.\n\nOne user shared: \u201cI lived in a home with three roommates. We all experienced it. The day we all decided to move out was when we heard it repeat. 'HELLO' four or five times as well as children giggling.\u201d\n\nA commenter joked that the \u201cmimic\u201d - believed by some to be a spiritual entity with the ability to imitate its surroundings or other creatures - would be happy with the family\u2019s scared reactions. Brandi then responded: \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t doubt it and what sucks is I respond to it because it\u2019s my daughter\u2019s voice and it\u2019s just an automatic response. I don\u2019t know how not to.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi is back in the director\u2019s chair for Kadhalikka Neramillai. On the lines of her debut film Vanakkam Chennai, the Jayam Ravi and Nithya Menen film also seems to be a breezy, fun, romance-drama. \u201cIt has no connection with the original film,\u201d says Kiruthiga, referencing the 1964 cult classic by CV Sridhar, \u201cMaybe at that time, it was a new-age love story while ours is the same for today\u2019s time.\u201d The yesteryear film marked actor Ravichandran\u2019s first film and interestingly, Kiruthiga\u2019s last work was the web series Paper Rocket which starred the veteran actor\u2019s granddaughter Tanya Ravichandran. \u201cShe was the first person I called to inform about the connection when we zeroed in on this title,\u201d says a smiling Kiruthiga, as we sit down at the office of Red Giant Movies, the banner behind the film.\n\n\u201cI try to tell stories without fixating on what genre they fall under. Kadhalikka Neramillai is based on stories I have heard people talking about and just like Paper Rocket, it\u2019s also based on true events,\u201d says Kiruthiga who agrees that there are not many romcoms coming up in Tamil cinema. \u201cI think it\u2019s because male directors are catering to male audiences and violence seems to be the trend. Women or children don\u2019t want to see these movies but they still get made. Drama films, on the other hand, are timeless. Lubber Pandhu is a recent example which was celebrated and if more such films are made, people will definitely watch them.\u201d\n\nKiruthiga has been toying with this film\u2019s script for a few years now. \u201cIt was supposed to have taken off before Paper Rocket. After finishing it, when I was trying to cast for this film, Thiruchitrambalam had released and I thought Nithya would be a great fit for the role. I narrated the story over a call and she agreed instantly. While speaking to Ravi, I told him Nithya had agreed and he gave his nod to read the script. I think he would have visualised the film with Nithya before agreeing to it,\u201d says Kiruthiga. \u201cIn romcoms or dramas, the emotions have to work and for that, characters have to connect. The two actors instantly elevated the roles.\u201d\n\nIn her previous two films, Vanakkam Chennai and Kaali, Kiruthiga gave equal weight to both her male and female lead characters. \u201cWhen I speak to my friends, I understand that just like me they are also unable to connect with the female characters written by men because they don\u2019t behave the way we do. I understand that men don\u2019t seem to figure out the core nature of us. So when I write a female character, I want to make sure it connects with me and my friends,\u201d says Kiruthiga for whom such character arcs come naturally from her life experiences.\n\nOne of Kadhalikka Neramillai\u2019s USPs is AR Rahman\u2019s music and \u2018Yennai Izhukkuthadi\u2019 has already turned out to be a hit. \u201cThe five songs incidentally fell under five different genres. While \u2018Yennai Izhukkuthadi\u2019 is a pub song, \u2018Lavender Neramae\u2019 is a travel song and \u2018It\u2019s a Break Up Da\u2019, as the name suggests, is a breakup song. When discussing the songs, we discovered the various themes and we didn\u2019t want to restrict the genres. That\u2019s why \u2018It\u2019s a Break Up Da\u2019 has a rock music feel to it.\u201d\n\nKiruthiga calls her film a contemporary love story; ask her how she relates to it and the filmmaker says, \u201cI believe I\u2019m Gen Z (laughs). That\u2019s because I have kids who belong to the Gen Z and Gen Alpha category. Rahman sir does not fit into any of these categories and that\u2019s why he\u2019s still who he is in the industry. Likewise, I can have a relatable conversation with late teens because I like to think I\u2019m young (smiles).\u201d\n\nShe says instead of having any preconceived notions, writing scenes from the characters\u2019 shoes paves the way to a more organic story. \u201cFor example, a fight between a couple is the result of two different emotions from the man and the woman. The miscommunication which takes a toll on the sync they usually have is often the reason and this happens regardless of the generation they belong to. People have been falling in love for centuries; literary works from hundreds of years ago mentioning the feelings of those in love resonate with us even today. Love is a timeless concept but what\u2019s changing is the way we look at it along with developments in society, technology and the mentality of the women who are rising from years of oppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am someone who writes to be happy and stress-free in life,\u201d says the filmmaker who says her inspiration comes from true events when asked about her works being slice-of-life films. \u201cDeath, which was the core concept in Paper Rocket, is inevitable in everyone\u2019s life but we still go through pain and grief. That\u2019s why the series considers death a transition. It\u2019s philosophies that I use personally for peace and happiness and I think spill over to my writing. It doesn\u2019t mean I will keep doing only such films; I want to do a horror film based on a paranormal experience I had. I want to do a crime thriller and I also want to do a mass-commercial film soon.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview, Kiruthiga mentioned Mani Ratnam and David Fincher as her favourite directors. Prod her why many of our filmmakers box themselves within a genre and Kiruthiga says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a style so I have the liberty to experiment with genres. I still have a lot to learn. Some experienced filmmakers can easily go out of the box and surprise us with a film. Mani sir gave us Ponniyin Selvan and is working on Thug Life though he was taking feel-good dramas just before that. Nolan is also making everything from a biopic like Oppenheimer to films like Interstellar and the Batman movies.\u201d\n\nDespite debuting in 2013, Kadhalikka Neramillai is Kiruthiga\u2019s third feature film but the director feels she has always been working. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m constantly writing even when I\u2019m not shooting. In fact, there are only a few filmmakers who make films periodically as many take time. I want to tell my story in the best way possible so I want to take my time for it to work. With the extra time, I write, so when a film of mine releases, I\u2019m already ready for my next film with the bound script. I would rather sincerely do a film and not beat myself up if it does not work out, rather than rush into a film. What takes time is casting, getting their dates and finding a production house.\u201d Interestingly, Kiruthiga says her home banner Red Giant Movies bankrolling Kadhalikka Neramillai is not as easy as others might assume. \u201cThey wanted to do this film because they saw Paper Rocket and wanted to take this one up considering the talents I brought to the table and the business aspect of it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of business, the conversation veers towards the deficit of women storytellers in Tamil cinema. \u201cThat\u2019s something I often wonder about. Half of my team comprises women. In the world of OTT, it\u2019s the women who are on top management. Even though I did not intentionally look for it, most of the HODs in my film turned out to be women and we only chose people based on their talents. When we are working, the gender never matters. I feel we are the crux of the change,\u201d says Kiruthiga, who adds that persistence and resilience go a long way. \u201cSometimes I feel like giving up but the next day I work with twice the vigour because I want my story to be heard. The film industry has always been tougher for women but today there are more female technicians than before and that\u2019s progress. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing more in the years to come,\u201d signs off Kiruthiga who is simultaneously working on a web series and a film.\n\nKadhalikka Neramillai releases in theatres on January 14, 2025"

            "article_content": "When Jin Yi (Jeanie) Tan told the school children she was supervising for a science outreach programme \u2018you can collect anything you want\u2019, she didn\u2019t expect one to bring in goose droppings. She also wasn\u2019t expecting the programme to lead them to a new cytotoxic peptide.\n\nTan, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Brian Murphy\u2019s lab from the University of Illinois Chicago, US, leads a team of researchers in an outreach collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, one of the city\u2019s oldest youth development organisations. With 21 locations, and 20,000 young members, the clubs provide resources and support to aid members\u2019 personal and professional development. So far the team has worked with two local branches: the Bartlett J McCartin club and the James R Jordan club, the latter of which is named after Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan\u2019s late father.\n\nThe 14-week after-school programme, termed the Chicago antibiotic discovery lab, offers middle school students (aged 11\u201313 ) from underrepresented communities, a hands-on learning experience searching for potential antibiotics in their own neighbourhoods . Funded by the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant that Tan received for her PhD, the programme teaches the fundamentals of microbiology research, from sample collection to laboratory analysis. Students are also introduced to environmental issues, engineering, robotics and related careers. \u2018We\u2019ve done four different cohorts of this programme, constantly tweaking stuff to make things better,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018One of our strengths is that the programme is very small, allowing us to give one-to-one mentoring and tailor the work to the students\u2019 interests.\u2019\n\nSemi-automated\n\nTan\u2019s PhD project focusses on finding new antibiotics to combat multi-drug resistance by harnessing antimicrobial toxins secreted by other bacteria. She has developed a pipeline for screening bioactive compounds from the natural environment, \u2018integrating things like robotics, bioassays and bioinformatics to create a streamlined workflow\u2019, she explains. This approach simplifies the initial stages of microbial drug discovery by allowing steps to be carried out in a semi-automated manner, making it safe and accessible enough to be taught to middle school students. \u2018The researchers were very good at mentoring the students \u2026 [the students] were constantly supervised and because of the robotics, had no interaction with hazardous bacteria,\u2019 adds Jonathon Rodriguez, the technology program manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.\n\nThe mentor team encourages students to carry out each stage of the process autonomously \u2013 instilling a sense of ownership over their results. While some students collect samples from lake water or flowers, others get more creative, swabbing everything from air conditioning filters to playground slides. \u2018The kids are always collecting the weirdest stuff t hey can find,\u2019 says Tan.\n\nStudents then program a robot to isolate the bacterial colonies grown from their samples and test the ability of each one to prevent the growth of multi-drug resistant bacteria. \u2018At first when they look at the environmental bacteria plates, they are really grossed out,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018But after five minutes, they\u2019ll be looking really closely? Like \u201cwait, what\u2019s this one? Why is this one pink?\u201d It\u2019s exciting for them to be able to understand microbiology and that they can produce medicines.\u2019\n\nTan successfully isolated a new anti-bacterial compound from Pseudomonas idahonensis, a bacterium cultured from the goose dropping sample. It turned out to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that they named orfamide N . Using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis she elucidated the structure of the new bioactive molecule. It comprises 10 mixed D- and L-amino acids and a distinct lipid tail, which sets it apart from other known orfamides and is thought to contribute to its biological activity. While the peptide demonstrated minimal antibacterial activity, it showed cytotoxicity in bioassays against human cancer cell lines, warranting further investigation in its application for cancer therapy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really happy and grateful that I was able to merge two big interests of mine and showed that this can happen. Biomedical research and Stem outreach can lead to a publication ,\u2019 says Tan. The research, published in the journal ACS Omega, lists the the student who collected the goose dropping sample as a co-author, underscoring their integral role in this discovery. \u2018The student was really excited about it,\u2019 adds Rodriguez.\n\nAs the project continues into its third year, the team hopes its approach can serve as a model for university\u2013community partnerships elsewhere. \u2018There is often a disconnect between a university and the neighbouring communities it should serve,\u2019 says Murphy. \u2018Both teams are learning about one another and building trust, and that barrier that typically exists between university and community is being systematically broken down.\u2019"

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

This has been described as AI with greater-than-human capabilities.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s current suite of products has a vast array of capabilities, Altman said that superintelligence will enable users to perform \u201canything else.\u201d He highlights accelerating scientific discovery as the primary example, which, he believes, will lead to the betterment of society.\n\n\u201cThis sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. That\u2019s alright\u2014we\u2019ve been there before and we\u2019re OK with being there again,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe change of direction has been spurred by Altman\u2019s confidence in his company now knowing \u201chow to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is typically defined as a system that matches human capabilities, whereas superintelligence exceeds them.\n\nSEE: OpenAI\u2019s Sora: Everything You Need to Know\n\nAltman has eyed superintelligence for years \u2014 but concerns exist\n\nOpenAI has been referring to superintelligence for several years when discussing the risks of AI systems and aligning them with human values. In July 2023, OpenAI announced it was hiring researchers to work on containing superintelligent AI.\n\nThe team would reportedly devote 20% of OpenAI\u2019s total computing power to training what they call a human-level automated alignment researcher to keep future AI products in line. Concerns around superintelligent AI stem from how such a system could prove impossible to control and may not share human values.\n\n\u201cWe need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us,\u201d wrote OpenAI Head of Alignment Jan Leike and co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in a blog post at the time.\n\nSEE: OpenAI and Anthropic Sign Deals With U.S. AI Safety Institute\n\nBut, four months after creating the team, another company post revealed they \u201cstill (did) not know how to reliably steer and control superhuman AI systems\u201d and didn\u2019t have a way of \u201cpreventing (a superintelligent AI) from going rogue.\u201d\n\nIn May, OpenAI\u2019s superintelligence safety team was disbanded and several senior personnel left due to the concern that \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\u201d including Jan Leike and the team\u2019s co-lead Ilya Sutskever. The team\u2019s work was absorbed by OpenAI\u2019s other research efforts, according to Wired.\n\nDespite this, Altman highlighted the importance of safety to OpenAI in his blog post. \u201cWe continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications.\u201d\n\nThe path to superintelligence may still be years away\n\nThere is disagreement about how long it will be until superintelligence is achieved. The November 2023 blog post said it could develop within a decade. But nearly a year later, Altman said it could be \u201ca few thousand days away.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brent Smolinski, IBM VP and global head of Technology and Data Strategy, said this was \u201ctotally exaggerated,\u201d in a company post from September 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re even in the right zip code for getting to superintelligence,\u201d he said.\n\nAI still requires much more data than humans to learn a new capability, is limited in the scope of capabilities, and does not possess consciousness or self-awareness, which Smolinski views as a key indicator of superintelligence.\n\nHe also claims that quantum computing could be the only way we might unlock AI that surpasses human intelligence. At the start of the decade, IBM predicted that quantum would begin to solve real business problems before 2030.\n\nSEE: Breakthrough in Quantum Cloud Computing Ensures its Security and Privacy\n\nAltman predicts AI agents will join the workforce in 2025\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions or make decisions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads.\n\nTechRepublic predicted at the end of the year that the use of AI agents will surge in 2025. Altman echoes this in his blog post, saying \u201cwe may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies.\u201d\n\nSEE: IBM: Enterprise IT Facing Imminent AI Agent Revolution\n\nAccording to a research paper by Gartner, the first industry agents to dominate will be software development. \u201cExisting AI coding assistants gain maturity, and AI agents provide the next set of incremental benefits,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nBy 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, according to the Gartner paper. A fifth of online store interactions and at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be conducted by agents by that year.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Sam Altman wrote a blog post about his experience running OpenAI on Sunday.\n\nAltman said OpenAI would have fallen apart in 2023 without Ron Conway's and Brian Chesky's help.\n\nThat was the year Altman was briefly ousted and then reinstated as OpenAI's CEO.\n\nOpenAI would have fallen apart back in 2023 without venture capitalist Ron Conway and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, Sam Altman wrote in a blog post on Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nAltman expressed his gratitude to Conway and Chesky in a blog post titled \"Reflections,\" which detailed his brief ouster from OpenAI. Altman said the post was inspired by a recent interview he gave to Bloomberg, which was published on Sunday as well.\n\n\"Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and beyond the call of duty that I'm not even sure how to describe it,\" Altman wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAltman was fired as OpenAI's CEO on November 17, 2023. The company's board said in a statement that it was removing Altman because he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board\" but did not elaborate further.\n\nAltman returned as CEO on November 22, 2023, after nearly all of OpenAI's staff threatened to quit if he wasn't reinstated.\n\nIn his blog post, Altman said \"there were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work\" to help him and OpenAI when he was ousted, but Conway and Chesky \"stood out from all others.\"\n\nAD\n\n\"I've of course heard stories about Ron's ability and tenaciousness for years and I've spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice,\" Altman wrote.\n\n\"But there's nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do,\" he continued. \"I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done.\"\n\nConway and Chesky, Altman wrote, gave him \"great advice\" and \"stopped me from making several mistakes.\" The pair also tapped on their vast networks to assist him, Altman added.\n\nAD\n\n\"I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did,\" Altman wrote. \"But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Conway and Chesky did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nConway and Chesky are longtime friends of Altman and were one of the first people he called after OpenAI fired him.\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam & Greg or all the builders in OpenAI. \u2014 Ron Conway (@RonConway) November 18, 2023\n\nConway was also one of Altman's guest speakers when the latter taught a class on startups at Stanford University in 2014.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAltman and Chesky's friendship, meanwhile, goes back more than a decade. Altman mentored Chesky when Airbnb was a part of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator.\n\nWhen Altman was fired from OpenAI, he briefly considered launching another AI startup but was discouraged by Conway and Chesky, The New York Times reported in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"You should be willing to fight back at least a little more,\" Chesky told Altman, per The Times.\n\nOpenAI's board, Conway later told Time magazine, had fired Altman for \"nitpicky, unfireable, not even close to fireable offenses.\"\n\nThe billionaire venture capitalist had spoken to the magazine as part of a profile on Altman that was published in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"It is reckless and irresponsible for a board to fire a founder over emotional reasons,\" Conway told the outlet."

Excavating just one of the coffins in their way was no small feat, either. According to the England\u2019s National Highways department announcement on January 6th, the largely intact stone casket weighed as much as \u201can adult male polar bear.\u201d For those unsure about that exact unit of measurement, that puts the coffin at around 1,650 lbs.\n\n\u201cWhile our main focus has been on building a road to improve journeys for road users, it\u2019s been extremely satisfying to play a part in uncovering such an unusual archaeological find,\u201d said Chris Griffin, the National Highways east region program leader.\n\nThe coffin weighs roughly 1,650 lbs. Credit: National Highways\n\nWhile a sovereign state today, a large portion of the UK once composed the Roman territory of Britannia. Julius Caesar initially invaded the island in 55 and 54 BCE during the Gallic Wars, but it wasn\u2019t until Claudius\u2019 reign that a much larger campaign commenced. Rome officially annexed the province of Britannia in 43 CE before ruling over the region for roughly the next 400 years. This means that locals likely buried the large stone coffin towards the end of Roman occupation following almost a half-century of cultural exchange and improvements made to Britain\u2019s agriculture, architecture, urban planning, and industry. One of the most notable Roman additions to the area was a vast network of roads connecting much of the territory. Despite their immense influence, however, only an estimated 800 Latin words were ultimately incorporated into Common Brittonic by the time of Rome\u2019s withdrawal from the island. The vast majority of the proto-English language remained firmly intertwined with its Germanic origins.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to Archeology News, a team of 50 archeologists and 20 civil engineers spent seven months excavating 17 different sites along the roadway. Many of these discoveries will be showcased in the new season of Digging for Britain. The first episode\u2014which includes the polar bear-sized casket\u2014will premiere on BBC 2 on January 7th."

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Crooks start most payments fraud by trying to figure out if the crime is actually worth the effort, sending small probes to see if there is enough money to steal. Stripe contends there is a way to gain the upper hand by leaning on machine learning.\n\nThe payments company says the technology has reduced a type of attack called \"card testing\" by 80% in the past two years. That has come as Stripe's yearly payment volume has grown from about $500 billion to more than $1 trillion during that time, a jump in payments activity that theoretically makes card testing easier.\n\nCrooks use card testing to measure how valuable a stolen card can be by making small phony payments, usually a couple of dollars or less, trying to bury a fraudulent transaction in a sea of legitimate payments, where it's less likely to be noticed.\n\nIf these payments go through without being flagged, the fraudsters then make incrementally larger purchases, relying on the initial \"test\" payments that have beaten a company's fraud guard to pave the way for larger theft.\n\n\"Card testing is where most fraud begins,\" said Emily Sands, head of information at Stripe, where she is responsible for leading a department that develops uses for data in decision-making and automation. \"Bad actors try to get to which cards can be used in the future.\"\n\n\n\nAdministering the exam\n\nCard testing is the most prevalent type of payment fraud, according to Chargebacks 911 .\n\nWhile the losses due to card testing alone are minimal, the technique is a gateway to $205 billion in e-commerce fraud in the first half of the 2020s, according to Juniper Research , which stresses the importance of determining the validity of a payment as key to halting deeper crime.\n\n\"It's a big threat and challenging to detect,\" Sands said. \"Crooks are clever. They hide attacks in businesses that make or receive lots of payments. The record of payments in this case may not look as spiky as for a business or small company. So there's not a sudden shift in the pace of transactions.\"\n\nThere are two major types of card tests. A verification attack involves a crook trying to make small purchases on stolen card accounts to see which ones have been canceled or expired. An enumeration attack, which is gaining steam as crooks use more sophisticated technology, involves \"guessing\" at card numbers in a rapid-fire manner to spot active cards and to circumvent the cards' blocking function.\n\nStripe uses machine learning, or a form of artificial intelligence, to estimate the overall prevalence of card testing on its platform, which enables the company to update its risk systems daily. The payment company additionally uses machine learning to estimate where card testing is likely to be taking place, such as businesses, issuers or a type of purchase or payment. This helps determine if a \"rush\" of transactions are card testing or a spike in payments due to a marketing campaign, for instance.\n\nOther tests include vetting individual transactions to spot signs of card testing. This technology enables Stripe to label breakthroughs, or \"successful\" card tests. That is combined with intelligence from new attack types, analyses that spot fraud patterns and manual reviews. This produces a set of transactions or transaction types that are labeled card-testing fraud, which is then fed into machine-learning models for rapid training using an engineering platform.\n\n\"Crooks are constantly changing methods,\" Sands said. \"Machine learning enables rapid retraining to spot new attack methods. \"This detection adds new features that get fed back into the AI model.\"\n\n\n\nRise of the machines\n\nWhile card testing has existed for years, it has increased over the past few years in concert with the economic crisis that accompanied the Covid-19 pandemic, which also catalyzed a rapid expansion in online payments. That has attracted payment and technology companies to develop products designed to halt the attacks. Verifi sells tools that help merchants adjust credit card authorization response messages, which can combat card testing. It also offers card verification value checks as well as geolocation and biometric analysis. Another Verifi product uses new 3D Secure protocols that are designed for digital commerce. JPMorgan Chase , Kount and Chargebacks 911 also offer services to mitigate card testing fraud.\n\nFirms are increasingly using large language models, or an advanced form of AI that's better at deciphering text, to detect similar intent, word usage and patterns in any textual fields of transactions such as disputes, chargebacks, etc. across different transactions, according to Andras Cser, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. The emerging technology also includes using machine learning and algorithms to parse large amounts of merchant and issuer data, he said.\n\n\"This is the motivation for Visa to acquire Featurespace ,\" Cser said.\n\nBattling card testing fraud is a great application for machine learning and advanced data management, according to David Mattei, strategic advisor for the fraud and anti-money-laundering practice at Datos Insights.\n\n\"The one thing in common I see with these newer card testing detection solutions is that they are coming from industry players considered to be at the network level,\" Mattei said, adding these firms view card authorization traffic across many merchants and financial institutions. Due to the nature of card testing, it is very helpful to have that 50,000 foot perspective to detect card testing attacks. Stripe is in a good position to offer this kind of solution.\"\n\n"

In the case of Microsoft and AI, that's not something being considered, as the software giant plans on spending $80 billion dollars on machine learning technology this year.\n\nMicrosoft casually dropped the monstrously huge sum of money in a long-winded blog by Brad Smith, Vice Chair & President of Microsoft, titled ' The Golden Opportunity for American AI ' (via The Register ). It starts by making it clear that AI is very much the number one focus right now, and that advances in AI technology and infrastructure need to continue. Microsoft also wants to promote training programs to get more people working in the field and it also wants America, as a whole, to export its AI systems to \"allies and friends.\"\n\nTo ensure all this happens, \"Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.\"\n\nThat kind of money makes the $10 billion it invested in OpenAI , back in 2023, seem like chump change. It's equivalent to almost all of Microsoft's net income in 2024. I know ridiculously large sums of money and AI just seem to be the norm these days, but $80 billion really is bonkers.\n\nNo company would spend that kind of money, though, if it didn't have a clear plan on how to recoup the investment and make a decent return from it. So what can we expect to see from Microsoft in this regard?\n\nIn its most recent financial statement, CEO Satya Nadella notes that \"[our] growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365\" and that \"digital transformation and adoption of AI continues to revolutionize more business workstreams for organizations in every sector across the globe.\"\n\nIn other words, since AI is already front-and-centre in every software package that Microsoft makes right now, one should expect to see it being promoted even more so. If you were hoping that the lacklustre sales of AI-ready PCs would mean the end of Copilot and Recall, then you're going to be disappointed.\n\nThe blog also talks about how Microsoft expects AI to eventually become another GPT or general-purpose technology because AI will apparently just be like electricity, ironworking, and computer chips in the same way they've \"boost[ed] innovation and productivity across the economy.\" To me, that sounds like Microsoft wants its Azure AI service to be ubiquitous in the business world, with every company tapping into its machine learning subscription services.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The year 2024 marked a grim milestone in global geopolitics, with armed conflicts proliferating at an alarming rate. From Ukraine to Sudan, Gaza to Myanmar, the world has become a theatre of unresolved disputes and escalating violence. With over 50 nations embroiled in active conflicts, the economic toll of these crises has created ripple effects far beyond the borders of war-torn regions.\n\nThe Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) reveals a 25% surge in political violence globally in 2024, with 223,000 fatalities recorded and one in eight people directly exposed to conflict. These figures highlight not only the human cost but also the economic strain borne by nations already teetering on the edge of collapse. As conflicts evolve, their economic consequences are reshaping regional and global dynamics in unprecedented ways.\n\nThe Economic Toll of Modern Warfare\n\nWars have historically devastated national economies, but the interconnected nature of today\u2019s global economy magnifies their impact. Ukraine, locked in a protracted struggle against Russian aggression, has seen its GDP contract by 29%. The energy infrastructure targeted in coordinated attacks has left millions without power, further exacerbating an already dire economic situation. Meanwhile, the ongoing blockade and aerial bombardments in Gaza have resulted in estimated losses exceeding $4 billion, crippling any semblance of economic recovery.\n\nSudan offers a stark example of a nation in freefall. Since April 2023, the civil war has displaced over 12 million people, disrupted agricultural production, and pushed half the population into acute food insecurity. The war\u2019s regional spillover, particularly in Chad and South Sudan, is overwhelming local economies already burdened by refugee influxes.\n\nIn Myanmar, the economic repercussions of the military coup in 2021 continue to reverberate. The country has devolved into a patchwork of conflict zones, with armed groups vying for control over natural resources. The resulting instability has stifled foreign investment and trade, relegating Myanmar to economic stagnation.\n\nGlobal Ripples: The Conflict-Driven Economy\n\nBeyond the immediate devastation, these conflicts are reshaping the global economic order. Energy markets have been particularly volatile, with the war in Ukraine spiking oil and gas prices in Europe and beyond. Food insecurity has also escalated, as disruptions in Ukrainian and Sudanese agricultural exports ripple through global supply chains. The Sahel, a key region for global counterterrorism and economic partnerships, faces increasing instability, threatening resource extraction and trade routes critical to European and African economies.\n\nHumanitarian aid, often underfunded, has become a pivotal economic variable. The United Nations estimates that 305 million people will require assistance in 2025. Yet, donor fatigue and competing priorities are straining the international community\u2019s capacity to respond. This funding gap perpetuates a vicious cycle: inadequate aid fosters deeper economic despair, fueling further instability.\n\nThe Geopolitical Dimensions of Conflict\n\nThe intensification of global conflicts also reflects shifting geopolitical alignments. In the Middle East, the war between Hamas and Israel has drawn regional actors into a polarized standoff. Iran\u2019s support for proxy groups, coupled with Saudi Arabia\u2019s cautious engagement in diplomacy, highlights the economic stakes tied to resource access and security guarantees.\n\nSouth Asia, a region often overshadowed by larger global crises, has also witnessed rising tensions. Speculations regarding Bangladesh\u2019s alleged preparations for military action against India have raised concerns about an unanticipated conflict in one of the world\u2019s most densely populated regions. While unverified, such developments underscore the fragility of peace in areas of historical contention.\n\nToward a New Economic Paradigm\n\nThe economic impact of conflicts is no longer confined to war zones; it is a global phenomenon. The interconnectedness of financial systems, energy markets, and supply chains ensures that violence anywhere is felt everywhere. This new reality demands innovative approaches to conflict resolution and economic resilience.\n\nFirst, targeted investments in conflict-prone regions could preempt instability. Infrastructure projects that integrate local economies into global trade networks, coupled with job creation initiatives, can serve as deterrents to violence. Second, international frameworks must adapt to ensure that humanitarian aid is not just reactive but preemptive, addressing the root causes of displacement and deprivation.\n\nFinally, diplomacy must prioritize economic interdependence as a tool for conflict prevention. The European Union\u2019s reliance on Ukrainian agricultural exports and Africa\u2019s energy potential highlight the mutual benefits of stability. Aligning these economic imperatives with security strategies could redefine how nations engage with fragile states.\n\nWill a New Year See Peace?\n\nAs 2025 begins, the specter of conflict looms large over the global economic landscape. The interplay between wars and economies is as old as civilization itself, but today\u2019s challenges are uniquely interconnected. Whether in the streets of Kyiv, the camps of Darfur, or the alleys of Gaza, the cost of conflict is borne not only by those directly involved but by a world increasingly shaped by its fallout. Addressing this requires bold, collective action that balances immediate relief with long-term economic vision\u2014an endeavor as complex as it is essential."

Crude oil has fallen from as much as .46 gallons per person, which was quite common before the pandemic, to close to .42 gallons per person recently (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. World crude oil production per person, based on data of the US EIA. Data through September 2024.\n\nPeople have a misimpression regarding how world peak oil can be expected to behave. The world economy has continued to grow, but now it is beginning to move in the direction of contraction due to an inadequate supply of crude oil. In fact, it is not just an inadequate crude oil supply, but also an inadequate supply of coal (per person) and an inadequate supply of uranium.\n\nWe know that when a boat changes direction, this causes turbulence in the water. This is similar to the problems we are currently seeing in the world economy. Physics dictates that the economy needs to shrink in size to match its energy resources, but no country wants to be a part of this shrinkage. This indirectly leads to major changes in elected leadership and to increased interest in war-like behavior. Strangely enough, it also seems to lead to higher long-term interest rates, as well.\n\nIn this post, I share a few thoughts on what might lie ahead for us in 2025, in the light of the hidden inadequate world energy supply. I am predicting major turbulence, but not that things fall apart completely. Stock markets will tend to do poorly; interest rates will remain high; oil and other energy prices will stay around current levels, or fall.\n\n[1] I expect that the general trend in 2025 will be toward world recession.\n\nWith less oil (and coal and uranium) relative to population, the world can be expected to produce fewer goods and services per person. In some sense, people will generally become poorer. For example, fewer people will be able to afford new cars or new homes.\n\nThis trend toward lower purchasing-power tends to be concentrated in certain groups such as young people, farmers, and recent immigrants. As a result, older people who are well-off or firmly established may be able to mostly ignore this issue.\n\nWhile the shift toward a poorer world has partially been hidden, it has been a huge factor in allowing Donald Trump to be voted back into power. Major shifts in leadership are taking place elsewhere, as well, as an increasing share of citizens become unhappy with the current situation.\n\n[2] Many governments will try to hide recessionary tendencies by issuing more debt to stimulate their economies.\n\nIn the past, adding debt was found to be effective way of stimulating the world economy because energy supplies supporting the world economy were not seriously constrained. It was possible to add new energy supplies, quite inexpensively. The combination of additional inexpensive energy supplies and additional \u201cdemand\u201d (provided by the added debt) allowed the total quantity of goods and services produced to be increased. Once energy supplies started to become seriously constrained (about 2023), this technique started to work far less well. If energy production is constrained, the likely impact of added debt will be added inflation.\n\nThe problem is that if added government debt doesn\u2019t really add inexpensive energy, it will instead create more purchasing power relative to the same number, or a smaller number, of finished goods and services available. I believe that in 2025, we are heading into a situation where ramping up governmental debt will mostly lead to inflation in the cost of finished goods and services.\n\n[3] Energy prices are likely to remain too low for fossil fuel and uranium producers to raise investments from their current low levels.\n\nRecession and low prices tend to go together. While there may be occasional spikes in oil and other energy prices, 2025 is likely to bring oil and other energy prices that are, on average, no higher than those of 2024, adjusted for the overall increase in prices due to inflation. With generally low prices, producers will cut back on new investment. This will cause production to fall further.\n\n[4] I expect \u201cgluts\u201d of many energy-related items in 2025.\n\nGluts are related to recession and low prices for producers. The underlying problem is that a significant share of the population finds that finished goods, made with energy products and investment at current interest rates, are too expensive to buy.\n\nEven farmers are affected by low prices, just as they were back at the time of the Great Depression. We can think of food as an energy product that is eaten by people. Farmers find that their return on farm investment is too low, and that their implied wages are low. Low income for farmers around the world feeds back through the system as low buying power for new farm equipment, and for buying goods and services in general.\n\nIn 2025, I expect there will be a glut of crude oil due to a lack of purchasing power of many poor people around the world. My forecast is similar to the forecast of the IEA that predicts an oversupply of oil in 2025. Also, a December 2024 article in mining.com says, \u201cA glut of coal in China is set to push falling prices even lower.\u201d\n\nEven wind turbines and solar panels can reach an oversupply point. According to one article, number of Chine solar panel builders seems to be far too high for world demand, leading to a potential shake out. As the share of wind and solar power added to the electric grid increases, the frequency of low or negative payment for wholesale electric power increases. This makes adding more wind turbines and solar panels problematic, after a certain point. We don\u2019t yet have a cost-effective way of storing intermittent electricity for months on end. This seems to be part of the reason why there recently were no bidders for producing more offshore wind power in Denmark.\n\n[5] I expect long-term interest rates to remain high. This will be a problem for new investments of all kinds and for governmental borrowing.\n\nIn Section 2 of this post, I tried to explain that a peak-oil impact is likely to be inflation. This occurs because ramping up debt to try to stimulate the economy no longer works to get additional cheap energy products from the ground. Instead of getting as many finished goods and services as hoped for, the added debt tends to produce inflation instead.\n\nI believe that we are reaching a stage of fossil-fuel depletion where it is becoming increasingly difficult to ramp up production, even with added investment. Because of the added debt added in an attempt to work around depletion, inflation in the price of finished goods and services can be expected. Investors are beginning to see long-term inflation as a likely problem. As a result, they are starting to demand higher long-term interest rates to compensate for the expected decrease in buying power.\n\nFigure 2. Interest rates on 10-year US Treasury Securities, in a chart by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Data is through December 30, 2024.\n\nFigure 2 shows that US long-term interest rates have varied widely. There was a period of generally dropping long-term interest rates from 1981 to 2020. Starting in late 2020, interest rates began to rise; in 2023 and 2024 they have been in the 4% to 5% range. These relatively high rates are occurring because lenders are demanding higher long-term interest rates in response to higher inflation rates.\n\nBecause of inflationary pressures, I expect that long-term interest rates will tend to stay at today\u2019s high level in 2025; they may even rise further. These continued high interest rates will become a problem for many families wanting to purchase a home because US home mortgage rates rise and fall with US 10-year interest rates. Often families are faced with both high home prices and high interest rates. This combination makes mortgage costs a problem for many families.\n\nGovernments are also adversely affected. They tend to hold large amounts of debt that they have accumulated over a period or years. Up until 2020, much of this added debt often was at a very low interest rate. As more long-term debt at higher interest rates is added, annual interest rate payments tend to rise rapidly. This can cause a need to raise taxes. Japan, especially, would be affected by higher interest rates because of its high level of government debt, relative to GDP.\n\nHigher interest rates will also raise costs for citizens trying to finance the purchase of homes, and for investors wanting to build wind turbines or solar panels. In fact, investment in any kind of factory, pipelines, or electricity transmission will tend to become more expensive.\n\nIn a sense, we seem to be seeing the peak oil problem shifting in a way that affects interest rates and the economy in general. Either higher interest rates or higher oil prices will tend to push the economy toward recession. We tend to look for rising prices to signal an oil supply problem, but perhaps that only works when there is excessive demand. If the problem is really inadequate oil supply, perhaps we should look for higher long-term interest rates, instead.\n\n[6] Industry around the world is likely to be hit especially hard by recessionary tendencies.\n\nIndustry requires investment. Higher interest rates make new industrial investment more expensive. Industry is also a heavy user of energy products. Putting these observations together, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise if new industrial investment is one of the first places to be cut back because of peak oil supply.\n\nFigure 3. Expected world industrial output, based on calculations I made with using industrial output and population forecasts from detailed output data provided with the article Recalibration of limits to growth: An update of the World3 model\u201d by Arjuna Nebel et al.\n\nThe original 1972 Limits to Growth analysis, in its base model, suggested that resources would start to run short about now. The variables in this model were recently recalibrated in the article, \u201cRecalibration of limits to growth: An update of the World3 model.\u201d Based on the detailed data given in the endnotes to the article, I calculated the expected industrialization per capita shown in Figure 3.\n\nBased on Figure 3, this model shows that industrialization per person reached a peak in 2017. Peak industrialization (total, not per capita) occurred in 2018, which coincides with peak crude oil extraction (not per capita).\n\nThe model seems to suggest that after an inflection point in 2023 (that is 2024 and after), industrialization will start to fall more steeply. The model shows a decrease in production per capita of 4.1% in 2024 and of 5.3% in 2025. Such decreases would push the world economy toward recession.\n\nThe model suggests that people, on average, are getting poorer in terms of the quantity of goods and services they can afford to buy. New cars, motorcycles, and homes are becoming less affordable. Heavily industrialized countries, such as China, South Korea, and Germany are likely to be especially affected by headwinds to industrialization. I expect that the economic problems in these countries will continue and are likely to worsen in 2025.\n\n[7] The US has tried to isolate itself from this nearly worldwide recession. I expect that during 2025, the US will increasingly slip into recession, as well.\n\nThere are several reasons for this belief:\n\n(a) The US is heavily dependent upon imports of raw material. China is restricting exports of critical minerals used by the US. This will make it very difficult or impossible to ramp up high tech industries as planned.\n\n(b) The US is heavily dependent on Russia for supplies of enriched uranium. Any plan for added nuclear electricity needs to consider where the uranium to power these plants will come from. It also needs to consider how this uranium will be enriched to the required concentration of uranium-235.\n\n(c) If the US can ramp up crude oil and natural gas production, this can perhaps counter this trend toward US and world recession. Unfortunately, recent US oil supply has not been ramping up; instead its production has been fairly flat. Natural gas production has actually been lower since February 2024. Plans have been made to rapidly ramp up US liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, but these plans cannot work if the US natural gas supply is already decreasing.\n\n(d) The US government has had an advantage in borrowing because the US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency. As such, the US is, in some sense, the first borrower, pulling the rest of the world along. The US, by making its short term interest rates higher than those of many other countries, was able to largely escape recession 2023 and 2024. Additional investment was attracted to the US by these higher interest rates. But the US cannot follow this strategy indefinitely. For one thing, a high US dollar handicaps exports. For another, interest costs on government debt become burdensome.\n\n(e) Donald Trump has plans to close inefficient parts of government. These changes, if enacted, will reduce \u201cdemand\u201d within the economy because workers in these sectors will lose their jobs. Over the longer term, these changes might be beneficial, but over the short term, they are likely to be recessionary.\n\n(f) It is difficult for the US to do much better than the rest of the world. If the rest of the world is in recession, the US will tend to head in that direction, as well.\n\n[8] I expect more conflict in 2025, but today\u2019s wars will not look much like World War I or World War II.\n\nToday, not many countries are able to build huge fleets of fighter airplanes. Even building drones and bombs seems to require supply lines that extend around the world. So, instead, wars are being fought in non-military ways, such as with sanctions and tariffs.\n\nI expect that this trend away from direct military conflict will continue, with more novel approaches such as internet interference and stealth damage to infrastructure taking place instead.\n\nI do not expect that nuclear bombs will be used, even when there is direct conflict between powerful adversaries. For one thing, uranium in these bombs is needed for other purposes. For another, there is too much chance of retaliation.\n\n[9] I expect many types of capital gains will be low in 2025.\n\nThe situation we are facing now is the opposite of the drop in long-term interest rates observed between 1981 and 2020, in Figure (2), above. This historical drop in interest rates made it possible for businesses to more easily finance new investments. It also made it possible for individual citizens to be able to afford more homes and cars. It should not be surprising that this period has been a time of rising stock market prices, especially in the United States.\n\nThe world\u2019s economic problem is that it no longer has the tailwind of falling long-term interest rates. Instead, rising long-term interest rates are becoming a headwind. Home prices are un-affordably high for most potential buyers at today\u2019s interest rates. A similar problem faces those hoping to purchase agricultural equipment and farmland at today\u2019s high prices and high interest rates.\n\nWe should not be surprised if home and farm prices stabilize and begin to fall. Prices of shares of stock are likely to encounter similar headwinds. Prices of derivative investments may perform even worse than the shares themselves.\n\nRecently, a great deal of the strength of the US market has been in a few stocks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) needs to very quickly provide a lot of benefit to the stock market as a whole for this to change. I cannot imagine this happening. With the US slipping toward recession, I expect that the US stock market will at best plateau in 2025.\n\n[10] With less energy available and higher interest rates on government debt, I expect to see more government organizations disbanding.\n\nIt takes energy, directly and indirectly, to operate any kind of governmental organization. Eliminating governmental organizations is one way of saving energy. This is what happened when the central government of the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. I would think that parallel kinds of changes could start happening in the next few years, in many parts of the world.\n\nAt some time, perhaps as soon as 2025, the European Union could collapse. If things are going badly for many member countries, they will be less willing to support the European Union with their tax revenues. Other organizations that seem like they could be in peril include NATO and the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn some ways, such shrinkage would be in parallel with Trump\u2019s plan for eliminating unnecessary governmental organizations within the United States. All these organizations require energy; cutting their number would go some way toward reducing crude oil and other energy consumption.\n\n[11] It is possible that the world economy will eventually get itself out of its apparent trend toward recession, but I am afraid this will happen long after 2025.\n\nWe know that the world economy tends to operate in cycles. We would like to believe that the apparent current down-cycle is just temporary, but we can\u2019t know this for sure. Physics tells us that we need energy supplies of the right kind for any action that contributes to GDP. Running short of energy supplies is therefore a very worrisome condition.\n\nWe also know that there are major inefficiencies in current approaches. For example, oil extraction leaves much of the oil resource in place. In theory, AI could greatly improve extraction techniques.\n\nWe also know that uranium consumption is terribly inefficient. M. King Hubbert thought that nuclear energy using uranium had amazing potential, but most of this potential remains untapped. Perhaps AI could help in this regard, also. If nothing else, perhaps recycling spent fuel could be made less expensive and problematic.\n\nWe can\u2019t know what lies ahead. There may be a \u201creligious\u201d ending to our current predicament that we are discounting that is actually the \u201cright story.\u201d Or there may be a \u201ctechnofix\u201d solution that allows us to avert collapse or catastrophe. But for now, how the current down-cycle will end remains a major cause for concern.\n\nBy Gail Tverberg via Our Finite World\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

When AI applications are ready to move from experimentation to production environments, the Nvidia AI Enterprise license provides enterprise-grade security, support and product releases of Nvidia AI software.\n\nAvailability\n\nProject Digits is coming around May.\n\nProject Digits will be available in May from Nvidia and top partners, starting at $3,000.\n\n\u201cBy making Llama models open source, we\u2019re committed to democratizing access to cutting-edge AI technology. With Project Digits, developers can harness the power of Llama locally, unlocking new possibilities for innovation and collaboration,\u201d said Ahmad Al-Dahle, Head of GenAI at Meta, in a statement.\n\n\u201cAdvancing AI requires tools that empower researchers to experiment at scale, speed and precision. Nvidia\u2019s Project Digits represents a significant leap forward. I\u2019m excited to see how 128GB in such a small form factor can advance the future of enterprise AI,\u201d said Silvio Savarese, Chief Scientist at Salesforce, in a statement.\n\n\u201cAt Hugging Face, we want to make it easy for developers to build their own AI. Nvidia\u2019s Project Digits will empower AI builders to build and run their own Gen AI models and systems at the edge. With 128GB of unified memory, AI builders can run 200B parameter models locally, and connect multiple Project Digits systems to scale from there. I can\u2019t wait to see what the Hugging Face community will build with Nvidia Project Digits,\u201d said Je Boudier, Head of Product at Hugging Face, in a statement.\n\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s Project Digits is a powerhouse you can hold in the palm of your hand. With two Project Digits units, developers can easily work with AI models up to 405B parameters in size. We can\u2019t wait to see the apps people will build with this,\u201d said Michael Chiang, cofounder of Ollama, in a statement."

It was one of the last refuges of the Anakim (literally, \u2018giants\u2019) in front of the conquering Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 11:22). Gath, a Philistine city, was either subdued during the days of the prophet Samuel, or by King David. The first book of Kings (2:39) states that in the time of King Solomon it was still ruled by a Philistine king named Achish (1 Samuel 27:1\u20137). The narrative in the first book of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 7:21) relates that Ezer and Elead, sons of Ephraim, were killed by men who were natives of Gath, because \u201cthey came down to take their livestock\u201d. In Hebrew, Kiryat Gat means \u201cthe place of the winepress\u201d.\n\nThe Israel Land Authority views this discovery as symbolic of the connection between past and future.\n\nDirector Yaacov Kvint commented: \"[the authority] invests tens of millions of shekels annually in salvage excavations for various projects across the country, aimed at uncovering and documenting the rich history and archaeology beneath the neighbourhoods of the future.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic floor will be relocated to an open area in the city and made accessible to the public.\n\n8 Included in these ten buildings is a monastery, which makes up a site which is thought to have functioned for 600 years Credit: Reuters\n\n8 A winepress was also discovered during the excavation Credit: Alamy"

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

Excavating just one of the coffins in their way was no small feat, either. According to the England\u2019s National Highways department announcement on January 6th, the largely intact stone casket weighed as much as \u201can adult male polar bear.\u201d For those unsure about that exact unit of measurement, that puts the coffin at around 1,650 lbs.\n\n\u201cWhile our main focus has been on building a road to improve journeys for road users, it\u2019s been extremely satisfying to play a part in uncovering such an unusual archaeological find,\u201d said Chris Griffin, the National Highways east region program leader.\n\nThe coffin weighs roughly 1,650 lbs. Credit: National Highways\n\nWhile a sovereign state today, a large portion of the UK once composed the Roman territory of Britannia. Julius Caesar initially invaded the island in 55 and 54 BCE during the Gallic Wars, but it wasn\u2019t until Claudius\u2019 reign that a much larger campaign commenced. Rome officially annexed the province of Britannia in 43 CE before ruling over the region for roughly the next 400 years. This means that locals likely buried the large stone coffin towards the end of Roman occupation following almost a half-century of cultural exchange and improvements made to Britain\u2019s agriculture, architecture, urban planning, and industry. One of the most notable Roman additions to the area was a vast network of roads connecting much of the territory. Despite their immense influence, however, only an estimated 800 Latin words were ultimately incorporated into Common Brittonic by the time of Rome\u2019s withdrawal from the island. The vast majority of the proto-English language remained firmly intertwined with its Germanic origins.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to Archeology News, a team of 50 archeologists and 20 civil engineers spent seven months excavating 17 different sites along the roadway. Many of these discoveries will be showcased in the new season of Digging for Britain. The first episode\u2014which includes the polar bear-sized casket\u2014will premiere on BBC 2 on January 7th."

Has solving a century-old paradox now undermined their existence?\n\n\u00a9 William Horton, William Horton Photography\n\nEvery now and then, it is worth pausing for a second and giving thanks to the many, ever so slightly different versions of you that exist in parallel realities. It is these alternative selves that help to keep these universes in balance.\n\nAt least, that is what\u2019s going on if you happen to subscribe to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. First proposed more than 65 years ago, the idea is that reality is constantly splitting off into parallel paths, due to subtle interactions at the level of quantum particles. Though it may boggle the mind, it also smooths over some devilishly tricky problems in physics and, for that reason, plenty of clear-eyed physicists believe it to be true.\n\nBut now this strange idea might be facing a huge challenge, thanks to physicists Sandu Popescu and Daniel Collins at the University of Bristol, UK. They initially set out to solve a 100-year-old puzzle in quantum theory, but ended up undermining the idea of parallel universes. \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially demolished one of the arguments for it,\u201d says Collins.\n\nIt might sound like a destabilising development, but it may actually prove to be a shot in the arm for quantum theory. Already, Popescu and Collins\u2019s work is helping to resolve other long-standing quantum paradoxes and, in the eyes of some theorists, it points to a fresh way of thinking about the cosmos as a singular quantum reality built from the inside out. \u201cThis is something deep and new. I think it could become really important,\u201d says Nicolas Gisin, who researches\u2026"
