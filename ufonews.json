        "article_content": "Many a horror franchise has been temporarily goosed by an injection of sci-fi \u2014 even the slasher at the center of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d series went into orbit in the 2001 \u201cJason X\u201d \u2014 but that element doesn\u2019t do a lot to distinguish \u201cV/H/S/Beyond.\u201d This seventh entry in the ersatz found-footage omnibus series should be another reliable draw for genre platform Shudder, where it begins streaming Oct. 4. And the ongoing overall enterprise continues to have value as a launching pad for up-and-coming talents. But despite its new thematic wrinkle, the five segments here feel familiar in ideas and unmemorable in execution. It\u2019s a middling addition to a variably inspired anthology brand that will no doubt trundle on through more installments yet.\n\nThe wraparound device, directed by Canadian documentarian Jay Cheel, mingles interviews with real-life UFO enthusiasts and skeptics, also throwing in passing mentions of highlights in the history of alleged abductions, plus clips from popular representations (including vintage drive-in camp \u201cEarth vs. the Flying Saucers\u201d). There\u2019s also a fictive element in discussing a man\u2019s disappearance from his family\u2019s home, leaving behind VHS tapes of a supposed \u201calien encounter\u201d that we finally see at the film\u2019s end.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe first three regular sequences are a little too alike, in that they all escalate quickly to frenzied, bloody action confused by the found-footage subgenre\u2019s usual hectic first-person camerawork. In Jordan Downey\u2019s \u201cStork,\u201d a squad of police raid a dilapidated house amid rampant baby kidnappings. Before finding what they\u2019re looking for, they must battle adults who\u2019ve basically turned into fast-moving zombies. Virit Pal\u2019s \u201cDream Girl\u201d has two paparazzi (Syandeep Sengupta and Rohan Joshi) sneaking onto a Mumbai film set, then into the trailer of \u201csuperstar Tara\u201d (Namrata Sheth) to snap some \u201ccandids.\u201d Alas, they discover a little too much about her, leading to another gory melee. Justin Martinez\u2019s \u201cLive and Let Dive\u201d finds skittish Zach (Bobby Slaski) coerced into skydiving with friends to mark his 30th birthday. Unfortunately, their plane gets caught between an alien spaceship and pursuing government aircraft, with the survivors facing related new perils once they\u2019ve crash-landed in an orchard below.\n\nEach is a bit better than the last, but these splattery scenarios nonetheless feel like the same thing in different settings \u2014 preliminary jitters, then carnage and monsters \u2014 only somewhat alleviated by the novelty of \u201cStork\u201d\u2019s surreal climactic attic tableau, \u201cGirl\u201d\u2019s Bollywood musical number, or \u201cDive\u201d\u2019s alarming creature design.\n\nThere is definitely a shift in approach with siblings Christian and Justin Long\u2019s \u201cFur Babies,\u201d but this more comedic miniature is also the collection\u2019s worst episode. Libby Letlow plays the gratingly chirpy proprietress for \u201cDoggy Dreamhouse,\u201d a canine boarding facility some animal rights activists suspect of being abusive. But when they send members incognito to spy on her, it turns out her harshest \u201ctraining\u201d is largely reserved for two-legged captives. Though it eventually tips towards silliness of a \u201cIsland of Dr. Moreau\u201d-esque stripe, the intended satire here of both simpering pet pamperers and PETA-style fanatics is painfully broad.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s actor Kate Siegel\u2019s latest collaboration with spouse Mike Flanagan, this one her first as director, while he is the writer. (They previously co-wrote the screenplay for his very good 2016 feature \u201cHush,\u201d in which she starred.) That definitely ups the expectations for \u201cStowaway,\u201d a slow burn with Alanah Pearce as Halley, a woman interviewing locals around \u201cknown UFO hotspot\u201d the Mohave Desert for a documentary \u2014 though whether she\u2019s sincerely interested or secretly ridiculing them, we\u2019re not sure.\n\nFlanagan\u2019s script offers this \u201cV/H/S\u201d entry\u2019s only stab at character nuance by hinting that our heroine arrived at this isolated place and task by having already burned every other bridge in her life. In any case, camping out one night, she investigates unusual lights in the distance, ultimately entering some kind of alien craft. But just what happens to her there is so murkily visualized (in sharpest contrast to the arguably over-sharp bodycam imagery in \u201cStork\u201d) that the segment just kind of floats off into fuzzy obscurity. Intriguing and frustrating in the general realm of \u201cSkinamarink\u201d\u2019s twilight-zone dread, it requires patience yet doesn\u2019t quite go anywhere definite enough to reward that effort fully.\n\nThe found-footage format can grow repetitious fast, and too much of \u201cBeyond\u201d degenerates into chaotic chase/attack set-pieces that feel interchangeable in their shaky cams and barely coherent action. The energy is high \u2026 but high energy can get monotonous, too. Actors running around screaming aren\u2019t all that effective (or convincing, as supposedly \u201creal\u201d people filming themselves) sans sufficient setup in terms of character involvement, ominous atmosphere or narrative engagement. While the individual conceits here are workable enough \u2014 even if two of them really have no connection to the ostensible UFO theme \u2014 nearly all head toward variations on the same shrill bloodbath, suggesting future \u201cV/H/S\u201d chapters might do better to re-focus on inventive writing rather than simply providing disparate excuses for gory mayhem.\n\nThat said, this competent if mostly forgettable effort\u2019s strongest elements are in exactly that department. Though their handiwork is often glimpsed too briefly, special makeup effects designer Patrick Magee and VFX supervisor Justin Martinez (both credited for the entire feature) contribute some vividly icky, grotesque images."

        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 sheds light on the controversial Roswell UFO crash incident of 1947. On one hand, the government allegedly covered up the truth by claiming that it was an experimental balloon aircraft that crashed. On the other hand, UFO enthusiasts believed that in addition to the crashing of an actual UFO, bodies of aliens were also recovered. The episode consists of in-depth interviews with some of the experts in the field, including Donald Schmitt, who shared his opinion on the subject.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Made Significant Contributions to UFO Research\n\nDonald Raymond Schmitt\u2019s journey to success was not short or easy. After graduating from Hartford Union High School, he earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree from Concordia University Wisconsin. He also attended Milwaukee Area Technical College for higher studies. Given his interest in UFOs and related subjects, he organized five archaeological dig projects at the 1947 Rowell crash site, with the first one in 1989. The next two digs came after more than a decade, in 2002, followed by 2006. The previous two digs were conducted in 2013 and 2016. His efforts were so impressive that the central theme of \u2018The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence\u2019 was based on the second dig.\n\nIn the 1970s, Donald used to work as a special investigator for the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the art director for the International UFO Reporter and the scientific consultant to the Air Force Project Blue Book. So, when the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in Chicago was founded, he became the Director of Special Investigations and retired from the post after serving for a decade. Apart from being a member of Holy Hill Basilica Choir, he was also the president of Hartford Community Chorus at some point. Donald was also employed at Bloom and Associates as an art director/consultant and at Stellar Productions. Formerly, he was also the Wisconsin State Director of MUFON.\n\nInterestingly, he also co-produced the 2020 documentary \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which centers on the unidentified aerial phenomenon. Starting in 2019, he is a co-founder of the International Coalition on Extraterrestrial Research (ICER), where he serves as the North American Representative. Furthermore, he is currently the co-founder of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. There, he is appointed as a board advisor and a lead investigator.\n\nThe Best-Selling Author\u2019s Debut Book is Now a Golden Globe-Nominated Movie\n\nDonald R. Schmitt has also dabbled in the field of writing and has authored several books. The former special investigator published his debut book, \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 in 1991, sharing the title of co-author with Kevin D. Randle. Chronicling the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, the book garnered several eyeballs and ended up getting adapted into a movie for the screen by Arthur L. Kopit and Jeremy Kagan for the latter\u2019s movie, \u2018Roswell.\u2019 Starring Kyle MacLachlan and Martin Sheen in pivotal roles, the 1994 film also earned a nomination for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at the Golden Globes in 1995. Interestingly, the Golden Globe nod is what Donald considers his most remarkable accomplishment in life.\n\nOver the years, he has made great strides in the world of writing by not only penning his observations in articles but also full-fledged books. Another of his books, \u2018Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up,\u2019 which he co-authored with Thomas J. Carey, sat on the throne of the top-selling UFO-themed book across the globe for two years \u2014 2007 and 2008. According to reports, Stellar Productions has optioned the book for the movie, \u2018Majic Men.\u2019 Donald has earned the title of best-selling author not once nor twice but seven times (author/co-author) for many of his titles, such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell,\u2019 \u2018Roswell: The Chronological Pictorial,\u2019 \u2018The Children of Roswell,\u2019 and \u2018Inside the Real Area 51.\u2019 Not just that, Donald has also graced the television screens to share his insight on all things UFO by featuring on \u2018Oprah,\u2019 \u2018CBS 48 Hours,\u2019 \u2018Larry King Live,\u2019 and many more.\n\nDonald Schmitt and His Wife Lead a Private Yet Fulfilling Married Life\n\nThough the professional life of Donald R Schmitt is in the public eye, the personal aspects are something he prefers to keep private. He has been blessed with the companionship of his lovely wife of many years, Marie, and together they have weaved a beautiful life with love, compassion, and understanding. The investigative author has never hesitated to profess his affection and gratitude for his wife for all the support and faith she has shown for and in him since they tied the knot.\n\nIn fact, a testament to that would be the heartwarming shout-out he gave the love of his life in the Acknowledgement section of his 2017 book, titled \u2018Cover-Up at Roswell: Exposing the 70-Year Conspiracy to Suppress the Truth.\u2019 It read: \u201cAnd finally, I will shout it from the highest roof that I am truly blessed with a wife who loves me for being me.\u201d Apart from the fact that his father passed on before his mother, Viola, not much is known about his familial life. As of writing, Donald and his wife seemingly reside in their peaceful ranch in the small community of Hubertus in Washington County, Wisconsin.\n\nRead More: Kevin Randle: Where is the Ufologist Now?"

        "article_content": "Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, \u2018CTRL\u2019 revolves around Nella Awasthi, a popular content creator whose social media relationship with her boyfriend, Joe Mascarenhas, comes to an end after she catches him cheating on her. Subsequently, Nella installs an AI app named CTRL that helps her erase Joe from her digital life. However, unbeknownst to her, the app takes rapid control over every aspect of her life, blurring the lines between reality and the virtual world.\n\nThe Netflix thriller presents a cerebral film that latches on to growing concerns within the modernizing digital world. With data, social media, and personal privacy colliding within the screenlife drama\u2019s plot, a grave and chilling account is presented with unflinching authenticity. It asks valid questions about individual awareness, the practices of the dark web, and how invasive technology can be when left unchecked and employed as a commodity. Therefore, the film\u2019s basis seems tied to prescient issues of the contemporary world and the reality faced by everyone with access to the internet. But is that really the case?\n\nCTRL Sheds Light on the Dark Side of Social Media\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is a fictional story penned by director Vikramaditya Motwane and co-writers Avinash Sampath and Sumukhi Suresh. The movie explores the pitfalls of social media culture through a gripping thriller storyline, punctuating it with incisive forays into the internet\u2019s toxic elements. While the story begins in a relatively happy place, it takes a slow descent into the issues plaguing ordinary people in relation to their digital interactions. Probing questions about authenticity are posed as the protagonist, Nella, finds herself living a lie in front of the camera but leading a completely different one offscreen. Additionally, the darkest aspects of the narrative come to the fore when an invasive AI begins exploiting the insecurities of human emotions through its own agendas.\n\nThe movie mainly examines the exploitative nature of social media and how memory, human emotion, and feelings can often get tied in a virtual setting, which often has no borders on its privacy. As people yearn for more, Nella finds herself catering to their needs by becoming the face of perfection but lacking the imperfections needed to sell reality. Director Vikramaditya stated that the film revolves around the concept of sharing oneself with the world without understanding the consequences that come from it. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2013 how much sharing is too much sharing and the dopamine hits likes and favourites give you. It\u2019s about how much you end up doing for social media. It\u2019s like a doomsday scenario and it\u2019s not impossible to believe this.\u201d\n\nCTRL is a Topical Thriller About the Commodification of Human Experience\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 derives most of its central tension from the battle between human free will and an authoritarian AI app that wants to dictate everything for its users. There is an Orwellian fantasy lurking in its premise. Parallels can be seen with how rapidly modernizing internet practices attempt to take away control from people\u2019s lives, particularly in the manner in which it preys on insecurities. It serves as the burning question of the film. Even Ananya Pandey, who plays Nella, chimed in on the topical concern by emphasizing how it can be particularly damaging for mostly the younger generation, who find themselves victim to a lot of seedy online elements and the mental challenges they pose at times.\n\nMemory also plays a major role in \u2018CTRL.\u2019 With most people\u2019s lives today stored in digital archives, a person\u2019s memories can be attached to their social media avatar. In the movie, this becomes a central topic and one that was inspired by other films. During the development process, the scriptwriters discussed the enduring legacy of \u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019 as a key influence, particularly in the manner in which it explores erasing a loved one from one\u2019s life. The same concept rears its head throughout the Netflix screenlife thriller. The director also revealed that the Spike Jonze-directed science fiction movie, \u2018Her,\u2019 had some influence over the writing. However, he hailed the Michel Gondry directorial as a masterpiece, even if it does not touch upon the topic of AI.\n\nThe Ctrl App is a Fictional AI Service With an Invasive Protocol\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is built around the futuristic service provided by the titular AI app that Nella installs on her laptop, which eventually takes control over her life. It is a made-up application conceived by the scriptwriters Vikramaditya Motwane, Avinash Sampath, and Sumukhi Suresh. While it is not based on any real-life apps, Vikramaditya stated that it would serve as an interesting reflection of how AI has become a major hot-button issue in today\u2019s society. \u201cGiven the conversations about AI, we realized that there was a lot more that we could say about social media, data and privacy in the guide of a straightforward thriller,\u201d the director said. As such, some vague parallels can be drawn between the CTRL app and chatbot AIs like ChatGPT, especially how it is capable of mimicking natural human dialogue.\n\nHowever, in terms of the app\u2019s personalized aspects, digital assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa have more similarities. The story focuses primarily on the CTRL app\u2019s invasive nature and how it eventually takes over Nella\u2019s life and dictates every aspect, including her schedule and emotional needs. In many ways, it also provides an outlet for people to alleviate their loneliness, which is a prime concern in the case of Nella, who goes through a very public breakup and finds herself ostracized on the internet. It speaks to a greater issue converging on modern society, specifically in the domain of ethics, and whether human insecurities might be harnessed to the advantages of AI services like CTRL. Still, for the time being, it is a fictional service with no ties to reality.\n\nRead More: CTRL Ending, Explained: Why Does Nella Give Up?"

Reducing the size of radiotherapy machines and optimizing them for ease of use \u2014 especially in countries with fewer resources \u2014, designing a smart program for breast cancer prevention and improving the monitoring of stroke patients are some of the promising projects that the European nuclear research laboratory is working on, in collaboration with European hospitals.\n\nThe European Organization for Nuclear Research \u2014 which is known as CERN \u2014 offers hospitals its experience in managing huge amounts of data in a secure and decentralized way, which is key to ensuring the privacy and security of the private patient information used to feed the algorithm. This institution \u2014 which is best known for building the Large Hardron Collider (LHC) \u2014 uses a system to process data locally without sending it to central storage. This helps protect privacy and make better use of resources when different hospitals work together to create reliable AI-based models for analyzing and predicting diseases.\n\n\u201cIt is a new paradigm. Before, there was a huge amount of data that was centralized and stored. Now we do the processing at the place where the data is acquired, for example in a hospital. If we guarantee privacy, data protection and the robustness of the model, we have something that is of great interest for medical applications,\u201d explains CERN scientist Luigi Serio during a visit to the laboratory\u2019s facilities organized by the International Union for Cancer Control (UICC) on the occasion of the World Cancer Congress in Geneva.\n\nLuigi Serio \u2014 responsible for developing AI applications in healthcare \u2014 acknowledges that the laboratory known for discovering antimatter \u2014 which also created the world\u2019s first website \u2014 isn\u2019t the only one using this data processing model. However, he emphasizes, \u201cWhat sets us apart is the strength, expertise, and reputation of CERN, along with the assurance that our services are backed by our nonprofit, impartial status.\u201d\n\nHow AI helps improve stroke patient monitoring\n\nOne of the applications based on this system is Truckstroke, which is already improving stroke treatment with artificial intelligence in around 10,000 patients in hospitals in Germany and Belgium and in the Vall d\u2019Hebron Stroke Unit in Barcelona.\n\nBy comparing images of the brain of a stroke patient with models trained by CERN in the so-called Truststroke Project, the algorithm predicts how the patient might evolve, what therapy should be administered and the follow-up required. Most importantly, the tool predicts the risk of recurrence.\n\nEvery year, 1.1 million people in Europe have a stroke, half a million die, and there are almost 10 million survivors who need long-term care. \u201cProfessionals are overwhelmed by stroke patients and need ever more new tools to support their work,\u201d explains Serio.\n\nHospitals have all the data configured locally, but by exchanging the parameters with the main server they obtain prediction models capable of measuring the severity of the stroke. \u201cThe doctor can use these models to decide what type of treatment to give to the patient. They also know the probable outcome and the follow-up required, how long the patient must remain in hospital, when they can be discharged, etc.,\u201d explains the researcher.\n\nThe algorithm knows who should undergo a mammogram\n\nCERN plans to complete a cancer detection program next year that promises to be 50% more accurate than the current screening model, GAIL. In addition to age factors and medical history, the CERN model will determine the risk of developing breast cancer by combining multiple factors, such as consumption of certain foods or alcohol, lifestyle and physical activity, the age of the woman at her first pregnancy or menopause, among other parameters.\n\nThe current screening system does not take into account all risk factors. \u201cThe idea is to have a tool that can analyze several factors beyond those currently taken into account to decide whether a mammogram should be done earlier, even if it can be delayed and for what reasons,\u201d explains Serio.\n\nUse of AI in medicine. Images provided by the NGO. Thomas Omondi (Union for International Cancer Control)\n\nThe data to train the tool comes from the European Prospective Study on Diet, Cancer and Health (EPIC), which contains information collected over more than 20 years. Once the model is finalized next year, it will need to be tested and regulated, so there are still steps to be taken before the promising breast cancer screening system replaces the current protocol.\n\nCERN aims to enhance linear radiotherapy accelerators (LINACs) with artificial intelligence to make them easier to use and more accessible in low- and middle-income countries. In these regions, access is limited not only by the high cost, but also by a shortage of experts trained to operate the equipment. \u201cThe machines are difficult to acquire, install, operate and maintain,\u201d explains Serio. The use of artificial intelligence in this field could significantly improve the quality of care, as it allows the machine to be operated and diagnoses to be made even in the absence of an expert, he explains.\n\nNew AI-based software will help predict failures, speed up maintenance and guide users, while reducing downtime at radiotherapy facilities, which are now often unused due to a lack of skilled personnel. This model could even open the door to automating treatment planning.\n\nThe project, called STELLA, is initially designed to improve radiation therapy treatment in some African countries, where there is one radiation therapy device for every 3.5 million people, compared with one for every 80,000 to 100,000 people in the U.S. and most European countries.\n\nPredicting the evolution of tumors or Alzheimer's\n\nAnother medical application developed by CERN is capable of determining defects, abnormalities or pathologies in the brain and indicating to doctors the exact point at which a pathology, for example a tumor, could be developing, thanks to a complex system based on the one CERN created to prevent failures in the operation of the particle accelerator.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the brain is a complex system that can be modelled as a graph. You have neurons in different parts of the brain that are connected to each other, and you can set up a matrix of nodes and vectors that connect the different parts,\u201d explains the CERN researcher. By processing images of the brain obtained by magnetic resonance imaging, the algorithm is able to detect with a certain degree of precision where a pathology might be present.\n\n\u201cThe algorithm would extract the image saying that there is some irregularity, and it can even actually predict where the anomaly is and where it spreads,\u201d explains Sergio. This technology is being tested clinically at the Kapodistrian University Hospital in Greece. For the moment, explains Serio, it has been used for tumors or strokes, but CERN also plans to use this system to monitor the evolution of Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

        "article_content": "PARKERSBURG \u2014 The new West Virginia Paranormal Trail includes several local attractions.\n\nSites on the trail are the Blennerhassett Hotel and Spa in Parkersburg and the Flinderation Tunnel on the North Bend Rail Trail.\n\nThe Paranormal Trail is designed \u201cto help spook-seekers discover the state\u2019s most spine-chilling sites,\u201d the Department of Tourism with Gov. Jim Justice said in a release. An accompanying digital passport allows visitors to check in at haunted locations, earning points for prizes along the way.\n\nThe launch of the West Virginia Paranormal Trail follows the recent announcement of Haunted Ohio: 24 Must-Visit Places by TourismOhio, the tourism arm of the Ohio Department of Development. The Lafayette Hotel and the Hackett Hotel in Marietta are on the trail. Nearby on the list are Hocking Hills State Park in Logan and The Ridges at Ohio University at Athens.\n\n\u201cThe haunted and paranormal stuff is so popular,\u201d said Mark Lewis, president and CEO of the Greater Parkersburg Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLewis cited the popularity of the annual Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, where the Silver Bridge collapsed in 1967, killing 46 people. According to folklore, the cryptid Mothman is tied to the collapse.\n\nThe Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant also is on the Paranormal Trail.\n\nIt\u2019s late in the tourist season, but not too late to promote the Paranormal Trail and the local attractions, Lewis said. A goal of the trail and its promotion, among others, is to increase room stays, he said.\n\n\u201cWe think we can bring in people for the haunted tours and the Paranormal Trail,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel is ranked in the Top 10 most-haunted hotels in North America, Adra Johnson, who runs the ghost tours and investigations at the hotel, said. She also is involved with the separate Susan Sheppard\u2019s Haunted Parkersburg ghost tour.\n\nAttractions applied to be on the Paranormal Trail, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to be on it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nApparitions at the hotel include the specters of children playing tag in the halls, unexplained knocks on the door and hotel builder William Chancellor smoking a cigar, believers believe.\n\nThe Paranormal Trail has already generated interest, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten several phone calls already,\u201d she said.\n\nActivities are held year round at the hotel and are popular, Johnson said. Appalachian ParaCon, a paranormal convention, will be held Oct. 18, 2025, at the hotel, Johnson said.\n\nLewis will propose two more local attractions to be added to the trail, the Riverview Cemetery in the 1300 block of Juliana Street in Parkersburg and the Silver Tunnel on the North Bend Rail Trail, a 1,376-foot tunnel near Cairo.\n\n\u201cI think the Silver Tunnel is more well known for paranormal activity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe weeping woman statue overlooking the graves of the Jackson family is located at Riverview Cemetery where many notable citizens in Parkersburg\u2019s history are buried.\n\n\u201cRecent trends have shown us that travelers are increasingly interested in spooky and unique destinations,\u201d West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said. \u201cWest Virginia has quite a few spots with haunted histories, so we created the Paranormal Trail to tap into the thriving market for themed tours and attractions. Whether learning about local legends or touring notoriously haunted attractions, it appeals to travelers interested in spooky sightings, mystery and local lore.\u201d\n\nOther landmarks on the Paranormal Trail are the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, Lake Shawnee Abandoned Amusement Park, Harpers Ferry, the Hotel Morgan in Morgantown, the Flatwoods Monster Museum in Flatwoods, Old Hospital on College Hill in Williamson, the Historic Glen Ferris Inn in Glen Ferris, the Shepherdstown Mystery Walk, the Haunted Haymond, the Elk River Trail between Ivydale and Duck and the West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville.\n\nInformation about the trail and how to earn points by visiting the site is at wvtourism.com/paranormal.\n\nTravelers can register online to participate in Paranormal Trail and receive the digital passport by email or text. Visitors check in to spooky spots around the state to earn points for an official Paranormal Trail sticker, a beanie and a limited-edition print by artist Liz Pavlovic of West Virginia.\n\nJess Mancini can be reached at jmancini@newsandsentinel.com."

        "article_content": "A hot jobs report combined with still-dovish Fedspeak lifted the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nSoftware leaders ServiceNow (NOW 3.04%), Snowflake (SNOW 3.85%), and UiPath (PATH 4.52%) rallied on Friday, up 3.1%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, in the day's trading.\n\nThere wasn't any company-specific news today on these three enterprise software leaders. However, today's solid jobs report, in combination with still-dovish commentary from Federal Reserve officials, sent each stock soaring.\n\nSoftware stocks to benefit from a soft landing\n\nThe past few years of rising interest rates have generally been difficult for software stocks. While ServiceNow has impressively managed to buck the trend and recover strongly after 2022's downturn, Snowflake and UiPath are still down 62% and 76% over the past three years, respectively.\n\nNOW data by YCharts\n\nInterest rates have had a lot to do with it. When the post-pandemic inflation took off and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, it hit software stocks in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, rapidly raising interest rates caused companies, fearing a downturn, to pull back on software spending, especially since there had been a huge amount of software adoption during the pandemic. Second, rising rates also disproportionally hurt software stock valuations, as software stocks tended to trade at very high multiples of earnings or sales. Rising rates lower the present value of earnings far out in the future, which hurt high-multiple stocks like software. So, software stocks were hit by a \"double whammy\" of slowing growth and sharply discounted valuations.\n\nWhat could reverse the trend? Well, a \"soft landing\" in which inflation and interest rates come down without a recession would be the ideal scenario. Increased confidence and hiring could spur more software \"seat\" subscriptions or, in the case of Snowflake's pay-as-you-go model, more consumption of computing. Meanwhile, lower interest rates would lift valuations.\n\nInflation has been coming down recently, which spurred the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points last month on Sept. 18. Yet while some had thought lower inflation might go hand in hand with a slowing economy, today's September jobs report blew away expectations, with 254,000 jobs added, far above the 150,000 forecast and up from a revised 159,000 jobs added in August.\n\nSolid job growth and lower interest rates is the ideal environment for stocks generally, but especially the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nOf course, the hot jobs report could mean that inflation may not be subdued yet, and could keep rates high. But Federal Reserve governor Austan Goolsbee, appearing on Bloomberg TV today, said the strong jobs report doesn't mean inflation is going up. He still sees inflation getting back to the Fed's 2% target and also declared no change in the outlook for continued interest rate cuts over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe next issue for software: AI disruption\n\nWhile the interest rate and economic picture looks terrific for software stocks now, there are still a few issues to consider. First, while interest rates are likely to get back to a \"neutral\" rate soon, they aren't likely going all the way back to pandemic-era low levels. So, one shouldn't expect software companies to reattain the inflated valuations they saw in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the AI revolution has the potential to benefit or disrupt certain software companies. ServiceNow has done quite well as it serves at the nexus of companies' private on-premises data and the outside cloud, and can therefore serve as a manager of enterprises' AI while also incorporating outside LLMs. Interestingly, UiPath and Snowflake are more cloud-based, and while they have been posting growth, they haven't been benefiting as much from AI -- at least not yet.\n\nSo while the interest rate picture is getting much better for software, investors will have to be choosy on which stocks will have AI as a value-add and which might see increased competition from the AI revolution."

        "article_content": "Google and Apple unveiled their latest smartphone lineups in the past few weeks. If you\u2019re interested in an entry-level phone option, you might want to consider the Google Pixel 9 and the Apple iPhone 16, which both include the latest and most powerful processors, fantastic cameras, and cutting-edge AI features. Both also include versions with various storage levels at different price points, and while they\u2019re among the cheapest in their respective ranges, you\u2019re unlikely to buy both. So which should you buy? Let\u2019s compare these phones and see how they stack up.\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: specs\n\nApple iPhone 16 Google Pixel 9 Dimensions and weight 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches 6.0 ounces 6.02 x 2.83 x 0.33 inches 7.0 ounces Display 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display 1179 x 2556 resolution (460 PPI) 60Hz refresh rate Up to 2,000 nits peak brightness 6.3-inch Actua OLED 1080 x 2424 pixels (422 PPI) 120Hz refresh rate Up to 2,700 nits peak brightness Processor A18 chip Six-core CPU Five-core GPU 16-core Neural Engine Google Tensor G4 Titan M2 security coprocessor Rear cameras Dual camera system 48-megapixel Fusion main 12MP ultrawide Dual camera system 50MP wide 48MP ultrawide Front camera 12MP selfie 10.5 MP selfie Storage and memory 8GB/128GB 8GB/256GB 8GB/512GB 12GB/ 128GB 12GB/ 256GB AI Apple Intelligence (coming soon) Google Gemini Durability IP68 IP68 Software and support iOS 18 Six to eight years of software updates Android 14 Seven years of software updates Battery and charging 3,561mAh 45W wired fast charging 30W wireless (with MagSafe) 4.5W reverse wireless 4,700mAh 27W wired 15W wireless 4.5W reverse wireless Colors Ultramarine Teal Pink White Black Peony Wintergreen Porcelain Obsidian Price Starting at $799 Starts at $799 Review 4 out of 5 stars 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: design and display\n\nThe iPhone 16 and Pixel 9 have undergone design changes compared to their predecessors, the iPhone 15 and Pixel 8. These changes are not significant, but they are noticeable nonetheless.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a new, smaller camera design on the back that generally changes its look compared to last year\u2019s models. Unlike previous generations, the camera system is now pill-shaped rather than having a square cutout. It should remind many of the iconic iPhone X. It\u2019s gorgeous. The Apple phone is available in classic white, black, vibrant pink, ultramarine, and teal. The chassis is made of aluminum, while the back is color-infused glass. At just 6 ounces, the iPhone 16 is one of the lightest smartphones to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 and the rest of the Pixel 9 series feature a more polished design than the previous generation. Some say the phone lineup reminds them of Apple\u2019s in terms of its cleaner look. This is evident in the stylish dual camera system on the back, which has evolved from a visor into a prominent flat-top island mountain. It\u2019s simply gorgeous and something to appreciate. The phone\u2019s satin-finish metal chassis has just the right amount of curvature to seamlessly blend in with the flat Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 rear panel, making it a pleasure to hold. Like the iPhone 16, you can purchase a Pixel 9 in white (Porcelain) or black (Obsidian). It\u2019s also available in beautiful Peony and Wintergreen. Because Google\u2019s phone has a larger display than Apple\u2019s, it weighs an ounce more than its competitor.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch OLED display, while the Pixel 9 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch OLED display. Both displays offer excellent resolution, though the iPhone 16 leads slightly in this aspect, with a higher pixels-per-inch count that means it\u2019s a bit sharper and crisper.\n\nIn addition to screen size, the Pixel 9 outperforms the iPhone 16 in terms of its display\u2019s peak brightness and refresh rate. The Pixel 9 boasts an impressive peak brightness of 2,700 nits, surpassing the iPhone 16\u2019s still respectable 2,000 nits.\n\nFurthermore, the Pixel 9\u2019s refresh rate of 120Hz matches that of most high-end smartphones, while the iPhone 16 is limited to 60Hz. That\u2019s similar to previous iPhone models, but it\u2019s holding back the regular iPhone 16 series. As a result, the Pixel 9 delivers smoother screen refreshes, which is particularly noticeable during activities such as gaming.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: performance and software\n\nBoth phones feature new chipsets: the iPhone 16 has an A18, while the Google Pixel 9 has a Google Tensor G4.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has significantly improved performance this year, thanks to the chipset and 8GB of RAM. Although Apple claims a 30% faster CPU and 40% faster GPU, you might notice little difference in everyday use since the iPhone 15 was already relatively fast.\n\nHowever, that A18 chip has other benefits that are (or will be) noticeable. Specifically, it enables the updated Photographic Styles on the phone and the upcoming Apple Intelligence package. The former has been around since the iPhone 13. This time around, however, the camera feature has been significantly improved. There are more styles to choose from, and you can now also customize the tone and color of each one using an improved slider control. Apple Intelligence, which the company has not yet released, will bring artificial intelligence to the iPhone for the first time. Once the feature is released, we will better understand how good the A18 chip is \u2014 or perhaps isn\u2019t.\n\nThe iPhone 16 ships with iOS 18, and based on previous iPhone releases, you\u2019ll likely get six to seven software updates.\n\nCircling back to the Pixel 9, previous Tensor G chips had been criticized for performance problems. In particular, some past Pixel users complained about overheating issues and occasional stutters, depending on what was done on the device. We had no issues with the Tensor G4 with 12GB of RAM featured in the Pixel 9. The performance on the Pixel 9 was the smoothest and most enjoyable Pixel experience to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 comes with Android 14 software. Google promises seven years of software updates, which means you can keep your device for a long time if you choose. The Pixel 9 ships with Google\u2019s built-in AI assistant, Gemini. Better still, Pixel 9 users get a free year of Gemini Advanced, which adds more intelligence. That\u2019s a savings of around $240 for the year.\n\nLeaving aside the issue of AI, which we\u2019ll get to below, both of these phones have high-tier performance and long update promises. As such, this has to be a tie.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: cameras\n\nCameras have always been a significant part of smartphones, and that\u2019s still the case with the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 48-megapixel Fusion primary rear camera, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 12MP selfie camera. The camera setup is quite similar to that of the iPhone 15, although there are a few notable changes.\n\nOne significant change is that the ultrawide camera now offers autofocus, allowing macro photography. Additionally, you can capture Spatial photos that can be viewed on an Apple Vision Pro. The primary camera also now has a new anti-reflective lens coating, and it can capture pictures with zero shutter lag, similar to the iPhone Pro models.\n\nOverall, we\u2019re happy with the iPhone 16\u2019s cameras. The primary camera is excellent, capturing detailed photos with really pleasing colors. It also focuses quickly, handles moving subjects well, and does a great job in lowlight environments. The ultrawide camera makes taking macro photos a treat, and the selfie camera is as reliable as ever on the iPhone.\n\nThe most significant change to the iPhone 16\u2019s growing list of camera tools is the addition of a physical Camera Control button. This button on every iPhone 16 series phone functions like a traditional camera shutter button, but offers more functionality due to its built-in capacitive sensor. The sensor allows you to access six options on a new camera menu: exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles, and tone. To navigate these options, you can slide your finger across the Camera Control, lightly press the button to select an option, and then adjust the chosen setting by sliding your finger again.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but Camera Control seems like a fun new way to interact with your iPhone\u2019s camera. However, it might take you a little bit of time to get used to it.\n\nThe Pixel 9 also features two cameras on the rear: a 50MP primary camera and a 48MP wide-angle camera that enables a macro mode. The 10.5MP selfie camera also has autofocus.\n\nWhen testing the Pixel 9, we took many photos, and we came away impressed. The primary and wide-angle cameras shot sharp, colorful images that were never dull or underwhelming. We also enjoyed using the phone\u2019s Action Pan, which adds motion blur to moving objects, and the new Reimagine feature in Magic Editor, which allows you to change scenes based on your imagination.\n\nCasual photographers will enjoy using the cameras on both of these phones, as they are equipped with hardware and software features that will provide years of enjoyment.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: battery and charging\n\nThe battery life of both these phones is decent, but not exceptional, especially when compared to more expensive phones from the same companies. Despite them both being decent, one is better than the other.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has a 3,561 mAh battery, which should last a day without recharging. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 has a bigger 4,700mAh battery, allowing you to use it for a second day (at least for a while) before recharging.\n\nThe iPhone 16 theoretically supports 45-watt wired charging, but seems to be limited to around 20W most of the time. We tested the iPhone 16 with an Anker 747 and found that it charged from 5% to over 60% in 30 minutes. However, it took over an hour and a half to reach 100%. Charging from a low or dead battery to around 70% is relatively fast, but the final 30% takes a while. If you prefer MagSafe charging, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the iPhone 16\u2019s charge speeds have increased from 15W to 30W. Apple\u2019s phone supports MagSafe, Qi2, and Qi wireless charging.\n\nThe Pixel 9 maxes out at 27W charging, similar to the iPhone. It could charge a dead battery to 53% in 30 minutes and get an entire charge in 92 minutes. The Google phone supports Qi wireless charging, but not Qi2.\n\nWe\u2019re giving this one to Google\u2019s phone, if only because it has a bigger and longer-lasting battery.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: AI\n\nIn just a few weeks, Apple plans to release at least the initial components of Apple Intelligence to the general public. Within six months, every feature should finally be available. Apple Intelligence is designed to provide a secure, helpful, and intuitive AI experience. It will offer personalized writing assistance, new creative tools, improved Siri, and more.\n\nGoogle Gemini, also available for iPhone through the Google App, is designed to help users make everyday tasks easier and offer a more helpful Google Search experience. Like Apple Intelligence, it will help you write better, improve your images, and more.\n\nBecause Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available, the Pixel 9 wins this category by default.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: price and availability\n\nThe iPhone 16 costs $799 for the 128GB model and $899 for the 256GB model. There\u2019s also a 512GB model for $1,099. The Google Pixel 9\u2019s base 128GB model also costs $799. The 256GB version is available for $859 if you need more storage.\n\nThe Pixel scores points because its 256GB model is available for $40 less than the similarly equipped iPhone 16 model. However, it loses that point because only Apple offers a 512GB model.\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: verdict\n\nThis result may change in six months. However, for now, the Pixel 9 bests the iPhone 16 overall. Google\u2019s entry-level phone has much more going for it, from having a larger display and battery to offering an AI product right now when you open the box.\n\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t a bad phone; it\u2019s actually a terrific phone that currently lacks some of Apple\u2019s promised features.\n\nUltimately, an incomplete product cannot outperform a completed one. However, your decision will likely be based more on each phone\u2019s operating system. If you prefer Android, you\u2019ll choose the Pixel 9 and Android 14; if you\u2019re a fan of iOS, then the iPhone 16 with iOS 18 is the one for you.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9\n\niPhone 16"
