            "article_content": "The truth is out there, whirring in the night sky, taunting us with winking lights and erratic zigs and zags.\n\nLike a plague of locusts, they keep coming, torturing us with their mystery.\n\nWhat are they, where are they from, what do they want and why won\u2019t the government give us a straight answer?\n\nAre they chariots of the gods from a strange new world in a galaxy far, far away?\n\nOr the villainous handiwork of China or Putin or Little Rocket Man?\n\nOr even an inside job \u2026 deep state spies, dispatched from a secret drone hangar in the basement of a D.C. pizza parlor?\n\nWho cares? Donald Trump says. Shoot first and ask questions later. Speculation is for suckers.\n\n\u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country,\u201d the president-elect posted on Truth Social. \u201cCan this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThe government says not to worry. Which, of course, is what worries people the most.\n\nUntil most recently, the official response has been sketchy, sluggish and anything but helpful or reassuring.\n\nAs of last week, thankfully, the feds finally were providing a coherent reaction.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, The Associated Press reports, the Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flights in 30 areas in New York and 22 in New Jersey, through mid-January. FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials say their agencies are looking into the sightings but have seen little evidence to suggest safety or security threats.\n\nWhat most people are seeing, officials say, are law-abiding, garden-variety drones. Or airplanes. Or helicopters. Or stars.\n\nThese are plausible answers. But many Americans remain unconvinced.\n\nThere are, of course, lots of precedents for our tin-hat predilections. \u201cYes, they can control the weather,\u201d a member of Congress posted on X only weeks ago, presumably about members of the other party. A vaccine denier may soon head the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Then there was a spate of clown sightings in 2016. (You can look it up.)\n\nBut the most famous was the \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d a 1938 radio drama about a Martian invasion based on H.G. Wells\u2019 science fiction novel that some Americans mistook as the real thing.\n\nIt all sounds like an episode of the \u201cX-Files,\u201d the popular old Fox series in which a pair of mismatched FBI agents delved weekly (9 Eastern, 8 Central Time) into monsters, aliens and labyrinthine conspiracies.\n\nSpecial agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder were an odd coupling of \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you\u201d-ism versus \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me-\u201d-ism. Mulder was the true believer, Scully the skeptic.\n\nI\u2019m more Scully than Mulder.\n\nI live in a neighborhood near enough to PTI Airport and far enough from city lights that the night sky is often vast and dark enough to reveal twinkling stars and a constant array of air traffic, some of it close and bright enough to resemble gliding Christmas trees.\n\nOccasionally, an aircraft headed for PTI will appear to be a UFO, sitting silent and still in the heavens. But it\u2019s always an illusion, a plane approaching head-on that only appears to be hovering until it turns toward the runway and you can hear the roar of its engines.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve hoped for a UFO sighting, just for the thrill of it. But I\u2019ve yet to see even one.\n\nAs for the mass hysteria over drones, it\u2019s another sign to me of the blessings of not living in a war-torn place like Gaza or Ukraine, where drones are ubiquitous and deadly, armed with missiles, bombs and bullets.\n\nSo, for now, at least, I\u2019m not buying the Drone Conspiracy.\n\nIn the end, maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. (Scully was in the \u201cX-Files.\u201d The aliens turned out to be real, as did many of the monsters of the week.)\n\nOn a more serious note, the ebbing faith in government and other institutions (insurance companies, media, big business, schools and universities) is for real and it is disturbing and unhealthy.\n\nWhen the center does not hold, things fall apart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a lot scarier than blinking lights in the night."

            "article_content": "Hyderabad: For understanding a patient\u2019s illness, a doctor typically analyses several physiological indicators as well as reports generated following diagnostic tests.\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI), however, is set to change the practices in vogue since decades. AI can correlate the patient\u2019s symptoms and diagnostic results using health records in the database to identify the cause of illness within a few seconds \u2014 helping the doctor to save time and increase operational efficiency of a hospital.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive report published in August by the Indian School of Business (ISB), AI's real transformation in healthcare is in patient care and clinical research.\n\nIn medical imaging, it accelerates diagnosis, while in surgeries, AI-driven robotics enhance precision. During the pandemic, AI played a critical role in tracking outbreaks and assisting in treatment planning. Initiatives such as Wadhwani AI\u2019s media scanning solution for disease surveillance and Artelus\u2019s image recognition for early diagnosis highlight the technology\u2019s versatility.\n\nThe doctor to patient ratio is abysmally low in rural India, with one doctor having to treat 2,000 people. The advent of AI is a morale-booster for doctors. The central government is reportedly keen on promoting AI applications in the healthcare sector. Several state governments are investing heavily in AI rollout in the healthcare sector.\n\nAn advanced healthcare AI can help the government or private hospitals to roll out telemedicine to make healthcare more accessible, especially in remote regions.\n\nAI can also revolutionise preventive healthcare as it can identify patterns early, which will help the doctors to begin treatment at the earliest.\n\nIn 2022, the Indian healthcare industry was estimated to be worth $372 billion. It is expected to grow at around 20 per cent till 2030. The use of AI will propel the growth rate.\n\nBut how does AI work and how does one deploy AI for healthcare purposes?\n\nAI uses various advanced technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), expert systems, and image and signal processing for diagnosis.\n\nMachine learning automates data analysis to identify patterns, while NLP aids in processing medical records and transcription. Expert systems, on the other hand, specialise in solving specific problems like diagnosing chronic conditions. Image and signal processing refine medical imaging data, allowing for accurate and timely diagnosis.\n\nNITI Aayog has deployed AI for early detection of diabetes and eye-related ailments. Radiology was among the first fields to adopt AI.\n\nStartups like Dozee, which developed India\u2019s first AI-powered remote patient monitoring system, and Augnito, a speech recognition tool for medical transcription, are setting benchmarks in healthcare innovation.\n\nIIIT Hyderabad is also using AI for detecting sleep quality and sleep-related disorders.\n\nWhile AI can study sleep stages to precise levels, deep learning (DL) can automate the sleep stage data through supervised and unsupervised learning models, said Prof. S. Bapi Raju, lead researcher and head of Cognitive Sciences Lab at IIIT Hyderabad.\n\nAI could be a boon for remote ICU assistance, says Dr D.V.R. Seshadri, director, centre for business markets, ISB.\n\n\"Once a technology such as the one for remote ICU assistance (CloudPhysician), breast cancer detection (Niramai) or scanning through millions of x-rays to detect TB are scaled up, many companies will inevitably spring up to deploy these technologies on a massive scale,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare is not without challenges.\n\nA lack of comprehensive electronic health records (EHR) and high infrastructure costs are the hindrances. There is also a significant skill gap, as professionals proficient in both healthcare and AI, are scarce. Additionally, concerns about data privacy, accountability, and ethical use persist.\n\nAn even wider concern is the possibility of AI replacing doctors.\n\nHowever, Dr Seshadri allayed these concerns: \"This is very unlikely in the foreseeable future. At the end of the day, the patient would like the assurance of a human doctor. While AI tools may be leveraged to enhance the efficacy of the doctors, it cannot replace doctors any time soon.\"\n\n\"There is convergence of multiple disciplines happening on a massive scale. It may be hard to isolate the application of AI in disease surveillance from its other applications. The regulatory systems to prevent such convergence typically lag behind the application of these technologies, and hence we cannot rule out the misuse of AI technologies in healthcare for purposes other than what was originally intended,\" Dr Seshadri explained.\n\nAI applications in healthcare:\n\nAI uses various advanced technologies such as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), expert systems, and image and signal processing for diagnosis.\n\nMachine learning automates data analysis to identify patterns, while NLP aids in processing medical records and transcription.\n\nExpert systems, on the other hand, specialise in solving specific problems like diagnosing chronic conditions. Image and signal processing refine medical imaging data, allowing for accurate and timely diagnosis."

            "article_content": "What's one way to charge more than $1,000 for a laptop in this day and age? Slap an \"AI\" sticker on it. Acer is not the only offender\u2014looking at you, Microsoft, forcing your Copilot key onto keyboards\u2014but the company has enthusiastically boarded the bandwagon with the Swift 14 AI AMD (starts at $1,199.99; $1,299.99 as tested), a notebook with a squiggly symbol on the touchpad that lights up when you use an AI app. Artificial hoopla aside, the Swift is a capable ultraportable laptop. However, it fails to unseat the Editors' Choice-award-winning Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406), which isn't as fast but has a superior screen and costs hundreds less.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Covering All the CPU Bases\n\nThe Swift 14 AI AMD\u2014you'll find Intel and Arm versions, too\u2014starts at $1,199.99 with 16GB of RAM, which is on sale for $999 at the time of publishing. However, this test unit (model SF14-61T-R3U1) doubles the memory for an extra $100. It also carries a 10-core AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor with Radeon 880M integrated graphics, a 1TB NVMe solid-state drive, and a 14-inch, 1,920-by-1,200-pixel IPS touch screen.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe system's web page on Acer.com trumpets two non-touch display options with higher 3K resolution\u2014one IPS with a 120Hz refresh rate and one OLED with 90Hz\u2014but Acer disappointingly confirms they're not available in the U.S.\n\nOn the positive side, the Swift lands right on our ultraportable weight line at 3.0 pounds, compared with 3.47 pounds for the HP OmniBook Ultra 14. Measuring 0.74 by 12.3 by 8.8 inches, it's a fraction trimmer than that laptop as well. Its anodized aluminum chassis has passed MIL-STD 810H tests for sturdiness, but you'll still feel a bit of flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nSlim bezels surround the screen, which opens 180 degrees and has a top lip to ease one-handed opening. The 1440p webcam centered above has a sliding privacy shutter and IR face recognition, joining a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button to give you two ways to skip passwords with Windows Hello.\n\nThe laptop's left side holds two USB4 Type-C ports, either suitable for the AC adapter, along with an always-on USB 3.2 Type-A port and an HDMI monitor port. Another USB-A port joins an audio jack at the right. Along with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth, this is a satisfactory array of connections. However, I would be happier with USB-C ports on both sides (so the AC adapter cord can't interfere with external mouse users) and an option for mobile broadband.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nUsing the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Ai-Yi-Yi, It's AI\n\nAlong with the usual shortcuts for screen brightness, audio volume, and airplane mode, the top row has a key to launch AcerSense, a utility that combines system info and updates, diagnostics, power/cooling settings, and three Windows Store apps. These are LiveArt, which creates AI-filtered stickers from your photos; AlterView, which provides adjustable animated wallpapers; and GIMP, the robust but less consumer-friendly rival to Adobe Photoshop.\n\nA feature called Acer User Sensing taps the IR webcam to log you in when you approach and dim the screen or lock the system when you move away, as well as nagging you to take regular screen breaks and not get too close to the display. Acer QuickPanel pops up during video calls to provide AI-enhanced PurifiedView image and PurifiedVoice audio enhancements. And as always with Acer PCs, you'll see a few bloatware ads for things like the Forge of Empires game.\n\nPurifiedView mostly duplicates Windows Camera's recently added auto framing, background blur, and video fine-tuning for the webcam. The camera captures images that are brighter and sharper than average, with quadruple the resolution of cheapo 720p cams. Sound from the bottom-mounted speakers is moderately loud but somewhat scratchy and hollow; you'll hear little bass, but you can make out overlapping tracks. DTS:X Ultra software offers music, movie, gaming, and other audio presets (my ears couldn't detect much difference) plus an equalizer.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe keyboard commits two common laptop sins: teaming the cursor arrow and Fn keys instead of providing dedicated Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys and arranging those arrows in a clumsy row (with half-size up and down stacked between full-size left and right) instead of an inverted T. Its typing feel is decidedly shallow and flat, uncomfortable for long sessions. The sizable, buttonless touchpad glides and taps smoothly and takes medium pressure for a comfortable click.\n\nI could wish for higher resolution, but the 16:10-aspect-ratio touch screen is sufficiently bright, with clean instead of dingy white backgrounds and broad viewing angles. Its colors don't pop like poster paints but are rich and well-saturated, with decent contrast. The screen's finer details are crisp, and you'll see no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nTesting the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Near the Head of the Class\n\nYou'll find no shortage of other 14-inch ultraportables to compare the Swift AI 14 with\u2014or wanna-be ultraportables, I should say\u2014since several edge over our three-pound limit. The Dell XPS 14 and Asus Zenbook S 14 have Intel Core Ultra 7 power. So does our test unit's more costly cousin, the Acer Swift X 14, whose Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 instead of integrated graphics makes it the champion of our GPU benchmarks. The HP OmniBook Ultra 14 has an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor like our Acer's.\n\nProductivity and Content Creation Tests\n\nOur primary overall benchmark, UL's PCMark 10, tests a system in productivity apps ranging from web browsing to word processing and spreadsheet work. Its Full System Drive subtest measures a PC's storage throughput.\n\nThree more tests are CPU-centric or processor-intensive. Maxon's Cinebench 2024 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene; Primate Labs' Geekbench 6.3 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning; and we see how long it takes the video editing tool HandBrake 1.8 to convert a 12-minute clip from 4K to 1080p resolution.\n\nFinally, workstation maker Puget Systems' PugetBench for Creators rates a PC's image editing prowess with a variety of automated operations in Adobe Photoshop 25.\n\nCompared with larger desktop replacement notebooks, the ultraportable performance baseline is usually decent workflow with everyday apps like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace\u2014say, 4,000 to 5,000 points in PCMark 10's main event. The Swift 14 AI AMD raises the bar, joining HP's OmniBook (which has a slightly higher-rated Ryzen AI chip) in crushing our processing tests. It's certainly suitable for content creation as well as routine productivity.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe challenge laptops' graphics with a quartet of animations or gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite. Wild Life (1440p) and Wild Life Extreme (4K) use the Vulkan graphics API to measure GPU speeds. Steel Nomad's regular and Light subtests focus on APIs more commonly used for game development, like Metal and DirectX 12, to assess gaming geometry and particle effects. A fifth test, Solar Bay, emphasizes ray-tracing performance.\n\nAMD's integrated graphics were not quite a match for Intel's, which in turn were no match for the Dell's entry-level discrete GPU, let alone the two-steps-higher RTX 4070 inside the Swift X. Most ultraportables are fine for solitaire games and video streaming, not playing the latest fast-twitch titles.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation\u2014what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show\u2014and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe Acer AI AMD did about as well as an IPS- rather than OLED-screened slimline can in these tests, combining lengthy battery life and screen brightness with decent color reproduction. However, I still wish Acer would sell the 3K OLED display as an option here in the States.\n\nVerdict: Embrace the Hype?\n\nWe have a perhaps stereotypical view of most Acer customers as non-tech-expert consumers rather than power users, so we're not surprised the Swift 14 AI AMD does everything but put a cereal- or detergent-style \"Now with AI!\" decal on the box. Those looking inside the box, however, will find exceptional processing power and webcam quality. The stiff, flat keyboard dampens the experience, and other 14-inch ultraportables, like the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch, include prettier OLED screens, but this Acer should satisfy many.\n\nAcer Swift 14 AI AMD 3.5 See It $999.99 at Amazon Starts at $1,199.99 Pros Near-workstation-class CPU performance\n\nGenerous 32GB of RAM\n\nBright and colorful touch screen Cons Disappointing keyboard\n\nUpgraded displays not for U.S.\n\nLow-impact AI apps\n\nNo WWAN option or flash-card slot View More The Bottom Line An AMD Ryzen AI 9 chip gives Acer's latest Swift 14 ultraportable laptop impressive performance, but we wish the company had sanded off one or two rough edges."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nWhat's one way to charge more than $1,000 for a laptop in this day and age? Slap an \"AI\" sticker on it. Acer is not the only offender\u2014looking at you, Microsoft, forcing your Copilot key onto keyboards\u2014but the company has enthusiastically boarded the bandwagon with the Swift 14 AI AMD (starts at $1,199.99; $1,299.99 as tested), a notebook with a squiggly symbol on the touchpad that lights up when you use an AI app. Artificial hoopla aside, the Swift is a capable ultraportable laptop. However, it fails to unseat the Editors' Choice-award-winning Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406), which isn't as fast but has a superior screen and costs hundreds less.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Covering All the CPU Bases\n\nThe Swift 14 AI AMD\u2014you'll find Intel and Arm versions, too\u2014starts at $1,199.99 with 16GB of RAM, which is on sale for $999 at the time of publishing. However, this test unit (model SF14-61T-R3U1) doubles the memory for an extra $100. It also carries a 10-core AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor with Radeon 880M integrated graphics, a 1TB NVMe solid-state drive, and a 14-inch, 1,920-by-1,200-pixel IPS touch screen.\n\nThe system's web page on Acer.com trumpets two non-touch display options with higher 3K resolution\u2014one IPS with a 120Hz refresh rate and one OLED with 90Hz\u2014but Acer disappointingly confirms they're not available in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the positive side, the Swift lands right on our ultraportable weight line at 3.0 pounds, compared with 3.47 pounds for the HP OmniBook Ultra 14. Measuring 0.74 by 12.3 by 8.8 inches, it's a fraction trimmer than that laptop as well. Its anodized aluminum chassis has passed MIL-STD 810H tests for sturdiness, but you'll still feel a bit of flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck.\n\nSlim bezels surround the screen, which opens 180 degrees and has a top lip to ease one-handed opening. The 1440p webcam centered above has a sliding privacy shutter and IR face recognition, joining a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button to give you two ways to skip passwords with Windows Hello.\n\nThe laptop's left side holds two USB4 Type-C ports, either suitable for the AC adapter, along with an always-on USB 3.2 Type-A port and an HDMI monitor port. Another USB-A port joins an audio jack at the right. Along with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth, this is a satisfactory array of connections. However, I would be happier with USB-C ports on both sides (so the AC adapter cord can't interfere with external mouse users) and an option for mobile broadband.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Ai-Yi-Yi, It's AI\n\nAlong with the usual shortcuts for screen brightness, audio volume, and airplane mode, the top row has a key to launch AcerSense, a utility that combines system info and updates, diagnostics, power/cooling settings, and three Windows Store apps. These are LiveArt, which creates AI-filtered stickers from your photos; AlterView, which provides adjustable animated wallpapers; and GIMP, the robust but less consumer-friendly rival to Adobe Photoshop.\n\nA feature called Acer User Sensing taps the IR webcam to log you in when you approach and dim the screen or lock the system when you move away, as well as nagging you to take regular screen breaks and not get too close to the display. Acer QuickPanel pops up during video calls to provide AI-enhanced PurifiedView image and PurifiedVoice audio enhancements. And as always with Acer PCs, you'll see a few bloatware ads for things like the Forge of Empires game.\n\nPurifiedView mostly duplicates Windows Camera's recently added auto framing, background blur, and video fine-tuning for the webcam. The camera captures images that are brighter and sharper than average, with quadruple the resolution of cheapo 720p cams. Sound from the bottom-mounted speakers is moderately loud but somewhat scratchy and hollow; you'll hear little bass, but you can make out overlapping tracks. DTS:X Ultra software offers music, movie, gaming, and other audio presets (my ears couldn't detect much difference) plus an equalizer.\n\nThe keyboard commits two common laptop sins: teaming the cursor arrow and Fn keys instead of providing dedicated Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys and arranging those arrows in a clumsy row (with half-size up and down stacked between full-size left and right) instead of an inverted T. Its typing feel is decidedly shallow and flat, uncomfortable for long sessions. The sizable, buttonless touchpad glides and taps smoothly and takes medium pressure for a comfortable click.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could wish for higher resolution, but the 16:10-aspect-ratio touch screen is sufficiently bright, with clean instead of dingy white backgrounds and broad viewing angles. Its colors don't pop like poster paints but are rich and well-saturated, with decent contrast. The screen's finer details are crisp, and you'll see no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\nTesting the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Near the Head of the Class\n\nYou'll find no shortage of other 14-inch ultraportables to compare the Swift AI 14 with\u2014or wanna-be ultraportables, I should say\u2014since several edge over our three-pound limit. The Dell XPS 14 and Asus Zenbook S 14 have Intel Core Ultra 7 power. So does our test unit's more costly cousin, the Acer Swift X 14, whose Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 instead of integrated graphics makes it the champion of our GPU benchmarks. The HP OmniBook Ultra 14 has an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor like our Acer's.\n\nProductivity and Content Creation Tests\n\nOur primary overall benchmark, UL's PCMark 10, tests a system in productivity apps ranging from web browsing to word processing and spreadsheet work. Its Full System Drive subtest measures a PC's storage throughput.\n\nThree more tests are CPU-centric or processor-intensive. Maxon's Cinebench 2024 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene; Primate Labs' Geekbench 6.3 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning; and we see how long it takes the video editing tool HandBrake 1.8 to convert a 12-minute clip from 4K to 1080p resolution.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, workstation maker Puget Systems' PugetBench for Creators rates a PC's image editing prowess with a variety of automated operations in Adobe Photoshop 25.\n\nCompared with larger desktop replacement notebooks, the ultraportable performance baseline is usually decent workflow with everyday apps like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace\u2014say, 4,000 to 5,000 points in PCMark 10's main event. The Swift 14 AI AMD raises the bar, joining HP's OmniBook (which has a slightly higher-rated Ryzen AI chip) in crushing our processing tests. It's certainly suitable for content creation as well as routine productivity.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe challenge laptops' graphics with a quartet of animations or gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite. Wild Life (1440p) and Wild Life Extreme (4K) use the Vulkan graphics API to measure GPU speeds. Steel Nomad's regular and Light subtests focus on APIs more commonly used for game development, like Metal and DirectX 12, to assess gaming geometry and particle effects. A fifth test, Solar Bay, emphasizes ray-tracing performance.\n\nAMD's integrated graphics were not quite a match for Intel's, which in turn were no match for the Dell's entry-level discrete GPU, let alone the two-steps-higher RTX 4070 inside the Swift X. Most ultraportables are fine for solitaire games and video streaming, not playing the latest fast-twitch titles.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation\u2014what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show\u2014and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe Acer AI AMD did about as well as an IPS- rather than OLED-screened slimline can in these tests, combining lengthy battery life and screen brightness with decent color reproduction. However, I still wish Acer would sell the 3K OLED display as an option here in the States.\n\nVerdict: Embrace the Hype?\n\nWe have a perhaps stereotypical view of most Acer customers as non-tech-expert consumers rather than power users, so we're not surprised the Swift 14 AI AMD does everything but put a cereal- or detergent-style \"Now with AI!\" decal on the box. Those looking inside the box, however, will find exceptional processing power and webcam quality. The stiff, flat keyboard dampens the experience, and other 14-inch ultraportables, like the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch, include prettier OLED screens, but this Acer should satisfy many."

            "article_content": "by Jayantha Perera\n\nI retired from ADB in April 2011. ADB appointed me as a staff consultant without waiting for the mandatory \u2018cooling off\u2019 12-month period expired. A memo signed by the President, a Vice President, and two Directors Generals of ADB stated why I should be re-recruited immediately. It stated, \u201cMr. Perera\u2019s experience as a senior and highly respected member of ADB as a safeguard specialist makes him ideal for this position \u2026 He is a well-respected ADB staff and was one of ADB\u2019s leading experts in the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s development issues; he was the only international staff member at ADB who had technical knowledge and expertise in all three safeguard areas\u2026\u2026..\u201d\n\nOne of my major assignments as a consultant was to conduct training in 10 Pacific countries for senior government officials on how to address social and environmental issues to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy standards. Fiji, Samoa, Pohnpei, Tonga, Cook Islands and Marshall Islands were among the countries chosen. Each country offered its rich culture, natural beauty, and the opportunity to meet people with vivid personalities and experience paranormal encounters. Pohnpei, an island state in the Pacific, etched a dazzling world I will never forget.\n\nPohnpei and three island states form the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the western Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei is the largest island in FSM, with a land area of 335 sq. kilometres. The other three states are Yap, Chuuk, and Kosrae. Pohnpei State also owns several small islands in the vast Pacific Ocean.\n\nPohnpei means \u2018stone altar.\u2019 Presumably, it refers to a large stone platform on the island. The island\u2019s population is about 37,000. Its terrain is mountainous and jungle-covered. It is one of the wettest places on Earth, with an annual rainfall exceeding 7,600 mm. A circular, tarred, narrow road connects dispersed towns. Access to the interior, especially to hilly areas, is challenging.\n\nThe people are proud of their history and boast about Nan Madol, an ancient city-kingdom. Its civilisation flourished for 700 years, from the 10th century to the 17th century. Its downfall began with the arrival of Spanish sailors in the early 19th century, followed by whalers, traders, missionaries, educators, and colonisers. After the Spaniards, the Germans occupied it. During the Second World War, the Japanese captured it, and the USA took it from the Japanese in the late 1940s.\n\nLocals suffered severely when colonisers plundered their treasures and destroyed cultural artefacts. Spaniards brought cholera and smallpox to Pohnpei, nearly annihilating the local population. The Japanese not only looted local treasures but also enslaved people. During the Second World War, Japanese warlords used local slaves to move heavy cannons to strategic mountaintops. Most of the workers died because of starvation and illnesses.\n\nIn 1986, Pohnpei became an independent state within FSM. The five traditional small kingdoms on the island constitute independent Pohnpei, and the Pohnpei State Council represents them. Kolonia is the capital of Pohnpei State, and Palikir is the capital of FSM. The two cities are adjacent to each other. The local kingdoms occasionally clash with the State Council on matters of development. About 10 years ago, for example, the State Council tried establishing a casino complex in the territory of a traditional kingdom. Its king opposed the proposal and took his protest to an international forum for arbitration.\n\nEnglish is the official language, and people consider themselves non-immigrant citizens of the United States. In other words, the USA guarantees they can become US citizens whenever they want. The currency in the country is the US dollar. Postage is paid in US$, and postal stamps are US postal stamps. A taxi charges one dollar to travel within Kolonia.\n\nFortunately, I got a seat on United Airlines from Honolulu to Kolonia. The Filipino hotel manager told me to wait a few hours before occupying my room. When I asked him why, he said hotel guests who had left in the morning might return if their flight was cancelled. The hotel\u2019s policy is to accommodate such stranded travellers on a priority basis in the rooms they had occupied earlier.\n\nI was tired, hungry, and sleepy. The manager gave me a hot tuna sandwich and coffee at the restaurant. He told me he could give me a room with a door facing the jungle behind the hotel. I feared small insects and reptiles might creep into my room after sunset. The incessant rain added a gloomy atmosphere to my fear. I could hear water gushing down a drain. Rainwater trickled down from the eves of the roof, flooding the narrow corridor in front of the room and making it slippery.\n\nI moved into the room and slept several hours. When I woke up, it was dark and still raining. I did not know how to go to the restaurant. There was no telephone in my room. I was nervous about going to the bathroom. When I opened the tap in the bathroom, it took about five minutes to see clear water. I was reluctant to pull the shower curtain. When I pulled it, a six-legged, black, long, gecko-like creature was in the bathtub. The bathtub was cracked and dirty and covered with dead leaves. The room\u2019s light bulb was weak, and the bathroom was not lit up to see what else was waiting there to meet me. I regretted my decision to occupy an outer room.\n\nThe manager came to take me to dinner. He had a strong flashlight and a large umbrella. I asked him about possibly moving to a room inside the hotel. But by then, the hotel was fully occupied. The manager told a Filipina woman to clean my room again and to keep a heater in it. I insisted that the bedsheets and pillows should also be changed. When I returned to my room after supper, it looked neat and smelled good. The gecko-like creatures had disappeared.\n\nI had a free weekend in Pohnpei before leaving for Honolulu. The hotel manager suggested I hire his four-wheel drive Jeep and travel around the island. He charged me $100 for the trip, which included a driver-cum-guide, a lunch box, snacks, and soft drinks. He advised me to carry one-dollar bills with me to pay local taxes. I changed a 50-dollar note for one-dollar and five-dollar bills. The bills were dirty and discoloured; some were as hard as cardboard.\n\nThe Jeep was a rickety old van without a spare wheel. It spluttered dark, unburned diesel, and its engine noise was unbearable. Roger, the jeep driver, was a local young man with long hair and a ferocious-looking black beard. He carried a big, heavy knife. The hotel manager handed him food boxes and an umbrella.\n\nI thought Roger might sacrifice me to a native god by cutting my neck at a remote place. I had read on Google about human sacrifices to gods on the island. I wished I had invited another hotel guest to accompany me, but it was too late. Roger promised to show me places that foreign visitors rarely visit. His offer made me more nervous. I told him that I should return to the hotel before 5 p.m.\n\nRoger drove the old Jeep with care. He stopped the Jeep in front of churches to talk to his friends who came for the Sunday mass. Sometimes, he offered them a ride in the Jeep without asking me. At a church, at least 10 people entered the Jeep, and two sat next to me in the front seat, pushing me onto the gear shift. They were fat people dressed in large white shirts and baggy blue jeans. They had unshaven faces and unwashed mouths. They spoke English. They invited me to visit their church and to join them for a communal lunch. I politely declined the offer by saying I was on a tight travel programme and should return to Kolonia early.\n\nLater, I visited a small Christian church. The church had a neat front yard, and a local artist had painted beautiful murals of the genesis and the crucifixion. I could see some well-thumbed prayer books and hymn books on a small table covered with an embroidered white tablecloth. The small board on the table invited donations. One could donate money by dropping dollar bills or cents into a small glass box, which a small padlock secured.\n\nSeveral people were in the church, wearing their Sunday best. Men wore European clothes, and women wore long white dresses with beautiful shoes. Some of them had heavy makeup. All adult women wore head covers. Many devotees, especially the women, carried rosaries in their hands.\n\nPeople sat in circles by the road and ate from large metal pots. Roger explained that Christians do not work on Sundays except for attending mid-morning service. They cook on Saturday and partook of it on Sunday after the church service. Pork was the main dish. Raw tuna fish competed with fried pork to be the best food item. Someone told me they had learned how to raise pigs and cook pork dishes from Filipino friends whose ancestors came with the Spaniards as cooks and servants.\n\nSuddenly, Roger drove off the main road, saying he wanted to show me the statue of Henry Nanpie. The figure was about 100 metres from a protestant church and was on an elevated stone dais. I thought it was built of steel with a hollow interior. Henry was in an elite tailcoat with a walking stick in his right hand. Roger told me that Henry had lived in Pohnpei in the late 19th century and early 20th century. He was the son of a local army commander. His mother was an English woman \u2013 the daughter of an English beachcomber.\n\nHenry inherited lots of land from his powerful father. Then, he wanted to acquire land from another local kingdom. Henry visited the kingdom\u2019s palace carrying a loaded gun and a bag of goodies. He took the weapon to kill the king and the goodies to bribe palace servants to get their allegiance. When he saw the king in an inner palace chamber, he tried to kill the king. But his gun misfired. Then Henry aimed the weapon at a flowerpot and pulled the trigger. The bullet went through the flowerpot and damaged the wall behind it.\n\nHenry cunningly claimed that he had supernatural powers and could stop a gun from firing a bullet. He explained to the king that before he aimed the weapon at the king, he had \u201ccharmed\u201d the gun. Because of the charm, the gun misfired. After removing the charm from the gun, a bullet fired from it smashed the flowerpot. The king was amazed and convinced himself of Henry\u2019s supernatural powers. The king asked him to be the kingdom\u2019s protector offering him a mansion and a vast stretch of land.\n\nHenry opened a large supply shop to supply food, water, oil, and labour to whaling ships in the Pacific. He used his new wealth to add more land to his estate. In Pohnpei, he established protestant groups and spread Western cultural practices and beliefs among the locals through them. Even today, local people consider him a semi-god who brought wealth and salvation to them and connected them with the outside world. Roger sang a folk song about Henry, which depicted Henry as a local god. A copper plaque beside his statue indicates that he still has admirers to spread, invent and reinvent myths about him.\n\nRoger was hurrying me to go to the ruined capital of Nan Madol Kingdom. He told me that the kingdom was on the banks of a large lagoon connected to the eastern shoreline. It was the only ancient city ever built atop a coral reef. In 2016, the UN declared it a World Heritage Site. We drove on a narrow gravel road and parked the Jeep. From there, we walked about two kilometres to Nan Madol. We walked through private lands, and landowners charged a fee for crossing their land. Some landlords collected a dollar or two, but one landlord demanded seven dollars.\n\nWe entered a rocky trail from the last property. The land rapidly became marshy, and we walked on an elevated narrow bund. Both sides of the bund were inundated, and walking on it was risky. Henry dexterously cut down weeds and plants that obstructed the path. He wanted me to follow him closely but did not say why. The thought that he might sacrifice me to a local god began looming in my mind. I did not look around as I wanted to keep my eyes on him and the bund. He walked fast, brandishing his knife as if in a frenzy.\n\nThe narrow bund that stretched through a grotesque jungle of mangroves looked never-ending. I thought that spirits were watching and following me. I tried to avoid looking at large trees because I thought they were beckoning me. Some tree trunks, I thought, turned into hobgoblins. I remembered reading how funny elves resort to mischievous acts towards human beings who encroach on their territories.\n\nSuddenly, I felt some invisible force pulling me back. I could not see Roger. I thought that I got lost among the mangroves forever. I saw the shallow water in marshy fields swelling to engulf me. I stopped walking. I thought how silly I was to think about bizarre things. Then Roger returned and asked me whether I had seen anything or anybody. I told him that some trees had tried to talk to me and were making faces at me. He said that many visitors had similar supernatural encounters. Roger explained that Pohnpiens treated the ruins at Nan Madol as sacred. They also knew various spirits haunt the place. The spirits came out at night, but a few hovered around during the daytime to harass visitors. Roger gave me several small, polished stones connected in a string. It reminded me of the rosaries that churchgoers had in their hands. He said that the string would fend off evil spirits. I then remembered my grandmother, who gave me my first rosary when I was seven, advising me to carry it with me to protect myself from evil forces.\n\nWe arrived at a stagnant shallow canal from where we could see the temple entrance. To reach the temple, we crossed a shallow canal. There were several decayed logs in the canal, and we had to push them aside to cross it. About 50 metres from the canal were the elegant stone walls three to five metres high. Just under a stone arch was a conduit from a table-flat wall top where, presumably, human sacrifices were conducted. According to Roger, the blood of those victims trickled down from the wall top to the main entrance through the conduit, where priests performed rituals to appease gods. Many city outer walls remain intact, although mangroves have engulfed them.\n\nLocal people believe twin brothers, who were sorcerers, built Nan Madol. They came to Pohnpei from another island in a large canoe to build an altar where they could perform ancestor worship. The legend is that the two brothers levitated large stones with the help of a flying dragon and built the entire city in three years. They transported basalt columns from a faraway island. Most of the columns are now under shallow water in the lagoon.\n\nThe temple consists of about 90 rectangular islets linked by narrow channels. Each islet had a coral-filled platform. Nan Madol means \u201cwithin the intervals,\u201d and the \u201cintervals\u201d are the complex canal grid. It is unclear who lived on islets, but locals believe priests who performed rituals at the altar lived in single-house units built on islets.\n\nThere were reserved locations among the islets for priests to feed turtle innards to a sacred eel who lived in a deep well. After feeding the eel, priests shared the rest of the turtle as a sacrament. To this day, eels are considered holy and are never killed or eaten.\n\nThe main enclosure is a large stone chamber with hundreds of human bones. About 15 years ago, several German archaeologists dusted and rearranged the bones to examine their age. That night, one archaeologist died in his hotel room in Kolonia, and the other fell gravely ill. Roger said his ancestors were unhappy when foreigners excavated and labelled their bones. They, as spirits, protect the monuments and punish anyone who disturbs them.\n\nRoger\u2019s father and two uncles had seen several light beams starting from the temple\u2019s main altar late one night. The light beams travelled across the sea to faraway islands and large stars. When I asked Roger if he would camp at Nan Madol after sunset to watch the light beams, he said he would not risk meeting his ancestors! He advised me not to talk about them as they were holy spirits with enormous powers and could harm us in their domain.\n\nWe spent two hours walking around the temple. The shallow sea and the lagoon behind the ruins were very picturesque. We tried to count the heaps of basalt rafts submerged in the lagoon. When we decided to leave Nan Madol, I felt I could not move. I was unsure whether the feeling came from my fear of hobgoblins or the perplexity in my mind. I told Roger to walk with me to the Jeep. He walked ahead of me, occasionally checking whether I was following him. I tried to walk fast without looking at the trees I had seen earlier. I felt a powerful, unseen force pulling me backwards. I imagined a tree with strange roots moving towards me. The gushing winds created a bizarre atmosphere. I felt I had not left the ruins, so I called Roger and asked him to walk with me. We plodded to the Jeep from the ruins. He reassured me that the spirits would not follow us. I was glad to leave Phonpei the following day."

Maiden\u2019s my favorite metal band of all time as well. That was the first band I saw of that genre in 1980, the day that MTV came on the air. I was 10 years old, and I was, like, \u201cWhat in God's name is this?\u201d And that just sent me on my trajectory [with] Maiden and Judas Priest.\n\nAside from Bittner\u2019s minor timeline mistake (MTV debuted in 1981), his love for Iron Maiden and Judas Priest isn\u2019t surprising. What is more shocking, however, is that he follows by confessing that he was far less impressed by Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them.\n\n\u201cI wanna say, I think [in] \u201984, a friend of mine let me borrow a record [Ride the Lightning],\u201d Bittner reflects. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you gotta check out this band.' And I'm, like, 'Who's Metal-licka?' And he goes, 'No, it's pronounced Metallica, man!' I'm, like, 'All right, cool. Metallica.\u2019 And I took it home and I hated it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Shadows Fall Vs. Haunted Prison\n\nWhy Bittner Originally Didn\u2019t Like Metallica or Slayer\n\nInterestingly, it\u2019s related to his love for Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford. Bittner explains:\n\nI was like, \u201cGod, what the hell is this?\u201d 'Cause I was used to Bruce Dickinson and Halford, and all of a sudden, you have James Hetfield, and I'm, like, \u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d Maybe, like, a week later, I taped the album just in case I might like it one day, and I gave the record back to my friend. And, like, a week later, I'm doing my paper route and I was humming [a guitar riff]. And I'm, like, \u201cWhat is this that I'm singing to myself?\u201d And it was the riff from \u201cFight Fire With Fire.\u201d And I'm, like, \u201cOh, that's that Metallica band. I didn't think I liked that.\u201d\n\nHe continues:\n\nA lot of the heavier bands \u2013 even bands I've been in \u2013 when I've heard [them] the first time, I didn't care for [them]. Like Slayer. I hated Slayer at first. I'm, like, \u201cNo way I'm gonna like this.\u201d [Now] Slayer\u2019s my favorite thrash band of all time. Anthrax and Megadeth were the only two that, when I first listened, I wasn't, like, \u201cAargh!\u201d Like, with Anthrax, I was just, like, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d That was, like, the \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 the \u201cbe all, end all\u201d for me right there, because [drummer] Charlie [Benante] was . . . one step beyond [Slayer drummer Dave] Lombardo for me at that point, because, like, Lombardo was feet, but Charlie was the whole fucking package.\n\nWhat Made Him Change His Mind on Metallica and Slayer\n\nBittner add that he was introduced to Metallica first (followed by Megadeth) because a classmate mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s this dude [Dave Mustaine] that was in Metallica before Kirk Hammett.\u201d\n\nHe explains:\n\nI didn't know about anything pre-'Kill \u2018Em All' . . . [and] he was, like, \u201cNah, this dude [Mustaine] was in the band before [Hammett], and he's got this other band and it's called Megadeth. . . And the first thing I heard was 'Killing Is My Business,' but that was so raw at the time. I was, like, \u201cAll right . . . it's kind of cool. It's fast and stuff.\u201d But, once 'Peace Sells' came out, I was, like, \u201cOh, all right. Now I get it.\u201d . . . Maybe a year after that or within that year, I got into Slayer. A friend of mine had Show No Mercy and he had let me hear that. And I wasn't really that impressed, but then Reign in Blood came out . . . and I bought that . . . went on a spring break vacation my sophomore year of high school to Florida with my mom, and all I did was just I had Reign In Blood . . . I listened to that record just incessantly for a week straight.\n\nFrom there, Bittner came to appreciate \u201chow hard thrash metal drumming was\u201d as he tried to play certain parts himself. \u201cSo, it was Slayer, then Anthrax, and it was basically through the \u201cBig 4\u201d and then everything else under the sun,\u201d he remarks.\n\nInterestingly, he admits that he\u2019s \u201calways been . . . a thrash metal drummer,\u201d adding:\n\nI\u2019m not an extreme metal drummer. I like that stuff, but . . . it's out of my wheelhouse. It's not what I do. But I like a lot of those drummers and went through that whole phase in the mid-'90s. [I was] immersed into Death and Morbid Angel and that stuff. Listening to Pete Sandoval and Sean Reinert and Gene Hoglan. So, my influences go across the board, really. And let's not forget Van Halen, either.\n\nThat\u2019s quite the musical journey, right?\n\nOf course, Shadows Fall recently released a new single and music video, \u201cIn the Grey,\u201d which marks their first piece of new music in over a decade. It also signifies their new partnership with MNRK Music Group.\n\nAs for Metallica, they were ranked no. 9 in Pollstar\u2019s recent tally of the Top 10 Worldwide Top Touring Artists of 2024. Likewise, they remain one of the top ten most popular choices for tattoos, and Kyuss\u2019 Brant Bjork acknowledged that he didn\u2019t like having the band labeled as \u201cthe next Metallica.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Slayer\u2019s Kerry King cited Sabotage as his favorite Black Sabbath LP.\n\nAlso, you can watch the full interview with Bittner below:\n\nShadows Fall\u2019s Jason Bittner Discusses His Musical History With RichardMetalFan"

            "article_content": "Terrifying night time phenomenon makes body freeze and 1 in 3 of us will experience it\n\nNight-time disturbances of the terrifying variety can make us believe in the paranormal.\n\nBut those of us unlucky enough to \"wake\" to the feeling we aren't alone or find our bodies suddenly at the mercy of mysterious forces will be relieved to hear that these phenomena have a scientific name and explanation.\n\nThe Sleep Foundation describes sleep paralysis as a \"temporary inability to move or speak that occurs directly after falling asleep or waking up\". During an episode, the boundaries of sleep and wakefulness \u2013 usually defined and distinct \u2013 are temporarily blurred, leading to a mixed state of consciousness wherein individuals maintain some degree of awareness, however distorted, of the world around them, while being unable to move.\n\nOrdinarily, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep combines vivid dreaming with atonia (the brief loss of muscle control), which works in our favour to prevent us acting out our dreams in real life. Sleep paralysis, on the other hand, seems to occur when the atonia and mental imagery of REM sleep persists even into a state of being aware and awake.\n\nMedical experts have grouped sleep paralysis into two categories. Isolated sleep paralysis, or one-off paralysis episodes that are not connected to an underlying diagnosis of narcolepsy (a neurological disorder that disrupts the ability of the brain to properly control wakefulness).\n\nRecurrent sleep paralysis, or multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time that are usually associated with narcolepsy.\n\nAround 75% of sleep paralysis episodes involve hallucinations. These can include intruder hallucinations, where the individual perceives a dangerous person or presence in the room; chest pressure hallucinations (also known as incubus hallucinations), which involve feelings of suffocation and often occur alongside intruder hallucinations; and vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations, which involve feelings of movement or out-of-body sensations.\n\nThe cause of sleep paralysis is not fully understood, but it has been associated with insomnia, disrupted sleep patterns, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and a family history of sleep paralysis. .\n\nTo prevent sleep paralysis, there are no quick-fixes or guaranteed cures, but some suggestions include: regularly getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep every day; maintaining a consistent bedtime and wake-up time; engaging in regular exercise, but avoiding it in the four hours leading up to bedtime; and sleeping on your front or side, as sleeping on your back can increase the likelihood of sleep paralysis episodes. .\n\nThose who are struggling with recurrent sleep paralysis may be referred to their GP, who could identify an underlying condition such as insomnia or PTSD. They may also be referred to a clinician who specialises in sleep disorders."

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

            "article_content": "When Camarria Williams, 13, stumbled upon goose poop in a neighborhood park, she enthusiastically scooped some up. She and six other students were looking for bacteria samples. \u201cMy mom feeds animals, and I know birds eat everything and anything,\u201d said Camarria, an eighth-grade student at William H. Brown STEM Magnet School in Chicago. \u201cI knew there must be in bacteria in it.\u201d\n\nAfter collecting their samples, students in the Chicago Antibiotic Discovery Lab, a STEM outreach program, were taught how to isolate bacteria and program a robot to catalogue it and track antimicrobial activity. Camarria learned, with university researchers\u2019 help, that her goose poop contained a cancer-fighting compound. She was stunned and delighted.\n\n\u201cI like discovering new things,\u201d she said.\n\nThe program \u2014 run by Brian Murphy, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago \u2014 partners with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago. Its goal is to give underserved middle and high school students experiences in biomedical sciences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premise of our 14-week program is to teach students how many medicines \u2014 in this case, antibiotics \u2014 are discovered,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cThe students analyze their own data and then make decisions in the very initial stages of this drug discovery process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect these experiences to careers in STEM,\u201d he added. \u201cI thought if we actually involve students in our own research that we do in the lab, we could show them there\u2019s a pathway to careers in the biomedical sciences, and maybe even start a pipeline from middle school to high schools to their local universities.\u201d\n\nFor Camarria, signing up for the program was a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked science and found it interesting, like how you can mix chemicals to make something,\u201d she said.\n\nShe did not anticipate, however, that her involvement in the program would result in her and university researchers\u2019 uncovering a novel compound with cancer-fighting capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did something, and it worked,\u201d Camarria said. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d\n\nCamarria collected the goose droppings at Garfield Park Lagoon, while other students collected samples such as lake water, leaves, bugs, dirt and flowers.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun to be able to go out, put on the gloves and do the science myself,\u201d said Camarria.\n\nWhile Camarria\u2019s sample did contain a bacterium with antibiotic activity, that wasn\u2019t the key takeaway of her discovery. The goose poop contained a novel compound, which university researchers investigated and found had cancer-fighting properties, specifically for ovarian and skin cancer.\n\n\u201cWe tested the compound against a panel of pathogens and a few cancer cell lines,\u201d said Jin Yi \u201cJeanie\u201d Tan, a graduate student in Murphy\u2019s lab who helps run the outreach program. \u201cAlthough this compound did not exhibit significant antibiotic activity, it did show cytotoxic activity in ovarian and melanoma cancer cell lines.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamarria was thrilled to learn her sample was even more promising than she originally thought.\n\n\u201cMy mom, auntie and grandma have all had cancer, so it makes me happy that something I found could help,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me want to discover more things out there.\u201d\n\nThe findings were published in the American Chemical Society\u2019s Omega Journal in October, and Camarria is named as a co-author.\n\n\u201cNow people will know me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll know that I am a smart kid and I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\nCamarria\u2019s discovery \u201ccaptures the whole essence of the program and what we set out to do, to give our youth an opportunity to really get experience with science and show them that their commitment and willingness to participate can lead to something,\u201d said Jonathon Rodriguez, a technology program manager at the Boys & Girls Club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the finding is exciting, Murphy said, it\u2019s unlikely that it will become a drug.\n\n\u201cVery, very few natural compounds that are discovered ever make it into the clinic as drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, \u201ccompounds like this allow us to understand how cancer works a little better, and that allows other groups of scientists to develop better drugs,\u201d Murphy explained, adding that he and other researchers may continue studying Camarria\u2019s novel compound.\n\nMurphy said the finding highlights the importance of accessible STEM programs for young people.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is show young students that there are a lot of real-world applications of science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to light a spark inside of them, get them to care about their education, and maybe even be the launching point for the next generation of biomedical researchers.\u201d\n\nCamarria is already looking forward to her future career."

            "article_content": "This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.\n\nSuchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.\n\nBalaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI\u2019s strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.\n\nWATCH: Current, former OpenAI employees warn company not doing enough control dangers of AI\n\n\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d said a statement from OpenAI.\n\nBalaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said \u201cappeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.\u201d The city\u2019s chief medical examiner\u2019s office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.\n\nHis parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a \u201chappy, smart and brave young man\u201d who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends.\n\nBalaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cSuchir\u2019s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without him,\u201d said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.\n\n\u201cHe had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,\u201d Schulman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.\u201d\n\nBalaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI\u2019s flagship large language model and a basis for the company\u2019s famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.\n\nHe first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.\n\nHe later told The Associated Press he would \u201ctry to testify\u201d in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the \u201cmost serious.\u201d Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have \u201cunique and relevant documents\u201d supporting allegations of OpenAI\u2019s willful copyright infringement.\n\nHis records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.\n\nREAD MORE: AI \u2018gold rush\u2019 for chatbot training data could run out of human-written text as early as 2026\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be training on people\u2019s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,\u201d Balaji told the AP in late October. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to do that. I don\u2019t think you are able to do that legally.\u201d\n\nHe told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.\n\nBut of the \u201cbag of issues\u201d he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was \u201cactually possible to do something about.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said \u201cthey will have to change and it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d\n\nHe had not been deposed and it\u2019s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.\n\nSchulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji\u2019s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.\n\nSchulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn\u2019t think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence \u201cwas right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.\u201d The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring \u201csome more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,\u201d Schulman said.\n\nBalaji\u2019s family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino."

            "article_content": "It may be an overused statistic, but it\u2019s true: We know less about what lives and lurks in our oceans than we do about outer space. This year proved no exception to the rule, either. In the last year, researchers discovered long-lost shipwrecks, odd animals, and even a phenomenon known as \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d among many other finds.\n\n\u2018Ghost Ship of the Pacific\u2019 found using underwater drones\n\nThe USS Stewart rests about 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nIt only took a few hours for a team of 20-foot-long autonomous submersible drones to relocate the USS Stewart after 78 years spent at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The \u201cfour-piper\u201d destroyer ship was the only vessel captured by Japanese forces during World War II, and earned its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker after numerous Allied troops sighted it deep behind enemy lines. Although eventually returned to the US Navy and scuttled, its exact location remained a mystery for years. Now, however, we know the extremely well-preserved remains lay off the California coast in the Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary.\n\nShipwreck hunters find WWII-era merchant ship that sunk in Lake Superior\n\nThe wheel of the Arlington, about 600 feet underwater. Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society\n\nAlthough also dating back to the WWII era, the Arlington wasn\u2019t involved in combat when it sank. The 244-foot bulk carrier was instead a merchant vessel sailing Lake Superior en route to Owen Sound, Ontario. Inclement weather, however, caused the ship to take on water in the early hours of May 1. While Captain Frederick \u201cTatey Bug\u201d Burke insisted his crew stay the course, the sailors had other plans, and soon abandoned Burke to his\u2014and his ship\u2019s\u2014ultimate fate. Like the USS Stewart, the Arlington was located using remote operating submersibles and sonar scans.\n\nNew, colorful starfish species found off the coast of Japan\n\nThe newly discovered Paragonaster hoeimaruae. There are many types of starfish and this one is particularly adapted to living in sandy, muddy waters, a feature the researchers want to learn more about. Credit: \u00a9 I. Kobayashi\n\nThere are around 2,000 cataloged starfish species in the world, but that list grew by at least one new variety in 2024. Discovered by researchers off the coast of Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula, Paragonaster hoeimaruae, is only the second starfish known to belong to the Pseudarchasteridae family. The strikingly orange sea creatures are especially adapted to live in muddy, sandy waters\u2014an evolutionary trait researchers hope to learn more about in the coming years.\n\nGrumpy-faced fish species found in Red Sea\n\nThe grumpy dwarfgoby is endemic to the Red Sea and lives in small holes and crevices in coral reefs. Viktor Nunes Peinemann\n\nWhile similarly as orange as Paragonaster hoeimaruae, Sueviota aethon arguably features a much more noticeable physical trait: the diminutive fish possesses a downturned mouth that makes it look permanently displeased. Its face seems so irritated that it even earned it the common name of the grumpy dwarfgoby. The roughly one inch long fish live among the coral reefs of the Red Sea\u2019s Farasan Banks near Saudi Arabia. Even at that size, however, discoverers describe the grumpy dwarfgoby as a \u201cfearsome predator\u201d given its comparatively large canines used to capture and devour small invertebrates.\n\nWWII submarine discovered 81 years after disappearing during secret mission\n\nThe HMS Trooper disappeared in 1943 with all 64 of its crew. Credit: YouTube / Planet Blue\n\nIt took at least as many as 14 attempts over nearly 25 years, but researchers finally located the wreckage of the HMS Trooper in 2024. The WWII Allied submarine and its 64 crew members deployed on a secret mission near Greece in early October 1943, but never arrived in Beirut as originally scheduled. Researchers used both sonar and an ROV called \u201cSuper Achille\u201d to identify Trooper\u2019s whereabouts, as well as confirm its fatal run-in with a German mine. Trooper lays in three separate parts an estimated 830-feet-deep at the bottom of the Icarian Sea, near the Greek island of Donoussa.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest coral formation is longer than a blue whale\n\nA diver from National Geographic Pristine Seas measures the world\u2019s largest coral colony in the Solomon Islands. Photograph by Manu San F\u00e9lix, National Geographic Pristine Seas\n\nThe biggest animal in the world may be the blue whale, but researchers in 2024 determined that the biggest intertwined community of animals is undoubtedly the recently discovered Pavona clavus coral colony. Measuring in at 111 feet wide, 104 feet long, 18 feet high, and 600 feet around, the standalone coral system formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean over the last 300 years, and can even be seen from space.\n\nNew ghost shark species found in New Zealand\n\nThe newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish, Harriotta avia. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)\n\nGhost sharks, also known as \u201cspookfish,\u201d technically aren\u2019t sharks, but instead are a group of fish that are closely related to the ocean predators. One of the newest additions to the family this year was Harriotta avia, described as having an \u201celongated, narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes; and very long, broad pectoral fins\u201d as well as possessing \u201clovely chocolate brown color.\u201d But don\u2019t expect to encounter one in the open waters\u2014Harriotta avia lives near New Zealand at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 8,350 feet below surface waters.\n\n\u2018Dark oxygen\u2019 on ocean floor may rewrite the origins of life\n\nThe formations can be found as deep as 20,000 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Wikipedia Commons\n\nOne of the wildest underwater discoveries of 2024 wasn\u2019t a new species of life, but chemical processes that might rewrite our understanding of the origins of life itself. Earlier this year, researchers published findings related to polymetallic nodules\u2014natural mineral deposits located on the pitch-black ocean floor. Despite lacking sunlight, however, evidence suggests these formations appear to function as \u201cgeobatteries\u201d capable of generating trace amounts of oxygen that help sustain deep-sea life. If true, then the planet\u2019s very first living organisms may have gotten their start in a place no one once thought could support life at all.\n\nNew jellyfish discovered near Japan may contain multitudes of venom\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross medusa is about four inches wide, three inches long, and has about 240 tentacles. Dhugal John Lindsay/JAMSTEC\n\nLike many other similar species, the newly found St. George\u2019s cross medusa lives around 2,300 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, and hunts bioluminescent prey with its many tentacles. Unlike its relatives, however, Santjordia pagesi packs an \u201carsenal of venoms\u201d that differs from other known jellyfish. Unfortunately, it might take a little while before researchers start gleaning more information on the creature\u2014it\u2019s difficult to gather more specimens given the jellyfish lives in a deep-sea volcanic caldera about 285 miles south of Tokyo.\n\nResearchers discover neurological mechanism controlling anglerfish lures\n\nFrogfish belong to the larger anglerfish family, and use their front fin as a lure. Credit: Deposit Photos\n\nAnglerfish aren\u2019t a new find for researchers, but biologists did confirm a surprising evolutionary feature in the odd-looking animals this year. Using tracer analysis, a team discovered the exact motor neurons that control one of the subspecies\u2019 front dorsal fin lure. It appears the location of these motoneurons shifted during their evolution compared to their relatives, pointing to evolutionary implications that reach all the way to landwalking vertebrates.\n\nOver 100 possible new ocean species found near Chile\n\nDuring an expedition off the coasts of Chile and Rapa Nui, scientists spotted a bony Chaunacops fish swimming in the waters of Chile\u2019s Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe 1,800-mile-long Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge near Chile is home to some wild creatures that look like they just arrived from an alien planet. Earlier this year, researchers used a remote operated submersible to survey the region and documented over 100 candidates for never-before-seen species. These included crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and even marine mammals. Biologists also glimpsed extremely rare animals, such as the whiplash squid."

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

New users can unlock a $150 sportsbook bonus when they place a winning $5 wager. The best part is there are no odds restrictions on that first wager so you have some cushion. To claim this offer, follow these instructions:\n\nClick on our FanDuel promo code and tap the \u2018Join\u2019 button. Answer the questions in the fields that follow. If you register using one of our links, no code is required. Choose a deposit method and deposit at least $5 into your new account.

The second most important thing is that the odds for your qualifying wager don\u2019t matter. For instance, if you think Tennessee will win the game, you don\u2019t have to bet on the moneyline with +220 odds. You don\u2019t even have to bet on the Vols\u2019 point spread (+7.5) with -110 odds.\n\nIf you think Ohio State will win, you don\u2019t have to wager on the Buckeyes to win by eight points (and covering the 7.5-point spread). You could bet on the Buckeyes on the moneyline (-280 odds). If you want something safer, there are more options at FanDuel. The sportsbook offers alternate point spreads and totals.\n\nYou can wager on Tennessee +33.5 or Ohio State +18.5. The over/under is 46.5 points, but FanDuel offers a total as low as 17.5 points so you could bet Over on that. You can go as high as 76.5 points for the total and bet Under. You won\u2019t get much of a profit on your $5 wager if you bet one of those extremes, but that isn\u2019t important. You just want to win so you can grab your $150 welcome bonus."

            "article_content": "In the wake of canceling its hyped car project, a hard setback with an iPhone subscription service, and delays with AI feature rollout, it seems Apple has found a new sweet spot for product development in the smart home segment. According to Bloomberg, the company is working on a smart doorbell with Face ID authentication support.\n\nApple is already rumored to be working on an iPad-like smart home device that will serve as a home hub for other connected devices as well. Now, the folks over at Cupertino are eyeing a niche that will integrate well within the HomeKit portfolio.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBloomberg\u2019s report describes it as a \u201csmart doorbell with advanced facial recognition that wirelessly connects to a deadbolt lock.\u201d The concept is pretty straightforward. Apple aims to bring its fast and reliable biometric authentication convenience to a doorbell.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nAt the moment, the segment is dominated by the likes of Amazon, Google, Eufy, and Logitech. The Nest Doorbell and Amazon Blink, in particular, often find their way to the top of the recommendation list for buyers. It\u2019s, therefore, no surprise why Apple would want to flex its way into the fray, especially when it has the tech stack, talent, and supply chain at its disposal.\n\nNow, the Face ID-ready doorbell project is in the early stages of development, which means its market arrival is neither close nor certain. According to a report that cites internal sources, enthusiasts should not expect to see anything on the market by the end of the year \u2014 at the earliest.\n\nThere is another probability. Instead of developing a hardware product of its own, Apple could very well outsource it to a third-party partner like Logitech or Belkin. That wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Take, for example, the Vision Pro, which sells a head strap for the headset straight from Apple\u2019s online store.\n\nThe upcoming device could be yet another host for the company\u2019s in-house combined chip for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which is reportedly making a debut in 2025 with the refreshed HomePod Mini and Apple TV models. The chip is apparently code-named Proxima and will reportedly be made by longtime partner TSMC.\n\nNow, a smart doorbell sounds like an obvious step in the right direction and could stand out with its facial recognition perk. Notably, the company already has the infrastructure ready (and is rapidly developing it with upcoming products) with a software stack in HomeKit that has already been embraced by various brands.\n\nIn addition, the upcoming home hub device that borrows from the iPad aesthetics will also run software that will connect with a whole bunch of other devices. It will also tap into the FaceTime system for videoconferencing. It won\u2019t be surprising to see it play nice with the upcoming smart doorbell camera via its video relay lane.\n\nThere are, however, a handful of concerns with the doorbell endeavor. Chief among them are chances of failure, especially when it comes to the possibility of an intruder somehow making it past the guardrails. The recent cases of abuse involving the AirTag tracker by bad actors is an example of one such scenario.\n\nApple has traditionally played it safe when it comes to user privacy and safety and has tried to skirt past such controversies to the best of its capabilities. So, there is a high chance that the company takes its own sweet time bringing the smart doorbell to the market or simply decides to offload the whole premise to other brands while milking royalty."

            "article_content": "(Each year, TIME recognizes 100 companies that are revolutionizing the world. Apply now to have your company reviewed by our editors.)\n\nAt the end of 2012, T-Mobile US was not in a good place. With a market cap of less than $6 billion, it was in distant fourth place relative to competitors like AT&T and Verizon. The company\u2019s trajectory changed in 2013, when it rebranded as the \u201cun-carrier,\u201d seeking to distinguish itself from competitors by offering simplified pricing structures, more flexible contracts, and a host of other customer perks. Thanks to these and other shrewd moves\u2014notably its 2020 merger with Sprint, which gave it access to mid-band spectrum, crucial for 5G networks\u2014today, T-Mobile has a market cap of over $200 billion and more than 100 million customers, making it one of the largest and most valuable mobile carriers in the world.\n\nDespite this success, the company strives to retain the hunger\u2014and the mindset of \u201cpunching up at giants\u201d\u2014that enabled its rapid growth in the first place, T-Mobile US CEO and president Mike Sievert tells TIME. Sievert took the helm in 2020, having previously served as COO since 2015. \u201cWe have a bigger opportunity in front of us than we\u2019ve ever had, because we are a technology leader who's transformed from a telecommunications company to a tech company, and that gives us a new canvas on which to serve customers,\u201d he says.\n\nThrough partnerships with leading AI companies like OpenAI and Nvidia, T-Mobile, which TIME listed as one of 2024\u2019s 100 Most Influential Companies, is looking to define the next decade of connectivity. TIME spoke with Sievert in November about his vision for the company.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhen you interviewed Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this year, you spoke about inventing the future together. What kind of future are you trying to invent?\n\nGiven the level of influence that T-Mobile now has, we have a huge opportunity to craft the future of connectivity.\n\nIt's amazing to think about how important connectivity has become in our lives. Last week, we had a big storm here in Seattle, and we lost our power in our house, but we didn't lose our connectivity. The T-Mobile site nearest to us lost its power, but T-Mobile has this self-healing network, and it was able to reach us from a further away tower.\n\nI came to realize, if you made me choose between my power and heat or my connectivity, I\u2019d choose connectivity. I felt so good being able to make sure my kids were OK, my mom was OK, even though our lights were off. It underscores the essential nature of the service that we provide. That's why we're working with the world's best thinkers in the space to define what connectivity looks like a decade from now.\n\nNot surprisingly, it will be powered by AI technology: networks will optimize themselves in real-time to get you the very best possible signal, ensuring you're connected everywhere you go.\n\nWith Jensen, we\u2019re creating a future that we call AI-RAN [Radio Access Networks]. Right now, we have compute power at every one of our tens of thousands of network nodes all over the country, and we want to virtualize that into data centers\u201460 different data centers near the edge of our network\u2014so we get the efficiencies of being able to create a virtualized data center that puts all that compute power in one place.\n\nNetwork demands vary throughout the day. If we can use excess computing capacity to run AI workloads when network demands are lower, this opens up new potential for us to make the network better for users.\n\nWhat does it mean to virtualize the network into data centers? How does this make things better for users?\n\nIn our core business, AI-RAN has the potential to allow the network to self-correct in real time, which is going to be more important as payloads rise. AI will radically increase the demands on our network, so it's going to become increasingly important that we stay ahead of that rapidly rising demand.\n\nFor example, let's say, in the future, you're in a spot uploading high-def video to an AI cloud, to help you process the world around you, and a big truck moves between you and the tower you're communicating with. You're in motion, and the world's in motion. The network will reconfigure itself to keep that stream uploading.\n\nWe believe AI workloads will create an important role for edge clouds. Right now you have two kinds of workloads: you have the massive cloud workloads, which are very helpful where massive compute is needed. They're giving you textual responses, and sometimes photos and videos, but they\u2019re mostly taking in simple voice or text inputs. There's a lot of latency to that as it comes down from a central cloud. Secondly, there's AI that runs locally on your device. And these are both very different from each other.\n\nWe think there will be a \u201cGoldilocks demand\u201d as, for example, LLMs will emerge to be much more about video and photos and audio going in both directions. To process what it's seeing in real time, it needs to have the best of both worlds: a cloud-like compute capability, while remaining very close to the end user. So we think this will create an opportunity for edge clouds.\n\nNow, we don't have a business model around this yet. I rolled out a multi-year plan for the capital markets day that was financially exciting, and it includes zero for this. But we see it as a big opportunity, one of many now that T Mobile has a massive footprint and technology capabilities we didn't have just a few years ago.\n\nWe're making a bet that AI applications in general, as they become more immersive, will benefit from a Goldilocks architecture like I'm describing. That might be right, or it might be wrong. The great news for our financial picture is it doesn't matter\u2014we're going to build it anyway, because it makes our core business so much better.\n\nYou\u2019ve partnered with OpenAI to develop \u201cIntentCX\u201d, a platform that uses AI to figure out what customers need and act on it in real-time, which is set to launch in 2025. What do you think is the ideal customer experience?\n\nPart of it is, we want to remove pain points. Being a great provider of wireless service means you shouldn't have to interact with us much. We should prevent problems in the first place.\n\nIn 2023, we had the best year ever in terms of \u201cchurn\u201d: people leaving T-Mobile. But because we're so big, 8 million people left us. Think about that: 8 million people! I'm a pilot, so I\u2019ll use a pilot metaphor: every one of them fell down an \u201caccident chain\u201d. With every one of them, we did something wrong, which wasn't enough for them to quit, and then we did something else wrong, and then something else, until finally they threw up their hands and left. Every one of them left a breadcrumb trail of data behind on what exactly went wrong, and what we could have done to prevent it.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve done nothing with this data. We've never even looked at it. But we've spent a lot of the last two years reorienting our data estate so that for the first time, AI can be trained to look at all this\u2014network data, billing data, interaction and experience data, and other data about you\u2014at one time, so that we can see the breadcrumbs.\n\nWe will have advanced bots that blow your mind and do great things. But it's not about putting bots between us and our customers. We see this technology and ask ourselves: could we create an experience for our customers that's so great that they love us more?\n\nT-Mobile recently unveiled a plan to evolve from a \u201cchallenger\u201d to a \u201cchampion.\u201d What does that entail?\n\nManaging a team of people who have created so much success together over the last decade, one of my biggest leadership challenges is: how do you keep everybody hungry, humble, unsatisfied, and striving for the future? How we do that has changed.\n\nLittle old T-Mobile, when we were a fraction of the size of our principal competitors, created a culture of punching up at giants on behalf of customers, and created a turnaround that we called the \u201cun-carrier\u201d, because we're unlike those giant companies. And we always told ourselves, one day, we'll be as big or bigger than those other guys, but we must never become them: companies that basically hate customers, take them for granted, are motivated by old-school ideologies, and aren't risk taking or interesting. How do we keep all that in a time when we're successful?\n\nThat's what \u201cchallenger to champions\u201d is about. Instead of just trying to right wrongs created by other companies, can we create new norms that nobody ever thought of before? Things like: could we be the first to provide direct-to-cell service, working with SpaceX, so that we can have the end of dead zones and your mobile phone could be directly connected to a custom low Earth orbit satellite system? We announced that intention two years ago, and we're about to launch it. Another example is \u201cT-Priority\u201d: using advanced 5G technology to provide first responders across the nation with the world's only dedicated 5G slice for first responders. What's required of us in this challenger to champion era is to pioneer and innovate things that other companies couldn't do.\n\nIn a recent earnings call, you mentioned T-Mobile\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d How would you describe that?\n\nPart of what has defined us over the last decade is that we do what we say, and in our industry, we're the only ones. If you were to watch our Capital Markets Day in 2021, and then you watched everybody else's from around that time, we're the only company still working on the things we said. Investors and the public and customers love this about us. We're reliable, and that takes a company that can execute.\n\nYou also have to be able to look around corners. And maybe we were lucky, maybe we were good. But a lot of our success has been that we called the ball on 5G. The whole world, except us and Sprint, thought that 5G would be about new gadgets, not your smartphone, and that they would be connected by a technology based on millimeter wave spectrum. As recently as 2018, everybody was building assets for that future.\n\nAnd we looked at it, maybe because of our \u201clove our customers\u201d value, and said that's not what customers want. They want their smartphone to work everywhere they go, at least 10 times faster and better than it does today. And the technology to get us there is mid-band technology in a multi layer 5G network. So we went after Sprint, which had this treasure trove of mid-band spectrum, but a stressed-out business model that wasn't able to take advantage of it. Arguably, that's been the most successful merger in telecommunications history, because it created this company.\n\nWe were right about what 5G would be. Everybody else has seen that and is scrambling to catch up, but they're a few years behind. It's important to try to see around corners again\u2014we're determined to get the next era right as well.\n\nDoes anything about the future of AI make you apprehensive?\n\nI'm worried about not moving fast enough. These technologies are rapidly changing how we engage with the world of computing and with each other. Companies that are able to see that unfolding, make some bets, and intercept it, are going to be the winners. One question people have about AI right now, at least financially, is \u201cis it all a bubble? Will it turn out AI is better at poetry and humorous photos than creating value?\u201d My belief is that no, this is no AI bubble, but it'll be up to companies like T-Mobile to be customers of it, and to demonstrate at scale how it can transform our relationship with customers.\n\nIf the T-Mobiles of the world don't show giant breakthroughs from the technology, then the benefits will be delayed. So it's up to people like us. That's one of the reasons companies like OpenAI and Nvidia want to partner with us. They see that we're ahead, and they\u2019re as interested as we are in demonstrating real value for end users that improves their lives, and creates financial value for everybody involved.\n\nWe can already see the potential. After two years of working on it, one of the aspirations that I unveiled in September was to reduce person-to-person problem-solving and customer service interactions by 75% within a three-year period.\n\nAnd that's going to happen\u2014we're well on our way. We have a detailed quarter-by-quarter plan that is absolutely on track, and a lot of that value is already dropping in. That's one of many metrics that I unveiled. We're demonstrating to ourselves that this is real, partly because we've laid all the track. We've got the data estate in order. We have our T-Life app out the door. We're going to get the hardest part done in 2025. Once we've moved into big elements of delivery, I think we will have broken the back of this opportunity in the next 12 months, and we can taste that right now.\n\n(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and decisionmakers, click here.)"

Israel was involved in four conflicts in the region, including with Hamas in Gaza and Iran. Peace remained elusive in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine that began over two years back read more\n\nA displaced Palestinian woman, Makram Hamdouna, carries a water container outside her shelter, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip December 19, 2024. Reuters\n\n2024 was a year of war. The wider conflict in West Asia and Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine made headlines throughout the year. Data by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) shows that an estimated 233,000 people were killed in conflicts this year.\n\nIsrael\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed a year in October. The Jewish state reached a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah in Lebanon to end 13 months of fighting. Israeli strikes are pounding against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTensions mounted between Iran and Israel, with both sides launching tit-for-tat attacks. The shadow war between the two countries has burst into the open since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel last October.\n\nAfter 13 years of civil war, Syria saw the fall of its dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Since his ouster, Israel has launched a bombing campaign on the West Asian country.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine entered its 1,000th day on November 24 this year. Even after over two years, there is no end in sight to the conflict.\n\nIn our yearly wrap, here is a look at the conflicts around the world.\n\n1. Israel was engaged in four wars in West Asia this year. On October 7, 2024, Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed one year. It was on this day last year that the Palestinian militant group\u2019s surprise attack on the Jewish nation changed West Asia and the world. We explain how Hamas\u2019 attack was a turning point in the region.\n\nThousands have died in Israel and Gaza since the war began last year. Many hostages taken by Hamas fighters last October remain captive in Gaza. Israel\u2019s relentless strikes on the narrow enclave have taken a mental toll on innocent civilians, especially children. We take a look at how the conflict has affected children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael achieved its biggest victory in the war by killing its enemy no 1, Yahya Sinwar. Israel had accused Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 attack. Here\u2019s what we know about the man dubbed \u201cbutcher of Khan Younis\u201d.\n\n2. West Asia inched closer to a wider war in the region as Israel and Iran carried out tit-for-tat missile strikes. In October, Israel launched three waves of overnight strikes on Iran in retaliation to Tehran launching at least 180 missiles into Israel earlier that month.\n\nIran had said its attack against Israel was in response to the assassination of the Lebanese group Hezbollah\u2019s leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut, and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there is a lull in tensions now, we explore who has the bigger and better military.\n\n3. Israel intensified attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon, with the group blaming the West Asian country for exploding pager and walkie-talkie attacks that killed or wounded thousands of its members.\n\nSmoke rises following an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in Beirut, Lebanon, November 26, 2024. File Photo/AP\n\nIn November, the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement, ending monthslong conflict that has taken the lives of over 3,700 people. The deal brokered by the United States calls for a 60-day halt in fighting. However, within a week of the fragile truce, there were mutual accusations of violations. Will the ceasefire hold? We explain in this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, a part of Iran\u2019s so-called Axis of Resistance, have been targeting commercial and military ships linked to Israel and its allies in the Red Sea since Israel launched its war against Hamas last October.\n\nThis year, Israel escalated attacks against the rebel group, with the Houthis claiming to target the Jewish country with drones and ballistic missiles. Find out about this rebel group in Yemen in this report.\n\n5. After 13 years of civil war, Syrian rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in just a matter of a few days. With Assad fleeing to Russia, the horrors of his regime are coming to light. Since his ouster, families have been desperately searching for their loved ones who went missing after being detained by the secret police. His regime is believed to have killed and buried more than 100,000 people in mass graves. The horrors have just begun to unravel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile insurgents have taken control of Damascus, Israel has carried out a volley of airstrikes in the country. Targets have included air defence systems, fighter jets, missile depots, weapons production sites and so on.\n\nIt is also planning to expand its settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, citing threats from Syria. We take a look at why Israel is eyeing the strategic plateau and why it is targeting the West Asian country.\n\n6. It has been over two years since Russia invaded Ukraine. Death and devastation followed after Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed his nation, announcing a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine on February 24, 2022. World powers, including incoming US President Donald Trump, have called for a ceasefire. However, peace has so far remained elusive.\n\nTensions could further escalate after Ukraine claimed responsibility for killing a top Russian general in a bomb blast in Moscow. Here\u2019s who he was.\n\nThis is all we have for you in our yearly roundup. If you like the way we explain hot topics from around the globe, you can bookmark this page."

Strategists polled by Bloomberg reckon not, forecasting Wall Street to triumph again in 2025.\n\nWhile some see President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies as a plus for the Magnificent Seven, their consistent profit growth is likely a bigger draw.\n\nEarnings are forecast to rise about 15.7% next year, versus the 9.9% expected for the Granalos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn a period of time when macroeconomic growth has been pretty unexciting and other sectors have had their challenges, that reliability of earnings delivery has given the market confidence in US tech,\u201d said Iain Barnes, chief investment officer at Netwealth Investments Ltd.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t see that from other markets,\u201d he added. \u2014 Bloomberg"

Now, it holds stories from 2,000 years ago that are now on display at Pullman Yards, where an extraordinary exhibit titled \"Discovering the World of Jesus: Ancient Treasures from the Holy Land\" opened on Dec 3.\n\nThe exhibition, showcasing over 350 artifacts from the private Golan Collection, promises visitors a visceral journey through the time of Jesus, from His birth to the Resurrection.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nFor Golan, an Israeli engineer and antiquities collector, the exhibit reflects a life-long passion.\n\n\"I started collecting antiquities at the age of 9,\" he said, recounting his discovery of what would later be identified as the earliest dictionary in the world, written in cuneiform.\n\n\"Israel is the best place to search for antiquities. Every stone, every object has a story to tell.\"\n\nFor the first time, Golan's renowned collection has left Israel to embark on a U.S. tour, offering visitors a rare opportunity to connect with objects illuminating the daily lives, culture and faith of those who lived in Jesus' time.\n\n\n\nAmong the highlights in the exhibit are ossuaries attributed to James, Jesus' brother, and the priest Zacharias, believed to be the father of John the Baptist. Among hundreds of other objects are lamps, sandals, coins, and even stone vessels that are thought to resemble the cup used during the Last Supper.\n\n\n\n\"We have the earliest images of the Nativity story from a church from the fourth century A.D., and the earliest description of the Holy Sepulcher, the place where the tradition claims the place where Jesus' body was put into the cave and then resurrected,\" Golan, who is Jewish, said.\n\n\n\nJames Tabor, a retired professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and a scholar of Christian origins, told CP the exhibit bridges a crucial gap between text and history.\n\n\n\n\"It's fabulous,\" he said. \"As a historian, I work primarily with texts \u2014 Dead Sea Scrolls, manuscripts. But when you combine those texts with archaeology, it's transformative.\"\n\n\n\nTabor, who has excavated in Israel for decades, sees the exhibit's immersive approach as a game-changer. Rather than presenting artifacts in isolation, \"Discovering the World of Jesus\" tells a chronological story complemented by audio and visual effects.\n\n\n\n\"You walk through history, from Herod the Great to the crucifixion and beyond. You get a feel for what life was like. What lamps did they use? What dishes did they eat from? How did they bury their dead? This exhibit answers those questions in ways no textbook can,\" he explained.\n\nFor many visitors, the exhibit promises to challenge long-held assumptions. For example, the manger in which Jesus is said to have been laid at birth was likely not a wooden crib, but a stone trough.\n\n\"These artifacts correct misconceptions we don't even know we have,\" Tabor said. \"The Bible comes alive in a tangible, material way.\"\n\nNo artifact stirs more awe than the James Ossuary, whose Aramaic inscription identifies it as belonging to \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\"\n\nIts authenticity, Golan explained, has been verified through rigorous chemical and microscopic testing, which confirm the inscription dates to the first century. Still, skeptics have debated its significance, questioning whether this James is the same man identified in the Gospels as Jesus' brother.\n\nDespite the debate, Tabor said the statistical evidence surrounding the ossuary is compelling.\n\n\n\n\"We've analyzed the likelihood of someone with this combination of names living in Jerusalem at the time. It's extremely rare. The probability is overwhelming that this is the James from the New Testament,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that the ossuary also serves as a rare physical link to Jesus' family.\n\n\n\n\"If this is James' ossuary, then his family members likely stood before it, mourning his death,\" Tabor said. \"It's the closest thing we have to a direct connection with Jesus.\"\n\n\n\nThe exhibit also serves as an immersive, family-friendly experience. Visitors will encounter ancient coins minted by Pontius Pilate, crucifixion nails that highlight the brutality of Roman execution and sandals worn by children in first century Judea. A short film, \"Daily Life in the Time of Jesus,\" offers a visual narrative that complements the artifacts.\n\n\n\nOne particularly striking piece is a stone cup, similar to the one used during the Last Supper. Golan said the cup \"wasn't made of gold or covered in diamonds, as some might imagine.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was a simple stone cup, used during Passover by Jewish people in Jerusalem,\" Golan said. \"The specific one we display has traces of fire damage, possibly from the destruction of Jerusalem, just as Jesus predicted during His life.\"\n\nGolan contended that the pieces are keys to understanding a shared past and bringing the Bible to life in a powerful way.\n\n\"When you hold an artifact from the time of Jesus, you are connecting with history in a deeply personal way,\" he says. \"You can almost feel the lives of the people who made them.\"\n\nTabor agreed, emphasizing the significance of immersing oneself in Bible history.\n\n\"When my students excavate in Israel and pick up a lamp or a shard of pottery, they're often amazed. 'Could Jesus have touched this?' they ask,\" Tabor stated. \"It's a profound moment. This exhibit captures that feeling for everyone.\"\n\nGolan hopes the exhibit will inspire curiosity and deepen understanding, regardless of one's religious beliefs.\n\n\"This isn't just for Christians,\" he said. \"Jesus was a Jewish man who lived in a Jewish world. Understanding his time helps us understand the shared roots of our faith and history.\"\n\nAt the end of the exhibit, visitors are invited to write prayers and leave them on a symbolic tree. These prayers will be transported to a church in Galilee, near where Jesus is believed to have grown up. Golan said the tree serves as a fitting conclusion to a journey that begins with ancient artifacts and ends with a personal connection to faith and history.\n\n\"Jesus lived in a real world. This exhibit helps us see that world \u2014 the sights, the sounds, the objects \u2014 and that makes the story more human, more powerful, and more real,\" Tabor said.\n\n\"Discovering the World of Jesus: Ancient Treasures from the Holy Land\" is now open at Pullman Yards in Atlanta. Tickets are now available online, with additional U.S. tour stops to be announced in the coming months."

While there's no direct connection to Jesus, it represents the type of vessel he and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, would have used. This provides valuable insight into the fishing industry and maritime life in Galilee during that period.\n\nDiscovered in 1986 on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, this fishing boat dates back to roughly the time of Jesus.

The Madaba Map: While dating to several centuries after Jesus's life (6th century AD), the Madaba Map, a mosaic discovered in Jordan, provides the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It offers a valuable visual representation of the region's geography during the Byzantine period and helps us understand the landscape and urban layout of cities like Jerusalem during the Roman and Byzantine eras."

Donald Trump says. Shoot first and ask questions later. Speculation is for suckers.\n\n\u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country,\u201d the president-elect posted on Truth Social. \u201cCan this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThe government says not to worry. Which, of course, is what worries people the most.\n\nUntil most recently, the official response has been sketchy, sluggish and anything but helpful or reassuring.\n\nAs of last week, thankfully, the feds finally were providing a coherent reaction.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, The Associated Press reports, the Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flights in 30 areas in New York and 22 in New Jersey, through mid-January. FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials say their agencies are looking into the sightings but have seen little evidence to suggest safety or security threats.\n\nWhat most people are seeing, officials say, are law-abiding, garden-variety drones. Or airplanes. Or helicopters. Or stars.\n\nThese are plausible answers. But many Americans remain unconvinced.\n\nThere are, of course, lots of precedents for our tin-hat predilections. \u201cYes, they can control the weather,\u201d a member of Congress posted on X only weeks ago, presumably about members of the other party. A vaccine denier may soon head the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Then there was a spate of clown sightings in 2016. (You can look it up.)\n\nBut the most famous was the \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d a 1938 radio drama about a Martian invasion based on H.G. Wells\u2019 science fiction novel that some Americans mistook as the real thing.\n\nIt all sounds like an episode of the \u201cX-Files,\u201d the popular old Fox series in which a pair of mismatched FBI agents delved weekly (9 Eastern, 8 Central Time) into monsters, aliens and labyrinthine conspiracies.\n\nSpecial agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder were an odd coupling of \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you\u201d-ism versus \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me-\u201d-ism. Mulder was the true believer, Scully the skeptic.\n\nI\u2019m more Scully than Mulder.\n\nI live in a neighborhood near enough to PTI Airport and far enough from city lights that the night sky is often vast and dark enough to reveal twinkling stars and a constant array of air traffic, some of it close and bright enough to resemble gliding Christmas trees.\n\nOccasionally, an aircraft headed for PTI will appear to be a UFO, sitting silent and still in the heavens. But it\u2019s always an illusion, a plane approaching head-on that only appears to be hovering until it turns toward the runway and you can hear the roar of its engines.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve hoped for a UFO sighting, just for the thrill of it. But I\u2019ve yet to see even one.\n\nAs for the mass hysteria over drones, it\u2019s another sign to me of the blessings of not living in a war-torn place like Gaza or Ukraine, where drones are ubiquitous and deadly, armed with missiles, bombs and bullets.\n\nSo, for now, at least, I\u2019m not buying the Drone Conspiracy.\n\nIn the end, maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. (Scully was in the \u201cX-Files.\u201d The aliens turned out to be real, as did many of the monsters of the week.)\n\nOn a more serious note, the ebbing faith in government and other institutions (insurance companies, media, big business, schools and universities) is for real and it is disturbing and unhealthy.\n\nWhen the center does not hold, things fall apart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a lot scarier than blinking lights in the night."

This year proved no exception to the rule, either. In the last year, researchers discovered long-lost shipwrecks, odd animals, and even a phenomenon known as \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d among many other finds.\n\n\u2018Ghost Ship of the Pacific\u2019 found using underwater drones\n\nThe USS Stewart rests about 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nIt only took a few hours for a team of 20-foot-long autonomous submersible drones to relocate the USS Stewart after 78 years spent at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The \u201cfour-piper\u201d destroyer ship was the only vessel captured by Japanese forces during World War II, and earned its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker after numerous Allied troops sighted it deep behind enemy lines. Although eventually returned to the US Navy and scuttled, its exact location remained a mystery for years. Now, however, we know the extremely well-preserved remains lay off the California coast in the Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary.\n\nShipwreck hunters find WWII-era merchant ship that sunk in Lake Superior\n\nThe wheel of the Arlington, about 600 feet underwater. Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society\n\nAlthough also dating back to the WWII era, the Arlington wasn\u2019t involved in combat when it sank. The 244-foot bulk carrier was instead a merchant vessel sailing Lake Superior en route to Owen Sound, Ontario. Inclement weather, however, caused the ship to take on water in the early hours of May 1. While Captain Frederick \u201cTatey Bug\u201d Burke insisted his crew stay the course, the sailors had other plans, and soon abandoned Burke to his\u2014and his ship\u2019s\u2014ultimate fate. Like the USS Stewart, the Arlington was located using remote operating submersibles and sonar scans.\n\nNew, colorful starfish species found off the coast of Japan\n\nThe newly discovered Paragonaster hoeimaruae. There are many types of starfish and this one is particularly adapted to living in sandy, muddy waters, a feature the researchers want to learn more about. Credit: \u00a9 I. Kobayashi\n\nThere are around 2,000 cataloged starfish species in the world, but that list grew by at least one new variety in 2024. Discovered by researchers off the coast of Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula, Paragonaster hoeimaruae, is only the second starfish known to belong to the Pseudarchasteridae family. The strikingly orange sea creatures are especially adapted to live in muddy, sandy waters\u2014an evolutionary trait researchers hope to learn more about in the coming years.\n\nGrumpy-faced fish species found in Red Sea\n\nThe grumpy dwarfgoby is endemic to the Red Sea and lives in small holes and crevices in coral reefs. Viktor Nunes Peinemann\n\nWhile similarly as orange as Paragonaster hoeimaruae, Sueviota aethon arguably features a much more noticeable physical trait: the diminutive fish possesses a downturned mouth that makes it look permanently displeased. Its face seems so irritated that it even earned it the common name of the grumpy dwarfgoby. The roughly one inch long fish live among the coral reefs of the Red Sea\u2019s Farasan Banks near Saudi Arabia. Even at that size, however, discoverers describe the grumpy dwarfgoby as a \u201cfearsome predator\u201d given its comparatively large canines used to capture and devour small invertebrates.\n\nWWII submarine discovered 81 years after disappearing during secret mission\n\nThe HMS Trooper disappeared in 1943 with all 64 of its crew. Credit: YouTube / Planet Blue\n\nIt took at least as many as 14 attempts over nearly 25 years, but researchers finally located the wreckage of the HMS Trooper in 2024. The WWII Allied submarine and its 64 crew members deployed on a secret mission near Greece in early October 1943, but never arrived in Beirut as originally scheduled. Researchers used both sonar and an ROV called \u201cSuper Achille\u201d to identify Trooper\u2019s whereabouts, as well as confirm its fatal run-in with a German mine. Trooper lays in three separate parts an estimated 830-feet-deep at the bottom of the Icarian Sea, near the Greek island of Donoussa.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest coral formation is longer than a blue whale\n\nA diver from National Geographic Pristine Seas measures the world\u2019s largest coral colony in the Solomon Islands. Photograph by Manu San F\u00e9lix, National Geographic Pristine Seas\n\nThe biggest animal in the world may be the blue whale, but researchers in 2024 determined that the biggest intertwined community of animals is undoubtedly the recently discovered Pavona clavus coral colony. Measuring in at 111 feet wide, 104 feet long, 18 feet high, and 600 feet around, the standalone coral system formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean over the last 300 years, and can even be seen from space.\n\nNew ghost shark species found in New Zealand\n\nThe newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish, Harriotta avia. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)\n\nGhost sharks, also known as \u201cspookfish,\u201d technically aren\u2019t sharks, but instead are a group of fish that are closely related to the ocean predators. One of the newest additions to the family this year was Harriotta avia, described as having an \u201celongated, narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes; and very long, broad pectoral fins\u201d as well as possessing \u201clovely chocolate brown color.\u201d But don\u2019t expect to encounter one in the open waters\u2014Harriotta avia lives near New Zealand at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 8,350 feet below surface waters.\n\n\u2018Dark oxygen\u2019 on ocean floor may rewrite the origins of life\n\nThe formations can be found as deep as 20,000 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Wikipedia Commons\n\nOne of the wildest underwater discoveries of 2024 wasn\u2019t a new species of life, but chemical processes that might rewrite our understanding of the origins of life itself. Earlier this year, researchers published findings related to polymetallic nodules\u2014natural mineral deposits located on the pitch-black ocean floor. Despite lacking sunlight, however, evidence suggests these formations appear to function as \u201cgeobatteries\u201d capable of generating trace amounts of oxygen that help sustain deep-sea life. If true, then the planet\u2019s very first living organisms may have gotten their start in a place no one once thought could support life at all.\n\nNew jellyfish discovered near Japan may contain multitudes of venom\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross medusa is about four inches wide, three inches long, and has about 240 tentacles. Dhugal John Lindsay/JAMSTEC\n\nLike many other similar species, the newly found St. George\u2019s cross medusa lives around 2,300 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, and hunts bioluminescent prey with its many tentacles. Unlike its relatives, however, Santjordia pagesi packs an \u201carsenal of venoms\u201d that differs from other known jellyfish. Unfortunately, it might take a little while before researchers start gleaning more information on the creature\u2014it\u2019s difficult to gather more specimens given the jellyfish lives in a deep-sea volcanic caldera about 285 miles south of Tokyo.\n\nResearchers discover neurological mechanism controlling anglerfish lures\n\nFrogfish belong to the larger anglerfish family, and use their front fin as a lure. Credit: Deposit Photos\n\nAnglerfish aren\u2019t a new find for researchers, but biologists did confirm a surprising evolutionary feature in the odd-looking animals this year. Using tracer analysis, a team discovered the exact motor neurons that control one of the subspecies\u2019 front dorsal fin lure. It appears the location of these motoneurons shifted during their evolution compared to their relatives, pointing to evolutionary implications that reach all the way to landwalking vertebrates.\n\nOver 100 possible new ocean species found near Chile\n\nDuring an expedition off the coasts of Chile and Rapa Nui, scientists spotted a bony Chaunacops fish swimming in the waters of Chile\u2019s Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe 1,800-mile-long Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge near Chile is home to some wild creatures that look like they just arrived from an alien planet. Earlier this year, researchers used a remote operated submersible to survey the region and documented over 100 candidates for never-before-seen species. These included crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and even marine mammals. Biologists also glimpsed extremely rare animals, such as the whiplash squid."

            "article_content": "The Great Mystification.\n\nTwo concepts call for socialist meditation, because they imply problems of permanent urgency: utopia and revolution. Rarely have these two problems been examined in their relationship of reciprocal affirmation and negation, i.e., in their dialectical relationship, except to reject them wholesale or accept only one term: whoever posits revolution seems to exclude or reject utopia; and conversely, whoever posits utopia seems to reject revolution. Such, at least, was the attitude of nineteenth-century socialist thinkers. In the twentieth century, the debate had found some scope for confrontation up until the First World War, without going beyond the ideological quarrels periodically renewed between Marxists and non-Marxists, or between anarchists and Marxists. Since then, there has been silence: the tumult of contemporary history has rendered inaudible any voice urging renewed discussion. And yet, if ever the idea of a socialist humanism required reflection, it is today, when under the name of socialism, or even humanism, regimes are developing that reproduce and amplify the defects of capitalism, while trampling underfoot the democratic conquests of bourgeois revolutions, long considered the condition for socialism. It took an incredible perversion of language and logic to succumb, often with total good faith, to the most vulgar propaganda, and to believe that today's world is really divided into two camps, the \u201csocialist\u201d camp and the \u201ccapitalist\u201d camp. All regimes, no matter how acute their conflicts of interest, propagate this alleged division as an article of faith. Western regimes eagerly acknowledge the socialist character displayed by their Eastern rivals, for they thereby gain a considerable propaganda benefit: they discredit socialism, by showing that so-called socialist regimes deceive the masses in their aspirations for a dignified and free life. In turn, these regimes spare no effort to make their people believe that the material and moral conditions in which they live are (or soon will be) superior to those of the masses under the yoke of capital. If religious consolation is much less the opium of Western peoples than it once was, the new narcotic offered to the peoples of Eastern Europe is called Marxism. Words neither live nor die like human beings; their meaning is transformed according to the intentions and interests of those who manipulate them. By a harmful and strange alteration of their meaning, words can mean the opposite of what they originally meant. Such is the case with the word socialism. Created at a time when industrial mechanization was ushering in the era of mass misery, it denoted the hope of a new society, the desire for a better way of life: utopia as tomorrow's reality. The nascent socialist and communist schools discussed and refined its content, and in February 1848, an anonymous pamphlet printed in London predicted, along with the fatal ruin of class society, the coming of the communist city defined in these terms: \u201cAn association where the free development of each is the condition of the free development of all.\u201d (The Communist Manifesto.) Nothing resembles this definition less than the contemporary world. Yet we manage to make people believe that part of our globe is now communist or moving towards communism. And, in a supreme perversion, regimes where people are relatively less free and where the police state has more rights over the individual than in capitalist countries are called socialist. In this way, Utopia is desecrated and the values of socialism are scorned.\n\nIt is said and believed that, since the Russian Revolution of October 1917, the world has entered a new era: the era of socialism; that since the Second World War, a third of the world has become socialist, and that the two wars made this revolutionary transformation possible. Those who say or think this generally choose a single criterion to justify this thesis: the abolition of private property, known as the socialization of the means of production. This thesis is opposed by another: there is no socialism in today's world. What we call socialism, by misuse of language, is in reality nothing more than a new form of exploitation and oppression of man by man: state property, which is just as murderous as private property; we should call it state capitalism.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that the legal regulation of property rights by state power is either the means or the end of a socialist order. If we disregard the legal forms that appear to regulate human relations, and stick to these relations themselves, what do we find? Simply that the human status of so-called socialist countries is fundamentally, essentially the same as that of capitalist countries.\n\nIf things have turned into a dialogue of the deaf, if this perversion of language has been able to take place so easily, it's because another word has suffered a similar fate: revolution. Revolutions have taken place; social structures have been violently overturned, but the character of these upheavals is obvious: in reality, they are nothing more than economic revolutions, which constitute an aggravation of the phenomena that the pioneers of socialism denounced as \u201cthe exploitation of man by man\u201d. If the debate between the \u201cfree world\u201d and the \u201csocialist world\u201d were merely a matter of words, it wouldn't be worth our attention. But behind this verbal quarrel lies a vital issue of our time. Can humanity survive without the disappearance of the social institutions that currently burden and regiment it? In other words, is human life still possible under the domination of the state and capital? This question, it seems to us, should be at the heart of any debate on socialist humanism.\n\nBack to Basics.\n\nMarxism is not the entire ideology of socialism. Nor is it all its thought. Both in its ethical aspects and in its theoretical claims, socialist thought can be traced back to the industrial revolution that began in England in the last third of the 18th century. From the outset, it had all the hallmarks of a new gospel, a message of earthly liberation and salvation, in a word, a new ethic. However, however visionary the first socialists or communists of the industrial age may have seemed, they had a fairly clear conception of the means that could lead to the realization of their dream goal. Thus, for William Godwin, social metamorphosis could only result from a revolution of reason, whereas for Gracchus Babeuf, reason could only be imposed by violence, and therefore folly: proclaimed at first as a legal action, the revolution, because of the closure of the Pantheon club, became the business of a \u201csecret directoire\u201d, charged with acting \u201cby and for the people\u201d. Babeuf's plan was to seize power \u201cin order to hand it over to the people\u201d. But steps had to be taken, as the people, called to the polls, were capable of bringing back tyranny. It was therefore necessary to make them capable of exercising sovereignty.\n\nIrresistibly, once on this slope of impatience and \u201cprovisional\u201d authority, Babouvism thinks of revolution as organized warfare, conducted according to the rules of the art: hierarchy, discipline, obedience, command, specialist strategy and so on. It's a revolution directed from above, by a general staff or a group of experts, in the expectation that it will be remade from below, or at least that those below will take over once the enemy has been defeated and power conquered. Such is the ambition of Babouvism, and it will reappear with Auguste Blanqui and his followers: honesty and good intentions are given as pledges to the still ignorant people, reduced to the state of inert matter or, more precisely, a mass of maneuver in the battle to defeat the enemy. Violence organized and directed from above is the essence of the Babouvist credo. Its humanism is in the intention, the goal, the utopia; it's not in the means, unless you consider the acts of vengeance perpetrated by the revolting masses as manifestations of a will to liberate: it's the purpose of violence that humanizes violence, since it aims to establish a society without violence.\n\nThe danger and weakness of this conception lies in the impossibility of foreseeing and judging, of choosing and evaluating methods and attitudes from a humanist perspective. From Babouvism to Bolshevik Marxism, the lineage is direct and sometimes openly acknowledged. Utopian socialism returns to the tradition of humanist rationalism that predates the French Revolution. For Saint-Simon, the spiritual heir of the Encyclopedists, political power, capable of reason and reform, plays only a secondary role. The \u201cNew Christianity\u201d is the ethics of power, which will no longer be political, but administrative (stewardship). This economic-social Christianity, the science of production, is, in short, industrialism for the benefit of mankind, the guarantee of bread, politics replaced by industrial organization, whose sole aim is to \u201censure the freest development of the faculties of all men\u201d. This is Saint-Simon's spiritual testament.\n\nUtopians claim to reform society in the name of reason and science. Robert Owen has a sense of reality, and his socialism is experimental: cooperation is the beginning and the end of the solution to social problems. Owen lacked the sumptuous delirium of Charles Fourier; he was unimaginative and his doctrine was reduced to a few elementary ideas, one of which was essential: man is what his environment makes him. Yet this pioneer of cooperative socialism was always in the breach, calling for spontaneous effort, distrust and even hostility towards the powerful, the rich and the rulers. If socialism means cooperation, then Owen was the first socialist. And if Marx's socialism is ultimately the cooperative system or mode of production, it's because he was Owen's disciple.\n\nKarl Marx.\n\nMarx did not abolish utopia; on the contrary, he renewed its meaning, broadening its sphere of application. For him, utopia becomes a single, two-stage process: revolution-creation. Before him, utopians had imagined and thought about creation independently of the men by whom the new city was to be built; at most, they had counted on an elite. Marx saw men first: \u201cWe know that to do useful work, the new forces of society need to be mastered by new men: such are the workers.\u201d (Address to a Chartist meeting, April 1856).\n\nInitially a disciple of Fourier and Owen, and soon deeply involved in the political struggle, Marx never broke the spiritual ties that bound him to the socialist utopia. In this respect, it's enough to read the clarification he was about to provide, two years before his death, to the Russian populists who asked him for his opinion on the chances and prospects of the peasant commune in the face of the threat of capitalism's penetration of Russia. At no point in this long and painful reflection does Marx tackle properly political problems, such as class constitution or party organization. Instead, he concentrates on the original characteristics of the archaic institution of the rural commune, and its importance as a \u201cregenerative element of Russian society\u201d and as an \u201celement of superiority over the countries enslaved by the capitalist regime\u201d. It's easy to recognize, in this apology for the \u201clocalized microcosm\u201d that for Marx is the Russian commune, the final tribute he pays to Robert Owen, pioneer of cooperative and communitarian socialism. Marx, like his utopian predecessor, puts all his trust in the creative spontaneity of those who produce society's wealth without really enjoying it. He attributes to the primitive commune the virtues of a social microcosm. In this idealization of a still little-known institution, we recognize the projection into the future of a desire-image. It's no coincidence, then, that Marx embraced the Owenian utopia. The cooperative commune he imagined responds to the problem we posed above, that of the opposition between the Jacobin (political) conception and the conception we now call, for greater clarity, communalist of the workers' movement. In the former, the initiative for awareness and action is attributed to' political avant-gardes placed at the head of easily-maneuverable crowds; in the latter, any political elite is deemed superfluous, as the reduced dimensions of the action group allow it to dispense with any stable, and therefore \u201cprofessional\u201d, representation. The delegation of power is not the abandonment of a right, but the handing over of a temporary and imperative mandate for well-defined representative tasks.\n\nIn a sense, Marx is the most utopian of utopians: unconcerned about future society, he is solely concerned with the destruction of present society. But he elevates revolution to the level of a total requirement.\n\nIt is the mechanism of this imaginary or imagined revolution that is utopian: it presupposes men capable of thinking the whole of social criticism, the whole of socialism, men aware of their \u201cgolden\u201d misery.\n\nFor Marx establishes the economic law of pauperization, which is harder to grasp than naked, unphrased misery. He implants the utopia of the future in the struggle of the present, and proposes a dialectic of workers' revolution: if the proletariat is capable of wanting and making its revolution, socialism will be given to it by surcro\u00eet, in other words: by becoming aware of their state of alienation (in the profound sense that Marx gave to this Hegelian term), workers are both capable of destroying capitalist society and building utopia: a society without state, without classes, without money. From then on, Marx's conception of revolution contained a strange paradox: it was at the height of misery that workers were supposed to become aware of the need for total revolution, for a regenerated society. Strange \u201cmaterialism\u201d that conceives of such a spiritual metamorphosis of the slave broken by a pitiless machine, reduced himself to the state of a cog in the great industrial mechanism operating with a single aim: profit.\n\nIt was from these masses of disinherited people, and not from an intellectual elite, that \u201ccommunist consciousness\u201d was supposed to \u201cemanate\u201d (The German Ideology). The psychological process is thus reversed: bourgeois intellectuals can only become communists by rising to the level of the revolutionary consciousness of slave-workers.\n\nSuch is the paradox of the workers' movement. Yet the theory remains coherent: Marx distinguishes between socialist consciousness and socialist science. This science (theory) is only possible and necessary as a function of the real movement of the working class, which is a two-faceted process: awareness and political action.\n\nBy giving itself political representatives, the proletariat proclaims its determination to overturn the existing established order, by recourse to the force of law or the laws of force, depending on the circumstances: \u201cThe proletariat constitutes itself as a class and therefore as a political party\u201d, declares the Communist Manifesto, clearly showing that this is a spontaneous act of creation and awareness by the proletarians, in no way an adhesion to constituted parties outside their ranks. The bourgeoisie is a constituted class whose unity is cemented by the profit motive. The proletariat constitutes itself as a class by forging its unity and cohesion through the struggle to defend its immediate interests and its awareness of a revolutionary goal. This is what Marx formulated in a single sentence that is the implicit postulate of all true socialist thought, enunciated as early as 1844 by Flora Tristan: \u201cThe emancipation of the workers will be the work of the workers themselves.\u201d\n\nUnions, parties and councils are all forms of working-class organization, which only exist as spontaneous, conscious creations of the working class. The proletariat constitutes itself by organizing its struggle, but the workers who make it up must not abandon themselves to elite bodies (or parties) that claim to guide them and prescribe their political and social objectives.\n\nThis is the idea frequently taken up by Marx and Engels in their criticism of party men who, coming from the bourgeois intelligentsia, set themselves up as political guides for the workers. Certainly, intellectuals have a role to play in the workers' movement, but they can only fulfill it effectively by bringing to the movement \u201celements of culture\u201d, and by no means a ready-made theory or philosophy, an esoteric doctrine of the march and ends of history, a dialectic of revolutionary action. This was Marx's deepest thought, even if his attitudes as a man and as a \u201cparty leader\u201d did not always conform strictly to the principle of workers' self-emancipation, even if, through the use of certain political means, he sometimes betrayed this principle.\n\nMarxism judged by Marx.\n\nThe real problem lies not in antinomies such as anarchism and Marxism, Marxism and reformism or Marxism and revisionism; it lies in the opposition of Jacobinism and self-emancipation. It lies in the following question: can social classes retain the autonomy of their action and consciousness by relying on representative organizations, chosen and appointed to express and defend their interests?\n\nThis question contains a dangerous equivocation: can a social class have a conscience, a will, an action? In other words, can it think, will and act in any way other than through \u201cdemocratically\u201d elected representatives, commonly appointed to represent, i.e. express, the will and thoughts of a collectivity? If so, isn't formal or tacit approval of the delegates' decisions and actions the only proof that the group's will and the behavior of its representatives are in accord?\n\nTo ask the question in this way is to answer it. But this answer does not provide the whole solution. Indeed, it implies the answer to another question, a corollary of the first: under what conditions of effectiveness can the delegation of a mandate result in a real \u201crepresentation of interests\u201d?\n\nPre-Marx socialist thought focused primarily on resolving this question. Its solution was the description and definition of the \u201cideal\u201d society. Marx accepted this legacy, and enriched it. His protest was not directed at the substance, but at certain aberrant aspects of so-called utopian socialism. The producers' commune, the cooperative enterprise, the unity of work and culture - in a word, the city liberated from the state and money - represents, in Marx's eyes, the resurrection, at the level of modern technology, of the archaic rural commune, the basis of primitive communism.\n\nAs for the Jacobin conception of the workers' movement, in both its reformist and revolutionary forms, the historical experience of the first half of our century has confirmed its definitive bankruptcy. When Lenin broke the ties he had maintained with Karl Kautsky's ideas until the First World War, he invoked the impotence of the workers' movement in the industrially advanced countries, where the proletariat had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by an aristocracy drawn from its own ranks. The material and moral conditions for a revolutionary movement, on the other hand, were given in an industrially backward, mainly peasant country like Tsarist Russia. It was here, as in countries under colonial yoke, that the process of socialist revolution could be triggered, if not completed: the misery of the masses was a sufficient guarantee against the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of ambitious, comfort-hungry workers' avant-gardes. To theoretically justify this recourse to classical conceptions of the role and vocation of the social elites, the concept of \u201cpermanent revolution\u201d was borrowed from Marx's terminological arsenal. This concept, reinforced by Lenin's idea of the \u201claw of uneven development\u201d, became the key to the new ideology with its Marxist flavour.\n\nIn truth, Lenin's and his party's theoretical and practical approach was simply the artificial grafting of a revolutionary-minded elite of bourgeois intellectuals onto a convulsing social mass. Its genuinely revolutionary aspirations could easily be exploited by an apparatus of professional revolutionaries for whom Jacobin methods of government held few secrets. The result was not long in coming: having established the presence of a state of \u201cdyarchy\u201d in Russian society liberated from tsarism, and having won the confidence of the soviets, which had spontaneously formed in opposition to the official government, the Bolshevik party succeeded in establishing itself as a monolithic state power. As in countries with an old capitalist tradition, a political \u201caristocracy\u201d aware of its interests and objectives had succeeded in replacing the \u201csocial microcosms\u201d which, according to Marx's theory and utopia, arise spontaneously from the soil of any society in a state of evolution and historical transformation.\n\nMarx may often have overestimated the political factor in the workers' movement, but he never thought for a moment that the working class should surrender to the dialectical wisdom of a party or an elite of political professionals. As we have seen, for Marx, the utopia of revolution is an ethic of revolutionary behavior. The economic and spiritual alienation of the workers is the fundamental cause of the revolutionary act, as well as the central motive for the creative action of the new social order. The proletariat is the direct subject of this transformation, but it is also its object, since it abolishes itself as a wage-earner.\n\nToday, \u201cMarxist empires\u201d are founded on the exploitation of proletarianized masses, forced to perform economic tasks dictated by state plans which, as in liberal capitalist regimes, maintain and reinforce the hierarchy of functions and incomes.\n\nEvery line of Marx, as of his precursors and masters, belies the so-called socialist regimes of our twentieth century.\n\nConclusion.\n\nUtopia and revolution are the two historical coordinates of the workers' movement, the two modes of intuition of socialist thought: utopia is the dimension of space; revolution is the dimension of time. In other words, to become a reality, the socialist movement must think of itself as utopia and revolution, one inseparable from the other. It also means that socialist man must assert himself simultaneously as utopian and revolutionary. Revolution and utopia appear as the normative foundations of the socialist ethic, inseparable from each other. To be a socialist, you have to want revolution and utopia; you have to want the abolition of existing types of society and desire the creation of the new city. Implicit in most socialist doctrines, this ethic has marked and continues to mark many thinkers who claim to be socialists, communists or anarchists. To varying degrees, it has enriched the thinking of Owen and Fourier, Marx and Engels, Proudhon and Bakunin, Sorel and Kropotkin, Oscar Wilde and Gustav Landauer.\n\nBut it must not be confused with the thought \u2014 explicit or implicit \u2014 of a single mind, however brilliant. Socialist ethics is the spirit of the entire workers' movement, of the socialist movement as a whole. To confuse it with the work or thought of a single individual is to betray the impersonal spirit of the ethic of the workers' movement.\n\nSocialist humanism is the ethic of revolution and utopia. Socialism is a historical necessity only insofar as it is thought of and willed as an ethical necessity. This is what Marx meant when he posed the dilemma: \u201cThe proletariat is revolutionary or it is nothing!\u201d And we add, to give socialist ethics its full meaning: socialism is utopian consciousness or it is nothing."
