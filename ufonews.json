FOX 5 New York\n\nManhattan Alien Abduction: 35 years later\n\nOne of the most famous \u2014 or infamous \u2014 alleged close encounters in the city is now the subject of \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction\u201d on Netflix, with Linda Napolitano\u2019s claims the subject of as much attention as they were doubt.\n\nNapolitano, then 41, lived with her husband and two sons in an apartment near the Brooklyn Bridge at the time of the alleged abduction 35 years ago.\n\nThe native New Yorker said that on the night of Nov. 30, 1989 she was lifted out through her apartment wall in a beam of light, soared above the East River into the sky over Manhattan, and into a clam-like alien spaceship that appeared to contain volcanic fire.\n\nNapolitano shared her story with Budd Hopkins, a ufologist who was in the midst of documenting a case study centered around what he believed to be a credible individual.\n\n5 Manhattan resident Linda Napolitano claimed she was abducted by aliens in 1989. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe alleged abductee\u2019s hypnotic regression in the days after the event is shown in the docuseries.\n\n\u201cOh I feel like electricity just went through me,\u201d Napolitano says in one exchange with her eyes closed and Hopkins leaning over her, head in his hand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone in the room,\u201d the allegedly hypnotized Napolitano says in the footage.\n\n5 Napolitano\u2019s alleged alien encounter was featured in the Netflix documentary series \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction.\u201d Courtesy of Netflix\n\nShe then describes being lifted through her solid door, floated in the air in her nightgown, and drawn into a fiery clam.\n\nInterview footage, both contemporary and from the early 90s, show witness accounts of varying credibility and veracity. Many critics later poked holes in her claims.\n\nThe Mysterious \u2018Near Miss\u2019\n\nA commercial plane had a \u201cnear miss\u201d with a cylindrical object off the coast of New York that has yet to be identified or explained, according to Congressional testimony from Pentagon representatives from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\nAn airline crew reported to the Federal Aviation Administration that their commercial plane \u2014 from an unnamed airline \u2014 had a \u201cnear miss with a \u2018cylindrical object\u2019 while over the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d\n\nThis undated encounter was just one of more than 20 reports made over the past year that have stumped AARO investigators, with agency director Jon Kosloski describing them as \u201ctrue anomalies.\u201d\n\nKosloski revealed to a congressional oversight committee that the agency received 757 reports of sightings from May 1, 2023 and June 1 of this year.\n\nThe \u201cclose call\u201d off the coast of New York is considered one of 21 anomalous cases that require further investigation, according to the agency.\n\nJohn Lennon\u2019s close encounter\n\n\u201cImagine\u201d that: John Lennon reported seeing a UFO in New York on Aug. 23, 1974.\n\nThe famed singer-songwriter said in an interview after the event that he had seen an unique aircraft zooming around the East River from his apartment.\n\n\u201cUp there, I saw a UFO,\u201d Lennon said to an interviewer, pointing to his penthouse apartment that overlooks the water.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd it went down the river, turned right at the United Nations, turned left, and turned down the river.\n\n5 John Lennon claimed to have seen a UFO in New York City in 1974. Photo by Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a helicopter, and it wasn\u2019t a balloon, and it was so near,\u201d Lennon said, animatedly to the interviewer.\n\nLennon described the craft as being \u201csilent\u201d and \u201cdark.\u201d He said it was round, black or gray in the middle, with blinking lights that looked like \u201clight bulbs\u201d circumscribed on the sides, and was completed with a red light on its top.\n\nLennon tried to take photos of the craft \u2014 none of which came out legibly \u2014 and even called the cops, who said they had received other calls about an object flying through the sky, according to The New Daily.\n\nLennon also commemorated the occurrence in the liner notes of his album \u201cWalls and Bridges,\u201d writing, \u201cOn the 23rd Aug. 1974 at 9 o\u2019clock I saw a U.F.O.\u201d\n\nLatest mystery\n\nEarlier this week, a local news station aired video that incidentally showed a mysterious orb appearing to zoom down the Hudson River.\n\n5 The blue orb was caught on camera during a helicopter news report. FOX 5 New York\n\nA local report on congestion pricing aired a random four-second clip of the lower Manhattan skyline, the Hudson River and parts of New Jersey.\n\n\n\nIn that clip, a mysterious blue orb can be seen apparently zooming down the Hudson River and past the camera.\n\nAvi Loeb, a theoretical physicist, cosmologist and Harvard professor, believes the apparent orb is a trick of the lights.\n\n\u201cThis is most likely an optical artifact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera, namely a bright spot from the reflection of sunlight as the camera gradually changes its orientation relative to the sun and the ground,\u201d Loeb tells The Post.\n\nOthers believe that it was a physical object merely affected by the speed of the helicopter and the angle of the camera."

            "article_content": "In the new horror movie, \u201cHeretic,\u201d Hugh Grant plays a diabolical religious skeptic who traps two scared missionaries in his house and tries to violently shake their faith.\n\nWhat starts more as a religious studies lecture slowly morphs into a gory escape room for the two door-knocking members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, underscoring just how well-suited religion can be for terrifying and entertaining thrill-seeking moviegoers.\n\n\u201cI think it is a fascinating religion-related horror as it raises questions about the institution of religion, the patriarchy of religion,\u201d said Stacey Abbott, a film professor at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, whose research interests include horror, vampires and zombies.\n\n\u201cBut it also questions the nature of faith and confronts the audience with a debate about choice, faith and free will.\u201d\n\nHorror has had a decades-long attraction to religion, Christianity especially in the U.S., with the 1970s \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Omen\u201d being prime examples. Beyond the jump scares, the supernatural elements of horror and its sublime nature pair easily with belief and spirituality \u2014 and religion\u2019s exploration of big existential questions, Abbott said. Horror is subversive. Real-life taboo topics and cultural anxieties are fair game.\n\n\u201cIt is a rich canvas for social critique and it can also be a space to reassert traditional values,\u201d Abbott said in an email.\n\nDeath, demons and other tough topics religion and horror address\n\nReligions and horror tackle similar questions about what it means to be human \u2014 how people relate to one another and the world, said Brandon Grafius, a Biblical studies professor at Ecumenical Theological Seminary in Detroit and an expert on Christianity and horror.\n\n\u201cSo much of religion is about how we grapple with the reality of death. \u2026 Helping us make meaning even in the face of that reality,\u201d said Grafius. \u201cHorror really serves that same process, as a way to reflect on death.\u201d\n\nNot only does Christianity translate well for U.S. audiences, it has a lot of raw material for moviemakers to work with, he said.\n\n\u201cChristianity emerged as a strongly dualistic religion, where forces are either good or evil,\u201d Grafius said. \u201cEven though the U.S. is moving away from being a nation dominated by Christianity, we still have that dualism deep in our bones.\u201d\n\nAmong the more recent religion-themed horror films, \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d franchise, including \u201cThe Nun\u201d movies, show paranormal investigators battling demons, Abbott said, while \u201cThe First Omen\u201d and \u201cImmaculate\u201d offer critiques of patriarchal attempts to control women\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cThese films seem to be a direct response to many of the debates that are happening in the U.S. these days,\u201d Abbott wrote in her email. \u201cThese different approaches to religion in horror illustrate the way in which the genre is engaging with a very live debate around religion or more specifically how religion is being used to assert control (which is what \u2018Heretic\u2019 is all about).\u201d\n\nGrant, who plays Mr. Reed in the new movie, told The Associated Press that he shared some of his \u201cHeretic\u201d character\u2019s skepticism, although not necessarily from a religious perspective:\n\n\u201cThere is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit.\u201d\n\nHorror can be challenging. It acts as a dark mirror that can reveal things people don\u2019t want to admit and fears they don\u2019t want to face, said the Rev. Ryan Duns, a Jesuit priest and theology chair at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\nIf done well, both religion and horror are unsettling, he said.\n\n\u201cReligion, when it unsettles, asks us am I living up to the person I have been called to be or am I complicit in systems of violence, oppression, injustice, going with the status quo,\u201d said Duns, who wrote the \u201cTheology of Horror\u201d and teaches a course on it as well. \u201cIn the horror movie, the monster threatens normality \u2014 threatens to destroy our status quo.\u201d\n\nBut they deviate from there. In horror, there is no way out, Duns said. He pointed out that defeating a movie\u2019s monster doesn\u2019t prevent sequels, hence \u201cJaws 2,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d \u201cReturn of the Killer Tomatoes\u201d and more.\n\nIn Christianity, it is Jesus and the Gospels threatening the status quo, but they offer hope and a way out, he said.\n\nTi West mixes religion into the narrative of his new movie, \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d a horror film about an adult film star trying to break into mainstream movies. West, who also wrote and directed \u201cThe Sacrament,\u201d a horror movie inspired by the Jonestown Massacre in 1978, said he doesn\u2019t actively set out to tell stories with prominent religion narratives, but religion can be ripe for mining.\n\n\u201cIt kind of depends on the story,\u201d West said, \u201cAnything with morality wrapped up into it, they kind of go hand in hand at times. And it\u2019s like religion is such a major part of every culture everywhere that \u2026 I feel like sometimes it\u2019s such a major part of life that gets put aside in movies.\u201d\n\nWhen religion works in horror \u2014 and when it doesn\u2019t\n\nBeyond poor storytelling, the mixing of horror and religion can go wrong if the movie is meant to offend the believers of a particular faith, said Lisa Morton, an award-winning horror author whose written books on Halloween and paranormal history.\n\nBut it can really go right. Morton\u2019s all-time favorite movie is \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a holy horror icon and a peak example of the genre. \u201cThe Omen\u201d followed it.\n\n\u201cAll of the contemporary bloodlines kind of trace back through those two,\u201d said Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how they keep getting rebooted over and over.\u201d\n\nAbbott agrees religion should be portrayed respectfully, just as she expects accuracy and respect for science in movies, though not every detail needs to be perfect. \u201cBut some horror films, like exorcism movies, are built upon the fact that they are drawing upon real rituals and then taking them to a more extreme conclusion,\u201d she said.\n\nOsgood Perkins, who wrote and directed \u201cLonglegs,\u201d a horror movie about an occultist serial killer, invented the religious material in his film, piecing together whatever felt right from his imagination and real life.\n\n\u201cI just make it up,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cBut then you catch hold of something like the Bible verse and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this is really rich.\u2019 Beasts coming out of the sea with heads and horns and crowns and things like that. I didn\u2019t make that up.\u201d\n\nFor Duns, an accurate portrayal of religious rituals and symbols \u2014 without over doing it \u2014 can add heft to a scene.\n\n\u201cThe rituals of the churches have been stylized and lived out for centuries,\u201d Duns said. \u201cWhen movies are silly or are sloppy with it, the power of the gesture and the power of the symbols are lost.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Krysta Fauria contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

            "article_content": "Jon M. Chu\u2018s Wicked, the first of a two-part adaptation of the celebrated Broadway musical, enters the cinematic landscape with high expectations and a dazzling cast. The story reimagines the Land of Oz, chronicling the rise and fall of Elphaba Thropp, who becomes the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, and her poignant friendship with Galinda Upland, later Glinda the Good. While the film successfully captures the musical\u2019s grandiosity and emotional beats, it occasionally falters in its pacing and storytelling cohesion.\n\nA Vibrant World of Oz:\n\nFrom the opening sequence, Wicked immerses viewers in the whimsical yet politically charged world of Oz. Jon M. Chu brings a cinematic grandeur to the setting, rendering the Emerald City as a vibrant metropolis brimming with life, while Shiz University exudes academic mystique. The production design and visual effects are impeccable, blending fantastical elements with tangible textures that evoke the wonder of the stage show.\n\nThe musical numbers are the film\u2019s undeniable highlight. Stephen Schwartz\u2019s iconic songs, including \u201cThe Wizard and I\u201d and the soaring anthem \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d are given new life through lush orchestration and Chu\u2019s dynamic direction. The camera work enhances the choreography, sweeping through scenes with a kinetic energy that pulls the audience into the heart of each performance. However, there are moments when the visual spectacle overshadows character intimacy, leaving quieter emotional beats feeling slightly underdeveloped.\n\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande:\n\nCynthia Erivo\u2019s portrayal of Elphaba anchors the film with emotional depth and raw vulnerability. Her performance captures Elphaba\u2019s complex journey from an outcast with dreams of acceptance to a determined figure fighting against injustice. Erivo\u2019s rendition of \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d is a show-stopping moment, her voice carrying the weight of Elphaba\u2019s transformation while embodying her unyielding spirit.\n\nAriana Grande\u2019s Glinda is also absolutely incredible and brings a huge sense of charm and silliness to the film. She makes for a perfect pairing with Elphaba, who seems like the polar opposite to her in virtually every way. Grande\u2019s comedic timing and facial expressions had my entire theatre rolling with laughter, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Don\u2019t be surprised if Grande gets nominated at a lot of awards ceremonies coming up here.\n\nThe chemistry between Erivo and Grande is central to the film\u2019s success, and while their bond is believable, it sometimes lacks the nuance that makes their friendship both poignant and tragic. Moments of shared vulnerability feel rushed, as if the film is more eager to progress the plot than delve into their connection.\n\nSupporting Cast and Performances:\n\nThe supporting cast brings their own flair to the film, though not all are given equal opportunity to shine. Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero is charming but underutilized, his character\u2019s arc feeling more like a subplot than a pivotal thread. Michelle Yeoh commands attention as the manipulative Madame Morrible, delivering a performance that oozes calculated menace. Meanwhile, Jeff Goldblum\u2019s Wizard offers a fascinating blend of charisma and duplicity, though his character\u2019s motivations could have been explored more thoroughly.\n\nMarissa Bode, in her film debut as Nessarose, brings a quiet intensity to her role, creating a compelling dynamic with Erivo\u2019s Elphaba. Peter Dinklage\u2019s brief but impactful appearance as Dr. Dillamond lends gravitas to the film\u2019s exploration of discrimination and systemic oppression.\n\nNarrative Strengths and Weaknesses:\n\nOne of the greatest challenges Wicked faces is translating the musical\u2019s intricate plot into a cohesive cinematic experience. Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox\u2019s screenplay largely succeeds in retaining the essence of the stage production, but the film\u2019s pacing occasionally feels uneven. The first half deftly balances character introductions and world-building, but the latter portion rushes through key developments, sacrificing emotional depth for spectacle.\n\nThe film shines when it explores its core themes of identity, prejudice, and the corrupting nature of power. Elphaba\u2019s struggle to reconcile her otherness with her desire to do good resonates deeply, and the narrative\u2019s critique of propaganda and political manipulation feels especially timely. However, some subplots\u2014such as the romantic tension between Elphaba and Fiyero or the budding love triangle involving Nessarose\u2014lack the narrative weight they deserve.\n\nMusical Numbers and Direction:\n\nChu\u2019s handling of the musical numbers is largely effective, infusing each song with cinematic flair while honoring the source material\u2019s spirit. The choreography and staging of \u201cDancing Through Life\u201d are delightful, capturing the carefree charm of Fiyero\u2019s introduction, while \u201cI\u2019m Not That Girl\u201d delivers a poignant introspection into Elphaba\u2019s unrequited feelings.\n\n\u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d the film\u2019s centerpiece, is an undeniable triumph. Chu\u2019s direction elevates the iconic moment with breathtaking visuals and Erivo\u2019s commanding presence. The sequence encapsulates the film\u2019s potential, blending emotional stakes with awe-inspiring spectacle.\n\nHowever, not all numbers land with the same impact. \u201cPopular,\u201d while humorous, feels overly polished, losing some of the spontaneity that makes it a fan favorite. Additionally, the film\u2019s reliance on CGI occasionally detracts from the intimacy of character-driven moments, creating a sense of detachment during otherwise pivotal scenes.\n\nA Prelude to Part Two:\n\nAs the first installment of a two-part story, Wicked leaves many narrative threads unresolved. While this structure allows for a more thorough exploration of the source material, it also results in a somewhat abrupt ending that may leave viewers feeling unsatisfied. The decision to split the story is a double-edged sword, providing room for character development but risking a loss of momentum between films.\n\nOverall:\n\nJon M. Chu\u2019s Wicked is an ambitious adaptation that soars in its visual and musical execution but stumbles in its narrative cohesion. Cynthia Erivo\u2019s powerhouse performance as Elphaba and the film\u2019s stunning production design make it a worthwhile cinematic experience, even if it doesn\u2019t fully capture the emotional complexity of the stage musical.\n\nFans of the original production will appreciate the film\u2019s faithfulness to its source material, though newcomers may find its pacing and character arcs uneven. Ultimately, Wicked lays a strong foundation for its second installment, leaving audiences eager to see how Elphaba\u2019s journey unfolds.\n\nActing - 8/10 8/10\n\nCinematography/Visual Effects - 7.5/10 7.5/10\n\nPlot/Screenplay - 4.5/10 4.5/10\n\nSetting/Theme - 5/10 5/10\n\nWatchability - 5/10 5/10\n\nRewatchability - 2/10 2/10 Overall 5.3/10 5.3/10 Sending User Review 0 ( 0 votes)"

            "article_content": "A rock on Mars spilled a surprising yellow treasure after Curiosity accidentally cracked through its unremarkable exterior.\n\nWhen the rover rolled its 899-kilogram (1,982-pound) body over the rock back in May, the rock broke open, revealing yellow crystals of elemental sulfur: brimstone.\n\nAlthough sulfates are fairly common on Mars, this represents the first time sulfur has been found on the red planet in its pure elemental form.\n\nWhat's even more exciting is that the Gediz Vallis Channel, where Curiosity found the rock, is littered with rocks that look suspiciously similar to the sulfur rock before it got fortuitously crushed \u2013 suggesting that, somehow, elemental sulfur may be abundant there in some places.\n\n\"Finding a field of stones made of pure sulfur is like finding an oasis in the desert,\" said Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in July.\n\n\"It shouldn't be there, so now we have to explain it. Discovering strange and unexpected things is what makes planetary exploration so exciting.\"\n\nSulfates are salts that form when sulfur, usually in compound form, mixes with other minerals in water.\n\nWhen the water evaporates, the minerals mix and dry out, leaving the sulfates behind.\n\nThese sulfate minerals can tell us a lot about Mars, such as its water history, and how it has weathered over time.\n\nPure sulfur, on the other hand, only forms under a very narrow set of conditions, which are not known to have occurred in the region of Mars where Curiosity made its discovery.\n\nThere are, to be fair, a lot of things we don't know about the geological history of Mars, but the discovery of scads of pure sulfur just hanging about on the Martian surface suggests that there's something pretty big that we're not aware of.\n\nSulfur, it's important to understand, is an essential element for all life. It's usually taken up in the form of sulfates, and used to make two of the essential amino acids living organisms need to make proteins.\n\nSince we've known about sulfates on Mars for some time, the discovery doesn't tell us anything new in that area. We're yet to find any signs of life on Mars, anyway.\n\nBut we do keep stumbling across the remains of bits and pieces that living organisms would find useful, including chemistry, water, and past habitable conditions.\n\nStuck here on Earth, we're fairly limited in how we can access Mars. Curiosity's instruments were able to analyze and identify the sulfurous rocks in the Gediz Vallis Channel, but if it hadn't taken a route that rolled over and cracked one open, it could have been sometime until we found the sulfur.\n\nThe next step will be to figure out exactly how, based on what we know about Mars, that sulfur may have come to be there.\n\nThat's going to take a bit more work, possibly involving some detailed modeling of Mars's geological evolution.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nMeanwhile, Curiosity will continue to collect data on the same.\n\nThe Gediz Vallis channel is an area rich in Martian history, an ancient waterway whose rocks now bear the imprint of the ancient river that once flowed over them, billions of years ago.\n\nCuriosity drilled a hole in one of the rocks, taking a powdered sample of its interior for chemical analysis, and is still trundling its way deeper along the channel, to see what other surprises might be waiting just around the next rock.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in July 2024."

JB Pritzker, in a partnership with the University President Tim Killeen and Discovery Partners Institute, launched the Cannabis Research Institute on Nov. 15. The CRI, which is housed within the University\u2019s DPI, is a joint effort aimed at providing research and data to advance public knowledge on the medical and socioeconomic impacts of cannabis use.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Human Services granted the CRI $7 million in July, according to a press release. The CRI will receive the funding over the next three years.\n\nReginald Gaudino, director of the CRI, said Illinois provided a unique environment for cannabis research due to the state government\u2019s use of research to help guide state legislation surrounding cannabis.\n\n\u201cThere is a big difference in Illinois, and I think that has to do with Gov. Pritzker\u2019s approach,\u201d Gaudino said.\n\nGaudino, who used to work for Steep Hill, ran a cannabis research laboratory in California where he witnessed the development of state regulations surrounding cannabis. He said many of the programs surrounding cannabis usage and production were held up by lawsuits due to a lack of social equity.\n\nGet The Daily Illini in your inbox!

As part of a partnership with the University of Illinois at Chicago and a National Institute of Health grant, the CRI is researching whether cannabinoids can be used to help mitigate pain, especially in sickle cell disease and endometriosis patients.\n\nAccording to Gaudino, endometriosis and sickle cell disease share similar pain markers \u2014 biological and physiological indicators of pain \u2014 and tend to affect minorities and underrepresented populations.\n\nThe CRI is also working with Northern Illinois University to find applications of cannabis in cancer treatments. According to Gaudino, in a certain study, eight kids who had cancerous tumors and had them treated with a certain hemp extract all had tumor regression or elimination after the treatment.\n\n\u201cSo clearly, there\u2019s something in this particular hemp lineage that needs to be identified because it is either a compound or a combination of compounds that is responsible for this tumor regression and elimination,\u201d Gaudino said.\n\nThe CRI is also working with UIC to research the social equity impact of cannabis usage and production.\n\nThe CRI plans to engage with the community through \u201clistening sections,\u201d which it hopes will provide much-needed community feedback during this process of cannabis research. Gaudino also emphasized its priority to ensure listening sections are equally distributed around the state instead of in populous areas. In short, the CRI will gather input from areas outside of Cook County to ensure a fair survey of community sentiment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to plan this out in a way that allows us to have some listening sections around the state and ask some questions, then use that information to inform a request for proposals that would then allow us to identify the main research topics of interest,\u201d Gaudino said.\n\n[email protected]"

            "article_content": "Home Sellers, 'Start Cutting Prices Or It's Going To Be A Long Winter,' Says Reventure CEO\n\nThe housing market continues its downturn as mortgage applications hit their lowest levels in three decades, according to data issued by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).\n\nNick Gerli, CEO of Reventure Consulting, pointed to the reality on X, formerly Twitter, noting that current mortgage demand has fallen about 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. For sellers, the latest figures are a bad sign as they head into winter, with purchase applications down 49.7% from 2019 levels and 55.2% below 2020 numbers.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe downturn continues despite favorable conditions that typically boost market activity. Despite two Federal Reserve rate cuts \u2013 one in September and another in early November \u2013 and the election\u2019s conclusion, buyers remain hesitant to enter the market.\n\nBehind the reluctance is historically poor homebuyer sentiment. The University of Michigan Sentiment Survey data showed that most Americans \"believe that high interest rates are weighing down homebuying conditions.\"\n\nAccording to Gerli, the core issue centers on housing prices. Current home valuations have reached unsustainable levels relative to inflation and income, exceeding the 2006 housing bubble peaks when adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n\nThe disconnect between perceived value and listing prices drives potential buyers away.\n\n\u201cSo buyers look for a home they think should be $350,000. And it costs $500,000,\u201d Gerli said. \u201cAnd they immediately give up. Because they know the home isn\u2019t worth that amount.\u201d\n\nSee Also: Invest in $20+ trillion home equity market today across cities like Austin, Miami, and Los Angeles through a unique 5-year term fund targeting a 14-20% IRR with minimums as low as $2,500\n\nRecent MBA data supports Gerli's assessment. While overall mortgage application volume showed a minimal 0.5% increase last week \u2013 the first rise in seven weeks \u2013 the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 6.86%, up from 6.81%. Refinancing applications dropped 2% to their lowest point since May despite being 43% higher than the previous year.\n\nJoel Kan, MBA\u2019s deputy chief economist, notes some bright spots in specific market segments. Applications for FHA and VA loans showed respective increases of 3% and 9%, with FHA rates notably declining against the broader trend.\n\nThe regional nature of the housing market means some areas may fare better than others. Gerli noted the variations in price forecasts for 2025, particularly between markets like Florida and New York.\n\nFor sellers hoping to move properties this winter, the message appears clear \u2013 price adjustments may be necessary to attract buyers in the current market environment.\n\n\n\nMarket dynamics suggest a shift in buyer behavior outside of typical seasonal slowdowns, pointing to deeper structural challenges in the housing market that might require price corrections to resolve.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Home Sellers, 'Start Cutting Prices Or It's Going To Be A Long Winter,' Says Reventure CEO originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

            "article_content": "Apple stamped its entry into the AI era this year with the release of Apple Intelligence. But 2024 also marked the year when Apple\u2019s staggered release plan for feature updates was also slower than usual. 2025 might not be much different.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple has pushed an unspecified number of features that were otherwise supposed to arrive with the iOS 19 update next year. Earlier this week, the outlet also reported that a planned Siri upgrade that would give it more conversational chops has been delayed until spring 2026.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\u201cI\u2019m told that a larger-than-usual number of features scheduled for iOS 19 (beyond the new Siri) are already postponed until spring 2026 (when iOS 19.4 debuts),\u201d says the Bloomberg report. The theme isn\u2019t too different from what Apple has followed so far with iOS 18.\n\nMerely weeks after the WWDC 2024 conference in June, it was reported that the company had delayed some of the most promising Siri and Apple Intelligence features. Some of those features, including the promised integration with third-party apps, are yet to arrive and are expected to roll out publicly next year.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, a senior Apple executive hinted that the company is taking a cautiously slow approach to releasing new features in the Apple Intelligence stack.\n\n\u201cYou could put something out there and have it be sort of a mess. Apple\u2019s point of view is more like, \u2018Let\u2019s try to get each piece right and release it when it\u2019s ready,\u2019\u201d SVP of Software Engineering at Apple, Craig Federighi, told the outlet.\n\nNow, Apple Intelligence hasn\u2019t quite run into the same kind of problems as rival products like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Gemini, or Microsoft\u2019s Copilot. Generative tools like those mentioned above already have their own set of inherent problems, such as hallucinations, blatantly making up inaccurate facts, and going haywire.\n\nIn his experiment with Google\u2019s Pixel Studio app, Digital Trends\u2019 Joe Maring witnessed the app generating deeply problematic images, such as a Nazi-influenced SpongeBob.\n\nThis well-documented error-prone nature of Generative AI products might also explain why Apple has been on the fence about going all-in with AI stuffing into its software. Unsurprisingly, Apple Intelligence has mostly stuck with low-stakes scenarios instead of chasing ambitious goalposts with a high-risk, high-rewards caveat.\n\nAt the same time, Apple also risks lagging behind the competition. The likes of Google and Microsoft have already integrated their respective AI tools at the heart of popular products like Workspace and Office 365, alongside OS-level integrations here and there.\n\nWe are still over half a year away from getting a taste of what Apple has planned for iOS 19. Moreover, multiple iOS 18 features that were showcased months ago at Apple\u2019s annual developers conference are still in line for a public release.\n\nLooking over at the competition, Google is now planning to showcase its own big innovations in roughly the same time frame as Apple. The company has already released the first Developer Preview of Android 16 and aims to reach platform stability in the first half of the year.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Google aims to spoil Apple\u2019s glitzy June event covering yearly software updates, or so assures the search giant. However, with Apple\u2019s feature cadence reportedly running into delays, Google has a chance to wow smartphone enthusiasts with new software tricks ahead of Apple."
