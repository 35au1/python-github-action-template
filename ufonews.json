        "article_content": "Trump's second term in office could be good news for UFO enthusiasts, Nick thinks\n\nThere could be \"seismic\" consequences for UFO disclosure after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States for the second time. Nick Pope, who once worked for the Ministry of Defence's UFO department, told the Mirror Trump's presidency is the \"perfect storm\". He explained: \"It's the perfect storm: a maverick, populist President in his second term, and \u2013 thus \u2013 not up for re-election.\" Pope added that Trump's unique standing could provide an unprecedented opportunity for transparency. He went on: \"For those in the UFO community who believe there's been a decades-long conspiracy to cover up the truth about an alien presence, Trump in his second term offers the best-ever hope for pushing back against the Deep State and delivering Disclosure.\"\n\nNick is regarded as one of the leading lights in UFO research\n\nHis views tie in with previous speculations that official revealings regarding extraterrestrial contact may coincide with the forthcoming Inauguration Day in January. Nick, a staunch critic of governmental secrets and manipulation, has showcased his opposition through his latest documentary, Apocalypse Covid, which aims to uncover \"the flawed response and government overreach during the pandemic\". US-based Nick suggests that Trump has been hinting at being privy to significant secrets regarding extraterrestrial contact. He added: \"I believe Trump views the subject in the same way as he views the JFK files, where, if there's top secret information still being withheld, it should be declassified and released. \"Trump released most of the JFK files in his first term and has essentially undertaken to release the rest early in his second term. As he seems to link the two issues, there's a strong possibility of bombshell UFO information being released early in 2025, soon after his inauguration.\"\n\nTrending\n\nTrump has often hinted that he knows something about extraterrestrials\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

(Channel 5)\n\nWhat did you miss?\n\nBen Fogle admitted his latest New Lives in the Wild Revisits turned \"weird\" as he listened to the story of a UFO encounter.\n\nThe 50-year-old TV presenter revisited 82-year-old twins Bill and Bob Stone who live in the canyons of Utah and are conspiracy theorists. Fogle was concerned for their health and safety being so isolated and cut off from health services, and somewhat disturbed by their paranoia at being attacked by outsiders.\n\nBut he admitted his day got even \"weirder\" as Bill told him about how they had been visited by a UFO.\n\nWhat, how and why?\n\nBen Fogle met twins Bill and Bob Stone who live in the canyons of Utah. (Channel 5)\n\nFogle has been making the Channel 5 show about people who have chosen to leave the rat race and live off grid for 10 years. And in the new series, New Lives in the Wild Revisits, is returning to see how they are getting on. In the latest episode he returned to the elderly twins to find Bob's health has deteriorated and Bill is now a fulltime carer for his brother.\n\nFogle asked if much had happed since his last visit. Bill told him: \"Not much, except that UFO that landed over there.\" Fogle replied: \"Whoah?! You saw a UFO? How do you know it was a UFO?\"\n\nBill told him: \"Landed right down there with that cedar tree by the house. What else was it? It did not make any noise at all. They just had a whitish bluish glow to it like static electricity going around it all the time. That had it lit up.\n\n\"I was sitting reading the magazine and Bob started stoking the floor and pointing and I thought, first thought he was having another heart attack he kept pointing out. So I got up out of the chair and looked down. Here comes this whatever this thing was, lands on the other side of the cedar tree right by the house.\"\n\nThe brothers then showed Fogle an image of an alien Bob had carved onto a rock.\n\nFogle said: \"I should say Bill and Bob are not alone in their experiences. That said, I do worry that aliens are just one more thing for Bill and Bob to feel anxious about. The day just got a little bit weirder. There's a lot of eccentricity here, but it's tinged with sadness 'cause there is a very real paranoia and I think a lot of that paranoia is born through news, they consume. But, you know, there's a sparkle of mischief as well and there's something kind of charming about that.\"\n\nRead more: Ben Fogle\n\nWhat else happened on New Lives in the Wild Revisits?\n\nBen Fogle said he felt a strange connection to Bill and Bob Stone. (Channel 5)\n\nBill also showed Fogle a cave filled with food provisions the 82-year-old had gathered, in preparation for the 'end of the world'.\n\nFogle said: \"This is my third time visiting Bill and Bob and I think what I think is they really like this. They like the game, whether there's an enemy that's real or not.\n\n\"It's not for everyone. And I don't want to be disrespectful. Maybe, you know, maybe they're right. But I don't know whether they are waiting for that moment or they hope it never happens. Possibly thinks that they've just enjoyed the process.\"\n\nBen Fogle said he had learned from Bill Stone's eccentricities. (Channel 5)\n\nBut despite not agreeing with their opinions, Fogle said he felt a \"strange connection\" to Bill and Bob.\n\nHe said: \"All these people who I've visited over the last 13 years or so have changed me profoundly. I feel incredibly lucky to have met such an eclectic bunch of people who I would never normally have had a chance to meet because I feel they've put my own life into perspective.\n\n\"And it's easy to come and meet the Bill and Bobs and to kind of laugh at prepper lifestyle that they've lived. But there's many Bill and Bob's out there. It's opened my eyes to a whole new world and it makes you think differently and I'm not about to go home and buy a cave and fill it with guns and food. But I do look at people differently and that is all. Thanks to the Bill and Bobs of this world. I owe them a lot.\"\n\nBen Fogle's New Lives in the Wild Revisits airs on Channel 5 on Tuesday."

        "article_content": "\"The Man Who Loved UFOs\" is a satirical foreign film that just landed on Netflix and hailing from Argentina that takes a nostalgic approach to the subject of flying saucers and the hysteria, fear, and misinformation these sightings spawn. It might not be on your immediate radar, but it demands a viewing for its semi-comedic examination of the nature of hype, media fabrications, and the need to believe.\n\nDirected by Argentinian filmmaker Diego Lerman and starring Leonardo Sbaraglia and Sergio Prina, this inspired production centers around the true tale of eccentric TV journalist Jos\u00e9 de Zer, who in 1986 ventured to a remote village where strange lights and a hillside burn mark were reported. When he discovers all is not as it seems, he invents an elaborate UFO hoax to create the best-known audiovisual recording on the existence of extraterrestrials in the history of Argentinian television, in turn boosting his own level of fame along with the TV station's ratings.\n\nIn the wake of its world premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival in September, this interesting indie sci-fi film has found a home on Netflix where it debuted on Oct. 18. The English dub is sub-par so we'd recommend watching it with the default Spanish accompanied by English subtitles.\n\nLeonardo Sbaraglia stars in \"The Man Who Loved UFOs.\" (Image credit: Netflix)\n\nWhen de Zer is approached by a pair of mining company owners with a business proposal to drum up interest in their town by using purported paranormal sightings as a means to attract tourists and raise real estate values, he and his cameraman Chango pack their bags and travel to the site of the UFO phenomenon near the small mountain village of La Candelaria in the province of C\u00f3rdoba,\n\nOnce in the rustic town, de Zer and Chango take a horseback ride up to investigate a mysterious circular mark burned into the grassy foothills of the nearby mountain, purported to be the landing zone of an alien craft. The site is surrounded by local villagers and police and a grizzled man who claims his grandson witnessed an alien encounter that turned his hair white.\n\nLerman (\"Refugee,\" \"A Sort of Family\") co-wrote the script with Adri\u00e1n Biniez and their narrative takes real-life events and blurs the line between fiction, dreams, and reality with equal measure.\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\n\"Well, this is a film that I wanted to do for many years,\" Lerman told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I used to spend vacation time in Cordoba where the story takes place, so I remember stories, and I always wanted to write something about it. I remembered the character of Jose, so I started researching and that made me think that there was an interesting film to do about him and the origin of fake news, for example.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"It is also a film about beliefs, the mystery of what can be or not be, the sense of life or the mystery of death. So underlying, in a more serious way, is a film about that: belief, what you can call religion, or whatever you want, whatever you choose.\"\n\nOnce back at the TV studio with the initial footage, de Zer's boss is apprehensive about this sort of sketchy tabloid entertainment material, but the aging reporter convinces him that there's journalistic gold in broadcasting a fantastical story as counterprogramming to all the usual economic and political turmoil.\n\nWhen the hype machine kicks into high gear and this UFO story goes global, de Zer and Chango must keep cultivating more sensational footage and evidence by recruiting reluctant residents and urging them to recite pre-rehearsed statements, unearthing phony rock paintings, planting dead beetles, and gathering squealing goats for effect. As pressure mounts to continue the charade after ratings soar, de Zer suffers exhaustion, visions, depression, and a definite touch of madness.\n\nA scene from \"The Man Who Loved UFOs.\" (Image credit: Netflix)\n\nPortraying the obsessed investigative journalist de Zer, Sbaraglia turns in an exceptional performance in this compelling and sometimes uneven film that delves into the most famous case of paranormal journalism in the history of Argentinian television. It was a true media circus that attracted considerable attention by the public at the time, though few can recall its impact in those innocent pre-internet days. The movie does get a bit lost in its own drama, but never loses its charm.\n\nAre we alone? Perhaps, but not with this provocative foreign film as a temporary companion. \"The Man Who Loved UFOs\" is currently screening exclusively on Netflix."

        "article_content": "Moor Studio/Getty Images\n\nMicrosoft is getting ready to expand the reach of its Copilot feature set, bringing its AI capabilities to Office apps for anyone currently subscribed to Microsoft 365 Personal or Family.\n\nToday, those features are only available with an extremely pricey Copilot Pro subscription. For Personal and Family subscribers, the upgrade costs an extra $20 monthly, which is more than double the cost of the basic Microsoft 365 subscription.\n\nAlso: Microsoft Copilot vs. Copilot Pro: Is the subscription fee worth it?\n\nAccording to an announcement from Microsoft Asia, the company is making Copilot part of all Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. As part of the deal, those subscriptions will also get access to the Microsoft Designer app for generating images. According to the announcement, current subscribers will automatically get access to Copilot in their apps once they update to the latest version.\n\nFor Microsoft 365 Family subscribers, the added features are available only to the primary user and can't be shared with other members.\n\nThis isn't an all-you-can-AI deal. As the announcement explains, \"Subscribers will receive a monthly allotment of AI credits to use Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Designer. The credits will also apply to apps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on Windows.\" The option of a Copilot Pro subscription is available for subscribers who use more than the basic basket of credits.\n\nAnd while there's no cost to current subscribers for the new features, the upgrade comes with a big gotcha: Subscription prices are going up with the next renewal. In Australia, for example, one user reported that the cost of their subscription had risen to $AU179 this week; the previous price was AU$139.\n\nAlso: Your Windows 10 PC can't be upgraded? You have 5 options before support ends in 2025\n\nFor those who neither want nor need those AI features, a Microsoft 365 Classic option will be available, at prices that are similar to those in place before the Copilot-driven increase.\n\nMeanwhile, in the rest of the world, including the US and Western Europe, the free Copilot features aren't available -- yet. But I expect it's only a matter of time before this change expands to additional markets.\n\nIt's not unusual for Microsoft to try out new subscription offers on a regional basis before taking them to a worldwide market. That's exactly what this announcement looks like.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot, and worthy alternatives\n\nAnyone who's paid attention to Satya Nadella's Microsoft in recent years knows that the company is all in on AI, so it would be odd if there were no plans to roll out a similar feature set to the Microsoft 365 subscription base worldwide. Starting in the APAC region gives the company time to gauge customer reaction and also continue scaling up the capacity of servers that power Copilot features.\n\nThis expanded offering is still brand new, but Reddit users from the region have already weighed in with complaints. One asked, rhetorically, \"I'm just meant to put up with unwanted bundleware that I never agreed to soaking up CPU cycles on my hardware \u2026 because Microsoft needs to look like [its] AI spend is getting ROI to investors?\"\n\nAlso: Microsoft introduces 10 AI agents for sales, finance, supply chain in Dynamics 365\n\nAnother Reddit user, who's apparently a graduate student in Taiwan, called the new Copilot features a \"nightmare,\" adding that it can't be turned off. \"Doesn't Microsoft understand that Graduate/Phd students receive an automatic fail or are charged with academic misconduct for any hint of AI assistance in their writing?\"\n\nI asked Microsoft if the company has plans to introduce similar features in the US and other worldwide remarks. A spokesperson replied, \"The company has rolled out changes in six markets to listen, learn, and improve. We don't have anything more to share today.\""

The technology has led to transformative applications that can create text, images, and other media with impressive accuracy and creativity.\n\nAlso: We have an official open-source AI definition now\n\nOpen-source generative models are valuable for developers, researchers, and organizations wanting to leverage cutting-edge AI technology without incurring high licensing fees or restrictive commercial policies. Let's find out more.\n\nOpen-source vs. proprietary models\n\nOpen-source AI models offer several advantages, including customization, transparency, and community-driven innovation. These models allow users to tailor them to specific needs and benefit from ongoing enhancements. Additionally, they typically come with licenses that permit both commercial and non-commercial use, which enhances their accessibility and adaptability across various applications.\n\nAlso: The best free AI courses in 2024\n\nHowever, open-source solutions are not always the best choice. In industries that demand strict regulatory compliance, data privacy, and specialized support, proprietary models often perform better. They provide stronger legal frameworks, dedicated customer support, and optimizations tailored to industry requirements. Closed-source solutions may also excel in highly specialized tasks, thanks to exclusive features designed for high performance and reliability.\n\nWhen organizations require real-time updates, advanced security, or specialized functionalities, proprietary models can offer a more robust and secure solution, effectively balancing openness with the rigorous demands for quality and accountability.\n\nThe Open Source AI Definition\n\nThe Open Source Initiative (OSI) recently introduced the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) to clarify what qualifies as genuinely open-source AI. To meet OSAID standards, a model must be fully transparent in its design and training data, enabling users to recreate, adapt, and use it freely.\n\nAlso: Can AI even be open source? It's complicated\n\nHowever, some popular models, including Meta's LLaMA and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion, have licensing restrictions or lack transparency around training data, preventing full compliance with OSAID.\n\nAs part of the OSAID validation process, OSI assessed the following:\n\nCompliant models: Pythia (Eleuther AI), OLMo (AI2), Amber and CrystalCoder (LLM360), and T5 (Google).\n\nPythia (Eleuther AI), OLMo (AI2), Amber and CrystalCoder (LLM360), and T5 (Google). Potentially compliant models: Bloom (BigScience), Starcoder2 (BigCode), and Falcon (TII) could meet OSAID standards with minor adjustments to licensing terms or transparency.\n\nBloom (BigScience), Starcoder2 (BigCode), and Falcon (TII) could meet OSAID standards with minor adjustments to licensing terms or transparency. Non-compliant models: LLaMA (Meta), Grok (X/Twitter), Phi (Microsoft), and Mixtral (Mistral) lack the necessary transparency or impose restrictive licensing terms.\n\nLLaMA and other non-compliant architectures\n\nThe Meta LLaMA architecture exemplifies noncompliance with OSAID due to its restrictive research-only license and lack of full transparency about training data, limiting commercial use and reproducibility. Derived models, like Mistral's Mixtral and the Vicuna Team's MiniGPT-4, inherit these restrictions, propagating LLaMA's noncompliance across additional projects.\n\nAlso: Want to work in AI? How to pivot your career in 5 steps\n\nBeyond LLaMA-based models, other widely used architectures face similar issues. For example, Stability Diffusion by Stability AI employs the Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license, which includes ethical restrictions that deviate from OSAID's requirements for unrestricted use. Similarly, Grok by xAI combines proprietary elements with usage limitations, challenging its alignment with open-source ideals.\n\nThese examples underscore the difficulty of meeting OSAID's standards, as many AI developers balance open access with commercial and ethical considerations.\n\nImplications for organizations: OSAID compliance vs. non-compliance\n\nChoosing OSAID-compliant models gives organizations transparency, legal security, and full customizability features essential for responsible and flexible AI use. These compliant models adhere to ethical practices and benefit from strong community support, promoting collaborative development.\n\nIn contrast, non-compliant models may limit adaptability and rely more heavily on proprietary resources. For organizations that prioritize flexibility and alignment with open-source values, OSAID-compliant models are advantageous. However, non-compliant models can still be valuable when proprietary features are required.\n\nUnderstanding licensing in open-source AI models\n\nOpen-source AI models are released under licenses that define usage, modification, and sharing conditions. While some licenses align with traditional open-source standards, others incorporate restrictions or ethical guidelines that prevent full OSAID compliance. Key licenses include:\n\nApache 2.0 : A permissive license that allows free use, modification, and distribution, along with a patent grant. Apache 2.0 is OSI-approved and popular for open-source projects, providing flexibility and legal protection.\n\nA permissive license that allows free use, modification, and distribution, along with a patent grant.

These models often impose specific conditions for use or modify traditional open-source terms to align with commercial goals, making them non-compliant with open-source principles. Research-only licenses: Certain models, such as Meta's LLaMA and Codellama series, are available only under research-use terms. These licenses restrict use to academic or non-commercial purposes and prevent broad community-driven projects, as they do not meet OSI's open-source criteria.\n\nRequirements for running open-source AI models\n\nRunning open-source Gen AI models requires specific hardware, software environments, and toolsets for model training, fine-tuning, and deployment tasks. High-performance models with billions of parameters benefit from powerful GPU setups like Nvidia's A100 or H100.\n\nAlso: How open source attracts some of the world's top innovators\n\nEssential environments typically include Python and machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Specialized toolsets, including Hugging Face's Transformers library and Nvidia's NeMo, simplify the processes of fine-tuning and deployment. Docker helps maintain consistent environments across different systems, while Ollama allows for the local execution of large language models on compatible systems.\n\nThe following chart highlights essential toolsets, recommended hardware, and their specific functions for managing open-source AI models:\n\nToolset Purpose Requirements Use Python Primary programming environment N/A Essential for scripting and configuring models PyTorch Model training and inference GPU (e.g., Nvidia A100, H100) Widely used library for deep learning models TensorFlow Model training and inference GPU (e.g., Nvidia A100, H100) Alternative deep learning library Hugging Face Transformers Model deployment and fine-tuning GPU (preferred) Library for accessing, fine-tuning, and deploying models Nvidia NeMo Multimodal model support and deployment Nvidia GPUs Optimized for Nvidia hardware and multimodal tasks Docker Environment consistency and deployment Supports GPUs Containerizes models for easy deployment Ollama Running large language models locally macOS, Linux, Windows, supports GPUs Platform to run LLMs locally on compatible systems LangChain Building applications with LLMs Python 3.7+ Framework for composing and deploying LLM-powered applications LlamaIndex Connecting LLMs with external data sources Python 3.7+ Framework for integrating LLMs with data sources\n\nThis setup establishes a robust framework for efficiently managing Gen AI models, from experimentation to production-ready deployment. Each tool set possesses unique strengths, enabling developers to tailor their environments for specific project needs.\n\nChoosing the right model\n\nSelecting the right gen AI model depends on several factors, including licensing requirements, desired performance, and specific functionality. While larger models tend to deliver higher accuracy and flexibility, they require substantial computational resources. Smaller models, on the other hand, are more suitable for resource-constrained applications and devices.\n\nAlso: IBM will train you in AI fundamentals for free, and give you a skill credential - in 10 hours\n\nIt's important to note that most models listed here, even those with traditionally open-source licenses like Apache 2.0 or MIT, do not meet the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID). This gap is primarily due to restrictions around training data transparency and usage limitations, which OSAID emphasizes as essential for true open-source AI. However, certain models, such as Bloom and Falcon, show potential for compliance with minor adjustments to their licenses or transparency protocols and may achieve full compliance over time.\n\nThe tables below provide an organized overview of the leading open-source generative AI models, categorized by type, issuer, and functionality, to help you choose the best option for your needs, whether a fully transparent, community-driven model or a high-performance tool with specific features and licensing requirements.\n\nLanguage models\n\nLanguage models are crucial in text-based applications such as chatbots, content creation, translation, and summarization. They are fundamental to natural language processing (NLP) and continually improve their understanding of language structure and context.\n\nNotable models include Meta's LLaMA, EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX, and Nvidia's NVLM 1.0 family, each known for their unique strengths in multilingual, large-scale, and multimodal tasks.\n\nIssuer & Model Parameter Sizes License Highlights Google T5 Small to XXL

        "article_content": "Content warning: Mentions of depression and suicide.\n\nIt\u2019s 1993, and Jacques Derrida is not a socialist. If you knew him, you\u2019d be quite surprised to hear that, given that he\u2019s 1) French and 2) deeply annoying. Strange, to be sure. If he\u2019s not a socialist, then what is he? Complex question, but worry not, there\u2019s a straightforward answer: He\u2019s someone that can see ghosts.\n\nTo Derrida, something felt wrong. The Berlin Wall had fallen three years ago, and the Soviet Union went down with it just last year. Bill Clinton was just elected, erasing the notion of a truly progressive Democratic party and replacing it with a liberal-in-name-only administration with a neoconservative Arkansas twang. The distance between our front doors and the sidewalk grows wider, the air in our workplaces filled with an invisible molasses that seeps into us; that horrible feeling that something isn\u2019t quite right, but Derrida couldn\u2019t put a name to it.\n\nHe attempted to analyze the world that he saw \u2014 the objects that made up the buildings around him and the material conditions of the world around us \u2014 but came up with simple, incomplete answers: We live surrounded by a system driven by capital, by individuals without care for communities and corporations more powerful than absolutist monarchs. This world is unchanging. We stand at the end of history; we stand at the end of the world.\n\nJacques Derrida, the world\u2019s leading paranormal and grammatological investigator, was the first to put a name to the phenomenon. To see the thing that pervades life, or to see the thing that doesn\u2019t. To Derrida, the void that existed in the world around him was just that \u2014 a void. No presence could explain the tragedy in the modern world, only lack of presence could. Derrida felt that the world around him was haunted.\n\nA century and a half before Derrida, Karl Marx wrote that \u201ca spectre is haunting Europe \u2014 the spectre of communism.\u201d While Derrida might not have agreed with Marx on the solution to their paranormal woes, he certainly did agree that a ghost hung over the world. In Derrida\u2019s 1993 novel, \u201cSpectres of Marx,\u201d that spectre, that phantom, existed in the liminal space of neoliberal capitalism, waiting and lurking in the minds of its workers. Ever since the Soviet Union fell, ever since the end of history, that ghost was doomed to an immaterial fate. People had given up on communism and socialism, the hope of their existence was utterly doomed.\n\nYet, the ghost presided over them. It possessed them. Instilled a sadness in them. Although the idea was dead, those around it gave it an afterlife. The hope that leftists once had for their future was utterly annihilated. In their surrender to the conditions around them, they allowed the phantom of that lost future to dig itself into them. The tragedy of it, the horror of it, seeped into their worlds like phantasmic ooze from some portal to another world. In contemporary philosophy, ontology is the study of that material, of the things around oneself. Jacques Derrida did not believe the material world mattered anymore. Only the ghosts around him did. He created a new word, a portmanteau; he called his studies Hauntology \u2014 pronounced with a silent H, a homophone of ontology. If you heard someone talk about it out loud, you wouldn\u2019t know it. The word, like its definition, was immaterial.\n\n***\n\n\u201cStranger Things\u201d exploded into mass culture in a way few things ever have. After the critical successes of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d Netflix needed one last piece of original branding to legitimize itself, something massively appealing in a way political dramas and comedies weren\u2019t. It needed an emblematic, bonafide franchise \u2014 a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d of their own. So when The Duffer Brothers\u2122 came to Netflix with a script coddled in \u201980s aesthetics and a name seemingly ripped from a Stephen King novella, Netflix realized they had a chance.\n\nThe show almost instantly became the moment, with season one skyrocketing to the third biggest Netflix release of all time and the proliferation of its actors and references throughout popular culture immediate and all-encompassing. Suddenly, Stephen King, \u201cDungeons and Dragons\u201d and even Eggo Waffles were back in style.\n\nDespite its radically intense acclaim, I don\u2019t really like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d It\u2019s not a passionate hatred or anything. It\u2019s more of a simple dissatisfaction. Season one was fun, season two less so, season three was mind-numbingly bad and by the time season four released, I was over the age of 18 and therefore did not feel the need to watch. The characters bored me, the plot was ridiculous and each episode of the show seemed to immerse itself deeper and deeper in fan service and less and less into the horror that the first season was built on. Even when I returned to the first season, which I had liked, it was simply not that good, nor that interesting. There was an issue with it that I couldn\u2019t quite crack.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s 2014, and Mark Fisher is thinking of killing himself. This isn\u2019t a surprise, not if you knew him. He is 1) British and 2) a socialist. Being under those parameters, the thought process is easier to follow. He\u2019s noticed that, culturally, the things he sees haven\u2019t changed in a long time \u2014 not meaningfully. The movies, the music, the clothes, the world \u2014 it\u2019s been stagnant. Pieces may be rearranged, but never made new. It was this mess of repetition, of continued meaninglessness funneled into the art that Fisher once enjoyed, that Fisher blamed much of his personal pain on throughout his writing. It was in that cacophony of tragedy that he, like Derrida before him, saw a ghost.\n\nIn many ways, he was a student of Derrida. He, too, was worried about the lost future that was once promised to the world. He too believed that he, and the Western world as a whole, was haunted. Fisher created a new hauntology. A different ghost existed in his life, a cultural ghost. Defined in his 2014 work \u201cGhosts of My Life,\u201d Fisher\u2019s hauntology was one of lost arts. To him, the hope for a better future was foreclosed on very slowly. It began in the \u201970s and didn\u2019t quite conclude until the early 2000s. It was a slow draining of hope from the world. He called it a slow cancellation. In that slow cancellation, he noted that art began to lose density. It became hollow. As the consuming, capitalist behemoth of the United States became hungrier and hungrier, art became another apparatus that allowed it to consume.\n\nCreative art, new art, interesting art, was snuffed out in place of reproduction, repackaging and remaking. Music movements like punk were watered down into lazy half-genres. Bands like Joy Division were among the last ones to catch the wave of creativity, and since then, their sound had been ripped and redone by hacks hoping only for a quick buck.\n\nWe are haunted not only by the future that could\u2019ve been, but by the art that existed when we believed that that future would be. We are moving only as possessed goods of things we enjoyed decades ago, spun around and around again chasing ghosts and chasing hope.\n\n***\n\n\u201cStranger Things\u201d opens with that iconic title sequence \u2014 its floating red letters coming together to the synthetic tune, creating a sense of dread in the audience. It perfectly fits both the show\u2019s successes and its failures. It\u2019s evocative, vaguely, of the \u201980s as a whole. The loose limbs of its plasticky theme, the soft glow of its neon lettering, its bold and sharp Stephen King-esque script; it all felt stitched together, references to a litany of ephemerally dated concepts sewn like appendages into a neon \u201980s Frankenstein, meant to evoke the decade rather than replicate it. After seeing it nine times per season, it began to get on my nerves.\n\nIt\u2019s inarguably well-made, memorable and maybe the most famous TV intro of the last decade. Yet, it looked wrong. To me, the Frankenstein\u2019s Monster of an intro has an uncanny valley nature to it. It is stuck in an uncomfortable middle ground of being unable to create something genuinely new, relying on old hallmarks while also not being an accurate representation of those hallmarks it represented.\n\nThe intro sequence is a microcosm of my issues with the entire show. The show, especially in its later seasons, was nonsensical. It was filled with as many jabs and throwbacks as possible and seemed less interested in being a unique cultural moment than it was in reminding us of cultural moments from 40 years ago. Loose jumbles of dated ideas and references \u2014 \u201cThe Goonies,\u201d \u201cE.T.,\u201d malls, roller rinks, the Reagan-era Cold War, the Satanic Panic, classic video games and, of course, the constant throwback needle drops: all concepts blended together into the disco mush of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d The show is overwhelmingly consumerist, plugging ads and products constantly. It is, in no uncertain language, a child of neoliberalism with symbols of capitalism (advertisements and malls) held up as culturally valuable and necessary. Yet, when watching, it\u2019s impossible not to feel the overwhelming dread of it. The haunting of Derrida manifests in that which could be something else.\n\nAs strange and insane as it sounds, what is a show like \u201cStranger Things\u201d if not a direct reflection of Fisher\u2019s own logic? It\u2019s a series of repacking and reprinting meant to evoke things that once were relevant to generations of has-beens.\n\nWhen watching \u201cStranger Things,\u201d it\u2019s immediately obvious what it is and when it is: the 1980s. If, in fifty years, a show was made about the 2020s, would it be so obvious? Are there hallmarks of our decade, of our time, that are uniquely ours the same way tracksuits and hairspray were of theirs? I don\u2019t think so. My mom owns a family photobook dating back to the \u201950s. When I see my grandfather, I can point at him, his clothes, his smile, and tell when he was. In fifty years, how will my grandchildren tell when I was?\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s 2020, and I\u2019m not in a very good place. When I first read Mark Fisher\u2019s \u201cGhosts of my Life,\u201d the book in which the majority of these ideas spawned, I felt uniquely seen. Despite living as someone who had no connection to American or British art before the year 2000, I, like Fisher and Derrida before him, felt lost and was looking for an answer. No normal resource had given me solutions, so I turned to the paranormal. \u201cGhosts of My Life\u201d felt like my own personal Ouija board, a way for me to reach out to the ephemeral and receive answers. Of course, I thought I was sad because there was no future. After all, I was unlucky enough to be born into a world void of meaning and art. I was worried about the world around me, worried about the world ahead of me, nostalgic for a world behind me that I had never seen. I thought it must be better. It must have been better than this.\n\nYet, there exist problems with both Derrida and Fisher\u2019s paranormal investigations. Let\u2019s return to \u201cStranger Things.\u201d As regurgitative as it might be, to cast it wholesale aside as completely unoriginal is laughable. According to so many, the reason it falls apart as it progresses is exactly because it buys into its own mythos and strays from cliche.\n\nIf not haunted by a personal demon, how could one ever agree with Fisher\u2019s claim of the death of art? How in the world could art simply have ceased to be new? Or original? How could you ever listen to Brat and claim that it\u2019s retreading on old ground? On the flipside, how could one listen to \u201970s punk and claim it\u2019s totally unique, and not (in some ways) inspired by \u201950s rock and roll? To claim that all art is now iterative, and all old art is creative, is dismissive.\n\nSo, what is it that Fisher saw? That Derrida saw? I think they did, as I do, see ghosts, albeit misidentified ones. Jacques Derrida was often depressed, anxious and afraid of the world around him. He thought almost constantly of death. Mark Fisher was the same. If half of \u201cGhosts of My Life\u201d was about hauntology, the other half was about death. Fisher mused on his lack of fulfillment and utter hopelessness, not just politically or artistically, but personally. Three years after the book\u2019s publication, Mark Fisher committed suicide. I only found this out after I read the book. I cried.\n\nOften, for those who feel empty, art is their only escape. Music, movies and TV become rhythm keepers in the hearts of those damned by themselves. When everything feels hopeless and immaterial and life is no longer worth living, they live vicariously through art. But when the tragedy of life becomes overbearing, even art loses its color, and all that we\u2019re left to do is return to the art that existed when we were once happy. In late 2020, I watched no new movies and listened to no new music. All I did was listen to Blonde and The Beatles. As I (and perhaps Mark Fisher) became consumed by the specter within me, things became pale, gaunt and shallow. Art, and nearly everything else in my life, became possessed by the phantom pain I projected onto it.\n\nEven time itself is victim to that thing which pulls from the living. The prospect of even just a future, not even a good one, is lost to those trapped in the haunted house of their own bodies. Is it not possible that Derrida\u2019s \u201clost futures\u201d and Fisher\u2019s \u201cslow cancellation\u201d of the future were philosophical manifestations of paranormal (or perhaps internal) woes? When phantasmic beliefs take hold of a mortal body, they exorcize belief from flesh. In my life, I have spent so much time worrying about my future, that I began to give up on the idea of a future. My worries about the memory of my existence in the far future were pre-textual to my worry that there would be no far anything. It takes its time, but after a total possession is complete, it feels like tomorrow doesn\u2019t matter. Moreover, it feels like the Earth itself is collapsing upon itself, engulfed in the terror we engulf ourselves in \u2014 it feels like tomorrow doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo, I ask again, what ghost haunted me? That which haunted Fisher and Derrida? That which haunts the hundreds of thousands that love their work like I did four years ago? Strangely, it\u2019s easy to claim that the pain one feels is external. A spectre larger than life, larger than art, larger than society, that plagues you and destroys you. It\u2019s weirdly comforting \u2014 you can claim that there is an answer to the great monsters we conjure in our heads, that there is a villain. But is it true?\n\nThis is not to say that there is no value in what these writers say; Fisher and Derrida are some of the most important thinkers of the last century, and Fisher specifically continues to be one of the most important authors in my life. But can you make the claim, without a shadow of a doubt, that the ghosts they speak of are even ghosts? A ghost implies that it was once alive, that it was once material and corporeal. When have the doomed beliefs Fisher espouses in his cultural hauntology been proven material? When has art or creativity truly been dead? In an era where more musicians and filmmakers exist than ever before, and more boundaries are pushed every day, how can we conclude that all we can see are artistic rehashes?\n\nI have spent so much time hunting the ghosts of my life. Looking for them, buying equipment to defeat them, to seal them, to destroy them. But as time goes on, I\u2019m starting to think that I\u2019ve been barking up the wrong tree. An omnipresent sadness, an omnipresent depression, is something that, like the least favorable of Fisher\u2019s ideas, was never alive to begin with. So, one must ask themselves the question, how can you fight something that was born dead? In my mind, there is only one answer: You must keep living.\n\n\n\nSenior Arts Editor Rami Mahdi can be reached at rhmahdi@umich.edu"

        "article_content": "If you've ever seen yourself through a thermal imaging camera, you'll know that your body produces lots of heat. This is in fact a waste product of our metabolism. Every square foot of the human body gives off heat equivalent to about 19 matches per hour.\n\nUnfortunately, much of this heat simply escapes into the atmosphere. Wouldn't it be great if we could harness it to produce energy? My research has shown this would indeed be possible. My colleagues and I are discovering ways of capturing and storing body heat for energy generation, using eco-friendly materials.\n\nThe goal is to create a device that can both generate and store energy, acting like a built-in power bank for wearable tech. This could allow devices such as smart watches, fitness trackers, or GPS trackers to run much longer, or even indefinitely, by harnessing our body heat.\n\nIt isn't just our bodies that produce waste heat. In our technologically advanced world, substantial waste heat is generated daily, from the engines of our vehicles to the machines that manufacture goods.\n\nTypically, this heat is also released into the atmosphere, representing a significant missed opportunity for energy recovery. The emerging concept of \"waste heat recovery\" seeks to address this inefficiency. By harnessing this otherwise wasted energy, industries can improve their operational efficiency and contribute to a more sustainable environment.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nThe thermoelectric effect is a phenomenon that can help turn heat into electricity. This works by having a temperature difference produce an electric potential, as electrons flow from the hot side to the cool side, generating usable electrical energy.\n\nConventional thermoelectric materials, however, are often made from cadmium, lead, or mercury. These come with environmental and health risks that limit their practical applications.\n\nThe power of wood\n\nBut we've discovered you can also create thermoelectric materials from wood \u2013 offering a safer, sustainable alternative.\n\nWood has been integral to human civilisations for centuries, serving as a source of building materials and fuel. We are uncovering the potential of wood-derived materials to convert waste heat, often lost in industrial processes, into valuable electricity.\n\nThis approach not only enhances energy efficiency, but also redefines how we view everyday materials as essential components of sustainable energy solutions.\n\nOur team at the University of Limerick, in collaboration with the University of Valencia, has developed a sustainable method to convert waste heat into electricity using Irish wood products, particularly lignin, which is a byproduct of the paper industry.\n\nOur study shows that lignin-based membranes, when soaked in a salt solution, can efficiently convert low-temperature waste heat (below 200\u00b0C) into electricity. The temperature difference across the lignin membrane causes ions (charged atoms) in the salt solution to move.\n\nPositive ions drift toward the cooler side, while negative ions move toward the warmer side. This separation of charges creates an electric potential difference across the membrane, which can be harnessed as electrical energy.\n\nSince around 66 percent of industrial waste heat falls within this temperature range, this innovation presents a significant opportunity for eco-friendly energy solutions.\n\nThis new technology has the potential to make a big difference in many areas. Industries such as manufacturing, which produce large amounts of leftover heat, could see major benefits by turning that waste heat into electricity. This would help them save energy and lessen their impact on the environment.\n\nThis technology could find use in various settings, from providing power in remote areas to powering sensors and devices in everyday applications. Its eco-friendly nature also makes it a promising solution for sustainable energy generation in buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe trouble with storage\n\nCapturing energy from waste heat is just the first step; storing it effectively is equally critical. Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that rapidly charge and discharge electricity. This makes them essential for applications requiring quick power delivery.\n\nHowever, their reliance on fossil fuel-derived carbon materials raises sustainability concerns, highlighting the need for renewable alternatives in their production.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nOur research group has discovered that lignin-based porous carbon can serve as an electrode in supercapacitors for energy storage generated from harvesting waste heat using a lignin membrane.\n\nThis process allows the lignin membrane to capture and convert waste heat into electrical energy, while the porous carbon structure facilitates the rapid movement and storage of ions. By providing a green alternative that avoids harmful chemicals and reliance on fossil fuels, this approach offers a sustainable solution for energy storage from waste heat.\n\nThis innovation in energy storage technology could power everything from consumer electronics, wearable technology to electric vehicles.\n\nMuhammad Muddasar, PhD candidate, School of Engineering, University of Limerick\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Paleontologists debate whether silesaurids were true dinosaurs or possibly a precursor to the creatures that once dominated the Earth.\n\nPaleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria, Rodrigo Temp Muller, holds a fossil ( REUTERS )\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the characteristics of these precursors could shed light on what was crucial for the dinosaurs\u2019 evolutionary success,\u201d the statement said.\n\nUnearthed in a rock layer dating back to the Triassic period, between 252 million and 201 million years ago, the Gondwanax paraisensis fossil comes from the time when dinosaurs as well as mammals, crocodiles, turtles and frogs first arose.\n\nIn 2014, physician Pedro Lucas Porcela Aurelio found the fossil in the town of Paraiso do Sul in Brazil\u2019s southernmost Rio Grande do Sul state.\n\nHe donated it to a local university in 2021, kicking off three years of research.\n\n\u201cBeing the first human to touch something from 237 million years ago is extraordinary,\u201d Aurelio told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an indescribable feeling,\u201d said the self-described paleontology buff since childhood.\n\nPaleontologist Rodrigo Temp Muller and geologist Jossano de Rosso Morais, both from the Federal University of Santa Maria, search for fossils at the archaeological site, where fossils of the Gondwanax paraisensis, a species that lived 237 million years ago and was a precursor to dinosaurs were discovered, in the city of Paraiso do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, ( REUTERS )\n\nThe discovery is detailed in an article by paleontologist Rodrigo Temp M\u00fcller published late last month in the scientific journal Gondwana Research.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of this finding is its age,\u201d M\u00fcller said in an interview. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so old, it gives us clues as to how dinosaurs came to be.\u201d\n\nHe added that the remains were covered by a thick layer of rock when donated by Aurelio and initially only parts of the vertebrae were visible.\n\nGondwanax means \u201clord of Gondwana,\u201d referring to the Gondwana landmass in the southern region of the supercontinent Pangaea before the continents broke apart, while paraisensis honors the town of Paraiso do Sul."

Pictured, Idy's burial chamber when discovered\n\nPictured, a close-up of the outer coffin of Idy, showing remarkable illustrations that were made nearly 4,000 years ago\n\nAsyut, a city in Egypt that sits comfortably along the west bank of the Nile river, was a prosperous regional capital and port city\n\nIdy had been placed in a coffin inside a coffin and then sealed in a side chamber in a vertical shaft about 45 feet deep that had been dug in the tomb of her father.\n\nHer coffins, weighing around 200-300 kg each, are above average in size with a length of 8.59 feet (2.62 metres) and 6.66 feet (2.03 metres).\n\nProfessor Kahl said both coffins seem to be made out of 'foreign wood', meaning wood sourced from outside of Egypt.\n\nHe said they are both 'completely decorated with wonderful images and texts' describing the journey of the deceased in the afterlife.\n\nTheir study will allow 'new and far-reaching statements to be made about the position of women and the transfer of knowledge in ancient Egypt'.\n\nWhile Idy's resting place has until now been unnoticed by researchers, it's thought the chamber was ransacked by thieves thousands of years ago.\n\nHer remains were robbed of all jewelry and metal objects in the search for treasures, but other grave goods seem to have been of no interest to the ancient looters.\n\n'Remnants of Idy's garment and her bones, which were completely torn to shreds by ancient looters, provide information about her person,' added Professor Kahl.\n\nIdy was found in two nested wooden coffins with numerous grave goods, including wooden figurines. Pictured, a female figure made of wood\n\nAccording to an initial visual inspection of the bones, Idy was probably around 40 years old and suffered from a foot problem, he added.\n\nSomewhat gruesomely, a box of jars were also found containing Idy's internal organs removed during mummification \u2013 liver, spleen, lungs and intestines.\n\nThis was customary during mummification, as the ancient Egyptians learned the internal organs would decay quickly.\n\nTypically, mummification in ancient Egypt then involved desiccating the body with a mixture of salts and then wrapping it in cloth soaked in a balm of plant extracts, oils, and resins.\n\nOlder mummies are believed to have been naturally preserved by burying them in dry desert sand and were not chemically treated.\n\nProfessor Kahl said further study of the discovered remains will continue in an effort to shed more light on the lives of the governor and his daughter.\n\n'After an initial conservational consolidation of the wooden objects in the burial chamber and the subsequent laborious recovery from the narrow, 14-metre deep shaft, the finds will be handed over to the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism,' he added."

Initially estimated to have a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029, this asteroid sparked widespread media coverage and public interest. Fortunately, further observations confirmed that it will not collide with our planet, including during its close approaches in 2029 and 2036.Measuring approximately 450 metres across, Apophis will pass as close as 30,600 kilometres (19,000 miles) from Earth on April 13, 2029, making it one of the closest encounters with a significant asteroid in recent history. As scientists prepare to study this intriguing celestial body, the upcoming flybys present valuable opportunities for research and public engagement.Apophis, formally known as 99942 Apophis, is a near-Earth asteroid with an orbit that brings it within 1.3 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Since its discovery in 2004, it has captured significant media attention, particularly when it was initially estimated to have a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029. There was also a brief period during which it was thought to pose a risk in 2036. However, further observations have confirmed that Apophis will not collide with Earth in either of these years.While Apophis won\u2019t collide with Earth, it will come very close on April 13, 2029. On that day, it will pass just 30,600 kilometres (19,000 miles) away from Earth, closer than some of our geostationary satellites. This close encounter is expected to spark public interest, and organisations like the Planetary Society are recommending ways to educate the public about the event. On March 30, 2036, Apophis will be much farther away, passing Earth at a distance of 8.4 million kilometres (5.2 million miles), which is more than 20 times the distance to the Moon.The name \"Apophis\" is derived from Egyptian mythology, where Apophis represents a serpent that is the enemy of Ra, the sun god. Each night, Apophis attempted to engulf the world in darkness, only to be defeated by Ra at dawn.Apophis was discovered on June 19, 2004, by astronomers Roy Tucker, David Tholen, and Fabrizio Bernardi at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. Tucker had previously received a grant from the Shoemaker Near Earth Object Grant Program, which supports amateur astronomers in their efforts to find, track, and characterise near-Earth objects.Determining the exact size and shape of Apophis from Earth is challenging due to its small size. However, radar imaging has revealed that Apophis measures approximately 450 metres (1,500 feet) across its longest axis\u2014comparable to five football fields and taller than the Empire State Building.Its shortest axis measures about 170 metres. The asteroid is likely to be egg-shaped or possibly dual-lobed, resembling Arrokoth, a small celestial body that NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft encountered in 2019.Currently, Apophis is not expected to hit Earth anytime soon. It will definitely miss Earth in 2029 and 2036, and observations made in March 2021 ruled out any risk of impact for at least the next 100 years. Initially, the chance of a 2029 impact was higher because early observations had not yet refined its trajectory. As more data became available, scientists were able to rule out the possibility of an impact.If Apophis were to collide with Earth, it would cause significant destruction, with effects felt hundreds of kilometres from the impact site. The energy released would be equivalent to over 1,000 megatons of TNT, similar to multiple nuclear explosions. In comparison, the asteroid that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs was much larger, at least 10 to 15 kilometres wide.Apophis will not collide with our geostationary communications satellites. While it will pass closer than some of these satellites, its trajectory is inclined away from the equator, ensuring it does not enter the region occupied by these vital communications systems.Yes, during its 2029 close approach, Apophis will be visible from Europe, Africa, and western Asia, appearing as a bright star moving across the sky. In 2036, it will be too far away to see without a telescope.Astronomers monitor asteroids like Apophis through a combination of follow-up observations and tracking efforts. These observations are gathered from both professional astronomers and skilled amateurs, then submitted to the Minor Planet Center. Teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the NEODyS program in Italy compute the orbits of asteroids based on this data. The accuracy of these predictions is determined by the quality and quantity of observations.In some cases, radar is employed to obtain precise distance measurements, further refining orbital predictions. Additionally, spacecraft missions to near-Earth asteroids provide even more accurate orbital data.NASA's OSIRIS-APEX mission will study Apophis for 18 months starting in April 2029, just before its close encounter with Earth. This mission uses the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which recently returned samples from the asteroid Bennu.OSIRIS-APEX will investigate how Earth\u2019s gravity affects Apophis' rotation and surface properties. This study could provide valuable insights about the asteroid and help scientists learn how to deflect similar objects that might threaten Earth in the future. As we approach the close encounters with Apophis, ongoing research and public education will be important for understanding this fascinating asteroid."

        "article_content": "An innovative augmented reality (AR) worker guidance system from LightGuide Inc. has been donated to KANDU Industries Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides employment opportunities and various programs for people with disabilities.\n\nFounded in 1961, KANDU has grown to become a thriving 501(c)(3) organization based in Milton, WI, where it employs nearly 200 people with disabilities in its pre-vocational work program. KANDU\u2019s nimble and experienced workforce provides fast-turnaround production and assembly services for local and national manufacturers.\n\nRhino Tool House and manufacturing software company LightGuide Inc. have donated an AR worker guidance system to help KANDU workers perform kitting tasks more efficiently and consistently, reducing training time and eliminating defects.\n\n\u201cKitting is simply the process of putting kits together to be assembled later by the consumer,\u201d explains Dave Wirth, local business founder, owner and entrepreneur (now retired) who volunteers at KANDU. \u201cWhen you receive a product to assemble, you want to make sure all the parts are there. The system we\u2019ve donated to KANDU will help make sure the kit is prepared properly and thoroughly. The worker guidance system is a quality assurance tool that also helps productivity and efficiency in the KANDU work cells.\u201d\n\nKANDU provides life-enriching experiences, connections and job opportunities to unlock the full potential of people with disabilities. Photo courtesy Rhino Tool House\n\nWirth founded the tool distributor The Tool House back in the early 1980s. In 2018, The Tool House joined forces with Rhino Assembly to form Rhino Tool House and become the largest manufacturing improvement company of its type in North America.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stayed close to the company, and two of my sons still work there,\u201d Wirth explains. \u201cAs I\u2019ve worked with KANDU over the years, I thought the LightGuide worker guidance system integrated by our team from Rhino Tool House could help the team at KANDU be more successful with its manufacturing customers. The LightGuide system is ideal for the kitting projects that companies such as Hormel and Playstar entrust to the client-workers at KANDU.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe technology we\u2019ve developed transforms manual processes by projecting digital step-by-step augmented reality work instructions onto the work surface,\u201d explains Chris Bala, senior vice president of sales and product at LightGuide. \u201cNo matter who the worker is, or how much experience they have, this system is extraordinarily effective in standardizing and error-proofing the work being done. We are thrilled to donate this unit to KANDU, and we are certain that it will help them be even more successful with their process improvements and product output.\u201d\n\nKANDU performs a variety of services for local and national companies, including high-volume packaging, assembly and disassembly; kitting; labeling; packaging; sorting; and inkjet printing. Photo courtesy Rhino Tool House\n\n\u201cI was overjoyed to hear from Dave,\u201d says Chip Paulsen, president of the commercial side of Rhino Tool House. \u201cEspecially with such a great idea to help these hard workers with assembly and kitting tasks that demand accuracy and consistency. We have manufacturers all over the country using the LightGuide system to improve quality. And we think it\u2019s an ideal assembly solution for KANDU.\u201d\n\nApplication engineer Kevin Martin from the nearby New Berlin Rhino office customized the LightGuide smartAR Workcell system to the specifications for KANDU\u2019s kitting applications, minimizing guess work. The system features no-code, drag-and-drop programming and seamless connection with various common factory tools.\n\n\u201cThis one system will be able to be used for a wide variety of applications,\u201d says Martin, \u201cand we\u2019re here to help prep the system for whatever new tasks come along.\u201d\n\nKANDU provides jobs for more than 200 people with disabilities. Photo courtesy Rhino Tool House\n\n\u201cKANDU is proud of its reputation for delivering high quality, fast turnaround production and assembly services to a customer list that includes major national brands where quality and consistency is critical,\u201d says Kathy Hansen, KANDU\u2019s executive director. \u201cThis donation from Rhino Tool House provides us with remarkable technology and an extra quality check to ensure we deliver the high-quality work our customers expect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company LightGuide is well-named,\u201d Wirth continues. \u201cTheir technology literally guides the worker with projected light, and is ideal for assembly, inspection, repair and training tasks.\u201d\n\nPaulsen elaborates: \u201cIt\u2019s a very intuitive system that has been preconfigured with everything the KANDU workforce needs to deliver high-quality kits every time. It\u2019s also extremely easy for KANDU to take ownership of the programming, so as their assembly needs change, they can adjust the system quickly to continually produce products with zero-defects.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand the technology,\u201d Hansen says, laughing. \u201cBut I understand the kindness and generosity of Dave, LightGuide and Rhino Tool House, and I appreciate innovations that help all workers, disabled or otherwise, to perform their jobs better.\n\n\u201cWe help our clients to broaden their social, emotional and personal development, and help them gain the sense of independence and self-worth that everyone deserves. This donated technology, along with the kindness and generosity, such as we just experienced, helps us continue our good work for many years to come.\u201d\n\nFrom left to right, KANDU volunteer Dave Wirth, worker Andrew Updike, Rhino Tool House application engineer Kevin Martin, KANDU executive director Kathy Hansen, and director of operations Jake Reed.

        "article_content": "The iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra are both big phones with big screens, big power, and big price tags. The cameras are also impressive, but which one of these two archrivals takes better photos?\n\nI\u2019ve been using the Galaxy S24 Ultra again over the past few weeks and have put it against Apple\u2019s latest top iPhone to find out. And the results are pretty shocking.\n\nThe cameras\n\nBefore we look at the phones, let\u2019s look at the numbers behind the cameras, starting with the iPhone 16 Pro Max. There are three cameras on the back, starting with the main 48-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization, which can also take 2x zoom photos. It\u2019s joined by a 12MP telephoto camera for 5x optical zoom photos and a 48MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra has four cameras. It\u2019s led by a main 200MP camera, along with a pair of telephoto cameras \u2014 a 10MP camera for a 3x optical zoom and a 50MP periscope zoom for 5x optical shots \u2014 plus a 12MP ultrawide camera. Unlike previous Galaxy Ultra phones, the S24 Ultra has \u201coptical quality\u201d 10x zoom shots, which have proven to be just as good as optical zoom shots.\n\nFor reference, I used the Standard Photographic Style on the iPhone 16 Pro Max for all the photos below, and each phone\u2019s camera was used in auto mode. All the photos were downloaded onto an Apple Mac mini and examined on a color-calibrated monitor. They have all been resized for friendlier online viewing.\n\nMain camera\n\nWhen using the main camera, the iPhone 16 Pro Max consistently took more visually pleasing photos than the S24 Ultra, apart from its long-time issue with exposure occasionally rearing its head. In the first photo of the leafy lane, you can see where it causes the camera problems and where the S24 Ultra\u2019s colors are punchier and more vibrant.\n\nHowever, as you can see in the second photo of the Aston Martin Valkyrie car, the S24 Ultra\u2019s eagerness results in noise, which is entirely absent from the iPhone\u2019s pin-sharp, more accurately colored image. Although its exposure can cause issues sometimes, here, it gets it exactly right \u2014 to the point where I can easily read the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the windscreen, which is blurred and jumbled in Samsung\u2019s photo.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra often gets a certain type of photo right, such as the example at the top, but everywhere else, the iPhone improves. The photo inside the church shows the wonderful tone and warmth of the iPhone\u2019s camera, rather than the starkness of the S24 Ultra, right down to the color of the padding on the seats and the wooden beams on the ceiling.\n\nTake a look at our final photo to see how the iPhone\u2019s super-sharp focus and depth of field help it take detailed, emotional shots, even of the simplest subjects. The foam and bubbles on top of the coffee are so sharp, and the depth of field is exactly right, making for a more realistic, attractive photo than the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, which seems less aware of its subject.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nUltrawide camera\n\nOn paper, the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s ultrawide camera should easily improve on the Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s camera, but in reality, it\u2019s the opposite. The S24 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide camera shows up the iPhone\u2019s camera really badly. The first photo of the Ferrari FF was taken indoors in good lighting (the same environment as the Aston Martin Valkyrie photo above), and the iPhone\u2019s photo is full of noise and blur, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra avoids most of the same issues to produce a sharper, less blurred image. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s far better than the iPhone\u2019s photo.\n\nOutside, things don\u2019t improve much for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but it can still impress with its warm tones. The photo of the fields and sky shows the S24 Ultra\u2019s vibrant colors but overall coldness. However, it has a less noisy foreground and more detail, such as around the fence post. In the distance, the two cameras introduce some blur and noise.\n\nIn the final photo of the church, you can see how much sharper the S24 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide photos are, with the stonework on the spire far clearer and less muddy than in the iPhone\u2019s image. Yes, the S24 Ultra does use quite a lot of software enhancement, but it\u2019s easier to forgive it when the balance and sharpness is right.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n2x zoom and 3x zoom\n\nThe two phones have different \u201cshort\u201d zooms, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max offering a 2x optical zoom and the S24 Ultra a 3x optical zoom. You can see examples of them both here, and we\u2019ll be judging this category as one rather than two separate categories. The 2x zoom is fairly consistent across both cameras for balance and focus, but the iPhone can introduce some noise, while the S24 Ultra\u2019s photos have a softer look.\n\nMove on to the 3x zoom across the two cameras, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max can\u2019t match the S24 Ultra\u2019s performance. Shots are far noisier and less sharp, while the Samsung phone\u2019s 3x zoom produces excellent photos with plenty of life and detail. This is to be expected, given Samsung\u2019s dedicated optical 3x mode.\n\nBut because the S24 Ultra\u2019s 2x mode isn\u2019t awful compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 2x shots, it\u2019s going to win this category for being more versatile, as you could realistically use both zooms on it, but would want to stick with the 2x on the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n5x zoom\n\nBoth cameras have 5x optical zooms, and Samsung continues its run of zoom superiority here too. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a problem with sharpness and focus, resulting in grainy, blurry, or noisy images that look worse the more you crop them down. These issues are missing from the S24 Ultra\u2019s camera, and its photos look great at 5x zoom.\n\nTake the wooden angel as an example. Not only are the colors and textures far more realistic in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, but when you crop it down, there\u2019s detail in the wood that the iPhone struggles to capture. The overall sharpness makes the depth of field pop more, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s photo appears flatter.\n\nPhotos taken outside have similar issues, but the iPhone does win a few points with generally more realistic colors. Many will like the S24 Ultra\u2019s fairly saturated colors, which stay consistent across all lenses. The donkey\u2019s fur is sharper and more defined in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, and there\u2019s clearly less noise on the wooden fence post and the red strap. Samsung wins the 5x zoom category, so will it make it three-for-three as we move to the 10x category?\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n10x zoom\n\nNeither phone has a 10x optical zoom, but Samsung does make a point of highlighting its optical quality photos at 10x and does include a shortcut in its camera app. The iPhone does not, and things do start out quite well.\n\nThe horse photo reveals a similar level of detail, but when you get very close, there\u2019s far more evidence of software enhancements in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, with some haloing visible along the horse\u2019s back and ears. This glow is not in the iPhone\u2019s photo at all, giving it a more natural appearance.\n\nBut the iPhone does not always win here, as seen in the next photo of the wooden pub sign. The S24 Ultra\u2019s photo has less noise than the iPhone\u2019s photo, particularly on the green board, and its more dynamic coloring means the fall leaves glow more attractively.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is far more consistent when shooting 10x photos, as the final photo of the car proves. The differences are clear \u2014 accurate colors, spot-on white balance, and no obvious noise. The iPhone can\u2019t keep up at 10x zoom.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nNight mode\n\nWhen it came to shooting photos in low light, the Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s preview on the phone made me expect the worst, as it did not show a truly representative image straight after taking it. The iPhone didn\u2019t have any such problem, so when I was collecting photos, I feared for the S24 Ultra\u2019s performance. However, the images looked totally different in the gallery, and at first, the two appeared quite evenly matched.\n\nThe outside of the brightly lit pub is a great example. The iPhone overexposes in many places while showing more detail than the S24 Ultra\u2019s photos in others. However, in most other areas \u2014 the seating and foliage, for example \u2014 both cope with the low light well. The iPhone\u2019s photo does have a little more blur, though, and the overexposure hides details, such as in the pub\u2019s signage.\n\nIn the photo of the village shop, the iPhone\u2019s more accurate colors shine through, and it\u2019s also less blurry than the S24 Ultra, where the software smooths out a lot of detail, showing both are very sensitive to lighting conditions when taking photos in the dark. The two trade blows like this in all the lowlight images I took, and while the iPhone\u2019s overexposure often caused problems, the S24 Ultra\u2019s smoothing often did the same.\n\nHowever, the S24 Ultra was great in difficult, harsh lighting conditions. Shooting into the sunset, the S24 Ultra captured the golden glow in the sky, the blue sky, the green of the grass, and the scene as a whole. The iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s photo contains so much shadow that it robs it of emotion and detail. The real-world environment was somewhere in between the two, but the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo is the one I\u2019d keep or share.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nSamsung\u2019s flagship comes out on top\n\nIt may come as a shock to some, but the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra \u2014 a phone released at the beginning of the year \u2014 has taken a victory in all but one category against the new Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max. It has by far the superior camera when you want to take any zoom or ultrawide photo.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t quite match the iPhone 16 Pro Max in the main camera category, though, and I consistently preferred it to the S24 Ultra. Still, it should be noted the iPhone\u2019s exposure and contrast can still upset the balance of some images, especially in challenging light. This has affected iPhone cameras for several generations, so it is not unique to the 16 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s very interesting is that the iPhone 16 Pro comprehensively beat the Google Pixel 9 Pro in a recent test, proving its top camera credentials. It also showed several improvements over the iPhone 15 Pro. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has been a winner from the start by improving on its predecessor, beating the Google Pixel 8 Pro, and equaling the performance of our favorite Android camera phone, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra.\n\nIt may not be the latest on the market, but the Galaxy S24 Ultra continues to take on the very best camera phones and easily holds its own."
