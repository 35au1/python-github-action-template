It\u2019s the largest collection of UFO sighting documents in the country, and maybe the world.\n\nNow, thanks to a partnership with Rio Rancho Public Schools, the amateur collectors who kept all these records safe over the years are finally making them available to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally overwhelming. People don\u2019t have any conception until they come here how much material that we\u2019re talking about. And it really, I think, makes people pause and realize there\u2019s a lot more to this UFO subject than I ever thought,\u201d said David Marler, executive director of the National UFO Historical Records Center.\n\nMarler knows the idea of a UFO records archive probably sounds silly to some folks, but he says that skepticism is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t care what your take is on the UFO subject. In fact, we welcome differing opinions, differing perspectives,\u201d said Marler.\n\nThe National UFO Historical Records Center is a nonprofit organizing hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents, news clippings, photos, videos and more evidence from across the globe all under one roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional historical archive dedicated to a non-traditional subject. We want serious research to be conducted here in the hopes ultimately of maybe gaining a better insight into this mystery that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for 75 plus years,\u201d said Marler.\n\nHe says there are countless connections to be discovered now that all these case files are together.\n\n\u201cSome organizations interviewed witnesses that the other did not, and vice versa, and sometimes there\u2019s new insights provided by one investigative organization that was never obtained by this one,\u201d said Marler. \u201cThe more minds, the more set of eyeballs we have looking at the data as with any subject, the better we\u2019re going to be if we truly want to try to understand what we\u2019re dealing with when we talk about UFOs.\u201d\n\nMarler\u2019s collection \u2013 which used to live inside his Rio Rancho home \u2013 is largely a collection of other collections sent in from fellow UFO archivists. With all this extra space donated by Rio Rancho Public Schools, Marler says they\u2019re ready for more.\n\n\u201cWe have about 10 to 12 other collections that are also in the queue,\u201d Marler said. \u201cTwo individuals I know in Ohio have stated, \u2018You\u2019re already in my will. If anything happens to me, my material is coming to Rio Rancho.'\u201d\n\nWhether or not you believe in aliens, Marler says the overwhelming amount of documentation is worth preserving.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important because it is an element of history, it is an element of our culture. So that\u2019s really how we try to view it,\u201d said Marler. \u201cIf we can\u2019t define the answers to the UFO mystery, maybe in 40, 50, 60, years someone might, but they can only do that by looking at the data.\u201d\n\nWhile this is a public archive, it\u2019s a not a free for all. Marler says you\u2019ll have to submit a request on their website to set up a time to come and visit. The idea is that you\u2019ll have full access to everything inside.\n\nBut why would Rio Rancho Public Schools get involved with something like this.\n\n\u201cOur students find the subject matter of UFO investigation very intriguing. And so we want to do is we want to use that as a catalyst in order to get students involved in other types of learning,\u201d said RRPS Chief Operating Officer Michael Baker. \u201cSo we think that the parents, as long as the students are learning, we\u2019re not trying to persuade thinking one way or another, we think we\u2019re going to see some really good benefits from this area.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials say the partnership is expected to last at least five years.\n\nAnother New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect."

        "article_content": "At first not many were using Google's NotebookLM to take notes. But it's been receiving more attention since it added a feature letting users create an audio summary of files in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice. Zacharie Scheurer/dpa\n\nA previously little known Google-created AI research and note-taking tool has \u201creally taken off\u201d after it added an audio feature which turned notes into podcast-like audio and the results went viral, one of its product managers has said.\n\nNotebookLM was first released last year as an AI tool to help users interact with their documents \u2013 allowing them to upload a range of files and get summaries and explanations based on that content.\n\nBut the app has begun receiving more mainstream public attention in recent weeks after it added a feature called Audio Overviews, which enabled users to create an audio summary of their upload files, but in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice.\n\nVarious results from using the tool quickly circulated online and brought new users to the app.\n\nNow Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs and one of the people leading the build of NotebookLM, says users are hungry for more editing control over the type of Audio Overviews they can create with the tool.\n\n\u201cThis is such an exciting time, because since we\u2019ve launched it everyone on Twitter and Reddit and even in our Discord is saying \u2018I want the knobs\u2019, particularly for more voices, or \u2018I want to change the length\u2019,\u201d she told the PA news agency.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to change everything, and we\u2019re definitely going to address this. We\u2019re shipping features quickly to give people more control, but we\u2019re trying to be thoughtful about which controls we ship first.\u201d\n\nAn update to NotebookLM has since rolled out, allowing users to tweak which topics or areas from their source notes they would like covered specifically.\n\nMs Martin added: \u201cI always get asked the question \u2018who is the tool for\u2019 or \u2018who is your target audience?\u2019 and most of the time I\u2019ve thought about it in the same way, which is; what is the person\u2019s profession? How are they applying this to their everyday life?.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we were very, very fortunate in that when we launched Notebook as Project Tailwind last year, we just launched the tool with none of those assumptions to try to find out how people would use it.\u201d\n\nShe said this lack of a specific target audience has helped show that the app could be applicable for anyone who \u201cworks on a computer\u201d, particularly when it came to the audio summaries, and the team building the app were already hearing stories of people listening to the Audio Overviews like a podcast to help them digest their notes.\n\n\u201cSpecifically for the audio, I think one of our key insights is that there are a lot of jobs that require you to digest a lot of information \u2013 and not just jobs \u2013 learners, students of all ages, educators\u2026 basically, if you\u2019re working on a computer, this is the sort of thing you could probably find utility in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of people that the way they use it is to listen to the audio first and then write their own questions down, and that had me thinking what a magical harmony between people, technology, information, knowledge, and I think we\u2019re just at the starting line of what this can do.\u201d\n\nNotebookLM has not had the high-profile launch of Google\u2019s flagship AI assistant, Gemini, which powers NotebookLM, but Ms Martin said the newfound fame the note-taking tool had found meant this \u201ctrue experimental product for Google\u201d was getting a more serious product road-map.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ll say in terms of how we\u2019re approaching the continuing rollout is that I think we\u2019ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they\u2019re using it every day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that the way we want to keep pushing forward is to really stabilise the experience, and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to try to connect this to everyday people and make it really relevant.\n\n\u201cSo I think that while the feature work that we\u2019re doing is exciting, I think now is the right time to also start addressing how do we make it so much easier to use.\n\n\u201cBecause for better or worse, that\u2019s not where a lot of our attention has been, but now that we have a lot more interest, a lot more users, let\u2019s make it a lot easier.\u201d"

        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Future\n\nAdobe's GenStudio is not something I'd normally think of using. I sat through the Adobe MAX 2024 keynote and it washed over me - a marketing AI app, who needs that? Then I tried it for myself, and well\u2026 it's really good.\n\nArtists are so focused on creating the art it can be hard to find time for marketing, you know, the boring bit that makes you money. That's where GenStudio fits in. Designed primarily for small studios to market product launches and brands, there's actually a handy use-case here for solo artists, indie game devs, and any small creative studio that needs to get noticed and fight through the mire of online noise.\n\nMy demo at Adobe MAX challenged me to create a brand identity and email campaign, and it took seconds. It was like an episode of The Apprentice compressed to ten minutes but with less botox, fewer Essex accents. Also, Adobe doesn't help itself, describing GenStudio as an \"end-to-end content supply chain solution\", but get past this word-hurdle and this is an AI app with real world benefits.\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nAdobe Max 2024, screens from Adobe GenStudio\n\nGenStudio social campaign\n\nGenStudio can create ads, emails and campaign messages for you across Instragram, Facebook, Twitter and more.\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nAdobe Max 2024, screens from Adobe GenStudio\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nAdobe Max 2024, screens from Adobe GenStudio\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nAdobe Max 2024, screens from Adobe GenStudio\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nAdobe Max 2024, screens from Adobe GenStudio\n\nMy first step was to design a brand image for an imagined company called Halliby and its new hand lotions. The Adobe rep - who exclaimed she's a fan of Creative Bloq - informed me the challenge was to create an image for the packaging and then an email marketing campaign.\n\nUsing Adobe Firefly I created an image from text prompts, but this stage can also simply be used to import your own art and graphics into GenStudio (your work is protected and you can opt out of Adobe's AI training). If you're a designer you can upload templates, set guardrails and generally protect the brand from drift. I created a bumblebee image, composed a background and merged the two for a simple design. Using Firefly I could have iterated on this more, but I tend to find gen AI lacks real control so made do with my simple 'buzzy' brand.\n\nThe magic of GenStudio comes in the next step, with the app's marketing tools. In this case I was creating an email campaign. Some text prompts around hand lotions and the broader brand identity were already entered, I simply needed to add a couple of 'buzzy' marketing words and GenStudio would do the rest - in a click the tool created four marketing mail-shots, each with slightly different headers and body text. It built in links to my make-believe store.\n\nAdobe MAX 2024, Adobe GenStudio products\n\nThe real power is in the platform's use of large language models, connected to data from partners including Meta, Microsoft, TikTok and Google it can rate the wording, headers, art and effectiveness of the campaign, with simple scores and suggested changes to improve the overall impact of the marketing materials. Once released the same process will track performance, offer feedback and suggestions for changes to improve the campaign. It can even be as granular as tracking colours your audience prefers.\n\nWhile this Adobe MAX demo created an email campaign, the same process can be used to make and launch social media posts, social ads and even to your own website. For artists seeking to launch new books and projects, get work noticed for sales, or for crafters on Etsy, GenStudio could really give you a boost.\n\nGenStudio is not the most exciting AI app announced at Adobe MAX 2024, that's clearly the new AI image rotation tool, but it does look to be taking the work out of artwork when it comes to marketing and wording social posts, something I know many creatives hate doing.\n\nAdobe MAX 2024, Adobe GenStudio email message\n\nGenStudio is perfect compliment to Adobe Express (which has some new AI features), but it can also be connected all Creative Cloud and Adobe's best software, including Photoshop.\n\nWhat is Adobe GenStudio?\n\nAdobe GenStudio is a new AI platform designed for marketing content across multiple channels, from social posts and ads to websites. It can generate marketing copy, create ads and schedule campaigns as well as rate performance of released content, and suggest changes."

She ultimately sought the help of a counselor. It was not until her most recent pregnancy that she also started to use an AI chatbot on the fem-tech app Soula, which she said helped with reducing depressive symptoms and reassuring her about her mental health.\n\n\"It tells me: 'Welcome back, LeRonika. Your reactions are natural,'\" said Francis, who is based in New Iberia, Louisiana.\n\nThe AI chatbot called \"Dua\" also sent her some videos that she could watch about self-hugging, a practice that could reduce stress levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I feel like Dua is there more than anything. It really showed me: OK, this is what you could do. Make sure you make time for yourself, too, because that's important as well,\" said Francis.\n\nSoula was co-founded by Natallia Miranchuk and Andrei Kulik, who conceptualized a 24/7 AI doula that could close the gap in mental health support for mothers during pregnancy and postpartum periods. Rather than replacing medical providers, apps such as Soula aim to increase broader access to maternal healthcare. Healthcare providers said that these apps could also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system, where wait times can be long and workers face burnout.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with OB/GYN doctors and doulas, who largely welcomed the rise in AI chatbots because they can make information more accessible to patients.\n\nAccording to data obtained from Sensor Tower, Soula now has more than 35,000 downloads. The startup has fundraised over $750,000 and is backed by investors such as Andrey Mikhaylyuk, the former vice president of product at Flo Health, a period tracking app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranchuk told BI that her experiences as a single mother of two and her work as a former maternity photographer inspired her to develop a supportive app for women. Initially conceptualized as a hub to connect doulas worldwide to those in need, the generative AI boom shifted the startup's focus to integrating a chatbot that could serve more populations.\n\n\"Women are shy to ask questions, even in the community, because they have the feeling that maybe 'as a mom, I should have known that, but I don't.' And she doesn't know where to go,\" Miranchuk said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe ease of customizing ChatGPT has spurred a wave of new AI-based chatbots like Soula. According to Sensor Tower, the companion apps Character.ai, Talkie, and Paradot have more than 73 million collective downloads, soaring more than 130% between 2023 and 2024. AI therapy apps such as Wysa and Woebot received over 1 million downloads, the data said.\n\nCorenia Smith, director of the Birth Justice Collaborative in Minnesota, said that while popularizing tools like chatbots can help broaden healthcare access, it is important to avoid a \"one size fits all\" and ensure that AI can reflect the communities it serves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are cultural practices that exist and have existed for thousands of years that people still use,\" Smith said. \"A human could talk about all their experience and what they've seen and give referrals. When you reach that limitation with an AI, it has to have the ability to hand over care or make a referral in a way where people don't feel dropped.\"\n\nThe role of a doula\n\nThe AI chatbot Dua aims to function like a doula, providing mothers with information about the pregnancy experience during a time of transition.\n\nDoulas are trained professionals who can provide non-medical, continuous physical, emotional, and information support for women before, during, and after childbirth, helping to reduce mental health-related morbidity for the mother and reduce infant mortality rates.\n\nAccess to doulas can be costly. While there's Medicaid coverage for doulas in several states, not all private health insurance plans cover these expenses. Long wait times and socioeconomic inequality also contribute to increased levels of stress and lack of healthcare usage among mothers and pregnant people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Traditionally, it's been something that's been available only to folks with a lot of money and a lot of resources. The people that benefit the most from doula care are those that might not trust the healthcare system,\" said Dr. Devon Rupley, an attending physician and OB/GYN specialist at NYC Health. \"That tends to be people of color who've had previously negative experiences with racism and bias that can really harm their experience in the healthcare system generally.\"\n\nRupley added that using an AI healthcare app to address basic questions can allow patients to spend higher-quality time with doctors by asking high-level questions and discussing their healthcare issues.\n\nDua is the Soula app's built-in AI chatbot. Soula\n\nHow to design an empathetic AI chatbot\n\nSoula enlisted real-life doulas to help train its chatbot and strike the right tone.\n\n\"We can't create it to be as personable as talking to a real-life person, but we can try to create that as much as possible,\" said Lexi Pacheco, a doula from Arizona who worked to help refine the dialogue in Soula's chatbot Dua. For $22 per hour, she helped improve the chatbot by using it \"hand-in-hand\" during her pregnancies, adding in her expertise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile asking questions on Google could yield more informational responses, Pacheco said mothers would want something that provided \"more of that reassurance that Google wouldn't.\"\n\nFor Armani Grant, a Soula user who became pregnant at 18, Google felt overwhelming. The chatbot allowed her to ask questions that she wouldn't feel comfortable asking her mother.\n\nPacheco said many women she's worked with reported similar experiences.\n\n\"They might even feel incompetent to ask the question, which no woman should ever feel, but with my history of working with people, they definitely tend to revert to: I'm sorry, I'm asking this question for some reason, and that might just be because of the societal pressure that more medicalized doctors have put on people that they don't give the time and day to us,\" Pacheco said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app isn't meant to completely replace a doula. Moreover, retention rates of AI healthcare chatbots can be low, said Johannes Eichstaedt, a computational social scientist and assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University. The high dropout rates for healthcare apps are \"an elephant in the room,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Pacheco said AI bots can help \"calm nerves\" and fill the gaps when patients feel they are \"bothering\" their healthcare providers.\n\n\"AI isn't like a healthcare provider to give you guidance, but it's supposed to be there to give you a little bit more comfort,\" Pacheco said."

Maybe.\n\nSusan Crane, a program manager for the Oak Park Park District, won\u2019t say what\u2019s there, but evidently it was enough to hire a team of paranormal investigators to find out exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\nAnd they\u2019re inviting interested spectators to join them on a \u201cthrilling journey through the dimly lit corridors and eerie rooms of this renowned estate, rumored to be a hotspot for supernatural activity,\u201d according to materials provided by the Park District.\n\nOn Friday, anyone over 21 can see, feel or hear for themselves what all lurks in the old home during a Park District event featuring paranormal experts Other Side Investigations.\n\nCrane said it will be OSI\u2019s first investigation for the Park District, though they\u2019ve been active in the Midwest for years. The team has been on site for preliminary inspection, however and Crane hosted another Pleasant Home ghost investigation a few years ago. But she\u2019s keeping mum about whatever she learned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say a word,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put any ideas into anybody\u2019s head. And when they came to look at the house, I didn\u2019t say anything. I can tell you one thing \u2014 there\u2019s nothing harmful or evil or anything like that. That\u2019s as specific as I want to get.\u201d\n\nThe event, listed on the Park District\u2019s website, has been a hot ticket item, with almost all 50 spots already gone \u2014 Crane said only about eight $50 tickets remain. At the very least, visitors are guaranteed a snack, a beverage and a tour of one of the oldest and grandest addresses in Oak Park.\n\nCrane said she wanted the event to be, above all, a fun night out for people. A chance to see friends, see history and tour a beautiful, restored local property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old house, it was built in 1897,\u201d Crane said. \u201cWe manage two homes; both are over 100 years old. This is another way to make the patrons engaged and see the historic houses. The Pleasant Home is one of the earliest examples of prairie style architecture in the country, so it\u2019s well-known to architecture buffs and the tour is another way for people to enjoy the home.\u201d\n\nVisitors will also get to learn a bit more about what it takes to detect the paranormal. The OSI team will divide the 50 people into two or three smaller groups and introduce attendees to their gear first \u2014 equipment to measure light, temperature, noise and more.\n\n\u201cThere is a science behind it, it\u2019s not just them talking about what they feel and what they may or may not see,\u201d Crane said.\n\nFrom there the tour will continue through the home, room by room, looking, listening and feeling things that just aren\u2019t right, maybe a cold spot, a strange, sudden bump or maybe a slight glimmer in a mirror, a face in the shadow something fleeting something you\u2019re sure you saw and you hope was caught on film.\n\nWhatever happens, Crane is ready for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think when we\u2019ve done it in the past, it\u2019s been really well received and I\u2019m looking forward to Friday night.\u201d\n\nAnd who knows. Maybe the house is looking forward to the visit, too.\n\nJesse Wright is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press."

Union Ave., and was later moved to 217 S. Union Ave. where it stands today.\n\nOutside the building stood the old hanging tree, a site with its own grim urban legend: on the boughs of the tall tree, legend has it many convicted criminals were hanged for their crimes in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nAccording to various historical accounts, 14 people were hanged from different branches of the tree at different times. At least one account put the number of people hanged at 16, although other accounts debate if anyone was actually hanged there at all, the Chieftain reported in 2019.\n\nAllegedly, those who died on the hanging tree continue to haunt the saloon to this day.\n\nA paranormal investigation of the restaurant was conducted in 2017 by Last Rites Paranormal Investigators, a group that has been investigating since 1998 in many locations, both private homes and businesses.\n\nDuring an investigation, Christopher Lucero and his team, usually composed of three to five people, set up equipment, ask questions, and record for intelligent responses, apparitions, and other paranormal activity, Lucero said. The team also looks for natural occurrences that may debunk their findings, such as noisy pipes, animal activity, or other explanations.\n\n\"We always try to debunk our own findings as much as we can,\" Lucero said. \"We don't jump to saying 'That's a ghost' when really it could have just been like a pipe or something.\"\n\nIn an investigation of the Gold Dust Saloon, Lucero stated the team recorded small orbs in pictures, as well as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), such as a child saying \"help\" twice.\n\nLucero also recalled feeling a presence at the saloon, although he stated he was not a psychic and relied on his equipment for results.\n\nThe Cortner House and reports of hauntings on the St. Charles Mesa\n\nThe Cortner House on Cortner Road past 27th Lane was demolished more than 20 years ago, but once was a destination for paranormal activity, the Chieftain reported in 2021.\n\nLocal urban legend has it that the abandoned house was haunted, mostly with spirits of those who'd died there and some who'd allegedly been sacrificed.\n\nLegend says that teenagers looking for a scare would participate in \"satanic rituals\" in the house, sacrificing live animals in hopes of summoning the entities that haunted the house.\n\nOne urban legend tells of an apparition of a legless, white dog with red eyes that supposedly can be seen hovering about in the area where the house stood.\n\nAnother story from the St. Charles Mesa and Vineland tells of a girl dressed in a hospital gown who will appear on the roads east of Pueblo. The girl is said to appear in the backseats of drivers who pass her on the road, hitching a ride before disappearing again.\n\nPueblo Central High School home to unexplained phenomena\n\nFormer Central High School drama teacher Elizabeth \"Bebe\" Mestas and her husband Richard told the Chieftain in 2017 about haunted phenomena in the high school's historic grounds.\n\nThe couple told the Chieftain about the theater's alleged haunting by a former drama teacher, Mary Richardson, who appeared as an apparition sitting in a chair in the theater where she used to sit to observe rehearsals.\n\nAlong with that ghost, the sounds of kids chattering and other unexplained phenomena could often be heard in the halls late at night, and on at least one occasion, an apparition appeared in the locked theater sound booth, the Mestas family said.\n\nSometimes, lights would also flicker, and equipment occasionally refused to function properly.\n\nStonemoor Hills haunted by goat-like specter\n\nStonemoor Hills, a residential area on the south side of Pueblo, is said to be haunted after a past murder. Some legends say the spirit that haunts the area is a goat-like creature called \"The Goat Man.\"\n\nDuring an October 2008 investigation, Last Rites captured the strongest EVP they've recorded, Lucero said.\n\n\"We got two different voices,\" Lucero recalled. \"One of them said, 'When?' and the other said, 'Right now.' Nothing happened to us but it sounded like they were planning something.\"\n\nLucero said during investigations, paranormal investigators commonly capture EVP, most often saying \"Help me\" or \"Get out.\"\n\nFire Station 3 Hose Museum sees truck moving by itself, ghostly handprint\n\nThe Hose Co. No. 3. Fire Museum, located at 116 Broadway Ave., is said to be helplessly haunted.\n\nStories tell of a fog that covers an upstairs window and a permanent handprint that can be seen in the fog. In 2005, a replica of a vintage fire engine was left idling outside and reportedly began moving by itself and made several turns, all with no driver in sight, as reported by the Boulder County Paranormal Research Society during a 2008 investigation.\n\nThe former firehouse was built in 1895 and was served by horse-drawn firefighting equipment for the first 20 years of its use. It now serves as a museum that honors the history of Pueblo first responders.\n\nIn a 2023 investigation, Last Rites investigators stated that while they were unable to record any EVPs or visible apparitions, electromagnetic field detectors, meant to detect changes in electromagnetic signatures resulting from the appearance of entities, went off several times, which Lucero stated was an indicator of possible ghosts in the building.\n\nPioneer Cemetery said to be haunted\n\nWhile Pioneer Cemetery Association President Joe Talbott confirmed that he has heard rumors of hauntings and apparitions at Pioneer Cemetery, he stated that he has personally never seen anything unexplainable.\n\nThe cemetery was established in 1870 and houses the graves of some of Pueblo's earliest residents.\n\n\"I know there has been a group go through, paranormal researchers, and apparently they found evidence 8-10 years ago,\" said Talbott. \"I wanted them to send me the information when they got done but they never did.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything or heard anything myself,\" Talbott emphasized. \"It's a nice, quiet, peaceful place.\" Talbott has led the association since 1997.\n\nSpooky season things to do in Pueblo:Ghost hunts, haunted houses and other spooky events to check out in Pueblo this October\n\nQuestions, comments, or story tips?

        "article_content": "For the first time, physicists have observed a \u201cblack hole triple\u201d in space. This new system is about 8,000 light years away from Earth and is made up of a central black hole that is in the act of consuming a small star spiraling very close to it. Surprisingly, a second star appears to also be circling the central black hole, but much further away. The discovery is described in a study published October 23 in the journal Nature.\n\nHitting a triple\n\nMost of the black holes that scientists have detected appear to be part of a pair called a binary system. These systems are made up of the black hole and a secondary object like a star, much denser neutron star, or another black hole. The binary system then spirals around each other and are drawn together by the black hole\u2019s gravity.\n\nFor this new black hole triple, there is an additional object orbiting the central black hole. The closer star orbits the black hole about every 6.5 days. The authors estimate that the more far-off companion orbits the black hole every 70,000 years.\n\n[Related: The hunt for the first stars in the universe.]\n\nThat a black hole appears to have a gravitational hold on an object that is so far away is raising some questions about the origins of this black hole itself. Scientists believe that black holes form from a supernova\u2013the violent explosion of a dying star. During a supernova, a star releases a huge amount of energy and light in one final burst before it collapses into an invisible black hole.\n\nIf this newly-observed black hole resulted from a typical supernova, the energy it would have released before it ultimately collapsed would have kicked away any more loosely bound objects orbiting on its outskirts. In theory, that second outer star shouldn\u2019t still be hanging around.\n\nThe team believes that the black hole formed through a more gentle process instead\u2013direct collapse. During direct collapse, a star simply caves in on itself and forms a black hole without that last dramatic burst. A gentle origin like this wouldn\u2019t really disturb any loosely bound, faraway objects.\n\nSince the new triple system includes a very far-off star, the system\u2019s black hole was potentially born through that gentler direct collapse. While astronomers have been observing violent supernovae for centuries, this new triple system may be the first evidence of a black hole that formed from this more gentle process.\n\n\u201cWe think most black holes form from violent explosions of stars, but this discovery helps call that into question,\u201d study co-author and MIT physicist Kevin Burdge said in a statement. \u201cThis system is super exciting for black hole evolution, and it also raises questions of whether there are more triples out there.\u201d\n\nChance discovery\n\nThis discovery also came about almost by chance. The physicists found it while looking through a repository of astronomical observations taken by telescopes in space and around the world called Aladin Lite. They used Aladin Lite to search for images of the same part of the sky, taken by different telescopes tuned to various wavelengths of energy and light.\n\nOriginally, they were looking within the Milky Way galaxy for signs of new black holes. Out of curiosity, Burdge reviewed an image of V404 Cygni, a black hole roughly 8,000 light years from Earth. In 1992, V404 Cygni became one of the very first objects in space to be confirmed as a black. Since then, it has been documented in over 1,300 scientific papers and is one of our most well-studied black holes. However, none of these studies reported this strange triple system.\n\n[Related: 1.5 billion cosmic objects dazzle in the largest infrared Milky Way map ever created.]\n\nWhile looking at optical images of V404 Cygni, Burdge saw what looked like two blobs of light that were close to one another. The first blob was the black hole and an inner star orbiting close by. That star is so close to the hole that it is releasing some of its material onto the black hole itself and giving off visible light. However, that second blob of light was most likely coming from a very distant star that had not been observed before.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can see two separate stars over this much distance actually means that the stars have to be really very far apart,\u201d said Burdge.\n\nCalculations found that the outer star is 3,500 astronomical units (AU) away from the black hole. One AU is the distance between Earth and the sun. The outer star is thus 3,500 times further away from the black hole as we are to the sun, or 100 times greater than the distance between Pluto and the sun.\n\nThe team then questioned whether the outer star was linked to both the black hole and its inner star. To find an answer, the team looked to Gaia, the satellite that has been tracking the motions of all the stars in the galaxy for a decade. They analyzed the motions of the inner and outer stars over the past 10 years of Gaia data and found that the stars moved in tandem compared to some of the nearby stars. According to their calculations, the odds of this kind of tandem motion are about one in 10 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not a coincidence or accident,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing two stars that are following each other because they\u2019re attached by this weak string of gravity. So this has to be a triple system.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go fly a (space) kite\n\nThe team then wondered how this system could have formed in the first place. The violent explosion of a typical supernova would have kicked that outstar away a very long time ago.\n\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re pulling a kite, and instead of a strong string, you\u2019re pulling with a spider web,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cIf you tugged too hard, the web would break and you\u2019d lose the kite. Gravity is like this barely bound string that\u2019s really weak, and if you do anything dramatic to the inner binary, you\u2019re going to lose the outer star.\u201d\n\nTo test out this kite string theory, Burdge carried out computer simulations to see how this kind of triple system could have evolved and kept the outer star.\n\n[Related: Biggest black hole jets ever seen span 140 Milky Way galaxies.]\n\nAt the beginning of each simulation, he introduced three stars. The third star was the black hole, before it became a black hole. He then ran tens of thousands of simulations. Each simulation had a slightly different scenario for how the third star may have become a black hole and affected the motions of the other two stars. For example, he simulated a supernova and changed the amount of energy and the direction all of that energy traveled in. He also simulated scenarios of direct collapse, where the third star caved in on itself to form a black hole, without sending off any energy.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of simulations show that the easiest way to make this triple work is through direct collapse,\u201d Burdge says.\n\nThis extra outer star also revealed the system\u2019s age. The team observed that the outer star is in the process of becoming a red giant, a phase occurring at the end of a star\u2019s life. They believe that the outerstar is about 4 billion years old, based on this transition. Since the neighboring stars are born around the same time, the team believes that this black hole triple is also 4 billion years old.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been able to do this before for an old black hole,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cNow we know V404 Cygni is part of a triple, it could have formed from direct collapse, and it formed about 4 billion years ago, thanks to this discovery.\u201d"

No sunlight reaches this region 200 to 1,000 meters below the sea surface, where levels of iron, a key micronutrient, are so low that bacteria growth is restricted.\n\nTo compensate, bacteria produce molecules called siderophores, which help them scavenge trace amounts of iron from surrounding seawater.\n\nn.Titled \u201cMicrobial iron limitation in the ocean\u2019s twilight zone,\u201d it was co-authored by Lauren Manck, a postdoctoral research associate with the University of Montana Flathead Lake Biological Station, and Matt Church, an FLBS aquatic microbial ecology professor.\n\nThe study findings offer insight into the ocean\u2019s capacity to absorb carbon, which plays an important role in naturally managing carbon dioxide levels in the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nNear the surface of the ocean, communities of planktonic algae use carbon dioxide dissolved in ocean water to photosynthesize and grow. Oceans act as significant sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, because when these algae die they descend into the deeper waters of the ocean where the carbon in their bodies is either consumed and recycled by bacteria or stored in the deepest regions of the ocean for long periods of time.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the amount of carbon that the ocean holds is crucial for understanding Earth\u2019s climate,\u201d Manck said. \u201cThe growth of bacteria in the dark ocean determines the efficiency of the ocean\u2019s carbon storage mechanism, so it is important to understand the factors, such as the availability of a nutrient like iron, that control the growth of bacteria.\u201d\n\nTo conduct the study, a team of researchers collected water samples from the upper 1,000 meters of the water column during an expedition through the eastern Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Tahiti.\n\nThe samples revealed the presence of siderophores, along with some surprising results. Siderophores are produced by bacteria when iron availability in the environment is very low \u2013 so low that it may be the limiting factor to their growth.\n\nNot only did the samples reveal that concentrations of siderophores were high in surface waters \u2013 where iron is expected to be deficient \u2013 but siderophores also were elevated in waters between 200 and 400 meters deep, where iron concentrations were previously thought to have little impact on the bacteria growth.\n\n\u201cThe discovery of siderophores at a large scale in the dark ocean significantly expands the region of the ocean where we think iron availability is impacting the uptake and storage of carbon,\u201d Manck said. \u201cUnderstanding these processes better will also help us better predict how the ocean will respond to future change.\n\nThe recent discovery was part of GEOTRACES, an international effort to provide high-quality data for the study of climate-driven changes in ocean biogeochemistry. Additional experiments in the North Pacific, as part of the Simons Collaboration of Ocean Processes and Ecology project, showed that not only was the concentration of siderophores high between 200 and 400 meters, but bacteria also took up siderophores from the environment at faster rates at depth than at the surface. This confirms the complete cycle of siderophore production and use by bacteria in this region of the ocean.\n\nThe study of siderophores is still in the early stages. Researchers involved in GEOTRACES only recently developed reliable methods to measure these molecules in water samples, and they\u2019re still working to understand where and when microbes use siderophores to acquire iron.\n\nAlthough the research into siderophores is new, this study demonstrates their clear impact on the movement of nutrients and carbon in the ocean\u2019s twilight zone.\n\n\u201cFor a full picture of how nutrients shape marine biogeochemical cycles, future studies will need to take these findings into account,\u201d said Daniel Repeta, a senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and co-author of the article. \u201cIn other words, experiments near the surface must expand to include the twilight zone.\u201d\n\nFunding for this work was provided by the National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation. The U.S. portion of the GEOTRACES research is provided by the National Science Foundation."

        "article_content": "Tua Tagovailoa is expected to return in Week 8 from the concussion he suffered in Week 2 against Buffalo, and hopefully he stays healthy for the rest of the season. If he plays as expected then I would start him against the Cardinals at home.\n\nTagovailoa scored 20.6 Fantasy points in his lone full game this year against Jacksonville in Week 1, and we know he's capable of being a top-10 Fantasy quarterback when healthy. You know Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle will be excited to get Tagovailoa back, and now Mike McDaniel can use his entire playbook.\n\nThe Cardinals allow an average of 21.4 Fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks, and Josh Allen, Jayden Daniels and Jordan Love all scored at least 26 Fantasy points against Arizona this season. I don't expect Tagovailoa to do that well, but over 20 Fantasy points is likely.\n\nIdeally, we get a shootout between the Dolphins and Cardinals, and Kyler Murray should also be considered a low-end starting Fantasy quarterback. Miami is actually No. 1 in the fewest fantasy points allowed to oppose quarterbacks for the season, but Murray has done well recently against San Francisco in Week 5 (26.1 points) and the Chargers in Week 7 (22.2 points).\n\nHe ran for at least 64 yards and a touchdown against the 49ers and Chargers, and hopefully his rushing production can put him over the top against the Dolphins. I'd love to see Tagovailoa and Murray both finish as top-10 quarterbacks in Week 8.\n\nFantasy Football Today Newsletter Know What Your Friends Don't Get tips, advice and news to win your league - all from the FFT podcast team.

Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs TEN DET -11 O/U 45.5 OPP VS QB 15th PROJ PTS 21.8 QB RNK 10th YTD Stats PAYDS 1610 RUYDS 17 TD 11 INT 4 FPTS/G 21 Goff is dialed in right now, scoring at least 22.8 Fantasy points in three games in a row, with at least 280 passing yards and two touchdowns in each outing. The Titans pass defense has improved this season but just allowed Josh Allen to pass for 323 yards and two touchdowns in Week 7. Standout cornerback L'Jarius Sneed (thigh) missed the Bills game, but even if he returns in Week 8, I still like Goff as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues. Dak Prescott QB DAL Dallas \u2022 #4\n\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ SF SF -4.5 O/U 46.5 OPP VS QB 13th PROJ PTS 19.2 QB RNK 9th YTD Stats PAYDS 1602 RUYDS 25 TD 9 INT 6 FPTS/G 17.7 Prescott is awesome after his bye week, and I hope history holds true in Week 8 against the 49ers. In seven career games after a bye, Prescott is averaging 28.1 Fantasy points, and he only has one outing over that span with fewer than 22.3 points. The last time we saw Prescott he was awful against Detroit with 3.2 Fantasy points, but he scored at least 20.4 points in each of his three games prior to Week 6. San Francisco isn't an easy matchup, allowing just 17.0 Fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks, but I'll take my chances with Prescott this week since he's coming off his bye. Caleb Williams QB CHI Chicago \u2022 #18\n\nAge: 22 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ WAS CHI -1.5 O/U 43.5 OPP VS QB 21st PROJ PTS 18.9 QB RNK 8th YTD Stats PAYDS 1317 RUYDS 169 TD 9 INT 5 FPTS/G 18.9 I hope the bye in Week 7 doesn't slow down Williams, who scored at least 27.6 Fantasy points in each of his past two starts against Carolina and Jacksonville. Those were two favorable matchups, but the Commanders have also allowed four quarterbacks this season to score at least 20.9 Fantasy points. Williams has top-10 upside this week, and it's great to see him using all of his weapons. That should continue against Washington on the road. Kirk Cousins QB ATL Atlanta \u2022 #18\n\nAge: 36 \u2022 Experience: 13 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ TB ATL -2.5 O/U 46 OPP VS QB 31st PROJ PTS 19.1 QB RNK 14th YTD Stats PAYDS 1830 RUYDS -8 TD 10 INT 7 FPTS/G 16.7 Cousins was a bust as the Start of the Week in Week 7 against Seattle with 9.2 Fantasy points, but I'll go right back to him again in Week 8 against Tampa Bay. We all remember the last time he faced the Buccaneers in Week 5 when he scored 42.4 Fantasy points with 509 passing yards, four touchdowns and one interception, and he should have the chance to be productive again in the rematch. Tampa Bay just allowed Lamar Jackson to pass for 281 yards and five touchdowns in Week 7, and hopefully Cousins can get back on track against this secondary. Aaron Rodgers QB NYJ N.Y. Jets \u2022 #8\n\nAge: 40 \u2022 Experience: 20 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ NE NYJ -7.5 O/U 41.5 OPP VS QB 11th PROJ PTS 16.5 QB RNK 12th YTD Stats PAYDS 1663 RUYDS 44 TD 10 INT 7 FPTS/G 17 The last time Rodgers faced the Patriots he scored a season-high 25 Fantasy points, and he didn't have Davante Adams for that Week 3 game. Adams didn't help Rodgers in Week 7 at Pittsburgh since he scored just 15 Fantasy points, but the Steelers pass defense is tough. I'm counting on Rodgers and Adams to have more success this week at New England, and I would use Rodgers as a low-end No. 1 quarterback in Week 8.\n\nSleepers (Start/Sit) Projections powered by Sportsline Geno Smith QB SEA Seattle \u2022 #7\n\nAge: 34 \u2022 Experience: 12 yrs. We don't know if Seattle will have DK Metcalf (knee) for this game, but Smith is still worth using as a starter in deeper leagues even if Metcalf is out. Smith leads the NFL in passing yards and has scored at least 21.8 Fantasy points in three of his past four games. He's also averaging 39.9 pass attempts a game for the season, so there should be a lot of volume here against the Bills in a potential shootout. Bo Nix QB DEN Denver \u2022 #10\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Nix is worth starting in deeper leagues in Week 8 against the Panthers, who are No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. Nix has emerged as one of the better running quarterbacks this season, and he has at least 61 rushing yards in each of his past two games against the Chargers and Saints. He also scored at least 19.3 Fantasy points in three of his past five games. Only two quarterbacks this season have failed to score at least 20 Fantasy points against Carolina's defense. Russell Wilson QB PIT Pittsburgh \u2022 #3\n\nAge: 35 \u2022 Experience: 13 yrs. Let's see if Wilson can cook again in Week 8 against the Giants after he just scored 28.9 Fantasy points against the Jets in Week 7 in his Steelers debut. The Giants allow an average of 20.4 Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season, and five quarterbacks in a row have scored at least 19.8 Fantasy points against New York coming into Week 8. I like Wilson as a starting Fantasy option in deeper leagues given this matchup.\n\nQBs to Sit Projections powered by Sportsline Brock Purdy QB SF San Francisco \u2022 #13\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs DAL SF -4.5 O/U 46.5 OPP VS QB 26th PROJ PTS 21.5 QB RNK 20th YTD Stats PAYDS 1841 RUYDS 154 TD 11 INT 7 FPTS/G 19.5 Purdy will be without Brandon Aiyuk (knee) and potentially Deebo Samuel (illness), Jauan Jennings (hip) and George Kittle (foot), which obviously isn't ideal. Now, the last time Purdy was down weapons in Week 3 against the Rams (Samuel and Kittle were out) he scored 31.8 Fantasy points, but it will be tough to trust him if anyone else joins Aiyuk on the sidelines. The Cowboys could also get Micah Parsons (ankle) back for this game, and Purdy has scored fewer than 18 Fantasy points in all but two contests this season. I would only start Purdy in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues. Patrick Mahomes QB KC Kansas City \u2022 #15\n\nAge: 29 \u2022 Experience: 8 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ LV KC -10 O/U 41.5 OPP VS QB 20th PROJ PTS 22.5 QB RNK 21st YTD Stats PAYDS 1389 RUYDS 122 TD 7 INT 8 FPTS/G 15.8 Things are looking up for Mahomes after the Chiefs traded for DeAndre Hopkins from the Titans on Wednesday, but we don't know if Hopkins will play in Week 8 against the Raiders. Mahomes needs help from his receivers since he's failed to throw a touchdown in consecutive games against the Saints and 49ers, and he now has more interceptions (eight) than touchdown passes (six) on the season. At some point, Mahomes will hopefully start producing at a high level, but until we see it, keep him reserved for Superflex and two-quarterback leagues only. Drake Maye QB NE New England \u2022 #10\n\nAge: 22 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs NYJ NYJ -7.5 O/U 41.5 OPP VS QB 5th PROJ PTS 13.3 QB RNK 23rd YTD Stats PAYDS 541 RUYDS 68 TD 5 INT 2 FPTS/G 17.4 I love what Maye has done in his first two NFL starts against the Texans and Jaguars, scoring at least 24.8 Fantasy points in each outing. But I expect a little regression to kick in against the Jets, who should get a boost in their pass rush with Haason Reddick ready to make his 2024 debut. Now, Josh Allen and Russell Wilson have each scored at least 28.4 Fantasy points against the Jets in consecutive games, but I'm not expecting that from Maye. He's only worth starting in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues. Anthony Richardson QB IND Indianapolis \u2022 #5\n\nAge: 22 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ HOU HOU -5.5 O/U 46 OPP VS QB 28th PROJ PTS 18.1 QB RNK 22nd YTD Stats PAYDS 783 RUYDS 197 TD 4 INT 6 FPTS/G 12.1 Richardson scored 30.1 Fantasy points in Week 1 against Houston. Since then he's combined for 34.6 Fantasy points in three healthy games. He's looking like a bust heading into a Week 8 rematch with the Texans, and he's only worth starting in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues. I hope I'm wrong about Richardson, and he can turn his season around. But we need to see it first, and scoring fewer than 12 Fantasy points a week isn't going to inspire much confidence from Fantasy managers."
