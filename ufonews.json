According to CTV News, the photo was released through a freedom of information request. Several redacted pages accompany the photo in question, though it is interesting to note how the photo was approved for release days after the incident but held back.\n\nThe incident was one of a few within days in February 2023. At least three objects were found and downed over Alaska, the Yukon, and Lake Huron. According to the New York Post, these three objects are \"small metallic [balloons] with a tethered payload,\" and were much smaller than the suspected Chinese spy balloon that traveled across the U.S. before being shot down over South Carolina on Feb. 4, 2023.\n\nCanada has unveiled the first-ever image of the UFO downed during a joint US-Canada mission in February 2023. The grainy photo shows a circular, white object shot by a US Air Force F-22 fighter jet.pic.twitter.com/re0pQB6QX7 \u2014 Breaking News (@TheNewsTrending) September 24, 2024\n\n\"Should the image be released, it would be via the [Canadian armed forces] social media accounts,\" an official wrote in the documents. \"Given the current public environment and statements related to the object being benign, releasing the image may create more questions/confusion, regardless of the text that will accompany the post.\"\n\nThe delay is implied to be the result of a pause due to \"pending U.S. engagement.\" At the time, President Joe Biden confirmed the three objects were downed but added that there weren't any \"suggestions they were related to China's spy balloon program, or that they were surveillance vehicles from any other country.\"\n\nThe debris from these objects was never recovered due to poor weather and the slim odds that anything could be recovered after being shot down. Some descriptions of the object in the documents indicate it had a distinctive shape.\n\n\"Visual \u2013 a cylindrical object,\" the email with the photo described. \"Top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20-foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended from it.\"\n\nThe photo seems to be taken from below the object, and some have pointed out that the photo resembles similar balloons photographed from below. That said, others are taking the photo as evidence of secret aircraft possibly from an otherworldly intelligence.\n\nIf anything, the object stands as evidence that there is a lot of stuff floating around in the sky that we have no clue about."

        "article_content": "\n\n\n\nAlthough questions remain whether locals really did see a UFO landing in Bentilee more than 50 years ago, a new dramatised version of the event put on by Claybody Theatre promises to be out of this world. Here StokeonTrentLive takes a look back at that day in 1967 as space fever gripped the nation...\n\nBack in 1967, when space exploration was capturing everyone's imagination, residents of Stoke-on-Trent were abuzz with talk of unidentified flying objects, especially as summer drew to a close and numerous sightings were reported.\n\nHowever, it was the events of September 2 that left even seasoned UFO enthusiasts scratching their heads. Numerous independent witnesses described seeing a red glowing object that night, causing quite a stir.\n\nREAD MORE:John Caudwell hits back at troll's 'untruths' after 'old, bald d***head' jibe\n\nREAD MORE:54 death notices in Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire this week\n\nStokeonTrentLive has obtained footage from an ATV Today broadcast, where presenter Gwyn Richards describes the 'extraordinary event' witnessed by many. Among those interviewed are neighbours Mrs Bowen and Mrs Stephenson, who both observed the UFOs descent near their estate.\n\nMrs Bowen, speaking calmly, recounted: \"It seemed like a saucer, you know. It changed in different colours - a red, a greenish and a blue. I did get frightened of it when it dropped.\"\n\nMrs Stephenson recalled: \"The object glowed bright red as if someone had lit a bonfire in the middle of a field. It spanned half a field. We could see the outline of it clearly like a dome but we couldn't see no door. There was no heat it was just a red glow.\n\n\"We couldn't even hear a bird, everything was dead. There was a man standing behind us. He said 'Did you two see it? '. We said 'yes'. He said 'I was in the bedroom and we thought the field was on fire because the bedroom was illuminated red. I came down because I thought I was seeing things'.\n\n-Credit:No credit\n\n\"While me and Mrs Bowen were at the bottom of the close we saw the object in the sky going the same way as it had come. The colours were glowing and it was going at a high speed.\"\n\nYoung Malcolm Bowen and three other lads also witnessed the strange occurrence that night, while an officer admitted his concern led him to advise the younger kids to go back indoors.\n\nMalcolm shared his experience: \"The rest of them ran off and I just stayed there. It was just like an ordinary saucer with a round sort of thing on the top. We thought it was an aeroplane at first but we all kept quiet.\n\n\"We saw it going round and then we said it couldn't be an aeroplane. We didn't hear any sound. We saw a very bright glow and it went straight up in the air and it went spinning round. Ten or 12 seconds later it went out of sight.\"\n\nA local policeman, taking a more cautious stance, also provided his take on the Bentilee UFO sighting, suggesting a potential explanation.\n\nHe recounted: \"We got there and we were met by a gang of children and one or two adults who informed us that they had seen this glow in the sky travelling from east to west or west to east, I can't remember exactly which. And that it had disappeared over the brow of the hill we were facing.\n\n\"We started climbing this banks. We were a little apprehensive and we did send quite a few children back who were quite small. These things could happen but I don't actually believe in them but I can't prove it one way or the other.\n\n\"The parents of the children were so adamant that this thing had happened we thought we'd be on the safe side. We carried on to the top of the hill and could see no signs. We could see nothing at all.\"\n\n\"In the distance there was a public house that had all yellow signs around it. I assumed that this lighting up for the first time could have been what they had seen.\"\n\nUFO experts Roger Stanway and Tony Pace also offered insights during an interview at Newchapel Observatory, reflecting on the Bentilee incident as 'quite incredible'.\n\nThey also mentioned that their investigation results were taken seriously by the Ministry of Defence, confirming an occurrence on the estate that particular evening.\n\nMr Pace added: \"The fact that quite a few witnesses were quite worried and disturbed at what had occurred convinced us that something really strange had happened on that Saturday night in September 1967.\"\n\nMr Stanway revealed: \"We couldn't find any explanation from the sources we contacted; air traffic control, the police, things of that nature. And as people on the estate wanted an explanation and we wanted something as well, we thought we'd go down to the MoD in London.\n\nNo caption\n\n\"We discussed the Bentilee episode as there was a terrific amount of evidence and independent witnesses. I then faced them with the bold question - 'Well gentleman, do you think in fact what is described in this report actually did take place? '. The reply was 'yes'.\"\n\n\"Well this somewhat surprised me as I expected them to have a number of explanations. My next question was 'What is the explanation, what were these objects, these phenomena? '. Much to my surprise they said 'we have no idea'. My immediate reaction was to say 'does this worry you? '. And they said 'yes'.\"\n\nWrapping up, Mr Richards made a call to Manchester Airport from a public telephone to report his unusual sighting of an unidentifiable craft over Derbyshire.\n\nMr Stanway and Mr Pace documented upwards of 70 distinct UFO encounters within a 20-mile expanse of Stoke-on-Trent, all detailed in their dossier 'UFOs: Unidentified, Undeniable'.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with the press, Mr Pace recounted the peculiar surge in UFO activity around Stoke-on-Trent's Bentilee area back in 1967: \"There were many reports of UFOs in the Potteries, and many seemed to be centred over the Bentilee area. At the time it was a country-wide phenomenon, there were sightings all over the country. You can't just dismiss things like that when so many people saw things.\"\n\nNorth Staffordshire historian Bill Cawley delved into these odd occurrences on the Bentilee estate and in neighbouring regions.\n\nHe explained: \"Reports of strange things in the sky stretched from Cannock to the hills above Leek. But the centre of much activity was the Bentilee estate, and the local media was full of sightings of UFOs in the skies of the city.\"\n\n\"On September 2, there were eight different sightings between 1am and dawn, with a lack of sound being a feature of all the sightings. An object like a spinning top was spotted by a resident of Beverley Drive.\n\n\"There was a very interesting account given by a Mrs Becanin. As an accomplished artist, she provided line drawings of what she had seen from her home in Hethersett Walk in the early hours.\n\n\"She couldn't sleep, and at 1am, after a drink of water, she looked through a window to see three orange lights lying on common ground some distance away. One of the lights seemed closer to her and larger, and was flashing with a brighter light.\n\n\"It began to ascend with a shower of green sparks, disappearing to the north east. The other two lights also vanished. The whole incident took two minutes. Another group saw a basin-shaped object fly overhead. It was glowing red and yellow, and appeared to land in fields off Beverley Drive.\"\n\n\"Children and adults ran in the direction of the landing site and one of the children said the area seemed on fire. Something had landed in the field and remained. A woman rang the police, who duly arrived. They saw nothing, but on leaving the area, a man in an upper room window called over that the saucer was taking off. It rose to about 300ft and then disappeared.\n\n\"When they were interviewed, the police remained sceptical and said the lights might have been reflections from street lighting or from the windows of a local pub. Then, on September 4, Terry Bagnall, aged 15, of Beverley Drive, saw a brightly coloured cigar-shaped object fly over the area with a bright light, which increased in intensity as it rose in the late morning sky.\"\n\n\"The report pointed out that jets using Manchester airport flew over the area, and that this would account for some of the sightings. It was also possible that many would have confused UFOs with satellites. A person mistaking the planet Venus was another possibility, as was freak weather conditions. However, Stanway and Pace concluded that 10 per cent of the sightings were unexplained.\"\n\nWhatever happened on that night in Bentilee, the truth is out there.\n\nBright Lights Over Bentilee has been written by playwright and former Coronation Street star Deborah McAndrew. It runs until October 12 at The Dipping House, Stoke.\n\nSign up to our main daily newsletter here and get all the latest news straight to your inbox for FREE"

However, when the 57-year-old isn't talking about the action in the octagon, he's sharing his thoughts on a variety of other topics.\n\nDuring a recent episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\", Rogan discussed the possibilities of life on other planets, including UFOs and UAPs.\n\n\"When I hear the UFO stuff, there's a part of my brain that's like don't get suckered into this. This s*it's nonsense! It's just that, if they were to tell me that a super volcano was going to erupt, I'd believe it because they are real. But for UFOs, there's part of me that says I don't believe you!,\" said Rogan while talking with guest Shawn Ryan.\n\nRogan shares story from his past\n\nRogan also discussed a story told to him by a woman he dated in the 90s. She stated she lost some of her privileges at work when she started looking into life on other planets.\n\n\"When I was very young, around 24, I was dating this girl who did something in the government and this was pre-internet. One of her jobs was to make sure that the information that the Navy had would reach the Army,\" said Rogan.\n\n\"There was some sort of database in like these computer terminals where she could share information and she had some sort of top clearance. One day, she wrote 'Little Green Men' in the search function, and then her system shut down and people visited her.\n\n\"They asked her why she looked this up and I think she ended up losing her clearance in some way. She was doing something that was not requested by the authorities and did it on her own.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Rogan has talked about aliens on his show. He once spoke with Dr. Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist who theorized that a mysterious interstellar object 'Oumuamua' may be the origin of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n\"Basically, I follow the evidence. Just like Sherlock Holmes trying to find solutions,\" said Loeb. \"You have some anomalies that don't quite match to things that you expect to. The thing about Oumuamua was that it was discovered on 19 October 2017 and it was the very first object that visited the vicinity of our planet outside of the solar system!\""

        "article_content": "As more and more companies scramble to jam artificial intelligence into literally everything, I find myself becoming increasingly desensitized to the prospect of using AI for really anything. I loathe the anti-creative powers of generative AI for text and image creation, and I\u2019m so over products carrying AI branding for no reason (I\u2019m looking at you, Samsung Family Hub AI Vision fridge).\n\nAs a serial gym goer, however, there\u2019s one area of my life where AI has proven indispensable for more than a year, and that\u2019s in powering my workouts. Last year, I was introduced to PUSH, an AI-powered workout app and gym tracker designed to help you build muscle as quickly as possible by taking a scientific approach to workout creation.\n\nGive or take a couple of injuries and some holidays, I\u2019ve used PUSH six days a week, every week, for over a year. I\u2019ve done hundreds of workouts, and in that time I\u2019ve learned more about exercise than all my previous years of experience attending the gym. It\u2019s definitely one of the best fitness apps I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nPUSH is a delight to use, it\u2019s got a great interface that\u2019s very easy to use, rest counters, custom workout plans, and more. Yet more valuable than the joy I\u2019ve had using the app, PUSH has taught me some invaluable lessons about building muscle in the gym I can\u2019t wait to share with you. Here\u2019s everything I\u2019ve learned.\n\nProgressive overload really matters\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the gym or building muscle, you might have heard the term \u2018progressive overload\u2019 bandied around. Even as a long-time gym goer, I was familiar with the concept, but until I started using PUSH, I\u2019d never really taken it seriously.\n\nPUSH is hyper-tuned to help you gradually increase the amount of weight you\u2019re lifting over time, a tried and tested vehicle for building muscle. I\u2019d spent years bench pressing maybe 70 or 80kgs (175lbs-ish), occasionally pushing the boat out to 85kgs if I was feeling sprightly.\n\nPUSH has helped me elevate my bench press to a consistent 100kgs for multiple sets of five in less than 12 months. Across the board, all of my movements and lifts have increased in power and weight because PUSH doesn\u2019t let you take your foot off the gas. As soon as you can achieve the desired number of reps at a certain weight, PUSH uses its AI algorithm to calculate your next increment. If you fail a set or can\u2019t see a certain weight through to completion, it\u2019ll automatically calculate a plateau-breaker exercise, usually an increased weight for fewer reps, to help you smash through your next barrier.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWith PUSH in my pocket, I\u2019m no longer guessing weights for workouts, or retreading ground. I\u2019m just making clear consistent progress week-in, week-out.\n\nIt\u2019s time to ditch the Bro Split\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nMost people tend to split their gym program up into body parts. Chest on Monday, back on Tuesday, then legs, shoulders, arms, etc\u2026 in gym circles, this is known as the \u201cBro Split\u201d. If it works for you then that\u2019s fine, but PUSH\u2019s tailor-made program uses AI and peer-reviewed scientific research to calculate a plan that lets you train your entire body in an optimal cycle.\n\n\n\nFor instance, on some days, I train back, legs, arms, and shoulders, all at once. It took some getting used to \u2013 doing lateral pulldowns right after squats isn\u2019t fun \u2013 but by carefully training muscles in a more target way, rather than just blasting chest on a Monday once a week and so on, I\u2019ve noticed a much more consistent and manageable progression in my strength and improved recovery. You can opt for a push, pull, leg split in the PUSH app if you so desire, but I\u2019ve put my faith in the AI algorithm and its unconventional muscle groupings, and I\u2019ll never go back.\n\nRest is important\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWhile the aforementioned muscle groupings help with longer-term fatigue over the weeks and months, PUSH also comes with a built-in rest timer for use between sets. I probably spent six years in the gym just guessing at how long I was taking between sets, choosing when to start my next exercise based purely on vibes and whether or not I\u2019d finished cruising Instagram.\n\nPUSH\u2019s regimented rest timer, which varies depending on the type of exercise you\u2019re doing, has shown me the importance of training to a precise period of rest. Too little time between sets, and your muscles won\u2019t have recovered, leaving you unable to push as much as you need. Too long, and you won\u2019t be fatiguing your muscles enough to make any progress.\n\nAgain, PUSH uses AI to determine what constitutes an ideal rest time but gives you the final say in how long you take, letting you tweak rest periods slightly based on how you\u2019re feeling. With set rest times between exercises, I\u2019ve massively improved the progress I make in the gym, all while reducing how long I actually spend in the gym.\n\nGrowth takes time\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWe live in a world of instant gratification, but PUSH has helped me understand that growing and building muscle takes time and commitment. Having an app show me my progress week-by-week has been vital in keeping me motivated, even when the results aren\u2019t physically obvious or immediate.\n\nSeeing consistent strength gains each time I return to the gym is a terrific motivator, and has helped me to take my eyes off trying to make big jumps in performance or expecting huge changes in my physique. What\u2019s more, knowing you\u2019re on a steady upward trajectory takes ego lifting and overexerting yourself out of the equation, with measured increases drastically reducing the chances of injury, and of course embarrassment.\n\nInvesting in a program is worth it\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nI pay \u00a315.99 ($21 / AU$23.49) a month for the privilege of using PUSH. That\u2019s a lot of money for a monthly subscription app, but for me the investment is priceless. I\u2019m convinced that with PUSH I\u2019m getting good value out of the app. It\u2019s well-built, gets regular updates, and most importantly has proven effective for me. However, there\u2019s also an extra kick of motivation in knowing that if I\u2019m paying \u00a316 a month for a workout app, I should probably use it to the full, instead of wasting my money.\n\nIt\u2019s the same tortured logic that says buying a pair of the best running shoes will help you get out an exercise, or that paying for a gym membership is more likely to get you out of the house each January. It might not work for everyone, but the financial commitment I\u2019ve made to this app keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAnd a whole lot more besides\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nPUSH has more to offer. It\u2019s got a great library of exercises that help me plan around a busy gym or lack of equipment. Its plethora of peer-reviewed source material is well presented and makes for an interesting read, and its daily insights tell me which muscles I\u2019m growing and which might be stalling, another fabulous motivator. It\u2019s not a perfect app and it won\u2019t work for everyone, but after 12 months in my pocket, it\u2019s become an indispensable training partner."

So in this Google Pixel AI vs Samsung Galaxy AI comparison, let\u2019s dissect their unique approaches and determine which Android giant truly reigns supreme in the AI arena.\n\nGoogle Pixel AI vs Samsung Galaxy AI: Photography, editing, audio\n\nReimagine in Magic Editor Samsung Generative Edit Pixel Recorder\n\nLong before the AI era, computational photography was pushing the boundaries of smartphone camera quality. Thanks to AI, that trend has only accelerated now, sometimes in bizarre ways. For example, both Google and Samsung allow you to add or remove objects from your shots.\n\nSince this category includes many features, here\u2019s a quick rundown of what you get from Pixel AI vs Galaxy AI: Image editing : The Google Photos app on Pixel and Gallery app on Galaxy smartphones includes Generative Edit, which can remove distractions. Samsung allows you to move objects from one image to another and expand images beyond their original dimensions. Both apps also let you \u201creimagine\u201d or replace portions of an image with something entirely different \u2014 imagine turning a pothole into a mini volcano.\n\n: The Google Photos app on Pixel and Gallery app on Galaxy smartphones includes Generative Edit, which can remove distractions.

Add Me (Pixel-exclusive) : The Pixel 9 series can merge two or more photos of the same setting to stitch the photographer into the frame. The feature, dubbed Add Me, can be used to include that one person always left out of group shots.\n\n: The Pixel 9 series can merge two or more photos of the same setting to stitch the photographer into the frame.

Audio Magic Eraser (Pixel-exclusive) : While video quality has improved leaps and bounds in recent years, audio has never received the same attention. Luckily, the Google Photos app on Pixel 8 and newer devices include an Audio Magic Eraser feature that lets you remove traffic noise, wind, and other unwanted sounds after the fact.\n\n: While video quality has improved leaps and bounds in recent years, audio has never received the same attention.

Video Boost (Pixel-exclusive) : Modern smartphones can capture and process shots incredibly quickly, but doing the same thing for videos requires immense computing power. Since the task just isn\u2019t possible on a smartphone, Google\u2019s Video Boost feature uploads recorded videos to the cloud and enhances them with Night Sight and HDR+ for better lighting and clarity. It works quite well but can take hours to process a single video in my experience.\n\n: Modern smartphones can capture and process shots incredibly quickly, but doing the same thing for videos requires immense computing power.

Recorder : Both Google and Samsung use AI within their respective voice Recorder apps to transcribe and summarize recordings. This feature can condense hours-long recordings down to just a handful of bullet points, which you can then easily share or export to a different app.\n\n: Both Google and Samsung use AI within their respective voice Recorder apps to transcribe and summarize recordings. This feature can condense hours-long recordings down to just a handful of bullet points, which you can then easily share or export to a different app. AI image generation: The Pixel 9 series ships with a dedicated image generator app dubbed Pixel Studio that can convert a few words into art. It\u2019s a cool party trick and might be useful if you often create stickers for group chats, but the app needs an internet connection to work. Samsung doesn\u2019t offer a competing app, although Sketch to Image can convert your S-Pen doodles into lifelike images. That said, you could just as easily use Midjourney or any other AI image generator on any phone. Many of the features in this section, except the Recorder apps, require an internet connection and will involve sending your images to the cloud for processing.\n\nGoogle Pixel AI vs Samsung Galaxy AI: Language and text\n\nSamsung Composer Gboard Voice Typing Pixel Screenshots Samsung Chat Assist\n\nGiven that modern AI can understand language as well as a human, it\u2019s no surprise that the technology has made its way into our texting apps and digital keyboards. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the language-related AI features on Samsung and Google devices: Samsung Chat Assist : If you\u2019re unsure about your spelling, grammar, or tone, you can enlist the help of an on-device AI model built into the Samsung Keyboard app to fix anything you\u2019ve typed. It works in any app and the Composer feature can also be used to generate paragraphs of text in different styles like professional, casual, polite, and witty. For example, I recently tasked the AI to generate a complaint email to my utility provider \u2014 it only saved me a minute or two of typing, though.\n\n: If you\u2019re unsure about your spelling, grammar, or tone, you can enlist the help of an on-device AI model built into the Samsung Keyboard app to fix anything you\u2019ve typed.

For example, I recently tasked the AI to generate a complaint email to my utility provider \u2014 it only saved me a minute or two of typing, though. Proofread with Gboard (Pixel-exclusive) : As the title suggests, this feature can correct grammar or punctuation errors automatically. The keyboard app will automatically surface a \u201cFix it\u201d button when the on-device AI detects errors in your text. Unfortunately, it only works in the US and doesn\u2019t support any language other than English.\n\n: As the title suggests, this feature can correct grammar or punctuation errors automatically.

It works very well in my experience, even with a heavy accent, and is almost reason enough to own a Google device.\n\n: While not a new feature by any means, the Gboard app offers a much better voice dictation feature that can seamlessly transcribe your words and add punctuation without manually instructing it. It works very well in my experience, even with a heavy accent, and is almost reason enough to own a Google device. Pixel Screenshots: If you routinely capture screenshots to remember snippets from various apps, the Pixel Screenshots app can help you organize and search for information. You can search for text within images or ask questions like \u201cWhen is my flight to Tokyo?\u201d and get nearly instant answers based on the screenshots in your gallery. The app relies on Google\u2019s on-device Gemini Nano model, meaning images are processed locally.\n\nGoogle Pixel AI vs Samsung Galaxy AI: Phone calls\n\nCall Screening Samsung Live Translate\n\nThe Pixel\u2019s Call Screening feature is not new by any means but it is an introvert\u2019s dream \u2014 if you hate the idea of answering calls from unknown numbers, you can let AI answer the call and ask who\u2019s calling. The other person\u2019s responses appear on-screen and you can pick suggested replies for the AI to read out loud.\n\nSamsung also offers a similar feature, dubbed Bixby Text Call, but the AI\u2019s voice isn\u2019t as polished in my experience. The upside is that you can type out responses meaning you aren\u2019t limited to the phone\u2019s suggestions.\n\nIn the US, the Pixel can automatically screen calls even if you\u2019re not around your phone. Your phone will only ring if the AI has ruled out the possibility of a spam call. Samsung doesn\u2019t offer this feature yet and cannot prompt the opposite party to leave a message. Google also introduced Call Notes with the Pixel 9, which records phone calls and generates bulleted summaries after you hang up.\n\nThe Pixel offers Call Screening for spam mitigation, while Samsung's Live Translate lets you converse in foreign languages.\n\nMoving on, Live Translate is one of Samsung\u2019s headlining AI features. It allows you to have a real-time phone conversation in two completely different languages. If you speak English and the other person only knows Spanish, for example, Live Translate will automatically translate both speakers\u2019 speech after a slight delay. This means you can have back-and-forth conversations in foreign languages without actually learning any of them. Needless to say, this feature is invaluable while traveling or living abroad.\n\nFor its part, the Pixel\u2019s AI suite includes Direct My Call and Hold for Me \u2014 two closely related features that take the frustration out of contacting a support helpline. The former allows you to navigate IVR menus (the kind that prompts you to press numbers on your phone\u2019s dialpad) without listening to the slow narration. Finally, Hold for Me prompts you with a vibration when a human representative returns to your call after a long hold.\n\nNone of the features in this section require an internet connection as all AI processing takes place on-device.\n\nGoogle Pixel AI vs Samsung Galaxy AI: Supported countries and availability\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nWhile Google and Samsung have both developed extensive AI suites, feature availability remains a sore spot on Pixel devices. As someone who lives in Asia, I can attest that many of the Pixel\u2019s best features like Call Screening simply aren\u2019t available. This isn\u2019t limited to AI either \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s Thermometer app cannot measure body temperature where I live because Google has only received regulatory approval in some regions.\n\nSo if you live outside of the US, I\u2019d highly recommend checking out which features you won\u2019t have access to. Luckily, many of the photography and image editing features work globally since they don\u2019t have to be adapted for specific languages or markets. However, many of these features (like Magic Editor) are also available on non-Google devices, giving you one less reason to buy a Pixel over a Samsung phone.\n\nSamsung does a much better job of maintaining feature parity across the world. Galaxy AI offers Live Translate for phone calls globally, in a long list of languages, while the Pixel\u2019s Call Screening is only available in a handful of countries.\n\nGoogle Pixel AI vs Samsung Galaxy AI: Common features\n\nEven though Google and Samsung are technically competitors looking to maximize sales of their own smartphones, they work closely with each other in other areas like software. Google maintains the Android operating system as we know it, after all, and Samsung sells the most Android-powered phones every year. This synergy extends to AI as well, with Google offering many of its AI models to Samsung and other Android brands. With that in mind, here\u2019s a list of the AI features you\u2019ll find on both Galaxy and Pixel devices: Gemini chatbot : While flagship phones from Samsung and Google both run the on-device Gemini Nano AI model, there\u2019s also the Gemini app that you can access on any Android phone. Meant to replace the Google Assistant, this chatbot can perform a variety of tasks \u2014 it can set alarms, play music, make phone calls, and control your smart home. Therefore, if you only care about AI that can handle phone-related tasks, both Pixel and Galaxy AI will serve your needs just fine.\n\n: While flagship phones from Samsung and Google both run the on-device Gemini Nano AI model, there\u2019s also the Gemini app that you can access on any Android phone.

Circle to Search : While Samsung announced Circle to Search at the Galaxy S24 launch event, the feature relies entirely on Google\u2019s technologies and even lives within the search giant\u2019s app. In a nutshell, Circle to Search allows you to look up any image or piece of text on your phone\u2019s screen without leaving the app you\u2019re currently in. The feature immediately made its way to Google\u2019s Pixel line and has even started trickling to other Android brands.\n\n: While Samsung announced Circle to Search at the Galaxy S24 launch event, the feature relies entirely on Google\u2019s technologies and even lives within the search giant\u2019s app. In a nutshell, Circle to Search allows you to look up any image or piece of text on your phone\u2019s screen without leaving the app you\u2019re currently in.

Google Photos : Recent Pixel devices have launched with timed exclusive Google Photos features that are now widely available across all Android phones, including Samsung ones. The AI-powered Magic Editor feature, for example, started out as a Pixel 8 exclusive but is now available to everyone. The only caveat is that Google limits the number of Magic Editor saves per month on non-Pixel devices. However, you can overcome this restriction as well if you subscribe to any Google One premium plan.\n\n: Recent Pixel devices have launched with timed exclusive Google Photos features that are now widely available across all Android phones, including Samsung ones.

However, you can overcome this restriction as well if you subscribe to any Google One premium plan. Generative wallpapers: Google\u2019s AI-powered generative wallpapers feature is available on both Pixel and Galaxy phones. Simply pick a few keywords and it will generate one-of-a-kind art that you can set as your homescreen background. It\u2019s easy to overlook this feature, but it negates the need for a third-party wallpaper app. It\u2019s worth noting that many new features may arrive on the latest Pixel smartphones first. But as we\u2019ve seen with recent additions like Gemini Live, Google tends to eventually open up access to all Android users. You may need a Gemini Advanced subscription to unlock newer features, but that\u2019s also usually true of older Pixel devices.\n\nBottom line then, you can\u2019t go wrong with either the Pixel or Galaxy AI suites. I personally prefer having access to Google\u2019s bespoke AI features like Gboard\u2019s Assistant-powered voice typing and Call Screening, if it\u2019s supported where you live. However, Samsung has also stepped up its game recently \u2014 Live Translate is a must-have for me while traveling abroad and the feature parity across all countries makes it even more compelling.

        "article_content": "I'm convinced AI will take over, but not in the way you think\n\nI understand why AI has become a focus for smartphone manufacturers. With the camera race dying down, companies needed a new way to differentiate their products and convince us to upgrade. Apple spent its entire Fall event showcasing Apple Intelligence for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, highlighting features that wouldn't be available on launch. Similarly, for much of its Made by Google event, Google demonstrated Gemini Advanced functionality on the Google Pixel 9 series.\n\nArtificial intelligence can be helpful, and I'm not here to hate on the benefits of the user experience. After all, I left my tin foil hat at home. However, Apple and Google demonstrated multiple AI tools that are legitimately concerning. So, whether your dystopian outlook of AI comes from Skynet or The Matrix, let's consider what I think the real danger of too much AI is.\n\nI'm mostly excited about what AI brings\n\nOur apps and notifications are going to be better\n\nGoogle Maps cannot be used from Gemini Live\n\nI'm optimistic about many of the new AI functions Google and Apple highlighted in the last few months. I'm glad Google unveiled more practical AI functions. The company may still show off apps like Pixel Studio, but we're moving towards more productivity-based tools. I've used Gemini Live much more than I initially thought. It isn't perfect and doesn't fully replace Google Assistant, but it's a step in the right direction, and natural-language AI is starting to come around.\n\nIn addition, Apple Intelligence promises multiple helpful features (when it's released). I love the way it will clean up notifications, prioritizing time-sensitive messages that need attention. I'm also looking forward to enhanced AR functions, with AI recognizing what we see through the camera. Plus, we can't forget the computational photography improvements, with AI getting the most out of our photos, even in low-lighting conditions. It isn't all bad, but some things concern me.\n\nGoogle and Apple are taking AI a step beyond\n\nWe're not just helping brainstorm anymore\n\nAI farming out art\n\nI've long worried about technology's role in destroying interpersonal communication. We prefer to send texts or emails instead of calling someone on the phone, and speaking directly to people is becoming a lost art. But apparently, it isn't enough to rely solely on emails and written communication anymore. We're hoping AI can do the heavy lifting for us.\n\nGoogle showed an example of AI drafting an email to an apartment manager complaining that the air conditioning had stopped working. Without a single human input, Gemini created an entire message ready to be sent, all with personal touches and greetings. It was designed to look like someone wrote it and the technology will only improve.\n\nApple took proofreading a step further, showing a Slack message entirely transformed by AI. Instead of communicating with colleagues, you can give a general idea of what you want to say and Apple Intelligence takes care of the rest. It's a slippery slope and a sign of things to come.\n\nWithout a single human input, Gemini created an entire message ready to be sent, all with personal touches and greetings.\n\nHow much is too much when it comes to AI?\n\nI don't think we can be trusted to curb convenience\n\nA live demonstration of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Google Gemini AI\n\nHow long will it be before AI handles both sides of a conversation? Messenger apps are already learning our speech patterns and phrasing to craft responses that sound more like what we'd say. I don't think it's a stretch to envision a time when two messenger programs speak with each other on our behalf, and then provide us with a summary of what was said. I don't think we can resist the temptation of effortless communication, and I fear it will erode our ability to relate to each other.\n\nGemini Live is a valuable tool for brainstorming, allowing us to bounce ideas around and formulate new ones. But that's the limit of what I want. I still want to be the one generating my thoughts, and I want to make sure my words are what goes out into the world.\n\nIt's still too early to tell\n\nIt's scary to see the high-quality videos AI produces. We must be careful with the technology, but I don't want to sacrifice the potential benefits. I want AI to enhance videos from 100 years ago that we already have, not create new ones designed to hurt people. Similarly, I want AI to help me hone my message, not come up with the message for me. When I text or email someone, I want to have confidence I'm communicating with a human on the other side. Our interpersonal skills are already eroding, and I don't have a positive outlook on them improving soon."

These historic properties offer more than just comfortable beds and five-star room service\u2014they promise a chance to brush shoulders with long-departed guests who never quite managed to check out.\n\nMany of these hotels have embraced their paranormal reputations, offering ghost tours and special packages for thrill-seeking guests, especially during the Halloween season. But make no mistake\u2014the otherworldly occurrences at these hotels aren\u2019t limited to October.\n\nSo pack your bags (and maybe a night-vision camera or two), and prepare for a stay you\u2019ll never forget\u2014if you dare. Who knows? You might leave with more than just memories and minibar charges.\n\nThe Stanley Hotel | Estes Park, Colorado\n\nPerched at the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, the Stanley Hotel is the crown jewel of haunted hospitality. This grand Colonial Revival hotel, which opened in 1909, famously inspired Stephen King\u2019s The Shining\u2014though management assures guests that all work and no play is not on the agenda here.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s most active area, the concert hall, often echoes with phantom piano music, presumably from the spectral fingers of Flora Stanley, the original owner\u2019s wife. For those seeking a more personal encounter, the fourth floor is a hotbed of paranormal activity, garnering frequent reports of children\u2019s laughter and mysterious footsteps.\n\nAnd of course there is infamous room 217, where King himself experienced the nightmare that birthed his horror classic. Just remember, if you hear \u201credrum\u201d whispered in the night\u2026go back to sleep instead of investigating.\n\nRebecca Harding - Getty Images\n\nThomas House Hotel | Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee\n\nThe Thomas House Hotel, dating back to 1890, has earned a reputation as one of America\u2019s most haunted destinations. The hotel\u2019s history is as rich as it is dark: Situated on an ancient Native American trail and built atop an underground spring and limestone deposits, the Thomas House seems to have been destined for supernatural activity from its very foundation. Over its 130-plus years of existence, the hotel has witnessed a litany of tragedies, including deaths, murders, and accidents. It has even served as a home for a cult and survived three fires, each event purportedly leaving a spiritual mark on the property.\n\nVisitors and staff alike have reported everything from the classic cold spots and disembodied voices to more unsettling phenomena like moving beds and dark, shadowy figures. These encounters have made the hotel a mecca for ghost hunters and thrill seekers from around the world. For those brave enough, Thomas House Hotel offers regular ghost hunt weekends throughout the year.\n\nCourtesy of Google Maps\n\nThe Marshall House | Savannah, Georgia\n\nThe Marshall House, built in 1851, is the oldest hotel in Savannah. During its long history, the hotel served as a hospital three times: once during the Civil War for Union soldiers and twice during yellow-fever epidemics in the 19th century. During renovations in the late 1990s, workers discovered human remains under floorboards of what was once the hospital\u2019s surgery room, believed to be amputated limbs of Civil War soldiers.\n\nGuests might encounter the ghost of a Union soldier making his rounds, or perhaps catch a glimpse of the portly gentleman reading by the window. The ladies\u2019 restroom is reportedly haunted by a woman with a penchant for locking stall doors, so make it speedy. Other reported paranormal activities include faucets turning on and off by themselves and unexplained noises. One of the most famous spirits is said to be that of Joel Chandler Harris, author of the Uncle Remus stories, whose ghostly typewriter is sometimes heard in his former room.\n\nccahill - Getty Images\n\nThe Driskill Hotel | Austin, Texas\n\nThe Driskill Hotel, opened in 1886, was built by cattle baron Jesse Driskill. It cost $400,000 to make (an enormous sum at the time). But in 1888, Driskill lost his fortune and was forced to sell the hotel to his brother-in-law. The hotel has a rich history, serving as the unofficial \u201cTexas White House\u201d for President Lyndon B. Johnson, who watched election returns and held press conferences there. It\u2019s also where he took his future wife, Lady Bird, on their first date.\n\nThe Driskill is known for its ghostly inhabitants, including the spirit of Jesse Driskill himself, often detected by the smell of cigar smoke. Other famous ghosts include the \u201csuicide brides\u201d of room 525\u2014as the stories go, several brides have committed suicide in the bathroom on the same day, but in different years\u2014and the daughter of a Texas senator who reportedly died on the grand staircase in 1887.\n\nChris Rogers - Getty Images\n\nHotel Alex Johnson | Rapid City, South Dakota\n\nBuilt by railroad magnate Alex Carlston Johnson, Hotel Alex Johnson has been luxurious\u2014and a bit spooky\u2014since 1928, with its stunning views of the Black Hills. One of the hotel\u2019s most popular ghostly residents is the Lady in White, often seen wandering the eighth floor in her nightgown. Legend has it, she\u2019s the ghost of a young bride who leapt to her death from her honeymoon suite\u2014though whether it was suicide or murder remains a subject of speculation. Elsewhere, in room 812, guests report everything from mysterious knocks to ghostly apparitions\u2014some have even claimed to wake up to the sensation of being held down by an unseen force.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom at the Alex Johnson. The playful ghost of Alex Johnson himself is said to roam the halls, ensuring his hotel is run smoothly even from the afterlife. Guests have reported objects moving on their own and elevators operating without passengers\u2014but perhaps Mr. Johnson is just trying to give you a tour.\n\nCourtesy Hotel Alex Johnson\n\nHotel Chelsea | New York City\n\nIf you\u2019re staying at Hotel Chelsea, the city may not be the only thing that never sleeps. This New York City landmark has housed countless artists, musicians, and writers\u2014some of whom apparently decided to extend their stay indefinitely.\n\nOpened in 1884, Hotel Chelsea was originally conceived as a utopian experiment in cooperative living by architect Phillip Hubert. It was New York\u2019s first cooperative apartment complex, designed to house a mix of working-class residents and artists. After financial difficulties in 1905, it was converted into a hotel. Throughout the 20th century, it became a haven for artists, writers, and musicians. Notable residents included Mark Twain, Arthur Miller, Bob Dylan, and Andy Warhol.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s most infamous incident occurred in 1978 when Nancy Spungen, girlfriend of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious, was found stabbed to death in room 100. The ghost of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who died at the hotel after a night of heavy drinking, is also said to still haunt the halls. After a lengthy renovation, Chelsea's haunted legacy still remains intact. Future guests can look forward to rubbing elbows with both living celebrities and ghostly ones in this one-of-a-kind New York institution.\n\nUCG - Getty Images\n\nMiss Molly\u2019s Hotel | Fort Worth, Texas\n\nMiss Molly\u2019s Hotel in Fort Worth\u2019s Stockyards District has been offering rooms with a view of the past since 1910. Originally opened as a boarding house, it quickly transformed into one of the area\u2019s most popular bordellos, opening under the name Gayatte Hotel. During Prohibition, the establishment took on yet another identity as a speakeasy, serving up illicit libations to thirsty patrons. It wasn\u2019t until the 1940s that the building shed its risqu\u00e9 reputation and became a legitimate boarding house, finally evolving in the 1980s into the bed-and-breakfast we know today.\n\nGuests might encounter the spirits of former working girls, hear phantom footsteps, or feel unexplained cold spots.

The Renaissance-style building was once the largest hotel in Maryland and has played host to numerous dignitaries, celebrities, and apparently, a few guests who never checked out.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s most famous ghostly resident is a young girl in a cream-colored dress and black shoes, often seen playing with a red ball. Guests and staff have reported sightings of the child on the 19th floor and in the lobby. Also keep an eye out for the ghostly couple often spotted dancing in the Calvert Ballroom\u2014they\u2019re always dressed to the nines, even in the afterlife.\n\nSpencer Platt - Getty Images\n\nHotel Congress | Tucson, Arizona\n\nSince 1919, Hotel Congress has been a Tucson landmark, famous for its role in the capture of John Dillinger and infamous for its ghostly residents. The hotel\u2019s brush with infamy came in 1934 when a fire broke out on the third floor. Among the evacuated guests were Dillinger and his gang, who were subsequently recognized by firefighters and captured by the police. Today, the hotel celebrates this claim to fame with an annual Dillinger Days festival.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just outlaws who\u2019ve left their mark on Hotel Congress. Guests might spot the apparition of a woman in a long white dress roaming the halls or hear unexplained voices and footsteps in empty rooms. The ghost of a former handyman is said to tinker with the plumbing and electricity (maybe still trying to fix that faulty wiring that caused the 1934 fire). For those brave enough, room 242\u2014the alleged site of a suicide\u2014is said to be particularly active.\n\ncourtesy Hotel Congress\n\nThe Emily Morgan Hotel | San Antonio\n\nThe Emily Morgan Hotel, originally constructed in 1924 as a medical facility, is a 13-story building that has worn many hats\u2014from doctors\u2019 offices to the city\u2019s first high-rise apartments. Named after the Yellow Rose of Texas, Emily Morgan, who allegedly helped win Texas\u2019s independence by distracting Mexican General Santa Anna, the hotel embraces its folkloric roots. But it\u2019s the building\u2019s medical history that fuels its haunted reputation.

Apparitions of nurses pushing gurneys, phantom patients wandering the halls, and unexplained noises are par for the course here, along with flickering lights and televisions with a mind of their own.\n\nAllan Baxter - Getty Images\n\nDauphine Orleans Hotel | New Orleans\n\nWhile the Dauphine Orleans Hotel as we know it opened its doors in 1969, the property\u2019s history stretches back to the early 19th century. The hotel\u2019s main building, constructed in the 1820s, was originally a prosperous bordello known as May Baily\u2019s Place. This notorious establishment operated during the heyday of New Orleans\u2019 red-light district, Storyville. Today, the hotel\u2019s bar, still called May Baily\u2019s Place, proudly displays an authentic brothel license.\n\nGuests and staff have reported encounters with the ghost of a Creole soldier, believed to be a Civil War general, who wanders the courtyard in full uniform. In May Baily's Place, patrons sometimes catch glimpses of a courtesan dressed in 19th-century attire, perhaps a lingering spirit from the building\u2019s bordello days.\n\nOne of the most frequently sighted apparitions is that of a young woman in a wedding dress, often seen dancing alone in the hotel\u2019s courtyard. Legend has it that she was a bride-to-be who was tragically killed on her wedding day and now haunts the grounds, forever waiting for her groom.

Danielle, who grew up in the 1920s timber cottage, claims she is experiencing eerie paranormal activity - leaving her kids ''petrified'\n\n\"I want to enjoy living here, but I just feel I can't because of the activity in the house,\" Danielle explains. The property, which has been in her family for over 35 years, holds significant sentimental value for her, and mother Elaine. However, the joy of returning to her roots has been overshadowed by ghostly encounters.\n\nDanielle recalls feeling watched as a child, and her sister once reported seeing a spirit resembling a nurse. She said: \"When I lived here as a child, I did feel like I was always being watched. My sister had seen a spirit in what was her bedroom, she thought that the lady was a nurse. She said she looked at her and then she disappeared. I never actually experienced seeing a ghost until I moved back recently,\u201d\n\nNow, her own children are having frightening experiences. \"I know my son has seen her, as he described her to me. He said he'd seen a lady in the toy room. I said to him, 'is she a happy ghost?' He said 'oh no mummy, she's angry',\" Danielle recounts.\n\nIn a particularly distressing incident, Danielle's four-year-old son ran to her bedroom in hysterics, claiming to have heard a deep gasping voice in his ear. She said: \"He was hysterical and he said to me that there was a voice in his ear that had taken a deep \u2018gasp\u2019. My children are petrified. As a mother, I just want to protect my children,\".\n\nDespite her attempts to rationalize these occurrences, Danielle is finding it difficult to ignore the paranormal activity. \"I try to brush it off and say to him 'it's your imagination', 'it's a dream', but I know that that's not the truth,\" she admits.\n\nThe situation has become so concerning that Danielle is contemplating moving house. \"This house is my absolute life, but if it did get even worse or carry on, then we would have to consider moving,\" she said.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to resolve the haunting and keep her family in their beloved home, Danielle has turned to a team of paranormal investigators for help.\n\nIn the eighth episode of the new sixth series of Help! My House is Haunted, airiedon Really on Friday 27 th September at 10pm (also available to stream on discovery+), in a desperate effort to protect her family and remain living in the house she loves, Danielle turns to the show\u2019s team of paranormal investigators Barri, Ian and Jayne for help.\n\nLocal historian Penny Griffith Morgan tells Jayne that during the Second World War, a bomb took out a local hospital in Chaldon, where a young nurse called Pauline died, trapped in the rubble. She claims this could be the nurse that Danielle has seen as a spirit.\n\nWatch Episode 8 of the new sixth series of Help!

        "article_content": "Although penicillin was discovered on September 28, 1928 by Andrew Fleming, a British physician and professor of bacteriology at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, it took fourteen years for the first civilian patient to receive treatment. Such a long delay to deliver what Popular Science called one of 1943\u2019s top ten \u201ctriumphs in medicine\u201d of all time seems unconscionable. In the decades since, it has been estimated that penicillin has saved more than 500 million lives. But word of Fleming\u2019s discovery was slow to spread, the therapeutic implications weren\u2019t entirely clear, and penicillin turned out to be quite difficult to manufacture.\n\nFleming, who admittedly discovered penicillin by chance, is reported to have said, \u201cWhen I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn\u2019t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world\u2019s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I guess that was exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nHe had been conducting experiments with common staphylococcal bacteria, or staph, but left an uncovered petri dish by an open window during a vacation in Scotland. When he returned, the dish looked different. It had the usual clusters of bacterial colonies, except for one spot covered in mold. \u201cIn the broth,\u201d Fleming later wrote, \u201cthe mould grows on the surface as a white fluffy growth changing in a few days to a dark green felted mass.\u201d Around the \u201cfelted mass\u201d the broth was clear\u2014nearby bacterial colonies seemed to have been killed by mold secretions.\n\nFleming continued to experiment with what he called \u201cmold juice,\u201d eventually isolating the Penicillium fungus as the bacteria slayer. He published his findings in 1929 in the British Journal of Pathology with only passing reference to the ramifications penicillin might have to treat patients suffering from serious infections such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, gonorrhea, or meningitis. Fleming seemed more focused on its implications for helping scientists who study bacteria. \u201cIn addition to its possible use in the treatment of bacterial infections,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpenicillin is certainly useful to the bacteriologist for its power of inhibiting unwanted microbes in bacterial cultures so that penicillin insensitive bacteria can be readily isolated.\u201d\n\nA decade after Fleming published his work, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and others at Oxford University sought ways to manufacture penicillin at scale, which meant cultivating massive quantities of Penicillium. But they struggled to grow enough mold. Their production was so scant, in fact, that they ran out of penicillin while treating their first patient, Albert Alexander, in 1941. Without the medication, Alexander, who had been improving, ultimately died. It wasn\u2019t until Florey recruited help from the US Department of Agriculture and US-based pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Lilly, and Merck that mass production began in earnest.\n\nWhen, in 1943, Popular Science named penicillin as one of the top ten medicines in history, the contributing writer and physician, Iago Galdston, cited its superior infection-fighting performance when compared with the leading antibacterial treatment, sulfa drugs: \u201cPenicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids.\u201d Until then, no drugs existed that could fight \u201clong-established infections,\u201d which, as Galdston wrote, made penicillin particularly valuable. But even in 1943, penicillin was hard to come by. Galdston lamented, \u201cUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use.\u201d At the time, a single dose of penicillin cost $20 ($364 in 2024). By the time World War II ended in 1945, a dose of penicillin cost $.55 ($10 today) and was readily available in the US.\n\nLooking back, Popular Science\u2019s 1943 Top Ten List seems particularly prescient. In addition to penicillin, the new and emerging treatments that Galdston cited included vitamins and the importance of nutrition, hormone therapy to treat cancer and other disorders, and psychosomatic treatment, or the growing awareness that psychiatric disorders could manifest in physical symptoms and vice versa. Despite such medical blockbusters, it may be Galdston\u2019s final item that has had the most profound effect on medicine: \u201cBiological Thinking.\u201d Galdston defined biological thinking as an acknowledgment that \u201cthe basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment.\u201d Today, we take for granted that excess stress from factors such as jobs, relationships, and finances, can make us sick, but in 1943 the idea was novel.\n\nPenicillin remains one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics. And producing penicillin still requires growing mold, but pharmaceutical companies have perfected the manufacturing process, growing Penicillium in deep fermentation tanks not unlike those used in breweries. But these tanks produce something even more valuable than beer\u2014Fleming\u2019s \u201cmold juice.\u201d\n\nPopular Science, December 1943:\n\nTen New Triumphs in Medicine\n\nMAGIC DRUGS, INGENIOUS INSTRUMENTS, WIDER KNOWLEDGE MARK THE RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF THE LAST THREE DECADES\n\nBy IAGO GALDSTON, M. D. Author of \u201cProgress in Medicine\u201d and \u201cBehind the Sulfa Drugs\u201d\n\nWithin the short span of the past 30 discoveries have developed in the field of medicine than in any comparable period during the entire history of the science. In times past, important discoveries often were followed by long periods of little or no progressive medical thinking. Today, discoveries of the utmost importance are following quickly on each other\u2019s heels.\n\nAmong these inventions and discoveries is an instrument with a moving pen, which can \u201ctake dictation\u201d from a patient\u2019s brain. The record of electrical brain waves that this amazing secretary takes down is read by the surgeon for indications of brain disorders. Another is a drug so powerful that one part in 25 million parts of water will stop the growth of bacteria. Still another has revolutionized the science of diagnosis, and has completely recast the modern physician\u2019s approach to the problem of healing.\n\nIn this writer\u2019s judgment, 10 of the greatest medical discoveries and inventions of recent years are: The sulfonamides; penicillin; the vitamins; the sex hormones; the relation of the sex hormones to cancer; the electro-encephalograph; the electron microscope; psychosomatic medicine; brief therapy; and biological thinking.\n\nThe Sulfonamides\n\nThe sulfonamides are without doubt the best known of the recent medical discoveries. And justly so, for no single group of com- pounds has proved as effective as this one in preventing and treating such a large number of diseases. Pneumonia, gonorrhea, erysipelas, childbed fever, many forms of bloodstream infection, trachoma, septic sore throat, urinary infections, meningococcus meningitis, chancroid, gas gangrene, actinomycosis, anthrax, scarlet fever, impetigo -these are but some of the conditions effectively treated with one or another of the sulfonamide compounds.\n\nEqually remarkable and numerous are the applications of the sulfonamides in the prevention of infection. Since their first use in this respect, the lives of countless men wounded in battle have been saved. The sulfonamides have also extended the scope of surgery, heretofore limited by the threat of infection supervening upon operations in contaminated regions. They are reducing the incidence of serious complications which in times past frequently followed on simple infections. There is, however, one particular aspect of the discovery of the sulfonamides which overshadows even its great practical results. The sulfonamides have given new life to the science of chemotherapy-the treatment of internal disease with chemicals. Chemotherapy got off to a great start when Paul Ehrlich discovered Salvarsan in 910 although for the next 25 years little new appeared on the chemotherapeutic scene. Then in 1935 came Prontosil, and later the sulfonamides, and the whole picture changed. But what changed most was the concept of chemotherapy itself. Paul Ehrlich and practically all of his followers thought of chemotherapy in terms of \u201cmagic bullets,\u201d that is, in terms of protoplasmic poisons which would kill germs, but not the human body. Unfortunately few such selective poisons were found. Most of the protoplasmic poisons proved as likely to injure the victim as the at- tacking germs. Then when Prontosil and the sulfonamides were found to be so amazingly effective against bacteria, the old theories of chemotherapy had to be recast, for the sulfonamides do not belong to the class of protoplasmic poisons. In fact, the sulfonamides are not even bactericidal, that is, they do not directly kill germs. They are, however, bacteriostatic: they arrest the development of germs by interfering with their metabolism. By thus weakening the germs, they make it possible for them to be overcome by the body\u2019s own defenses.\n\nToday, research follows the path of germ metabolism, and seeks to discover how that metabolism may be adversely affected by means of chemical agents. It is this new rational basis for chemotherapy that warrants our hope of finding chemicals with which to cure tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, and other germ and virus diseases not affected by the sulfonamides.\n\nPenicillin\n\nHot on the heels of the sulfonamides came the discovery of penicillin, a chemotherapeutic agent in many respects superior to the sul- fonamides. This powerful new drug is derived from a fungus called Penicillium notatum. In 1929, this fungus, or mold, was an unwelcome in- truder into some staphylococcus cultures with which the English bacteriologist Prof. A. Fleming had been experimenting for quite some time. Fleming acutely observed then that wherever the fungus grew, the germs did not, and he reasoned that the fungus and the germs did not get along well together. He studied the matter further and found his reasoning correct.\n\nHowever, since the fungus was not antagonistic to all germs, but only to certain ones, he employed it to eliminate from groups of mixed germs those to which penicillin was antagonistic. But that was as far as the matter went at the time.\n\nWith the discovery of the sulfonamides it was natural for the scientists to turn their attention once again to the penicillium mold. Another English scientist, Prof. H. W. Florey, in 1940 extracted from the penicillium mold a brown powder-like substance. He found it to be an extraordinarily powerful drug, effective against a larger variety of infections than are the sulfonamides.\n\nThough but recently discovered, penicillin has already been subjected to numerous trials. Unlike the sulfonamides, which operate by diminishing the growth of bacteria, it has been found to kill bacteria or stop their growth entirely. But it will work in many cases where the sulfa drugs have proved useless or only partially effective. Penicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids. This renders it particularly valuable in the treatment of such conditions as osteomyelitis, empyema, infected compound fractures, and wounds and burns with long-established infections. Penicillin is superior in undermining the yellow pus-producing bacteria, the staphylococcus aureus, and many infections caused by cocci. And the user of penicillin suffers no toxic effects such as are sometimes experienced when sulfa drugs have been employed.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use. There is, however, no reason to doubt that the chemists will before long succeed in crystallizing it and reproducing it artificially.\n\nThe Vitamins\n\nThe vitamins represent a major medical discovery of an order different from any of those thus far described. Biology and medicine have been radically affected by their discovery. Until vitamins were discovered, the conviction prevailed among medical men that there wasn\u2019t much one could do about health except to prevent disease. Doctors preached personal hygiene in terms of rest, cleanliness, exercise, fresh air, and good food. But they did so in the belief that they could only preserve health, which for any given individual was more or less fixed. For the rest, attention was focused on \u201cfighting infection\u201d by such means as vaccines, serums, antiseptics, and so forth.\n\nWith the development of the modern science of nutrition, of which the vitamins are an important segment, we learned that one could be not sick, but at the same time not healthy, as in the case of \u201csubclinical conditions,\u201d in which the patient is not manifestly ill, but also is far from well. We also discovered that susceptibility to many types of disease, including infections, was due to malnutrition, and that growth, de- velopment, and aging were profoundly influenced by the quantity and quality of the foods eaten.\n\nAs our knowledge of nutrition increases, and as that knowledge is applied to the everyday diet of people, we are bound to see a reduction in the incidence of disease, and an improvement in physical growth and wellbeing.\n\nThe Sex Hormones\n\nThe discovery of the sex hormones is one of the achievements of modern medicine on which the public is comparatively unin- formed. Yet it is truly a tremendous accomplishment.\n\nIt was a bright hunch that led to the discovery of the female sex hormone. When an ovum (egg) ripens in the ovary, it is surrounded by a minute quantity of a yellowish fluid, known as the liquor folliculi. No one thought to investigate the function of that fluid until 1922, when Edgar Allen, Ph.D., of St. Louis, and his wife obtained buckets of ovaries from a meat-packing plant and, working on their kitchen table, carefully drew off the fluid from the follicles. Soon they had enough of it to enable their coworker, Dr. E. A. Doisy, to purify it and determine its chemical constitution. This made possible the crystallization of the female hormone in 1929. In 1936 it was reproduced artificially. The discovery of the male hormone, which is credited to L. C. McGee, of Chicago, took place in 1927.\n\nThe sex hormones have proved enormously useful in the treatment of a variety of disturbances, including those of the sexual and reproductive functions. From this discovery was derived the original Aschheim-Zondek test for pregnancy.\n\nThe most important result of the discovery of sex hormones, however, is the light it has thrown upon the complicated structures and operations of the glands of internal secretion. These glands affect growth, development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction; in fact, all phases of the \u201cinner activities\u201d of the human body.\n\nThe Relation of the Sex Hormones to Cancer\n\nCancer of the prostate is one of the most common types of malignancy affecting men. This type of cancer is difficult to discover in its early stages, and tends to spread so work of uniformly close tolerances is performed rapidly that, in actual experience, less than five percent of such cases can be successfully treated surgically.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. C. Huggins, of the University of Chicago, advanced the idea that the prostate cancer cells require the male hormone for their continued existence, even as the normal prostate cells do. He and his associates reasoned from this that castration or else the \u201cneutralization\u201d of the male hormone by means of the female hormone should adversely affect the prostate cancer growths. He, and others after him, tried the latter treatment. The results were astonishing. Although the cancer is not cured, most of the patients benefit enormously. Pain disappears, nutrition improves, appetite returns, and strength is regained. The original cancer growth in the prostate, and those that have spread to other parts of the body, regress so that many sufferers are enabled to carry on their normal activities in comfort. This treatment of prostatic cancer is vastly superior to any previously available. But the greatest value of the discovery is that it has stimulated many scientists to study the relation of the sex hormones to cancer in general.\n\nThe Electro-Encephalograph\n\nThis recent invention is a sleuthing machine for tracking down the mysterious ways of the brain. Working by means of vacuum tubes similar to those used in a radio, it picks up \u201cbrain waves\u201d-electrical impulses generated in the head by brain function. These currents, which have distinguishing characteristics, are visibly recorded by a moving pen. Since a brain suffering from some organic ailment sends out waves differing from those generated by a normal one, the record set down by the electro-encephalograph can be read by the brain surgeon for indications of such dis- orders as brain tumors and epilepsy. This useful diagnostic instrument promises to be of great value in the study of the physiology of the nervous system, and of the dynamics of drugs employed for their effects on the nervous system.\n\nThe Electron Microscope\n\nThe electron microscope likewise promises to prove a great research instrument. The ordinary microscope cannot magnify an object beyond approximately 2,000 diameters, this limitation being imposed by the wavelength of light. The electron microscope, however, can magnify objects from 50,000 to a 100,000 diameters. It can, therefore, be readily seen how this extremely powerful instrument has opened up new and vast fields of research in bacteriology and biochemistry. We are now able to obtain a really intimate insight into the structure of both living and nonliving matter, and, most interestingly, of that \u201cin-between\u201d matter known as the viruses, which are responsible for such destructive diseases as smallpox, influenza, and infantile paralysis.\n\nPsychosomatic Medicine\n\nOne of the more interesting developments of psychiatry goes by the name of psychosomatic medicine. It represents the fusion of orthodox clinical medicine with the best in psychiatric knowledge. It teaches the important lesson, in an irrefutable way, that there is no disorder of the soma (the body) without some involvement of the psyche (the mind and the emotions), and conversely, that psychiatric disorders have their somatic (physical) components. In some instances, indeed, physical symptoms are the only tangible manifestations of what is primarily a psychiatric condition. This insight into the interplay of psyche and soma has made possible a much more effective treatment of many conditions which in times past could be treated only superficially. It also enables the physician to anticipate, and by appropriate action to prevent, the development of a variety of physical and emotional strains and disorders.\n\nBrief Therapy\n\nRelated to psychiatry is the new experimental development of brief therapy. The objective of these experiments is, simply, brevity of treatment. Most of the techniques of psychiatric therapy as practiced today are lengthy and therefore costly. Far too many persons who require treatment cannot afford it. And there are not enough trained psychiatrists available to meet the needs. To correct these deficiencies, studies, conferences, and experiments are being conducted to develop techniques of psychotherapy that will be effective but less time-consuming.\n\nBiological Thinking\n\nFinally we come to that development in present-day medicine which blankets all others: the ability to think biologically. Today the physician thinks of his patient in terms of his many environmental relationships\u2013his job, his marriage, his friends, his education, his degree of success, and so forth. A short while ago, however, the physician thought of his patient only in terms of his complaints, of the symptoms or disorders he discovered and of the specific remedies he could use in the treatment of \u201cthe case.\u201d In fact, the physician was more concerned with the \u201ccase\u201d-with the disease afflicting the patient-than with the patient himself.\n\nToday, we know that to effect a permanent cure, the contributory as well as the primary factors must be considered and dealt with; that, in substance, the basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment."

        "article_content": "A grassroots organization is calling on the provincial government to reopen the Ontario Science Centre after it was abruptly closed in June following the discovery of structural issues in the building.\n\nSave Ontario\u2019s Science Centre held a rally in a Scarborough park on Sunday, just days after the 55th anniversary of the museum\u2019s opening. Organizer Floyd Ruskin spoke to those in attendance and said Premier Doug Ford has received as many as 90,000 letters from Ontarians who want the centre reopened.\n\n\u201cOut of those 90,000 letters that the premier has received, 42 per cent come from outside the city of Toronto. That makes it a province-wide initiative,\u201d he said, adding that the letters represented all 124 of the province\u2019s electoral districts.\n\nThe tourist attraction in North York was officially closed on June 21 after an engineering report found that there were \u201cserious structural issues,\u201d including the risk of a potential roof panel failure.\n\nAlthough the report suggested other alternatives beyond closure, including blocking off the part of the building where roof panels could give way, Ford has suggested that repairing the aging structure would be \u201cfoolish\u201d and cost more than $500 million.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the Science Centre has been a source of social, educational, and economic prosperity, not just to the community around it, not just to Toronto, not just Ontario, but to all of Canada and around the world,\u201d Adil Shamji, the MPP for Don Valley East, said at the Sunday rally. \u201cAnd in one fell swoop, this premier comes in, and he says, we're going to shut it down with no notice, because supposedly, the roof's about to collapse. Well, look, we met architects, we had engineers, we had the people that built this science centre come out and say that it is A-OK.\u201d\n\nPrior to the June closure, the province already had plans to move the tourist attraction to the redeveloped Ontario Place. However, that space won\u2019t open until 2028 at the earliest and will have a much smaller footprint.\n\nThe province has said that it is looking for an interim space for a science centre until the new one is built, but that won\u2019t be open until 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, the province said the fate of the current building will be subject to discussions with the City of Toronto, which owns the land where the former science museum was located.\n\nAll remaining staff at the Ontario Science Centre must vacate the building by Oct. 31.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press"

        "article_content": "Twenty years ago this October, two physicists at the University of Manchester, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, published a groundbreaking paper on the \u201celectric field effect in atomically thin carbon films\u201d. Their work described the extraordinary electronic properties of graphene, a crystalline form of carbon equivalent to a single layer of graphite, just one atom thick.\n\nAround that time, I started my doctorate at the University of Surrey. Our team specializes in the electronic properties of carbon. Carbon nanotubes were the latest craze, which I was happily following. One day, my professor encouraged a group of us to travel to London to attend a talk by a well-known science communicator from the University of Manchester. This was Andre Geim.\n\nWe were not disappointed. He was inspiring for us fresh-faced PhD students, incorporating talk of wacky Friday afternoon experiments with levitating frogs before getting on to atomically thin carbon. All the same, we were skeptical about this carbon concept. We couldn\u2019t quite believe that a material effectively obtained from pencil lead with sticky tape was really what it claimed to be. But we were wrong.\n\nThe work was quickly copied and reproduced by scientists across the globe. New methods for making this material were devised. Incredible claims about its properties made it sound like something out of a Stan Lee comic. Stronger than steel, highly flexible, super-slippery and impermeable to gases. It is a better electronic conductor than copper and a better thermal conductor than diamond. It is also practically invisible and displays a host of exotic quantum properties.\n\nGraphene was hailed as a revolutionary material, promising ultra-fast electronics, supercomputers and super-strong materials. More fantastical claims have included space elevators, solar sails, artificial retinas, and even invisibility cloaks.\n\nJust six years after their initial work, Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, further fueling the enthusiasm around this wonder stuff. Since then, hundreds of thousands of academic papers have been published on graphene and related materials.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. Skim through the comments section of any popular article on the material, and you\u2019ll quickly find the sceptics. We have endured decades of empty promises about the real-world impact of graphene, they complain. Where are the game-changing products to enrich our lives or save the world from climate change, they ask?\n\nSo, has graphene been a resounding success or a damp squib? As is so often the case, the reality is somewhere in between.\n\nGraphene\u2019s ups and downs\n\nIn terms of public perception, it\u2019s fair to say that graphene has been held to an impossible standard. The popular media can certainly exaggerate science stories for clicks, but academics \u2013 including myself \u2013 are not immune from over-egging or speculating about their pet projects either. I\u2019d argue this can even be useful, helping to drive new technologies forward. Equally, though, there can be a backlash when progress looks disappointing.\n\nHaving said that, disruptive technologies such as cars, television or plastic all required decades of development. Graphene is still a newcomer in the grand scheme of things, so it\u2019s far too early to reach any conclusions about its impact.\n\nWhat has quietly occurred is a steady integration of graphene into numerous practical applications. Much of this is thanks to the Graphene Flagship, a major European research initiative coordinated by Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. This aims to bring graphene and related materials from academic research to real-world commercial applications, and more than 90 products have been developed over the past decade as a result.\n\nThese include blended plastics for high-performance sports equipment, more durable racing tyres for bicycles, motorcycle helmets that better distribute impact forces, thermally conductive coatings for motorcycle components, and lubricants for reducing friction and wear between mechanical parts.\n\nGraphene is finding its way into batteries and supercapacitors, enabling faster charging times and longer life spans. Conductive graphene inks are now used to manufacture sensors, wireless tracking tags, heating elements, and electromagnetic shielding for protecting sensitive electronics. Graphene is even used in headphones to improve the sound quality and as a more efficient means of transmitting heat in air-conditioning units.\n\nGraphene oxide products are used for desalination, wastewater treatment , and purification of drinking water. Meanwhile, a range of graphene materials can be bought off the shelf for use in countless other products, and major corporations, including SpaceX, Tesla, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony and Apple, are all rumored or known to be using them to develop new products.\n\nFrom promise to practicality\n\nThe impact of graphene on materials science is undeniable. The impact on consumer products is tangible but not as visible. Once a material is embedded in a working product, there is little need to keep mentioning it, and proprietary concerns can make companies reluctant to get into details in any case. Consumers can, therefore, be blissfully unaware that their car, mobile phone, or golf club contains graphene and most probably don\u2019t care as long as it works.\n\nAs production methods improve and costs decrease, we can expect graphene to become ever more widely adopted. Economies of scale will make it more accessible, and the range of applications is likely to continue to expand.\n\nPersonally, after two decades, I still get excited when I try it out for something new in the lab. While I may be guilty of having contributed to the initial hype, I remain optimistic about graphene\u2019s potential. I\u2019m still waiting for my ride on a space elevator, but in the meantime, I\u2019ll take comfort in the fact that graphene is already helping to shape a better future \u2013 quietly and steadily.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation by Stephen Lyth at the University of Strathclyde.

        "article_content": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 Travis Hunter wore custom-made football cleats in Saturday night\u2019s game against Central Florida \u2013 a pair of gold-colored shoes with a graphic on them depicting the mountains and trees of Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThey had quite a night. First he scored a 23-yard touchdown in them in the first quarter. Then he made an interception and flashed the Heisman Trophy pose in them in the third quarter. After his Colorado team won the game, 48-21, Colorado\u2019s two-way superstar even took those cleats off his feet and gave them to somebody in the stands here at FBC Mortgage Stadium.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who he is, man,\u201d Colorado football coach Deion Sanders said of Hunter\u2019s big night.\n\nBy the time it was over, Hunter had caught nine passes for 89 yards and a touchdown, snagged one interception, broke up one other opposing pass attempt and recorded two tackles before walking back to the locker room in his socks.\n\nMr. Everywhere had done it again.\n\nBut this time was different.\n\nWhy was this win different for Travis Hunter and Deion Sanders?\n\nHunter\u2019s team also rose to the occasion around him to play what might be its best all-around game in Sanders\u2019 two seasons as head coach.\n\nIt also came on a homecoming of sorts for both Sanders and Hunter, both Florida natives coming home to lead the Buffaloes (4-1) to their third straight win.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how emotional I am about these young men and seeing what they could do when they put it all together and seeing what we\u2019re capable of when we put it all together,\u201d Sanders said afterward.\n\nThe win effectively puts the Big 12 Conference on notice. The Buffs are hot, on the move and might even come close to cracking the national Top 25. The Buffs led 27-14 at halftime and held the nation\u2019s No. 1 rushing offense to 177 rushing yards, nearly 200 under UCF\u2019s season average before Saturday.\n\nHere\u2019s how they did it Saturday and what it means:\n\nWhat did Deion Sanders say about win?\n\nHe was in a playful mood after a warm, humid game that started about 50 minutes late because of lightning in the area. He poked fun of Hunter, who is known to wear onesie pajamas and doesn\u2019t always like talking to the news media after games.\n\n\u201cKnowing Travis, he ain\u2019t coming,\u201d Sanders said at the postgame news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s probably on the bus with a onesie on.\u201d\n\nSanders also poked fun of his quarterback son Shedeur, who threw an interception on the game\u2019s opening drive before leading the Buffs on scoring drives in six of their next seven possessions in front of an announced sellout crowd of 45,702 at FBC Mortgage Stadium. Shedeur Sanders completed 28 of 35 passes for 290 yards and three touchdowns. He added three carries for 28 yards and was only sacked twice despite the loss of a starting guard to injury this week.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon Grown, they want to ask you about the interception,\u201d Deion Sanders said to his son as the quarterback entered the post-game news conference.\n\nThat\u2019s what Sanders calls Shedeur: \u201cGrown\u201d \u2013 as in mature beyond his years.\n\nShedeur Sanders showed it by settling down after the initial turnover and letting his running game take some pressure off of him for a change. The Buffs compiled 128 rushing yards on 29 carries, led by 39 from running back Isaiah Augustave, a native of Naples, Florida.\n\n\u201cWe got outcoached,\u201d UCF head coach Gus Malzahn said. \u201cWe got outplayed.\u201d\n\nUCF gave up two interceptions and two fumbles to Colorado, including one that was returned 95 yards by safety Cam\u2019Ron Silmon-Craig for the final touchdown of the game in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat did Shedeur Sanders say afterward?\n\nHe was asked how he stays focused amid the hype and all the football legends that come to see him and his father at games. On Saturday, Cam Newton, the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner, greeted him before the game. Hall of Fame receivers Michael Irvin and Terrell Owens watched him from the Colorado sideline, too.\n\nSo how does he do it? Shedeur Sanders answered by saying he collects personal slights, either real or imagined. He said he remembers being described as \u201cjust an HBCU kid who couldn\u2019t do it at the Power 5 level,\u201d referring to Jackson State, a historically Black college where he played in 2022 before transferring to Colorado last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t forget anything,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t forget what anybody ever said, and personally I\u2019m not one to make friends or feel like just because success is going on, now I\u2019m going to forgive everybody. Nah, whatever you said at any point in time, I\u2019m not really a forgiving type.\u201d\n\nThat kind of mindset drove him to dominate a team Saturday that was favored by two touchdowns. He spread the ball around to eight different receivers and knocked the Knights (3-1) out of their comfort zone by forcing them to pass the ball more to keep up.\n\n\u201cTo keep up with our type of scoring, that gets them out of their comfort zone and provokes them to throw the ball a little more than they\u2019d like to,\u201d Deion Sanders said.\n\nHis team now gets some rest heading into a bye weekend in Boulder. The Buffs resume play at home on Oct. 12 against Kansas State.\n\nDeion Sanders talks about his record\n\nSanders pulled a trick on the news media afterward to make a point. With four wins, his team now has matched its win total from last year, when the Buffs finished 4-8 in his first season in Boulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so darn proud of where we are,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe could be in a whole different place right now, but look it\u2026 We\u2019re going into the break. What\u2019s the record?\u201d\n\n\u201cFour-and-one,\u201d the news media responded.\n\n\u201cSay it again,\u201d Sanders said, acting like he couldn\u2019t hear.\n\n\u201cFour-and-one,\u201d the room said again.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to hear y\u2019all say it collectively, and y\u2019all fell for it,\u201d Sanders said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 4-1 going into the break, and I\u2019m so excited, you have no idea,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a really good plane ride tonight.\u201d\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

        "article_content": "Apple has reportedly been working on a new kind of display-focused smart home device for a while now, and it seems it will arrive as early as next year. Now, Bloomberg reports that Apple is eyeing not one but two such devices across different price points and that they will mark the era of a new AI-first software approach.\n\nCodenamed J595, this one is a high-end machine that features a large iPad-inspired screen and robotic limbs. The other one, which internally goes by the J490 identifier, is more like a conventional smart display \u2014 think a screen slapped on a speaker base \u2013 that would predominantly serve as a FaceTime machine and smart home control hub.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUnlike the approach that Apple took with the Vision Pro, which was all about flexing the engineering muscles and imagining an entirely new approach to computing, the company\u2019s foray into the field of smart display will likely start at the lower end of the price spectrum, or specifically, the device codenamed J490.\n\nNow, the device won\u2019t exactly be unique. Amazon has been offering similar devices under the Echo Show label for a while now, and Google\u2019s own approach with the Nest Hub hasn\u2019t been too dissimilar. Where Apple stands a chance to stand out is the software ecosystem built around these devices. That secret sauce is AI, or in the brand\u2019s lexicon, Apple Intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe Apple Intelligence tools will be at the heart of both products, helping the company bring AI into the home,\u201d says the Bloomberg report. With the integration of AI at the center of the experience, Apple will reportedly rebadge the software as well. It seems that just the way we got iPadOS forked from the iOS experience, the software bundle on the upcoming smart home devices will be branded as homeOS.\n\nIt seems the hardware has been designed with user convenience in mind, allowing users to run essential apps like Calendar, Notes, and Home that not only offer a glance at important routine information but also a look at the status of connected devices. Moreover, homeOS will reportedly be optimized for intuitive control of your home appliances so that users can engage in adjustments and monitoring wherever necessary.\n\nThe upcoming smart home devices are said to be borne out of a collaboration between Apple\u2019s AI and hardware engineering units. Bloomberg\u2019s report mentions that when the devices were in the prototype engineering stage, there were design concepts that envisioned these devices attaching to walls using a magnetic mount system.\n\nThe report mentions an asking price of roughly $1,000 for one of the smart devices, which is quite steep. But it seems the silicon requirements to boot Apple Intelligence in all its glory could be one of the core reasons for that, along with a functional screen assembly and speaker gear.\n\nIt would be interesting, regardless, how exactly Apple is going to market these devices to smart home enthusiasts and, more importantly, convince them to part ways with a healthy few hundred dollars instead of relying on third-party solutions that embrace the Matter protocol. Maybe we are going to hear the \u201cseamless ecosystem integration\u201d argument from Apple once again."
