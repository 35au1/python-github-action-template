Spanish Files offers a unique look into this fascinating chapter of Spanish history.\n\nFor more local news and events in the Almeria province click here."

        "article_content": "Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer won\u2019t say whether his party will scale back or fully scrap Canada's federal dental care program, despite new data showing nearly 650,000 Canadians have used the plan.\n\nA national dental care program was one of the keystones of the now-ended supply-and-confidence agreement between the Liberals and NDP, inked in 2022. It involves plans to roll out coverage especially for children, seniors, and low-income Canadians, and with remaining eligible Canadians slated to gain access in 2025.\n\nFederal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced last week he\u2019d formally ended the pact with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal party, 10 months before it was set to expire. Absent that agreement, the possibility of a general election before the set date in October 2025 is more likely.\n\nWhen asked by CTV\u2019s Question Period host Vassy Kapelos whether the Conservatives would roll back dental care if they form government, Scheer wouldn\u2019t say.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the NDP never want to talk about government greed and government waste, and when we talk about fixing the budget so that inflation and interest rates can come down, that's what we're focusing on,\u201d he said in an interview airing Sunday.\n\nScheer also pointed to and characterized specific government spending, including the infrastructure bank and consulting fees, as inflationary, accusing the Liberals of \u201cwaste and corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut again, it's all about how inflation takes a big bite out of workers\u2019 paychques, and that these programs aren't as advertised, that we're hearing from people all across the country saying that they're not qualifying for these programs, that the dentists aren't adopting in,\u201d Scheer said.\n\nThe dental care program faced early criticism from dentists for what they said was an administrative burden, along with confusion over its reimbursement model. Despite that, the federal government announced this month that more than 2.4 million Canadians have been approved for coverage, and that more than 82 per cent of dental care providers are now participating in the program.\n\nWhen pressed by Kapelos on the statistic that nearly 650,000 Canadians have already accessed care, Scheer again would not directly say whether his party would scrap the program, if elected.\n\n\u201cWe've seen workers' paycheques completely gutted by nine years of NDP and Liberal deficit spending and borrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why workers' paycheques don't go as far. That's why prices have risen so dramatically.\u201d\n\nWhen asked a final time whether those 650,000 Canadians would lose access to dental care under a Conservative government, Scheer said his party will \u201chave a fully comprehensive plan in time for the next election.\u201d\n\nMPs are returning to Ottawa as the House of Commons resumes Monday, once again under traditional minority government dynamics after more than two years of the supply-and-confidence agreement.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, meanwhile, has promised his party will table a non-confidence motion as soon as possible."

        "date": "26m",
        "source": "TechCrunch",
        "article_content": "Platforms to connect apps that wouldn\u2019t normally talk to each other have been around for a minute (see: Zapier). But they have not gotten dramatically simpler to use if you\u2019re nontechnical. Generative AI has lowered the barrier to entry somewhat. However, getting the most out of these platforms \u2014 and fixing things when they break \u2014 still requires a bit of programming know-how.\n\nSoftware developers Sam Brashears and Edward Frazer perceived this to be the case as well. During internships at tech giants like Meta and Stripe, they struggled to get automations working using some of the more popular app-linking tools.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been dealing with the pain of designing integrations and automations from scratch,\u201d Frazer told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cAnd Sam believed that generative AI models would solve the biggest problem in integrations \u2014 transforming data between APIs.\u201d\n\nSo Brashears and Frazer, longtime friends who\u2019d been building software together since elementary school, decided to try their hands at a streamlined, easy-to-use app-to-app integration platform.\n\nDryMerge is the fruit of their work. A chatbot for building workflows, DryMerge lets you describe an automation you want between apps \u2014 for instance, \u201cWhenever I get an email from a new prospect, ping the team on Slack and add them to HubSpot\u201d \u2014 and handles the necessary technical scaffolding.\n\n\u201cCurrently, IT departments use complicated no-code tools to automate workflows on behalf of non-IT teams,\u201d Frazer said. \u201cA natural language interface opens up automation to nontechnical people.\u201d\n\nIt sounded like a neat idea, a chatbot that can string apps together for you \u2014 particularly if you, like me, have spent countless hours wrestling with IFTTT. So, I decided to give DryMerge a go, hoping to replace my old and rickety automations once and for all.\n\nDryMerge\u2019s UI is quite clean and minimalist. It reminds me a bit of ChatGPT; there\u2019s not much to look at besides a text bot. Each new request (e.g., \u201cText me a summary of my calendar meetings every morning\u201d) starts a new chat session, and these sessions can be revisited at any time from a list on the left-side panel.\n\nDryMerge\u2019s automations management screen. Image Credits: DryMerge\n\nDryMerge hooks into an expanding library of apps, including Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Salesforce, storage services like Dropbox and OneDrive, social media platforms (e.g., X), and messaging clients (e.g., Discord). Once the platform creates an automation with these, it plops that automation into a dedicated window showing when the automation last run and whether DryMerge encountered any errors.\n\nI tried setting up a few automations I thought might be useful for a reporter with an overfull schedule, like one to throw Gmail contacts into a spreadsheet and add dates from recent email invitations to a Google Calendar. Things started out promising \u2014 DryMerge had me log into the relevant apps and asked whether I\u2019d like to test the automations to ensure everything was working properly.\n\nBut then, problems started to crop up.\n\nSeveral times, DryMerge\u2019s chatbot stopped responding altogether. Other times, it missed key details in a request. I tried repeatedly to get DryMerge to understand that I wanted to copy Gmail contacts to my Google Calendar, but every attempt, it thought I wanted to manually enter contacts into a spreadsheet.\n\nThe setbacks didn\u2019t completely ruin my DryMerge experience. Giving credit where it\u2019s due, the platform\u2019s nifty when it works. For example, I successfully got DryMerge to set up an automation that copies posts from my X account to the personal Discord server I use to aggregate various notifications. A niche use case? Perhaps. But it\u2019s going to save this reporter a lot of task switching.\n\nChatting with DryMerge\u2019s bot. Image Credits: DryMerge\n\nThe bugs, Frazer assures me, will be addressed in time. He and Brashears are DryMerge\u2019s only employees, so there\u2019s lots on the to-do list.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re well-positioned to iterate quickly and nimbly,\u201d Frazer said.\n\nAssuming Frazer and Brashears can get DryMerge\u2019s platform in good working condition, the bigger challenge the duo will have to face is staying relevant in the fiercely competitive integration-platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) space. According to recent poll released by IDG and TeamDynamix, iPaaS is one of the fastest-growing software markets, projected to reach $2.7 billion this year.\n\nAWS has its own iPaaS called AppFabric. IBM recently acquired iPaaS tech from Software AG. A growing number of startups aside from DryMerge are attempting to break into the segment, while incumbents like Zapier and IFTTT are aggressively deploying generative AI capabilities.\n\nFrazer makes the case that DryMerge\u2019s differentiator is \u2014 and will remain \u2014 \u201cbeing 10x easier to use\u201d than drag-and-drop integration builders.\n\n\u201cOur users include online fashion retailers, school administrators, and asset managers \u2014 the vast majority of which have never touched a line of code,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use us to save hours a day on tasks ranging from customer support automation to customer relationship management data entry.\u201d\n\nFrazer\u2019s not wrong about the opportunity. Per the IDG and TeamDynamix poll, 66% percent of companies said that they\u2019ll invest in iPaaS to address internal automation and data integration challenges.\n\n\u201cWe think a gigantic enterprise opportunity is in increasing the simplicity of automation and delivering easy-to-use tooling that empowers nontechnical folks,\u201d Frazer said.\n\nIt\u2019s very early days for DryMerge, which only has around 2,000 users at present. But the company was accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2024 batch, and DryMerge this past summer closed a $2.2 million seed round led by Garage Capital with participation from Goodwater Capital, Ritual Capital, and angels whose names Frazer wouldn\u2019t reveal.\n\nFrazer says that the funds are being put toward adding new app integrations and doubling the size of DryMerge\u2019s team in the next few months."

        "article_content": "To keep the ghosts at bay, read on for Entertainment Weekly\u2019s list of the 30 best paranormal movies, ranked.\n\nParanormal movies mainly preside in the horror and thriller genres, but there are a few comedic or dramatic exceptions. Almost all of them offer audiences an indelible glimpse of the supernatural that real life, for better or worse, doesn\u2019t afford us. There\u2019s nothing like that implacable tingle, that crawling dread, of films like these.\n\nOne has to wonder how ghosts and ghouls have time to haunt us when they\u2019re so preoccupied acting in paranormal movies. Certainly, the genre lets us live vicariously through (often ill-fated) characters who either summon or accidentally encounter some of the other side\u2019s residents.\n\n30. Paranormal Activity (2007) Everett Collection Oren Peli\u2019s genre-defining found footage thriller stars Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat as a couple who believes their suburban home might be beset by malevolent forces of some kind. With the help of a handy digital camera, the pair set out to find the source of the nightly disturbances. The Paranormal Activity franchise has gone so far down the rabbit hole that it\u2019s easy to forget its ultra-simple, stripped-back roots. Peli structures his picture in the seamless style of old-school horror-thrillers, first by establishing the characters and then spinning scares from their relationship that further exacerbate the bumps in the night. Where to watch Paranormal Activity: Max\n\n29. Session 9 (2001) Everett Brad Anderson\u2019s skin-crawling ghost story follows a group of sanitation workers (led by David Caruso and Josh Lucas) who encounter some creepy goings-on, and even spookier recordings of therapy sessions, when they\u2019re sent to clean out a disused mental asylum. Journeyman director Anderson outdid himself with this rollicking yet understated horror-fest, which executes its finest scares without using much more than its ingeniously unsettling sound design. Where to watch Session 9: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n28. The Frighteners (1996) Everett Peter Jackson\u2019s jolly horror-comedy finds an architect turned exorcist (Michael J. Fox), who\u2019s able to communicate with departed spirits, trying to solve the mounting body count in his idyllic small town while romancing the widow (Trini Alvarado) of one of the victims. Nobody does their respective jobs as well as Jackson and Fox do theirs, and to see these two working together is almost too much goodness to behold. The Frighteners is just as goofy and splattery as you want a Jackson genre picture to be, anchored in a solid mystery and Fox\u2019s preternatural ability to command the screen. Where to watch The Frighteners: Tubi\n\n27. Insidious (2010) Everett Collection Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) move their family to what should be an idyllic suburban home; but when one of their children falls ill, the Lamberts uncover a much darker reason behind his ailment. James Wan\u2019s haunted house picture essentially birthed Blumhouse\u2019s brand of inexpensive, wildly lucrative horror. In the same vein of Paranormal Activity, Wan\u2019s film launched a sprawling franchise with a simple, effective formula that packed an additional wallop for having been absent from cinemas for some time by the 2010s. Where to watch Insidious: Peacock\n\n26. It Follows (2014) Everett David Robert Mitchell\u2019s astonishing paranormal picture has spawned a litany of imitators, none of which match It Follows\u2019 distinctive mix of mood, high-concept plotting, and propulsive fear. Jay (Maika Monroe) has sex with her boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) only to discover he\u2019s passed along a fatal curse that she can only shake by sleeping with another person. And so it begins its shape-shifting pursuit \u2014 slow, deliberate, agonizingly persistent. Mitchell conjures a maddening sense of dread out of the simplest techniques; once we\u2019ve seen the entity walking toward Jay, every person casually moving in the background feels like a threat. Of course, It Follows is as much about growing up as it is about fear and sex \u2014 or, rather, it\u2019s about what\u2019s scary about growing up, the dying of the youthful presumption of safety, protection, and immortality. Where to watch It Follows: Netflix\n\n25. The Amityville Horror (1979) Everett Collection This classic haunted house tale tells the unfortunate \u201ctrue\u201d story of George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin and Margot Kidder), who buy a rambling house on Long Island only to discover its murderous past and supernatural inhabitants. A tremendously effective horror story that takes its time to eke out substantial frights, Stuart Rosenberg\u2019s completely over-the-top vision of yuppie-dom gone awry kicked off one of Hollywood\u2019s most dubious franchises. Though a few of the sequels have their merits, Amityville in Space and Amityville Karen remain for completists only. Where to watch The Amityville Horror: Max\n\n24. Sinister (2012) Phil Caruso/Summit Entertainment Scott Derrickson\u2019s brilliant found footage-cum-haunted house tale stars Ethan Hawke as a morally murky true crime journalist who moves with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and kids into the home where a brutal family murder took place, the inspiration for his latest book. Things go badly, and only get worse when Hawke finds a box of 16mm snuff films in the attic. Derrickson is a woefully underrated horror director, and Sinister is his crowning achievement. The gory recordings are photographed in a surrealistic, utterly chilling manner, and, set to Christopher Young\u2019s masterful industrial score, they carry an uncommon power. Where to watch Sinister: Max\n\n23. Child\u2019s Play (1988) United Artists/Everett Tom Holland\u2019s franchise kick-off finds the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transferred into a cherubic Good Guys doll named Chucky. When the toy makes its way into the home of Andy (Alex Vincent) and his exhausted mother (Catherine Hicks), only a dedicated detective (Chris Sarandon) can stop the bloodshed. Holland treats the idea of a loony murderer\u2019s spirit occupying a doll\u2019s form with an uncommon seriousness. Though some of the later installments veered into comedy, this original makes a compelling case for taking Chucky very seriously indeed. Where to watch Child\u2019s Play: Tubi\n\n22. Final Destination 2 (2003) Everett Collection David R. Ellis\u2019 wildly entertaining first sequel in the admirably consistent franchise follows a group of spring-break revelers (led by A.J. Cook and returning star Ali Larter) who manage to avoid a catastrophic highway pileup only to find themselves being picked off, one by one, by that dreaded specter known as Death. Breathtakingly gory and hell-bent on a very particular type of early-aughts destruction, Final Destination 2 is a slasher movie crossed with something approaching a supernatural action film. It\u2019s remarkably entertaining and always rewatchable, with a few murder set pieces that will make you genuinely wince. Where to watch Final Destination 2: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21. Ringu (1998) Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter, sets out with her ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) to investigate the ghostly phenomenon of a disturbing videotape that seemingly killed her niece. Hideo Nakata\u2019s seminal fright flick kicked off a sprawling franchise across several continents, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Ringu possesses a singular sort of fear that few films can pull off. Watching it leaves you with that unshakeable, unpleasant feeling of recalling too vividly a particularly disturbing nightmare. Where to watch Ringu: Tubi\n\n20. The Others (2001) Everett Collection Grace (Nicole Kidman) moves with her children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), who possess a sunlight allergy, into an isolated country cottage as she awaits the return of her husband from fighting in WWII. There, the arrival of a governess (Fionnula Flanagan) and her peers kicks off a series of horrifying supernatural occurrences that threaten to unravel Grace\u2019s reality. A wonderfully paced, brazenly old-fashioned ghost story, The Others feels timeless as all the best horror films do. Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar directs with a lush eye for atmosphere and details, while the oft-imitated twist ending feels earned and emotionally cathartic. Where to watch The Others: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n19. The Eye (2002) Everett The Pang Brothers\u2019 ultra-spooky immersion into the supernatural underworld stars Angelica Lee as Mun, a prodigious blind musician who is gifted sight with a radical corneal transplant. Yet as she\u2019s tormented by visions of the dead, Mun wonders if sight is worth her mental sanity. One of Hong Kong\u2019s signature modern thrillers, The Eye got swept up in American audiences\u2019 fascination with Asian horror from the late \u201990s through the aughts, later receiving an obligatory remake in 2008 starring Jessica Alba. Like most modern horror encores, that version is best left unseen; it can\u2019t match the Pangs\u2019 contemporary twist on classical, spine-tingling fright. Where to watch The Eye: Not available to stream\n\n18. The Beyond (1981) Everett Collection Lucio Fulci\u2019s paranormal masterwork concerns a young woman (Catriona MacColl) who inherits a palatial hotel that sits above the gates of hell. Predictably, things don\u2019t go so well for her. To define what the experience of The Beyond is actually like is\u2026 well, if you\u2019ll forgive the paraphrased steal from Casablanca, it\u2019s like any other Italian horror movie, only more so. Fulci embraces nightmare logic as enthusiastically as any filmmaker of his genre or generation, and this film is him at his gorily most unhinged. He indulges his penchant for toe-curling eyeball violence and subtly effective set design in this everything-and-the-kitchen-sink haunted house riff. Where to watch The Beyond: Peacock\n\n17. Jennifer\u2019s Body (2009) Doane Gregory/TM and Fox Atomic/Courtesy Everett Collection Karyn Kusama\u2019s supernatural high-school dark comedy, written by Diablo Cody, is utterly excellent despite its initially lackluster reviews. Amanda Seyfried plays Needy Lesnicky, the dowdy best friend to the popular/hot/cool/flexible Jennifer Check (Megan Fox). When Jennifer is sacrificed as part of a devilish ritual by a skeevy rock band, she returns as a succubus with a taste for teenage boys\u2019 flesh. Jennifer\u2019s Body is one of those perfect fusions of time and place, capturing that mid-aughts period when pop culture was paradoxically alt. Cody also flexes her sprawling knowledge of the horror genre, making for a riotously entertaining film with a ferocious satirical undercurrent. Where to watch Jennifer\u2019s Body: Tubi\n\n16. Talk to Me (2022) A24 This recent A24 effort from Australian directors Danny and Michael Philippou is one of the studio\u2019s scariest outputs yet. A mummified hand that can imbue its possessors with both horrifying glimpses of the afterlife and a drug-life euphoria threatens to undo a suburban family when a young boy (the stupendously natural Joe Bird) spends too long on the other side and becomes possessed. Remarkably unsettling and shockingly brutal, Talk to Me is a singular horror film that ranks among this decade\u2019s finest. With a smart application of style and humor, the Philippous crafted a relentless modern chiller. Where to watch Talk to Me: Paramount+\n\n15. Suspiria (1977) 20th Century Studios Dario Argento\u2019s groundbreaking opera of furious sight and sound concerns young Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), who upon being sent to a prestigious German ballet academy discovers that it is but a front for a coven of youth-siphoning witches. Argento\u2019s galvanizing picture remains a masterclass in harnessing the power of image and music to beguile an audience. It also feels as fresh and exciting today as it did almost 50 years ago. Where to watch Suspiria: Xumo Play\n\n14. Lake Mungo (2008) Mungo Productions After their teenage daughter (Talia Zucker) drowns, a family begins experiencing strange events in their home. They call in a paranormal psychologist, who uncovers disturbing secrets while parsing through their surveillance camera and cell phone footage. This is a particularly somber and understated movie, resembling domestic dramas like Ordinary People more than traditional horror films. With a canny mix of found footage and faux-documentary, Lake Mungo transports the audience into its spare, chilling universe. Where to watch Lake Mungo: Tubi\n\n13. Hereditary (2018) Toni Collette; Hereditary. A24 Ari Aster\u2019s astonishingly original yet somehow terrifically old-fashioned ghost-and-witchcraft story stars Toni Collette as a bereaved mother who turns to the paranormal in the hopes of contacting family members she\u2019s recently lost. As the supposedly well-intentioned woman leading her to doom, Ann Dowd commits to one of the most insidious villain performances in modern horror history. The movie that established Aster as an art-house freakout auteur, Hereditary is breathtakingly, exhaustively intense and frequently just as emotional. That Collette didn\u2019t collect an Oscar nomination for this role is a stain on the Academy. Where to watch Hereditary: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n12. The Orphanage (2007) Everett Collection J.A. Bayona directed this Spanish production about a young woman (Bel\u00e9n Rueda) who buys the orphanage in which she grew up with the intention of converting it into a home for infirm children. When her son goes missing, she turns to the many ghosts residing within the home to aid her desperate search. More than a bit inspired by Guillermo del Toro\u2019s The Devil\u2019s Backbone, The Orphanage weaves a similarly melancholy and thematically rich haunted house tale that calls on the country\u2019s complicated past to inflect its plot with verisimilitude. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s exceptionally scary. Where to watch The Orphanage: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n11. Jacob\u2019s Ladder (1990) Everett Adrian Lyne\u2019s mind-warping erotic thriller stars Tim Robbins as a Vietnam vet plagued with horrifying hallucinations once he returns stateside. As he discovers he's not the only member of his platoon to experience such oddities, Jacob is further removed from his already tenuous reality. A thoughtful and enveloping exploration of psychosis, Lyne\u2019s film remains a high-water mark in the psychological freak-out genre. Robbins grounds the eccentric proceedings with his reliable everyman persona, while Lynne one-ups his signature opulent visual style in such a way that he often wrong-foots the audience\u2019s genre expectations with nothing more than a simple camera move. Where to watch Jacob\u2019s Ladder: Amazon Prime Video\n\n10. The Sixth Sense (1999) Everett Collection Young Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is plagued by visions of those who died violent deaths. His exasperated mother (Toni Collette) seeks help in the form of a psychologist (Bruce Willis), who may have more in common with Cole than he thinks. M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s classic ghost story popularized a now-ubiquitous twist ending and got all of us swearing we saw dead people. It\u2019s still a hard-edged, substantially creepy fable with a heart-wrenching central performance from Osment and some of Willis\u2019 best dramatic acting. Where to watch The Sixth Sense: Max\n\n9. Cat People (1942) Everett Collection A well-intentioned husband (Kent Smith) accidentally ignites his wife\u2019s (Simone Simon) supernatural curse, in which she transforms into a large feline when aroused. She then goes about stalking her nemeses, including the beautiful woman (Jane Randolph) with whom her partner has become infatuated. Jacques Tourneur\u2019s fabulously creepy and macabre exploration of jealous sexual awakening features some unbelievably detailed sets and camerawork that seem innovative even today. Far from the staid paranormal horrors produced during this period, Cat People is ferocious and mysterious in equal measure. Where to watch Cat People: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n8. Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968) Courtesy Everett Collection Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s satirical shocker stars Mia Farrow as a young housewife who begins to believe her dream pregnancy is a cover for something much more nefarious, as her actor husband (John Cassavetes) brings an eccentric elderly couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) uncomfortably into their lives. Polanski\u2019s picture is elegant yet abrasive, an uncommonly lovely combination. Farrow is terrific in the lead role, getting the audience almost instantly on her side as the director ratchets up the tension to an unbearably chilling climax. Where to watch Rosemary\u2019s Baby: Paramount+\n\n7. Poltergeist (1982) Everett Collection Tobe Hooper\u2019s story about a suburban family (helmed by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) beset by paranormal activity in their new home, which may or may not be built on an ancient burial ground, is completely insane. It\u2019s one of the first horror movies to feel like an out-and-out action (or even disaster) movie, with crumbling sets and flashing lights right out of a Clive Barker climax. Poltergeist has endured, though, because its scares are rooted in this authentic family unit\u2019s terror. We feel for them, and the dissolution of their \u2014 \u201980s American dream. Where to watch Poltergeist: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n6. The Innocents (1961) 20th Century Fox Film Corp./Courtesy Everett Based on Henry James\u2019 The Turn of the Screw, Jack Clayton\u2019s spine-chilling ghost story (with a script by Truman Capote, among others) stars Deborah Kerr as a governess sent to an isolated estate to care for two odd children (Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin). There, she encounters \u2014 what else? \u2014 disembodied voices and vengeful spirits. Clayton\u2019s exceptionally frightening haunted house picture established many of the genre\u2019s most beloved tropes, a great deal of which are still in circulation today. Nearly every film on this list has arguably drawn inspiration from The Innocents. Here, Clayton creates a masterful mood of dread and dense mystery within a rich and oddly cozy atmosphere. Where to watch The Innocents: Not available to stream\n\n5. Hausu (1977) Everett There\u2019s no other way to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi\u2019s film except for \u201cgenuinely f\u2014ing crazy.\u201d Even to call it a haunted house movie seems tame; it\u2019s more of a spiritual home invasion, really. A group of seven schoolgirls \u2014 all with cheeky names like Kung Fu and Mac (for \u201cstomach,\u201d because she likes to eat) \u2014 venture to the home of one girl\u2019s aunt, where they\u2019re beset by disembodied, bottom-chomping heads, possessed mattresses, and hungry ghosts. Obayashi\u2019s picture is an authentically singular experience, and also a rather sweet one. It plays like a live-action, exaggeratedly silly Studio Ghibli movie. Where to watch Hausu: Max\n\n4. The Haunting (1963) Everett Collection Robert Wise\u2019s adaptation of Shirley Jackson\u2019s masterful novella finds a specially selected group of people brought together to spend a night at the famously haunted Hill House. Each has their different motives \u2014 Eleanor (Julie Harris) wishes to separate from her overbearing family; a gregarious psychic (Claire Bloom) hopes to write a bestselling book; Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) wants to uncover the home\u2019s paranormal truth. Joined by the home\u2019s heir (Russ Tamblyn), they set about uncovering the home\u2019s insidious past. Wise crafts an elegant and memorable ghost story here, retaining much of Jackson\u2019s scabrous dialogue while improving upon the suspense set pieces established in her book.\u200b\u200b It\u2019s one of the spookiest, and most elegant, haunted house pictures ever made. Where to watch The Haunting: Tubi\n\n3. The Shining (1980) Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) encounters the Grady twins (Lisa and Louise Burns) inside the Overlook Hotel in 'The Shining.'. Warner Brothers/courtesy Everett Stanley Kubrick\u2019s supernatural opus continues to spark scrutiny and debate almost 50 years later. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a has-been writer, takes a job at the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker so he can write his next novel. Soon, his family (wife Shelley Duvall and son Danny Lloyd) experiences gory hallucinations and unexplainable events within the corridors. Kubrick\u2019s film is a devastatingly rendered portrait of an artist\u2019s descent into psychosis, one that\u2019s implicit through the pursuit of crafting a great work. The Shining is every bit as meticulous and fetishistic as its reputation would suggest, with Kubrick using his stern directorial hand to create a sense of unease on screen. Where to watch The Shining: Max\n\n2. Evil Dead II (1987) Everett Sam Raimi\u2019s gleeful, gore-gag-laden romp (essentially a higher-budget, more jocular spin on his 1981 original) finds Bruce Campbell\u2019s Ash once again battling a group of Deadites in a remote cabin. Raimi strikes an inimitable tone of feel-good fun that precious few films are able to attain, let alone those in the horror genre. The director previously compared this movie to The Three Stooges with viscera standing in for custard pies, and that\u2019s the precise vibe one feels upon viewing. There\u2019s nothing offensive or off-putting in Evil Dead II, only a merry sense of the possibilities paranormal filmmaking presents. Where to watch Evil Dead II: Plex"

        "article_content": "People might recognise the owner as she\u2019s been doing paranormal activities for over 30 years\n\nA new shop selling all things \u201cwitchy\u201d has moved to a popular shopping destination in the Six Towns. This Witchy Needs is owned by Jade Hawkins, 35, who\u2019s moved her business from Longton Market to The Longton Exchange and says there is much more custom there.\n\nThis Witchy Needs also offers reiki and holistic therapies, which are said to engage mindfulness practices, and consider a person's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being with the aim of understanding themselves better. The Sneyd Green mum decided to move her business as she needed more space to carry out her services, as well as requiring space to stock items for the shop.\n\nSome of the items on sale include mugs, incense, crystals, clothing, and other \u201cwitchy and paranormal\u201d related goods. Jade is also well known throughout the Six Towns for the ghost hunts she hosts, which she has done for more than 30 years.\n\nJade said: \u201cI started off in Longton Market at the end of May but I needed more space. I needed to expand because we have so many ranges of items and services on offer, and this was the last lease available in The Longton Exchange. It\u2019s a lot better here and it\u2019s busier than the market. I'd say footfall in the area is probably about 80 percent more than in the market.\n\n\u201cI did ghost hunts anyway in and around Stoke, and I have done for 30 odd years in total, so I decided to open a shop so people can come and talk to me when they want to. We offer tarot readings, reiki, and lots of holistic therapies. People can come in and enquire, and they can pre-book set days or they can do walk-ins if they\u2019re available. We usually get walk-ins and we\u2019ve been busy.\u201d\n\nTalking about her life prior to opening This Witchy Needs, Jade said: \u201cI did work full time as a care supervisor, but I decided to go self employed. It\u2019s the best thing I ever did because it\u2019s more flexible, and being open six days a week is much better than only opening for three days a week when I was in the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always got incense burning and meditation music playing in the shop. It\u2019s a safe space for people to come in and have a coffee and a chat. We\u2019re always bringing in different things when we place our orders.\n\n\"If there\u2019s anything specific people want and we don\u2019t stock it in store then we can order it online and get it from them. We welcome everyone and we want people to pop in and ask us any questions they have about anything spiritual or paranormal.\u201d\n\nThis Witchy Needs is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 9am until 5pm, on Wednesdays from 10am until 5pm, and on Saturdays from 9.30am until 5.30pm. People can find out more by visiting This Witchy Needs on Facebook and TikTok, and a website is currently being built which will be found at thiswitchyneeds.com."

The team of scientists discovered the wasp species by chance while they were collecting fruit flies in their backyards.\n\nIn an interview with Live Science, Moore explained that female S. perlmani use their needle-like ovipositor organ \u2014 the stinger in stinging wasps \u2014 to stab and deposit an egg within a fruit fly's abdomen. The egg then hatches into a tiny wasp larva, which grows inside the fly for about 18 days before leaving its host for dead.\n\n\"It will effectively emerge out of the side of the fly, and just to add an additional layer of horror, the fly will normally remain alive for several hours after that,\" Morre said, explaining the chilling process."

        "article_content": "Wounds that resist healing have long posed a significant challenge in medical care, but a recent discovery offers a solution that combines luxury with cutting-edge science.\n\nResearchers have tapped into the remarkable healing properties of gold nanoparticles mixed with antioxidant-rich red wine.\n\nThis unexpected fusion of precious metal and natural compounds paves the way for a revolutionary approach to treating chronic wounds and other medical conditions.\n\nTraditional medicine and new technology\n\nIn the heart of South Africa, the University of the Western Cape hosts a team of researchers driven to make significant strides in medical science.\n\nThe team\u2019s dedication to exploring novel solutions for persistent health challenges has led them to a fascinating discovery that blends traditional medicine with cutting-edge technology.\n\nTheir latest research was focused on a concoction combining gold nanoparticles with the potent antioxidants found in red wine. The innovative formula has shown tremendous potential, as lab tests revealed that it significantly accelerated wound healing.\n\nRemarkably, in just 72 hours, wounds treated with this unique mixture of gold and red wine healed almost entirely \u2013 a promising and exciting outcome that could pave the way for future advancements in chronic wound care.\n\nThe dangers of chronic wounds\n\nChronic wounds, defined as those that fail to heal within three months, represent a widespread and persistent health challenge, affecting approximately 3.8 million patients each year.\n\nChronic wounds often stall in the inflammatory phase, a stage where the body\u2019s natural healing processes become hindered. This prevents progression to the crucial remodeling phase where new tissue begins to grow and repair the damaged area.\n\nFor individuals with underlying conditions like diabetes, this issue becomes even more serious. Poor blood circulation, a common complication of diabetes, exacerbates the healing process, leaving these wounds vulnerable to infections.\n\nIn severe cases, the inability to heal can lead to devastating outcomes, including the risk of limb amputation. Identifying solutions for chronic wound care is a medical priority.\n\nThe wound healing power of gold\n\nThe research team hypothesized that gold could act as the ideal catalyst to jump-start the healing process for chronic wounds.\n\nGold\u2019s renowned anti-inflammatory properties, combined with its natural compatibility with human tissues, have made it a valuable element in medical treatments for centuries.\n\nIts unique ability to reduce inflammation without causing adverse reactions allows gold to interact harmoniously with the body, promoting faster recovery.\n\nHistorically, gold has played a significant role in medicine, with gold particles being used as early as the 20th century to treat chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis in the UK.\n\nBuilding on this legacy, the research team explored how gold could unlock similar benefits in the realm of wound care, providing a modern twist to an age-old remedy.\n\nPowerful antioxidants of red wine\n\nRed grapes, the foundation of many popular wines, are rich in powerful antioxidants like resveratrol. These naturally occurring compounds play a crucial role in protecting the body from oxidative stress by neutralizing harmful free radicals.\n\nFree radicals can damage cells and impede the healing process, but the antioxidants in red wine help to counteract these effects.\n\nBy combating these damaging molecules, resveratrol and other antioxidants support the body\u2019s ability to repair itself.\n\nThe antioxidants ensure that tissues receive a sufficient oxygen supply, which is essential for regeneration and recovery, ultimately boosting the healing process and enhancing the body\u2019s natural defenses.\n\nCombining gold and red wine\n\nThe team tested their hypothesis by drying red wine to obtain extracts, which were then mixed with chloroauric acid, a gold-containing chemical.\n\nThe blend was applied to a lab dish containing human skin cells, with a scratch in the middle to simulate a wound.\n\nCells treated with this golden mixture saw an 80% wound closure within 72 hours, compared to 50% with wine alone.\n\nThe combination of cabernet sauvignon and gold proved even more effective, healing wounds almost entirely in the same time frame.\n\nThe future of wound care\n\nRenowned vascular surgeon Stella Vig of Croydon University Hospital praised the novel use of red wine and the innovative production of gold nanoparticles. Both silver and gold nanoparticles could play a critical role in reducing wound infections.\n\nDr. Ahmed Osman from Queen\u2019s University, Belfast added that gold particles encourage cell growth and enhance the natural healing process of the skin.\n\nThis revolutionary approach to wound healing, combining gold and red wine, holds remarkable promise for the future of wound care.\n\nWhile further research is needed, the implications are significant, opening new avenues for advanced medical treatments.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

        "article_content": "There is a massive transformation happening in the financial services industry due to technological advancements and evolving consumer expectations. Key to this transformation has been advances in financial software development as companies innovate, improve operational efficiencies and create better customer experiences. In response to these trends, an article has been developed to take a deep dive into the major breakthroughs defining financial software development and unearthing more upon highlights on how developments in this niche affects global industries.\n\nThe Rise of Fintech Solutions\n\nWith a machine-like version of human oversight, the financial services industry has been transformed by disruptive fintech (financial technology). Fintech companies are using very advanced tech-enabled tools to change the way banking and financial services work, with innovative products that meet consumer needs today.\n\nMobile Banking and Payments\n\nConsumers and businesses of all sizes can benefit, as mobile banking & payment solutions have changed the way people interact with financial services. Users can manage and control their finances, make payments & transfers if they need be and access traditional banking services on their cellphones via these applications.\n\nLately we\u2019re seeing all our favorite payment apps such as Venmo, PayPal and Cash App explode in popularity. Similarly, traditional banks have also gone mobile with apps like Chase Mobile or Bank of America Mobile Banking.\n\nDigital Wallets\n\nDigital wallets are one more sort of fintech that has in a lot of ways changed the economic landscape. They are secure wallets that store payment details and allow you to pay for stuff without cash or using your pocket card with a simple tap.\n\nOther than the fact they work, Apple Pay and Google Wallet are pretty pedestrian \u2013 just another digital wallet to use side-by-side with traditional payment methods.\n\n1) AI and ML\n\nIn financial app development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are acting as a spine. Initiatives are using these technologies to improve everything from customer service in financial services and insurtech, through to risk management.\n\nCustomer-Centric Engagement. Financial institutions can now capitalize on AI and ML to provide customers with bespoke experiences, by utilizing an abundance of data reservoirs that the solution solutions analyze, in order to understand individual liking or dislike patterns. This customization makes for happier and returning customers.\n\nArtificial Intelligence-Powered Chatbots for Instant Customer Support and Product Recommendations Credit unions, along with traditional banks and fintech companies deploy chatbots powered by AI to provide instant customer support and query responses; leverage data analytics capabilities using the user\u2019s financial history or behavioral analysis laying down personalized product recommendations.\n\nFraud Detection and Risk Management.
