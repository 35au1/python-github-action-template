        "article_content": "Area 51 is the most famous alien base shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories\n\nAn infamous part of America has been \"revealed\" to be the home of another alien base. A lawyer, Danny Sheehan has worked to bring UFO whistleblowers to the United States Congress over recent years. Alien base conspiracy theories have cropped up time and time again but Mr Sheehan has helped to give evidence of alleged government cover-ups involving extraterrestrial beings. There have been some serious allegations made including that at the locations of two bases, hundreds of UFOs have been seen going \u201cin and out of it\u201d. Mr Sheehan spoke on Julian Dorey\u2019s podcast about the potential location of alien bases in the US.\n\nThe Arizona mountains are allegedly home to a secret alien base\n\nHe said one base is under the sea bed off the island of Isla Guadalupe and another is hidden away on land. Mr Sheehan added: \u201cThere's another base outside of Sedona, Arizona, over by a place called 'secret mount' wilderness \u2013 a totally desolate area. \u201cThere's a base there where the craft are, there's a number of them high in the mountains in remote areas of the planet and they're here now and they're extraordinarily distressed about the state of affairs (of humanity).\u201d In terms of what lies inside, Mr Sheehan claimed aliens were \u201cmantis people\u201d who could have advanced weaponry. When asked what the \u201cmantis people\u201d are, he said: \u201cThey are huge, seven feet tall, extraordinarily skinny, thin, kind of bowed over and remind people of a praying mantis... they are also called 'insectoids'. Whenever they're seen with tall greys, they seem to be in charge... giving telepathic commands.\u201d\n\nMany conspiracy theorists are keen to share their thoughts on UFO and alien sightings\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Luckily, if first contact with alien life turns out just like in \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d a new survey has some tips on where to hide! In an out-of-this-world analysis that comes on the heels of safety officials releasing the first-ever police handbook on UFOs, researchers with the website Rant Casino have put out a list of which U.S. states would fare best during an extraterrestrial invasion. The timing couldn\u2019t be more relevant \u2014 searches for \u201cwhat would happen if aliens came to Earth\u201d have skyrocketed by an astounding 2,850% in recent months, while nearly two-thirds of Americans now believe in the existence of alien life. Even more striking, 34% of Americans now consider UFOs as proof of alien life, up significantly from 20% in 1996.\n\nShould E.T. invade in the near future, fleeing to Virginia emerged as Americans\u2019 best hope for survival, scoring an impressive 8.03 out of 10 on the alien survival index. The state\u2019s robust military presence \u2014 the highest per capita force in the nation \u2014 combined with its natural defenses of 29 caves and 63% forest cover make it an ideal stronghold against otherworldly threats. Close behind is Alabama, scoring 7.90 out of 10, with its network of 35 caves and the highest forest coverage (71%) among top-ranked states. The state\u2019s relatively low UFO sighting rate of 2.76 per 10,000 people suggests it might fly under alien radar, while its considerable law enforcement presence \u2014 267.35 per capita, nearly double that of Oregon\u2019s 145.01 \u2014 positions it well for coordinated defense efforts.\n\nMinnesota rounds out the top three with a score of 7.83, distinguished by its intellectual firepower of 5.07 scientists and 10.12 engineers per 1,000 residents. The state\u2019s impressive ratio of 32.01 healthcare professionals per capita and 882 food and beverage manufacturers strengthens its survival prospects. Interestingly, New York finished as the fifth-best state for surviving an alien invasion. That being said, it\u2019s probably still a good idea to avoid the Empire State Building when the UFOs arrive, just saying.\n\n10 U.S. states most likely to survive an alien invasion Virginia Alabama Minnesota Massachusetts New York Florida Wisconsin North Carolina Alaska Georgia\n\nOn the flip side, Nevada\u2019s position as the state least likely to survive (scoring just 5.31 out of 10) might raise eyebrows. Despite its association with Area 51, the state\u2019s lack of natural cover, minimal water resources, and high UFO sighting rate of 5.41 per 10,000 residents make it particularly vulnerable. Idaho follows as second-most vulnerable, with the nation\u2019s lowest per capita healthcare workforce (22.95) and concerning UFO activity (6.95 sightings per 10,000 people).\n\n10 U.S. states least likely to survive an alien invasion Nevada Idaho Arizona Nebraska Oregon Utah Oklahoma New Hampshire South Carolina Wyoming\n\n\u201cGone are the days when it was regarded as part fringe, part-science fiction, and part conspiracy theory. UFOs are now being treated as a defense and national security issue, discussed in the United States Congress, and attracting attention from the Head of NASA,\u201d says former U.K. Ministry of Defense UFO investigator Nick Pope. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell whether we\u2019re seeing a genuine spike in UFO sightings \u2013 and if so, what this means \u2013 or whether what\u2019s happening is that a higher proportion of sightings is being reported, as a result of the current mainstream media coverage of this subject,\u201d Pope continues.\n\nThe study\u2019s methodology considered multiple survival factors, including UFO sighting frequencies, natural hiding spots like forests and caves, military and law enforcement presence, healthcare and scientific workforce, and food manufacturing capabilities. This comprehensive approach provides a sobering look at each state\u2019s preparedness for what once seemed like science fiction but increasingly captures public attention and government resources.\n\n\u201cThe subject has come out of the fringe and into the mainstream, which has led to lots more people speaking out about their own sightings and encounters. Regardless of the truth about these various incidents, it focuses on the fact that UFO sightings \u2013 whatever their cause \u2013 have serious and profound defense, national security, and air safety issues,\u201d Pope concludes."

        "article_content": "Carl Petrick is a sky-watcher.\n\nThe East Moline resident and Moline native is a retired longtime zookeeper at Niabi Zoo. He studies his surroundings with scientific attention. Science is his religion, Petrick said. The 66-year-old just wants to figure it all out.\n\n\u201cMoving things,\u201d in particular, are fascinating to him. He\u2019s an avid bird-watcher. Birds\u2019 camouflaging abilities, their ability to fly into the wind, their speed \u2014 it\u2019s all impressive to Petrick.\n\n\u201cPeople are smart, but we can't do some of the things they do,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrick is willing to go to great lengths to identify birds he spots in local parks \u2014 once, he chased a bird 50 yards just to get answers after he glimpsed it through a bush. Eventually, he tracked it down.\n\nBut there\u2019s one flyer that got away. It\u2019s nagged at him for more than 50 years.\n\nPetrick is one of several Quad-Citians who reported seeing UFOs over several days in early March 1967. At the time, Petrick was a 9-year-old student at Sacred Heart Catholic School, now Seton Catholic, in Moline.\n\nThe record of this local UFO phenomenon, which stretched across multiple counties in western Illinois, is part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs in the 1950s and 1960s, a time of heightened concern due to the Cold War.\n\nNuns, sheriff\u2019s deputies, elementary students and more reported seeing something in the sky that spring.\n\nThe story is still vivid in Petrick\u2019s head.\n\nIf he stares long enough at a wall, he can close his eyes and see it like it was yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s not an airplane\n\nPetrick saw it between 2 and 3 p.m., as he went back inside for class, he said. The weather was chilly but clear.\n\n\u201cI looked up and I saw something in the distance,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nTo his naked eye, the object in the western sky looked like a spot or a small silvery thing. He estimated its height to be like that of airplanes when they emit contrails as they fly over.\n\nAs Petrick watched the object, Bill Fisher, a Moline police officer, came around the corner. The officer had binoculars or a movie camera with him. Fisher looked at the object then handed the instrument he carried to Petrick.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d the police officer asked the boy.\n\nWith the instrument\u2019s assistance, Petrick saw a silver, cigar-shaped object with what Petrick described as three long windows along the side. Those windows were powder blue, like the jersey shade of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe thing was not moving and Petrick estimated its length to be between 20 and 40 feet.\n\nPetrick told Fisher the thing was not an airplane, then the police officer said he had to go.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last I saw of him,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nThat day, Fisher recorded the object with a portable 8mm movie camera. He and his recording would be a central part of the Air Force\u2019s investigation.\n\nAfter Fisher left, Petrick watched the object for about 10 more minutes before returning to class, he said. About 30 or 45 minutes later, he came back outside.\n\n\u201cIt was still there,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nAt home a short time later, he observed it again with his father and brother, using a small telescope. The object still had not moved and its appearance remained the same.\n\nPetrick does not know what the object was, but he said he knows what it wasn\u2019t. It was not a bird or a butterfly, he said. It was not an airplane, helicopter or zeppelin.\n\nBy the process of elimination, he concluded it was a UFO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, so obviously and logically, it would be unidentified,\u201d he said. \u201cJust common sense.\u201d\n\nNow decades removed from the event, Petrick said he does not think the object had a human origin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just observing us like we observe.\u201d\n\nPetrick said he saw the object in the same place in the sky for several days after those initial sightings.\n\nThen, one day, it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nInitially, he thought it might have moved. After a bit more time, he decided it was gone for good.\n\nDuck and cover\n\nAt the time of the Quad-Cities sighting, the Cold War was in full swing. The rivalry between America and the Soviet Union even extended into space.\n\nPetrick remembered a childhood game he and his friends played, inspired by the monthly emergency siren tests. When they heard the siren, the children would pretend the Russians were attacking.\n\nPeople feared a nuclear holocaust, Petrick said. Incidents like the Bay of Pigs had occurred and the conflict in Vietnam was heating up.\n\n\u201cWe were so inundated with the Cold War\u2019s \u2018Russians are bad, we\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d Petrick said.\n\nHe also described an exercise he had to do at school: the duck-and-cover drill.\n\n\u201cIf the siren goes off, get under your desk because if a bomb explodes, you\u2019ll be protected,\u201d he said.\n\nShould they find themselves in the hallway, children were supposed to get against the wall and cover themselves as best they could, he said.\n\nThe school phased that drill out while he was still a student.\n\nThere was also a big emphasis on science in school because of the Cold War. The Russians had their Sputnik satellite. The Americans were after the Moon.\n\nAfter he saw the object in the sky that day, Petrick said, he considered, then discarded, the possibility that another nation was behind it.\n\n\u201cIf it was Russian or Chinese or whatever, you think it would have been attacking the States or would have been doing something to throw us off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sat there.\u201d\n\nNot just Petrick\n\nPetrick wasn\u2019t the only person in the Quad-Cities who spotted a UFO that week. The local newspapers covered the phenomenon extensively.\n\nJames Maifield, of Silvis, reported that he and his wife spotted a \u201cwhite light\u201d in the sky for several minutes. An anonymous Silvis police dispatcher told the Moline Dispatch she saw a \u201cweird\u201d white light, too.\n\nGary Bennett, an Augustana College student, told the Times-Democrat he saw an \u201cunfamiliar airborne vehicle\u201d around 9:30 p.m. on March 9.\n\nArnold Buchmeyer, Helen DeRocker and Leo Schmitz, all of Moline, separately reported to the Times-Democrat that they saw something strange in the sky, too. Schmitz said it was \u201cvery white\u201d and \u201cmoving northwesterly.\u201d\n\nA Northwestern University astronomer speculated that it was just the planet Venus.\n\nThe weekend after the sightings, pranksters were caught deploying a balloon with a candle that crash-landed in Rock Island. A similar balloon was found near the Monmouth waste disposal plant on Thursday, March 9, pieced together with soda straws.\n\nJimmie Scott, a 12-year-old from Buffalo, Iowa, told the Times-Democrat he got out of bed around 2 a.m. on March 9 to get a drink of water. He looked into the sky and saw a \u201cbright, white object that looked like a saucer.\u201d\n\nHis sketch of the saucer was published on the front pages of the Times-Democrat.\n\nThe principal witness, though, was Fisher, the Moline officer who greeted Petrick on the campus of Sacred Heart.\n\nThe star witness\n\nAfter the Quad-Cities area sightings drew the attention of the federal government, Fisher was interviewed at length by the U.S. Air Force, who sent Capt. Edward Orenic and Capt. Anton Kato to investigate.\n\nAfter their visit, they produced a 94-page report on their methods, avenues of inquiry and conclusions. The report is available online through the U.S. National Archives.\n\nThe two captains cast a wide net, the report shows. Their efforts included interviewing witnesses and collecting weather data. They also checked with regional military, airport and National Weather Service officials for aircraft and weather balloon flights as well as for reports of anything strange.\n\nOrenic and Kato took particular interest in Fisher\u2019s account and the footage he took.\n\nThe officer told the Air Force that he was initially at Sacred Heart on March 9 to deliver a message to his son, a student there. He arrived around 1:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I glanced upward above the treetops and viewed a object that I was not sure of its description or its identity,\u201d he told investigators.\n\nHe described the object as \u201cU-shaped \u2014 like a pickle,\u201d and said he watched it for \u201ca precious minute and a half.\u201d Soon after, he began shooting footage with his 8mm camera, using a telescopic lens and outdoor film. The footage is also available online in the U.S. National Archives.\n\nFisher told the Dispatch in 2015 that he kept the camera in storage on his motorcycle, aware that UFO rumors were already swirling in town.\n\n\u201cThere were stories all around,\u201d he told the Dispatch. \u201cI was just naturally curious.\u201d\n\nAfter he arrived on the campus, Fisher says the object then began moving \u201cnorthwesterly\u201d away from him. It \u201cappeared to have stopped\u201d and hovered, he said, and then it continued its pace until it faded from view.\n\n\u201cBefore it faded away here, before it got completely obscure, I did have a definite sighting of a metallic, shiny surface on the side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe side that was the broad side to me, was metallic and appeared to be of the same construction like some of our large aircrafts that I\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n\nAs he stood at the school, Fisher asked several kids and a state policeman\u2019s wife about what they saw. The woman told him it \u201clooked shiny and reflected a white light.\u201d Fisher said he didn\u2019t spot any lights or objects connected to the craft. He heard no sound emitted from the object, but the woman reported a hissing or whirring sound.\n\nIn the report, captains Orenic and Kato also highlighted the accounts of two sheriff\u2019s deputies, one from Knox County and the other from Henry County.\n\nThe Knox County deputy\u2019s account was that early on March 6, 1967, he saw a flying object.\n\nHis account included that it was shaped like an upside-down bowl, the report states. It had a glowing red base and at one point emitted a bright beam of white light.\n\nThe deputy from Henry County saw something in the sky late on March 8, the report states.\n\nThe deputy\u2019s description included that the object was framed by three lights \u2014 one red, one white and one green. Periodically it would emit an intense red light bright enough to obscure the other three lights.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict?\n\nOrenic and Kato concluded at the end of the report that the sightings most likely involved the mundane.\n\nIn Fisher\u2019s case, the object was most likely an air vehicle \u2013 a plane or helicopter, the report states. In another part of the report, Orenic and Kato also state it could have been a balloon.\n\n\u201cThe description, duration and flight characteristics are similar to that of a balloon,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe 8mm film failed to reveal any information that would dispute this evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe captains said the Henry County deputy\u2019s sighting was also likely an aircraft.\n\nThe Knox County sighting was probably of a home-made hot air balloon created using a garment bag, similar to the one Rock Island pranksters made the weekend of March 12, and the one recovered in the Monmouth area. The method of making the balloons had been published in a national magazine, the report states.\n\nDuring that period, two red kites along with batteries and a light bulb were also recovered in the Galesburg area, according to the report.\n\nNearly all the witnesses Orenic and Kato interviewed appeared extremely reliable but had a \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d or an attitude of \u201cthought I\u2019d never see a saucer,\u201d the report states.\n\nThose attitudes, the extensive news coverage and prank launchings appeared to have caused wide-spread UFO sightings, the captains wrote.\n\nStill looking, still believing\n\nIn 2015, the year before Fisher\u2019s death at the age of 81, the Dispatch interviewed him about the incident. They asked how he felt about investigators pointing out his affinity for science fiction and \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d \u2014 the report said, for example, that Fisher \u201cwatches the sky every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nThe former officer told the Dispatch he felt investigators were fishing for statements like that. But Fisher remained \u201cadamant that he saw what he saw,\u201d even years later.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what it was, but it most certainly wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d the Dispatch wrote. \u201cAnd several other people saw it and were startled by it, too.\u201d\n\nPetrick also stands by his story. He said he never read the conclusions of the Air Force, but he doesn\u2019t mind skepticism. Like Fisher, he knows what he saw.\n\n\u201cPeople believe in love,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cCan you prove it? Can you prove it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also quick to point out that his interest in the UFO comes from a place of scientific curiosity, not opportunity. It\u2019s the bird that got away.\n\nPetrick jokes about his father, whose experience with the unknown was a little different. Milton Petrick lived in rural New Jersey when Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of The Worlds\u201d went over the radio the night before Halloween in 1938. Milton and his buddies saw through the radio play\u2019s facade, but took it as a chance to improve the town.\n\n\u201cThey went down with their shotguns and rifles and shot the water tower, called the police and said, \u2018Yeah, we just killed a Martian,\u2019\u201d Petrick laughs. \u201cThey got their new water tower out of it.\u201d\n\nPetrick, though, isn\u2019t looking for a new water tower. He\u2019s just looking for answers. To this day, the 66-year-old scans the western sky almost daily, longing to see the UFO again. The uncertainty, though, is a sort of gift.\n\n\u201cEverybody has beliefs that they can't prove,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cWhich is actually a good thing, or life would be boring.\u201d\n\nWhile walking around the grounds of his old elementary school on a recent fall day, Petrick\u2019s voice rattled with a certain giddiness. He shuffled his feet along the sidewalk. Every time he found the perfect spot to recreate the memory, he\u2019d find an even better one a few inches over.\n\n\u201cNow it really hits home,\u201d Petrick said, aligning a triangle between the rightmost spire on the church steeple and the roof of the school.\n\nHe lingered in the neighborhood for about a half hour, in awe of the sky. Waiting, perhaps, for an answer to appear. The weather conditions were similar to those in 1967. The sky was clear and a seasonal chill lingered in the air.\n\nFor a moment, a plane flew overhead to the north. Petrick estimated it was about the same size as the UFO of 1967. The jet left contrails behind, but they faded after a few minutes.\n\nPetrick kept on looking, raising his hand to his forehead to block out the sun \u2014 a salute, of sorts, to the puzzling sky."

The app offers \"Nowcasting\" precipitation guesses, like \"Rain continuing for 2 hours\" or \"Light rain in 10 minutes.\"\n\nCredit: Kevin Purdy\n\nThe best feature, one seen on the version of Weather that shipped to the Pixel Tablet and Fold, is that you can rearrange the order of data shown on your weather screen. I moved the UV index, humidity, sunrise/sunset, and wind conditions as high as they could go on my setup. It's a trade-off, because the Weather app's data widgets are so big as to require scrolling to get the full picture of a day, and you can't move the AI summary or 10-day forecast off the top. But if you only need a few numbers and like a verbal summary, it's handy.\n\nSadly, if you're an allergy sufferer and you're not in the UK, Germany, France, or Italy, Google can't offer you any pollen data or forecasts. There is also, I am sad to say, no frog.\n\nGoogle's Weather app isn't faring so well with Play Store reviewers. Users are miffed that they can't see a location's weather without adding it to their saved locations list; that other Google apps, including the \"At a Glance\" app on every Pixel's default launcher, send you to the Google app's summary instead of this app; the look of the weather map; and, most of all, that it does not show up in some phones' app list, but only as a widget."

        "article_content": "OSHKOSH (NBC 26) \u2014 The Oshkosh Paranormal Society is a group of lifelong ghost enthusiasts who want to use their passion to help people. They\u2019ve carried out dozens of ghost investigations in the Oshkosh area.\n\n\n\nThose in the Oshkosh Paranormal Society have had a lifelong passion for ghosts\n\nThe group measures electricity and energy to communicate with spirits.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to help people find peace of mind with death.\n\nIngrid Lemke says her first encounter with a spirit was early in her childhood.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a preteen, I had seen a shadow figure, and it just really terrified me,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like it was hovering over me.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, Lemke says she has had a sort of \u201csixth sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in my day, they thought you were insane, so I only told my friends,\u201d she says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until her adulthood that Lemke would find a large group of like-minded people and create what is now the Oshkosh Paranormal Society.\n\nLemke says it was validating finding others with a similar connection to ghosts and spirits.\n\n\u201cIt feels wonderful, it feels freeing,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society started as a group of Lemke and her coworkers, but now is a large Facebook group.\n\nMany in the group also had paranormal experiences as children.\n\n\u201cI think I was about eight,\u201d Emily Kampmann, a member of the group, says. \u201cI kind of woke up on the floor one day in my bedroom, and I was staring at my closet\u2026. and the door was wide open and there was glowing lights, like eyeballs staring at me. I know it sounds silly.\u201d\n\nThe group gets together to do paranormal investigations in haunted areas around Oshkosh. They\u2019ve investigated the local cemetery, The Grand Oshkosh, the Algoma Club and multiple personal homes.\n\nLemke says the downtown area near the Algoma Club and the Grand Oshkosh seem to be particularly haunted, which she believes is due to Oshkosh\u2019s two 19th century fires.\n\n\u201cOur investigations are generally scientific,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe group relies on different types of instruments and tools to pick up on energy shifts in the air. Some of the tools are used by electricians to track electricity.\n\n\u201cSo the theory is that spirits are energy, so when they get close to that, it triggers it,\u201d Jason Tiffany, a member of the group, says.\n\nThey also use recording devices to pick up on voices they wouldn\u2019t normally hear.\n\nLemke says they find a lot of evidence after the investigation ends and they\u2019re able to rewatch the footage.\n\n\u201cIt takes many hours,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe Algoma Club in Oshkosh was a speakeasy during prohibition, and Lemke says they\u2019ve found lots of evidence of prohibition-era spirits roaming the space.\n\n\"It's definitely a heavy presence,\" Lilly Heft, another member of the group says of the Algoma Club. \"I feel spooky in here.\"\n\nDespite the many hours that go into each investigation, the group says they are always fun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s an adrenaline rush, but it kind of is,\u201d Heft says.\n\nHeft says she\u2019s a \u201chardcore believer\u201d in ghosts, but that\u2019s not true for everyone in the group.\n\n\u201cIf you hear a voice, you know, understanding that, is that your brain just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on?\" Stephanie Whittaker, another member of the group says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just, well for me anyways, you can\u2019t just let your imagination run away with you.\u201d\n\nWhittaker says she\u2019s a \u201cskeptic,\u201d and often questions the evidence the group collects. Still, there are some findings that she says are hard to deny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve, with the group, had enough experiences that I can\u2019t explain,\u201d she says.\n\nMore than the thrill of finding ghosts, the Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to use its passion to help people.\n\n\u201cMy favorite aspect of our group is when we help people in their personal houses,\u201d Lemke says. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve felt like I did when I was a kid\u2014 who do I reach out to? Who do I trust with this? I know how that feels not having any validation.\u201d\n\nLemke says she\u2019s helped expel angry spirits from homes, as well as give people the confirmation that they\u2019re not imagining things.\n\nFor Kampmann, she thinks the group can help on a deeper level\u2014 giving comfort around death.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really neat to experiment with that and show people that there is life after death in some form, to not be like somewhat scared of death even,\u201d she says.\n\nMore information on the group can be found on their Facebook page.\n\n"

        "article_content": "SALEM, Ohio \u2014 In between the cracks of Gothic buildings and rusty swing carousels lies a dark past, one that the West Virginia Department of Tourism\u2019s Paranormal Trail seeks to uncover.\n\nLaunched on Oct. 1, the Paranormal Trail is a digital passport that rewards individuals for visiting West Virginia\u2019s reportedly most haunted locations through a tier system of prizes. In its first two weeks alone, the trail saw over 5,000 sign-ups.\n\nOn a larger scale, the trail takes visitors on a tour of the state, exposing its rich history and that not everything is as it seems.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to experience something different at everyone you go to,\u201d said Michelle Graham, filming and events manager for Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. \u201cYou can learn so much about things that are unexplained by the people who spend so much time in these buildings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee\n\nBeneath the soil of Lake Shawnee abandoned amusement park lies thousands of years of history. It starts with the Native American Shawnee tribe which occupied West Virginia for nearly 2,000 years before the United States government told them to assimilate or leave in 1831.\n\nOne of the most notable Shawnee leaders was Chief Cornstalk, originally named Hokleskwa, which translates loosely to \u201cstalk of corn.\u201d He was the leader of the Shawnee nation between 1720-1777.\n\nCornstalk was murdered by American militiamen while on a diplomatic visit in November 1777, during the American Revolutionary War. His death furthered tensions between the two groups.\n\nAround the same time, the first English settlers in Mercer County, the Clay family, moved to what is now known as the Lake Shawnee property in 1775. Mitchell and Phoebe Clay had 16 children, but three of them would be massacred by the Shawnee tribe in 1783.\n\nViolent deaths continued to plague the property after Conley T. Snidow turned it into an amusement park, which opened in 1926. Six children were killed in accidents at Lake Shawnee Amusement Park between 1926 and 1967, when the park finally closed.\n\nThe park was reopened by former employee Gaylord White in 1987 but would only operate as an amusement park for two years before closing again.\n\nAt a crossroads with what to do, Gaylord and his son, Chris White, the current owner of Lake Shawnee, decided to turn the property into a mud bog in 1989 \u2014 but they would uncover something much more valuable than dirt.\n\nWhile bulldozing the empty field in 1990, they started finding arrowheads and pieces of pottery. Gaylord immediately stopped and called Marshall University archaeologists to inspect the land. The team would uncover loads of Native American artifacts between 1990-1991, as well as a Shawnee burial ground.\n\nToday, the site pays homage to the Shawnee tribe where artifacts are on display. Additionally, Chris White provides a brief history on the Shawnee tribe. Someday, he hopes to create a small Native American museum on-site.\n\nThe abandoned amusement park also honors the other deaths that occurred on site, including the Clay family and the children who died while the amusement park was in operation.\n\nOver the years, visitors have left offerings to the Native Americans or the children like handcrafted items, stuffed animals, pinwheels and various toys.\n\n\u201cWe ask anybody that comes to bring an offering, and the offering doesn\u2019t need to be valuable,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cIt\u2019s better if it means something to you.\u201d\n\n1 of 19\n\nNumerous TV shows and paranormal investigators have also visited the site to film and experience the ghosts of the park\u2019s past. Many claim the spirits of the children who died at the park remain there today.\n\nSince taking part in the Paranormal Trail, Chris White has seen an increase in visitors at Lake Shawnee. He hopes more people continue visiting Lake Shawnee and the other sites on the Paranormal trail.\n\n\u201cVistors should come to Lake Shawnee because it\u2019s unique,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cYou will learn a lot about Native American history and their culture, the way they lived and the way they died. You can walk the creepy trail (where the Clay children died) and you can go around the park and take photos of the Ferris Wheel and swings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee, 470 Matoaka Road, Rock, West Virginia, offers daytime tours and overnight stays by appointment only. For more information, call or text 304-921-1580, or visit www.wvlakeshawnee.com.\n\nTrans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum\n\nLurking in the halls of the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum are decades\u2019 worth of memories that are both tragic and pleasant in equal measure.\n\n\u201cWe ran the entire gamut of mental health treatment progression in the years that the asylum was in operation,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere was a lot of dark history there, but at the same time we want to highlight and showcase that this was somebody\u2019s home. There were people who cried when the asylum closed in 1994 because they\u2019d spent their entire lives here. We have just as much good as we have bad.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum began in 1858. The facility opened in 1864, although work on it would continue until 1881. It is the largest hand-cut stone masonry building in North America and is the second largest in the world, next to the Kremlin. The asylum was originally designed to provide care for 250 patients.\n\nIn the beginning, there weren\u2019t strong criteria for admitting patients, Graham said. However, over time, the asylum would start separating the patients based on needs within the wards of the asylum including violent females, violent males, tuberculosis and more.\n\nThe oldest section of the building is the Civil War section, which housed both Union and Confederate soldiers during the early days of operations.\n\nAt its peak in the 1950s, the asylum housed 2,400 patients. Treatments ranged from lobotomies, electroshock therapy and hydrotherapy in the early years to various forms of discussion-based therapy and antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs in the later years.\n\nEventually, with the evolution of modern-day healthcare, outpatient care became more common which is one of the contributing factors for the asylums closure in 1994. The asylum reopened as a tourist attraction in March 2008.\n\nToday, the asylum acts not only as one of the most unique pieces of architecture in the world but seeks to highlight the evolution of mental health care. Graham adds that the treatments of lobotomies and electroshock therapy given prior to the 1960s are often misinterpreted as acts of vengeance.\n\n\u201cThis was not just some horror place that that they were experimenting on patients,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThey 100% believed that it was the best medical practice that was going to help the patients that resided at the asylum at the time.\u201d\n\nThe Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, 50 S River Ave., Weston, West Virginia, is part of West Virginia\u2019s Paranormal Trail and has many tours available, including the history tour, discover the asylum tour, photography tours, ghost tours and more. Reservations are required for some of the tours. For more information, visit trans-alleghenylunaticasylum.com.\n\nParanormal Trail\n\nThe trail includes 18 haunted stops across West Virginia. To join the journey, interested parties need to register to receive a link that opens up a personal digital passport.\n\nVisitors will click the check-in button, upon visiting a location, which earns them prizes the more locations they visit. At three locations, participants get a Paranormal Trail sticker, at 10 they get a Paranormal Trail beanie and by visiting all 18 they get a limited edition Paranormal Trail print designed by West Virginia artist Liz Pavlovic.\n\nThe challenge lasts until the end of the year. However, if it proves to be popular, the West Virginia Department of Tourism may extend it to next year.\n\nSites on the Paranormal Trail include:\n\nMothman Museum; Point Pleasant, West Virginia; www.mothmanmuseum.com\n\nWest Virginia Penitentiary; Moundsville, West Virginia; wvpentours.com\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel; Parkersburg, West Virginia; theblennerhassett.com\n\nGhost Tour of Harpers Ferry; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; www.harpersferryghost.20m.com\n\nHotel Morgan; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.hotelmorgan.com\n\nFlatwoods Monster Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; braxtonwv.org/the-flatwoods-monster/visit-the-museum\n\nThe Old Hospital on College Hill; Williamson, West Virginia; www.collegehillhospital.com\n\nThe Historic Glen Ferris Inn; Glen Ferris, West Virginia; www.glenferrisinn.com/home-9866\n\nShepherdstown Mystery Walk; Shepherdstown, West Virginia; shepherdstownmysterywalks.com\n\nThe Haunted Haymond; Sutton, West Virginia; www.facebook.com/thehaymondhousehaunted\n\nFlinderation Tunnel, Salem, West Virginia\n\nBigfoot Statue (Elk River Trail); Ivydale, West Virginia; www.elkrivertrail.org/rail-trailheads/06\n\nWest Virginia Bigfoot Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; wvbigfootmuseum.org\n\nSilver Run Tunnel (North Bend Rail Trail); Cairo, West Virginia; wvstateparks.com/park/north-bend-rail-trail\n\nCryptid Mountain Miniature Golf; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.cryptidmountainminigolf.com\n\nHempfield Tunnel (Wheeling Heritage Trail); Wheeling, West Virginia; www.wheelingwv.gov/directory/Parks-Recreation/heritage-trail\n\nFor more information, visit wvtourism.com/west-virginia-paranormal-trail.\n\n(Liz Partsch can be reached at epartsch@farmanddairy.com or 330-337-3419.)"

He\u2019ll be matched against Will Anderson Jr., one of the league\u2019s most exciting pass-rushers, totaling 7.5 this season.\n\nI like his chances to notch another sack on Thursday (-110 on Fanatics). Anderson\u2018s athleticism and the Texans\u2019 aggressive pass rush should put pressure on Rodgers and create opportunities for the star defensive end to make a big play."
