Lee said Andrews half expected her Majesty to get out of the car, only to find out it was actually her chief scientific advisor.\n\nRetired CID officer John Hanson, who is a UFO researcher and author said there was \u2018undoubtedly\u2019 a link between crop circles and UFOs.\n\nHe said: \u201cParticularly the early crop circles were just circular, burnt formations in the grass or in the fields. I think they described them as UFO nests back in the olden days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to witnesses who have more or less seen these things appear and then gone over and then ended up with some quite terrifying experiences.\u201d\n\nThe doc also claims that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were hugely interested in the Rendlesham UFO case from 1980 - which has been dubbed the British Roswell.\n\nThe case allegedly saw a UFO land in the forest at Rendlesham over Christmas weekend in 1980. Numerous airforce personnel, from nearby RAF Bentwaters, which was a US NATO base at the time, went to investigate and saw strange orbs and beams of light shining through the forest.\n\nThe film also investigates wild claims that, the then, Prince Charles piloted an experimental UFO type craft in 1975, and explores what he can do now as King to aid UFO disclosure.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhat I wanted to show in this film is how passionate and serious the senior royals were on the subject of UFOs. They had to keep this mostly a secret because of possible ridicule but if such high standing, balanced people, took them seriously why can\u2019t we?\n\n\u201cThere is something that pilots and police officers are seeing in the skies that can\u2019t be explained so why can\u2019t the British government take them seriously?\u201d\n\nJoin the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

He added: \u201cHere is somebody who could pick up the phone and say look here what\u2019s going on in the United States. He could ask for a full classified briefing.\u201d\n\nThe film includes footage from John Hanson, taken in 2000, of the alleged UFO sighting Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk.\n\nThe \u2018sighting\u2019 became known as the British Roswell - in reference to the 1947 crash of a United States Army Air Forces balloon near Roswell, New Mexico which birthed a conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nLee claims Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, was the first member of the Royal Family to have a UFO experience in around 1875. Lee said: \u201cHe wrote an entry in his journal saying he saw strange, dazzling lights in the sky, like orbs flying past and he couldn\u2019t describe them. It was powerful enough for him to make an entry in his diary and the basis of modern, royal UFOlogy.\u201d\n\nLee said Lord Mountbatten, Prince Phillip\u2019s uncle had a passion for UFO\u2019s. Nick Pope, a retired member of the Ministry of Defence, also claims the Royals have been interested in UFO\u2019s for decades.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut this was always a matter of extreme sensitivity because in some ways it was counter to the government\u2019s public position on this. Or if not directly counter to it, certainly difficult to gel with it.\n\n\u201cPrince Phillip was very much at the forefront of Royal interest in this, though arguably he was introduced to that subject by Lord Mountbatten.\u201d\n\nThe film also looks at the story that the the Prince Charles flew a prototype UFO in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1975. Lee said: \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t extra terrestrial, it was a saucer shaped craft. But the funny thing is it has some strange magnetic propulsion system which was unknown.\u201d\n\nThe craft was said to have emitted a blue ionic flame and was controlled magnetically by a larger craft behind it.\n\nBut the film does acknowledge Prince William is not known to have had any UFO experiences.\n\nLee said: \u201cWhoever is King is going to have an important role to play on the world stage with disclosure being imminent that we are not alone.\u201d\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

        "article_content": "Polygon\u2019s Editor\u2019s Letter is a column from Editor-in-Chief Chris Plante that reflects on the video game and entertainment industries, their communities, and Polygon itself. New editions appear in the first week of each month.\n\nLast month, I wrote about how the endless stream of \u201ctoo many games\u201d has caused existential problems for game makers. This month, I\u2019ll focus on the other side of the equation: the audience. The people who play all of these new games. Or, as a recent survey tells us, the people who don\u2019t play them.\n\nAbundance should be a boon for the average video game fan. Unfettered competition pushes prices down, particularly on PC, where each month players can grab bundles containing dozens (sometimes hundreds) of games for less than $20. And even the fanciest, freshest games often get discounted within weeks of launch.\n\nBetter still, as creators seek untouched corners of the market, their target audiences can be more varied. Wish to build a cozy castle diorama? Want a hardcore SWAT simulator or an anime Stardew Valley-like? Crave an ode to Brazilian bootleg boomer shooters of the 1990s built on actual 1990s tech? If you have an itch, odds are it can be scratched.\n\nAnd yet, a diminutive portion of the overall gaming audience plays new games. According to a report from Newzoo, in 2023 players spent 77% of their playtime on games three years or older. Much of the time players spent on new games went to annualized franchises, like Call of Duty, Madden, and EA FC. A paltry 8% of overall playtime in 2023 went to new games not tied to big, yearly IP.\n\nIn 2024, when someone sits down to play a video game, they can either spend money on a promising but unknown new game, or they can choose from their massive backlog of owned games. Or, they might return to a live-service game like League of Legends or Fortnite that continues to provide a familiar dopamine surge week after week, year after year. To play a new game is to willingly take a risk in terms of one\u2019s money, time, and happiness.\n\nThus, we have 8% of total playtime going toward new games: a tiny slice of pie from which the thousands of developers each year fight for a bite. Ryan Rigney, gaming comms veteran and author of the illuminating Push to Talk newsletter, has been digging into this problem (and this unsettling data) for the past few weeks. I strongly recommend you read his piece \u201cAre Old Games Killing New Games?\u201d\n\nIn that newsletter, Rigney uses Arco, his personal favorite game of the year, which at the time of writing this piece has a modest 623 reviews on Steam, as an example of how a truly great game can fall through the cracks. The example hit me like a rock to the forehead. Despite Arco being one of my most anticipated games, despite receiving advance code from a publicist, despite having a weekly video game podcast that requires me to sample dozens of new games a year, I only now have gotten around to playing this game.\n\nAnd frankly, even with everything going for it, Arco could have just as easily collected dust indefinitely on my exponentially elongating to-do list.\n\nHow to enjoy new video games in the Age of Abundance\n\nSlackers - Carts of Glory is one of the many great games of 2024 that you\u2019ve likely never played. Image: Falling Saints\n\nWhat does this mean for you? As the headline promised (or threatened?), you too won\u2019t play many of 2024\u2019s best games. Time is against you. The number of hours can\u2019t fit the surplus of great new releases.\n\nAssuming we all accept that to be true, I thought it might help if I shared some strategies I\u2019ve learned over the years for making the most of my video game time. As someone professionally expected to have a grasp on the vast majority of video games released, plus the entirety of gaming history, I\u2019ve been wrestling with this challenge for some time.\n\nBe mindful of where your gaming time goes: This is my number one tip when people ask me how I play so many games. The answer is that I play the stuff I like, and I skip or bail on the stuff I don\u2019t. For the past decade, major video game publishers have worked tirelessly to create \u201cforever\u201d games that use habit-forming hooks to lock in players indefinitely. If you want to play the same game every day for years on end, that\u2019s fine and your prerogative! Alternatively, if you want to play new games more, then take a break from your \u201cforever\u201d game of choice. You might find, with some distance, it had become a chore rather than a treat.\n\nWatch streams and playthroughs: Ashley Bardhan recently argued that watching a video game isn\u2019t so different from playing it. I agree. This guidance won\u2019t surprise anyone under the age of 30. But many gamers in the millennial demographic (or older) have yet to make a habit of watching streams on Twitch or playthroughs on YouTube. If this is your first time, search for a playthrough of a new game that interests you on YouTube, skim the headlines and thumbnail images for a style that matches your own, and give it a try!\n\nFind communities that match your pace: Similar to watching games, reading about games is a great way to follow games. Just be sure to find a community that moves at your tempo. If you want a trillion messages and the latest info, a game\u2019s official or unofficial Discord can be great. Want the highlights, try a subreddit. And if you prefer to keep up to date on the games community as a whole, rather than one game, I recommend Polygon.com. Naturally.\n\nAccept that you can\u2019t know everything: For the first few decades of video game culture, the most hardcore gamers took pride in having an encyclopedic knowledge of the industry. Not only had they played every game, but they also knew its developer, publisher, and \u2014 if it came from Japan \u2014 the original title and release date. Because game developers of the \u201980s and \u201990s only released so many games, exhaustive knowledge could be cultivated. The NES had 1,377 games. But then the PS4 had 3,399 games. Steam laps both those numbers each year. In 2024, acquiring an all-encompassing knowledge of video games isn\u2019t possible. And the pursuit of it is like trying to catch every fish in the ocean.\n\nImage: Mossmouth via Polygon\n\nBefore I wrap, let\u2019s talk about one more game.\n\nLast month, developer Mossmouth published what Game File author Stephen Totilo wrote \u201cmight be the most 2024 game anyone can play this year.\u201d If you can even call it a game. UFO 50 is a package carrying 50 stand-alone, complete games from some of the most brilliant game designers alive.\n\nUFO 50\u2019s a masterpiece and the vast majority of gamers will never play it. A tiny fraction of those who do will manage to play all 50 games. And an infinitesimal percentage of the people on Earth will finish the game in its entirety.\n\nThe project is a microcosm of the problem that faces players. With so many good games in UFO 50, its players must approach the game as they would the entire video game ecosystem. Be mindful of your time and your priorities. Dabble! Don\u2019t like a game? Drop it! Be comfortable knowing you don\u2019t have to play all 50 games to completion to enjoy UFO 50. In fact, you don\u2019t have to play any of them.\n\nWeeks after its release, fans have come together to solve its mysteries and celebrate their favorite games within the game on Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube. They\u2019ve created lore explainers, role-played within its fictional history, and carried the experience of the game beyond the confines of the software."

Learn More\n\nAs the generative AI continues to progress, having a simple chatbot may no longer be enough for many enterprises.\n\nCloud hyperscalers are racing to build up their databases and tools to help enterprises deploy operational data quickly and efficiently, letting them build applications that are both intelligent and contextually aware.\n\nCase in point: Google Cloud\u2019s recent barrage of updates for multiple database offerings, starting with AlloyDB.\n\nAccording to a blog post from the company, the fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible database now supports ScaNN (scalable nearest neighbor) vector index in general availability. The technology powers its Search and YouTube services and paves the way for faster index creation and vector queries while consuming far less memory.\n\nIn addition, the company also announced a partnership with Aiven for the managed deployment of AlloyDB as well as updates for Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase.\n\nUnderstanding the value of ScaNN for AlloyDB\n\nVector databases are critical to power advanced AI workloads, right from RAG chatbots to recommender systems.\n\nAt the heart of these systems sit key capabilities like storing and managing vector embeddings (numerical representation of data) and conducting similarity searches needed for the targeted applications.\n\nAs most developers in the world prefer PostgreSQL as the go-to operational database, its extension for vector search, pgvector, has become highly popular. Google Cloud already supports it on AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, with a state-of-the-art graph-based algorithm called Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) handling vector jobs.\n\nHowever, on occasions where the vector workload is too large, the performance of the algorithm may decline, leading to application latencies and high memory usage.\n\nTo address this, Google Cloud is making ScaNN vector index in AlloyDB generally available. This new index uses the same technology that powers Google Search and YouTube to deliver up to four times faster vector queries and up to eight-fold faster index build times, with a 3-4x smaller memory footprint than the HNSW index in standard PostgreSQL.\n\n\u201cThe ScaNN index is the first PostgreSQL-compatible index that can scale to support more than one billion vectors while maintaining state-of-the-art query performance \u2014 enabling high-performance workloads for every enterprise,\u201d Andi Gutmans, the GM and VP of engineering for Databases at Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGutmans also announced a partnership with Aiven to make AlloyDB Omni, the downloadable edition of AlloyDB, available as a managed service that runs anywhere, including on-premises or on the cloud.\n\n\u201cYou can now run transactional, analytical, and vector workloads across clouds on a single platform, and easily get started building gen AI applications, also on any cloud. This is the first partnership that adds an administration and management layer for AlloyDB Omni,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase?\n\nIn addition to AlloyDB, Google Cloud announced enhancements for Memorystore for Valkey, the fully managed cluster for the Valkey in-memory database, and the Firebase application development platform.\n\nFor the Valkey offering, the company said it is adding vector search capabilities. Gutmans noted that a single Memorystore for Valkey instance can now perform similarity search at single-digit millisecond latency on over a billion vectors, with more than 99% recall.\n\nHe also added that the next version of Memorystore for Valkey, 8.0, is now in public preview with 2x faster querying speed as compared to Memorystore for Redist Cluster, a new replication scheme, networking enhancements and detailed visibility into performance and resource usage.\n\nAs for Firebase, Google Cloud is adding Data Connect, a new backend-as-a-service that will be integrated with a fully managed PostgreSQL database powered by Cloud SQL. It will go into public preview later this year.\n\nWith these developments, Google Cloud hopes developers will have a broader selection of infrastructure and database capabilities \u2014 along with powerful language models \u2013 to build intelligent applications for their organizations. It remains to be seen how these new advancements are deployed to real use cases, but the general trend indicates the volume of gen AI applications is expected to soar significantly.\n\nOmdia estimates that the market for generative AI applications will grow from $6.2 billion in 2023 to $58.5 billion in 2028, marking a CAGR of 56%."

If it works as intended, it could be the first true cross-phone AI integration.\n\nIn a blog post, Google offered a rough time frame for when we\u2019ll be able to integrate Gemini with different Workspace apps like Google Keep, Google Calendar, Tasks, and Utilities. Currently, Gemini can work with Gmail, Maps, and YouTube. The general concept is that, at users\u2019 request, the AI will be able to pull information from one app to the other without users needing to scroll to find the information they\u2019re looking for.\n\nAs an example, the Mountain View tech giant said users should be able to pull a recipe from Gmail and then add the ingredients into a note in Keep. It will also work with your phone\u2019s camera, and if users take a photo of a receipt or concert ticket, you should be able to set it as an event or reminder in Calendar.\n\nThese features should be dropping in the next few weeks, so we shouldn\u2019t have to wait too long before we try Google\u2019s Geminification of our phones for ourselves. The Gemini app has already taken over most of Assistant\u2019s former duties, and earlier this week, Google gave every Android phone access to Gemini Live. This feature lets you have a conversation with your phone in a more natural way than the base Gemini, which still works better with short and sweet commands.\n\nGoogle showcased some of these features at its big August showcase, revealing the new Pixel 9 series alongside new watches and Pixel Buds. Apple has promised very similar capabilities with its still-incoming Apple Intelligence. So far, we haven\u2019t had the chance to test either company\u2019s full mobile AI integrations. The idea seems sound, but knowing how finicky and inconsistent AI can be, we\u2019re not exactly holding our breath for a real mobile ecosystem sea change.\n\nI may have far less use for a conversational AI than I would for an assistant who can uproot the important emails from my flooded inbox. On Wednesday, Google said it was updating Gmail\u2019s \u201csummary cards\u201d and \u201cHappening soon\u201d features. Happening soon should show the most timely updates, such as deliveries or events happening, based on your emails.\n\nSummary cards now show more information right at the top of each email for purchases, events, bills, and travel registrations. You can add events to your calendar, just like before. But now you can also modify your bookings or get directions to an airport or venue.\n\nGoogle said Gemini was getting access to more than 40 languages other than English, eventually. First on the list are French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Hindi. The rest will come sometime in the future. Each phone\u2019s Gemini Live can support conversations with up to two languages at a time. Now even more people will be able to see their Android phone transform into an AI device. The cross-platform mobile AI does feel enticing, especially for those of us with too many things going on to remember where the hell you put that one email with the event registration. However, for those who prefer their phones to be AI-free and still get new features, you may need to bite the Gemini bullet."

        "article_content": "Paranormal investigators Sam Golbach and Colby Brock have already conjured YouTube success, scaring up more than 13 million subscribers on their popular channel. Now, the spirited duo is chasing another elusive goal: becoming movie stars.\n\nGolbach and Brock (\u201cSam and Colby\u201d to their fans) made their first foray into the theatrical space a year ago, when they releasing an episode of their series \u201cA Week at the Conjuring House\u201d in October 2023, two days before its YouTube premiere. That sneak was shown in 168 Cinemark theaters across the U.S.\n\n\u201cOver the last four or five years, we\u2019ve created feature-length videos for YouTube,\u201d Golbach tells Variety. \u201cWe approached Cinemark last year to see if we could put one of our YouTube videos into theaters to basically have a test project, like a proof of concept.\u201d\n\nAfter an immediate sell-out, they charted a course for their next project \u2014 and thought even bigger. The duo\u2019s new 97-minute film, \u201cSam and Colby: The Legends of the Paranormal,\u201d is heading exclusively to theaters, but this time on a much larger scale.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cWe went to Mount Wilson Ranch in Nevada, and we were in search of something completely different: cryptids, skinwalkers and aliens and ghosts as well,\u201d Brock says of the film. \u201cWe\u2019ve never stepped into that mythical realm or world with our fan base, and so it\u2019s gonna bring like, a whole new light to Sam and Colby and the adventure that we went on.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cThe Legends of the Paranormal\u201d was originally scheduled for a three-day limited window across 260 Cinemark screens, overwhelming fan demand prompted the movie chain to expand its release plans to 350 screens for a full-week schedule, beginning Oct. 3. \u201cAfter the first weekend of sales, they called us!\u201d Brock says. \u201cWe\u2019re so grateful.\u201d\n\nIf sales continue to impress, Golbach says Cinemark has shown interest in screening the film for the entire month of October.\n\nWhile Hollywood hasn\u2019t always taken YouTubers seriously in the film space, the duo say their built-in audience and ability to bridge the gap between film and online content puts them on the precipice of a major breakthrough for influencers. \u201cThis is the new form of entertainment, especially for younger audiences like Gen Z,\u201d Brock asserts.\n\nAdds Golbach: \u201cEveryone is set in their ways in traditional media, so they are just waiting to see what it\u2019s like for the YouTubers when we come through and do things like this theatrical release. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be until people like Colby and I do these releases over and over and over again, and have the same selling power that the traditional media has, that they will finally believe that YouTube\u2019s the real thing.\u201d\n\nWhile they got to celebrate their \u201cLegends of the Paranormal\u201d success with a splashy premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre, Golbach and Brock are already looking ahead for how they can up the ante next. \u201cThis is hopefully the very, very beginning of the journey,\u201d Golbach says. \u201cWe have already have talks of the 2025 movie.\u201d\n\nBrock hopes that, with time and elbow grease, films like theirs can become the new normal. \u201cGive it five or ten years, and then everybody will understand.\u201d\n\n"

However, the episode also acquaints them with various other professionals in the field of the paranormal and the unknown, such as Barry Fitzgerald. As he talks about his views on the subject, questions about his whereabouts arise in the minds of the viewers.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald\u2019s Expertise in the Field of Paranormal Has Allowed Him to Explore Other Avenues\n\nBorn in 1972 in the city of Lisburn in Northern Ireland, Barry Fitzgerald allegedly experienced supernatural occurrences in his early days, leading him to form an interest in the unknown. After completing his education, he reportedly worked at the Southern Education and Library Board as the warden. Given his affinity towards the paranormal, he got into the field of paranormal research and worked for a couple of paranormal groups in Northern Ireland. With more than thirty years of experience as a paranormal investigator, he has encountered all kinds of cases, including ancient tombs, myths, hidden spiritual doorways, and legends.\n\nMoreover, Barry has been featured on several TV shows over the years, including \u2018Destination Truth,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Hunters,\u2019 and SyFy\u2019s \u2018Ghost Hunters International.\u2019 In 2016, rumors about him disappearing during his search for a Neolithic doorway to another world were spread. However, he denied these to be true when he featured on the podcast \u2018Stirring the Cauldron.\u2019 Thanks to his expertise in the field, he started writing books based on the paranormal and the unknown, such as \u2018The Influence,\u2019 \u2018Banshee,\u2019 \u2018Searching the Sidhe,\u2019 and \u2018The Mist of Gods.\u2019 He has also co-authored a book with Brian Allan \u2014 \u2018The Deception Of Gods And Men.\u2019\n\nGiven his experience as a television personality, Barry co-hosts \u2018Project Doorway\u2019 with Steve Mera, another renowned paranormal investigator and a dear friend. When he is not busy with that, he spends his time researching new investigative techniques. In February 2024, he traveled to Albert Halls Bolton in Manchester to attend the Awakenings event, where the attendees discussed the dark side of ufology.\n\nBarry Fitzgerald and His Loving Wife Are Proud Dog Parents\n\nFrom what we can tell, Barry Fitzgerald knows how to strike a balance between his personal and professional life. He shares a great bond with his loving wife, Donna, and is committed to nurturing the fulfilling life they have built together in the quaint town of Sligo in the northern part of Ireland. The duo loves to venture on trips across the globe to feast their eyes on stunning landscapes and have amazing experiences. When they\u2019re back home, they often stop by their local pub to sip on a large glass of cold Guinness and share some laughs with friends. Even after so many years of being together, Donna and Barry still appear to be deeply in love with each other. They haven\u2019t welcomed any kids of their own into the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean their love for their furry babies isn\u2019t unconditional.\n\nAn avid animal lover and a dog dad, Barry went on multiple adventures with his snowy white baby, Max, for several years until his passing. The \u201cmystery legend seeker\u201d passed into the land of rainbows a few years ago, leaving a giant hole in the hearts of the pair. Though one can\u2019t truly move on from the loss of a dear one, in a post he shared in January 2024, Barry revealed that he has found a companion as precious as Max to accompany him on his adventures. Alongside an adorable picture of his furry baby, Barry wrote, \u201cMeena has crept into the hole left by Max, I\u2019ll be forever broken by his death but Meena is a ball of life and mischief to keep me distracted.\u201d The heartwarming caption is a testament to his love for Meena and how she has impacted his life.\n\nBarry\u2019s love for canines runs so deep that he doesn\u2019t hesitate to show up for them in any part of the world if needed. In fact, he flew to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in March 2024 to attend Pawtographs Parafest 5, a paranormal convention held by Pawtographs for Pooches to raise money for a local animal shelter. The paranormal investigator also has other hobbies, like cooking. Interestingly, exploring the realm of the paranormal to unearth new claims is not the only thing that sparks joy in Barry Fitzgerald\u2019s life. Aside from the purported elements of the unknown, nature\u2019s beautiful gifts also pique the interest of the paranormal investigator, and he regularly shares his findings with the world via his social media profiles. Joining him on his escapades in the peaceful embrace of nature is, of course, his baby, Meena.\n\nRead More: Steve Mera: Where is the Paranormal Specialist Now?"

The marine robotics company\u2019s trio of orange, 20-foot-long underwater robots found the historic vessel while mapping what is now the 1,286-square-mile Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary off the California coast. Also known as the \u201cGhost Ship of the Pacific,\u201d the 314-foot-long ship has spent the past 78 years resting roughly 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface, and appears to remain almost completely intact and upright.\n\nThe USS Stewart shipwreck as seen in a 3D map of the region. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\n\u201cThis level of preservation is exceptional for a vessel of its age and makes it potentially one of the best-preserved examples of a US Navy \u2018four-piper\u2019 destroyer known to exist,\u201d Maria Brown, superintendent for both Cordell Bank and Greater Farallones national marine sanctuaries, said in a statement to The New York Times on October 1.\n\nThe USS Stewart\u2019s story is unique in US maritime history, making it one of the most sought-after wrecks for decades. Initially sunk and abandoned after sustaining substantial battle damage, Japanese forces managed to raise the destroyer, repair it, and reenlist it against America as a naval convoy escort. During its second life, Allied pilots began recounting what appeared to be one of their own ships far within enemy territory, earning the Stewart its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker.\n\nThe shipwreck now serves as a home to deep sea ocean life like crabs and fish. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nThe US Navy recovered the Stewart following Japan\u2019s surrender and intended to tow it back to its original home. While en route, however, its engines gave out near Guam, forcing the fleet to tow it the rest of its journey. Once back in the US, the \u201cGhost Ship of the Pacific\u201d was given a dramatic burial at sea on May 24, 1946: Used as target practice for naval forces, it still took an estimated 2 hours of fire to finally sink it for good. But in the years since, the exact coordinates of its location were lost.\n\nThe USS Stewart, seen sinking during its final scuttling by the US Navy. Credit: US Navy / Ocean Infinity\n\nNumerous attempts were made in the past to find the USS Stewart, but the successful August search reportedly came about almost by accident. Ocean Infinity, which previously used its drones to help rediscover the USS Nevada and Endurance wrecks, originally wanted to simply test out multiple of its largest autonomous underwater robots simultaneously. That\u2019s when Russ Matthews, president of the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation nonprofit, suggested the drones be used to scan for the Ghost Ship after he found coordinates of the tugboat that pulled it out to the area of its final scuttling. While it usually takes weeks to map out 37-square-nautical-miles of ocean floor, the drones managed to find the Stewart in a few hours.\n\n[Related: The famous railing from \u2018Titanic\u2019 has broken off from Titanic.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of, I think, a radical change in ocean discovery,\u201d Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH, Inc, a maritime archeology firm also involved in the project, told The New York Times on Tuesday.\n\nAside from long-lost shipwrecks, autonomous mapping drones can be used to identify promising ocean floor space for the construction of wind farms, as well as chart routes for underwater cabling."

The vast majority of yachts rely on dirty energy for power and to supply the massive amounts of electricity they consume. Some superyachts, The Guardian reported, emit more planet-overheating air pollution per year by themselves than many small countries.\n\nSocial scientist Gregory Salle labeled superyachts a form of \"ecocide\" in his book, Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Superyachts, Salle wrote, display, \"the capacity of the wealthiest individuals to exonerate themselves from the social and environmental cost of their activities and behaviours.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the yacht that took Maroni to Svalbard was not a superyacht but a regular yacht, meaning that it merely creates a large amount of planet-overheating air pollution instead of a mind-boggling amount of planet-overheating air pollution.\n\nThe positive to take away from the story is that more ocean research can be used to better protect our oceans \u2014 largely from the threats caused by the very pollution that yachts create every day.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

Gulotta now focuses her work on the anxieties women in their 30s and 40s face around their fertility because she's been there \u2014 and feels like a lot of the burden falls on women to start conversations around kids.\n\nShe assumed her relationship would lead to marriage and kids\n\nGulotta started dating a close friend in her mid-20s. Due to their strong bond and long history, she thought the relationship would naturally lead to marriage and kids. \"We'd never gotten to a place where we were talking about timelines or rings, but we had definitely planned a life together,\" she said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut things unraveled when he needed to financially and emotionally support a family member. \"That was really the priority, and I didn't see where I was going to fit into that,\" she said. They broke up when she was 30.\n\nShe wishes she was more upfront about kids when dating\n\nAfter the breakup, Gulotta started dating again, but it took time to figure out what she was looking for \u2014 and how to ask for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe recalls trying to be a \"cool girl,\" worrying that she would sound too demanding if she brought up kids early into dating. As a result, she ended up dating emotionally unavailable people who weren't capable of discussing the future.\n\n\"If I were to go back and be dating in my 30s, I would get really clear on what I wanted,\" she said. From her work as a therapist, she said she's seen so many cases \"where you're even further into your 30s, and you end a six-year relationship, and then what? You're starting all over.\"\n\nBeing upfront, she said, makes it easier to avoid regret later on. When she met Rob, her current partner, she felt more urgency around her timeline for having kids. She was 34 and wanted certainty about her future. Rob wanted kids, too.\n\nBut there was a snag: Rob didn't want to start a family as soon as she did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was willing to break up over kids\n\nGulotta said it was difficult not to be aligned on when they wanted kids.\n\n\"I was 37, 38, having these conversations where he's not sure, and I'm like,' I don't have much more time for you to continue to be unsure,'\" she said. \"As much as I tried to explain it to him, I don't think he understood: I was up against a clock.\"\n\nShe froze her eggs at 37 to strengthen her sense of security. This decision also sparked \"a lot of really hard conversations\" about when to have kids.\n\nShe didn't want to walk away from the relationship. But she was also willing to break up, thinking about what she would need to do if she moved out of New York and had a baby on her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, she gave birth to her son at 40. Looking back, Gulotta said everything worked out.\n\n\"It's deeply emotional, but you have to have these conversations because it's your life,\" she said. \"It's the timeline that feels good for you.\"\n\nPlus, being able to broach these topics says a lot about your partner, she said. If your partner is avoidant, it signifies bigger issues.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it should be two adult mature people making life decisions,\" she said."
