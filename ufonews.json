        "article_content": "Ominous images of a perfectly spherical UFO, seemingly dotted with yellow 'landing lights,' have left some researchers certain one is 'the first selfie with a UFO in history.'\n\nTaken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011, the snaps show the apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n,' a chilly waterfall in Brazil's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina National Park.\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.'\n\nAnd by Meireles' own account, his sighting in one of South America's most scenic ecological preserves led to a raid on his home by 'soldiers in camouflage and black.'\n\nPhotos, taken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011 (pictured), show the an ominous apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' - a chilly waterfall in the South American nation's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nIn a recent, March 2022 post to the group UFOs Bahai on Facebook, Meireles boasted that his candid snap was 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.' Above, a second and less clear 'UFO selfie' from Meireles' alleged encounter with a flying orb in Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.' Above, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nSkeptics on social media, however, have alleged that the photos are everything from 'sky lanterns' held aloft by hot air from candles to outright doctored images.\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to Meireles for further comment \u2014 but the researcher, who serves as admin for 'el Grupo de Pesquisa Tecnol\u00f3gica Extra Avan\u00e7ada' ('the Extra-Advanced Technology Research Group') on Facebook has not replied.\n\nBut, in a March 2022 post, Meireles boasted that his candid snaps were 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.'\n\nAnd, in a submission to Brazilian nonprofit Museu da Pessoa (Museum of the Person) the UFO researcher recounted his trips back to the national park for repeated, but less-well-documented, encounters with these UFOs and their occupants.\n\nThose expeditions, documented in his book Fieldworkers: Pesquisadores de Campo in 2016, according to Meireles, led to further unwanted encounters with the military.\n\n'The result of the interrogation was [...] Fractures: 4 left ribs and left knee [...] Perforation with bleeding in the left lung,' and worse, Meireles told the nonprofit.\n\n'I was hospitalized for 12 days at the Chapada Regional Hospital, in Seabra-Ba, my medical history is there for anyone who wants to investigate,' according to the Brazilian UFO researcher.\n\nMeireles' version of his UFO experiences at the national park, includes more surreal encounters with beings and a prophecy of global environmental cataclysm: 'a natural collapse, with a lack of renewable resources, drinking water, and wood for construction,' as he told the nonprofit museum.\n\nFact or fiction, his story has a fitting setting in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park, established in September 1985 to protect a host of rare, endangered species native to these Atlantic Forest plateaus 3,000 feet about sea level.\n\nBrazil's giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), its giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) are all protected species that call the park home.\n\nAbove, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, lateral blur on the apparent craft appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another photo alleged to be from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, another image of lateral blur on the apparent 'alien spacecraft' - which appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter\n\nOne account of the 2011 sighting, attributed to Meireles, described a UFO whose onboard devices or novel means of propulsion managed to either accidentally or intentionally leave him stranded in the park.\n\n'I got out of the car and photographed,' according to a Reddit posting quoting Meireles. 'It was an indescribable wonderful emotion to have photographed a UFO so clearly visible.'\n\nBut, the account continues: 'About 40 minutes later, still on the road, my car turned off, I braked, I tried to turn the key and nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n'I saw a light on the hood and I looked up and there was a UFO standing on top of my car, I opened the door and ran,' the account continues.\n\n'I even stopped to take a Selfie with them. My car was towed by a tractor the next day, it burned all electrical parts.'\n\nThis version of his encounter states that Meireles was travelling to the historic district near the national park, Serra de Igat\u00fa, although a 2016 posting apparently by Meireles on Facebook asserts the images were taken on his was to the waterfall at the park known as 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n.'\n\nAbove, 'Mosquito Waterfall,' one of many waterfalls like the 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' from Meireles' UFO encounter, visited by tourists of Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAbove, a final known image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter, this time with less fog or low-lying cloud cover along the trail in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAn aerial view of Chapada Diamantina National Park in Bahia state, Brazil\n\nAbove, tourists admire the 'Poco Encantado' (aka 'the Enchanted Well') a sunken, subterranean pool and tourist destination at Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nSome champions of Meireles' UFO research have attributed the murky stories around his incredibly crisp and visually compelling photographs to the alleged hostile encounters with the military.\n\nH\u00e9lio Nunes de Camargo, the self-decribed founder of UFOs na Chapada \u2013 Centro Ufol\u00f3gico da Chapada Diamantina, wrote that Meireles' UFOs Bahai research group disbanded over the alleged military harassments and violence.\n\n'They are leaving UFOlogy to live their own lives away from threats and intrigues,' Nunes de Camargo wrote in a 2014 post to his group's Facebook page.\n\nThe UFO researcher recounted the deaths and abductions that UFOs Bahai is alleged to have faced, adding: 'They told me that families are suffering a lot and they don't want to make other families suffer.'\n\nOther UFO researchers online, however, have had trouble with this explanation.\n\n'The fact that he's [Meireles] still uploading those photos to his Facebook account every few months proves that might not be correct,' Reddit user spriz2 opined.\n\n'I've written to Edie multiple times on Facebook over the last year to try and gain more knowledge on this event,' the Redditer explained. 'He's ignored every message and comment.'\n\nOthers, however, not only found the case credible but believed they had seen this same UFO themselves.\n\n'Holy F***, this is identical to what I saw right before Covid hit,' one Redditer, who goes by ehtseeoh, said.\n\nThe poster said that the bottom of the craft he saw 'rotated when it glowed red with an orange center, and then it did a quick zig zag and it was gone,' making 'zero sound' as it vanished in an instant.\n\n'I screamed laughed and cried,' the poster said. 'FINALLY the orb I've been looking for online, this guy has a selfie with it haha.'\n\nDailyMail.com also reached out to noted UFO skeptic and computer programmer Mick West of Sacramento, California, who weighed-in saying: 'They look photoshopped to me, but could be practical effects.'\n\nThe prolific, skeptically minded, UFO researcher and former video game designer noted that UFO cases like this, with limited information like static images and inconsistent eye-witness testimony, should always be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n'In cases like this we need actual evidence that the photos are NOT fake before attempting to explain them,' West told DailyMail.com via email."

        "article_content": "The opportunity arose for Swallow after a chance meeting with Gerry's son Jamie Anderson, now head of his late father's company Anderson Entertainment \u2013 with the two men sharing an agent, Swallow arranged a meeting with Jamie to express his enthusiasm for Gerry's works.\n\nThe conversation eventually turned to the idea of crafting new stories set within the timeline of the original shows, with Swallow keen to explore the worlds of UFO and Space: 1999, two series which had \"the strongest impact\" on him in the early 1970s.\n\n\"Jamie came back to me and said, 'We've got this idea about doing these novellas \u2013 would you like to take a crack at it?'\" Swallow recalls. \"I pretty much bit his hand off.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"It's been a lot of fun for me \u2013 It gave me a great excuse to go back and rewatch the shows and kind of steep myself in them again. I tried very hard to make sure that I wrote these new stories in the style of that early 1970s sci-fi.\n\n\"I wanted to make it feel like these two manuscripts had been lying in a box somewhere since 1972... so if you love these shows, you could watch the TV show and then pick up the book, and it would feel like a seamless experience.\"\n\nThe cast of Space: 1999. Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nFirst aired in 1970-71, UFO \u2013 the first wholly live-action show produced by the Andersons following the Supermarionation success of Thunderbirds, Stingray and others \u2013 followed the covert efforts of top-secret military agency SHADO to prevent an alien invasion of Earth.\n\nThough a second season never materialised, initial concepts for further episodes eventually formed for the basis for the next show on the slate: Space: 1999 (aired 1975-1977) saw the moon, and the 311 inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha, sent hurtling out of Earth's orbit towards the unknown dangers of the galaxy.\n\nSwallow's new efforts, he says, \"dovetail with the source material\", with the hope being that you \"feel like you're reading an episode of the TV show that never got made\".\n\n\"I tried to do a little more than maybe they could have done on the TV shows, so I've got a few elements in both books which would have blown the budget had it been the television episode,\" he adds. \"But I've got the best budget ever, which is my readers' imagination.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine sees Commander John Koenig (as played on television by Martin Landau) and the people of Moonbase Alpha face an uncertain fate when a planet-killing alien weapon at the heart of a sinister cloud diverts their lost moon on to a fatal trajectory, while UFO - Shadowplay see SHADO commander-in-chef Ed Straker (played by Ed Bishop in the series) awaken from a coma with missing memories and suffering from strange hallucinations that threaten his grip on reality.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn telling these stories, Swallow was allowed to \"play with somebody else's toys\", but knew he couldn't \"leave sticky fingerprints all over them\" \u2013 and that the continuity of the television shows imposed certain limitations.\n\n\"In terms keeping inside the canon, I think that's part and parcel of taking on one of these jobs,\" he explains.\n\n\"You're not going to break it. You're going to work inside the lines. And some people have said to me, you know, isn't that like a straightjacket for you? Isn\u2019t it an intellectually bereft way of writing? And I think the exact opposite is true.\n\n\"It's challenging to me working inside the box. My first thought is, how do I push at the edges of that box? How do I kind of work inside the lines but still deliver something that reveals something new about these characters while acting in respect to the core material?\"\n\nCould these two books be just the beginning of a range of new adventures? Swallow is certainly hopeful, and suggests there's a hunger among other authors to engage with the worlds of Gerry Anderson.\n\nUFO and Space: 1999 novellas. Anderson Entertainment\n\n\"I had an absolute blast doing this \u2013 sometimes working on these type of projects can be a real pain, if you're working with somebody who's watching every tiny little detail, but there was such great creative freedom here, and it was such a fun bunch of people to work with.\n\n\"I would love to do it again, and I've heard from friends of mine who are other writers who are saying, 'Oh, that's a great franchise, we\u2019d love to be part of that.' So I think there's a market for it, there's an audience for it, and there's definitely a love for these stories, so we could tell more.\"\n\nGiven that UFO and Space: 1999 are effectively sister series, albeit a shared continuity was never established between the shows on television, might a crossover story even be on the cards in future?\n\n\"I've always thought these two shows feel like they took place in the same world,\" says Swallow. \"If you look at the timeline of it, Ed Straker was running SHADO in 1980 and Moonbase Alpha\u2019s in 1999\u2026 maybe these guys knew each other?\n\n\"I think that would be fun, to explore the idea of finding some sort of way to connect them... because of course UFO\u2019s story was never brought to a conclusion. You had this ongoing sort of Cold War story with these alien invaders and the show finished after one season and we never found out... were they defeated? What happened? And then Space: 1999 rolls along, [set] a decade later...\n\n\"Well, did something happen between the point of those stories?

I think that would work, definitely. You could update that to the modern day and you wouldn't really need to change an awful lot.\"\n\nAs for Space: 1999, though he argues you'd need \"brush over the scientific elements that were maybe a bit wobbly in the show\" \u2013 chiefly a nuclear explosion blowing the moon out of Earth's orbit \u2013 he adds: \"The core concept about a group of people stranded in this satellite moving through space, who have no control where they're going, coming up against danger and meeting people, and finding a way to survive again... that's a compelling idea.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine and UFO - Shadow Play novellas are available to buy from gerryanderson.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out more of our Sci-Fi coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on.

Learn More\n\nMicrosoft has unveiled a groundbreaking benchmark called Windows Agent Arena (WAA) to test artificial intelligence agents in realistic Windows operating system environments. This new platform aims to accelerate the development of AI assistants capable of performing complex computer tasks across diverse applications.\n\nPublished on arXiv.org, the research addresses critical challenges in evaluating AI agent performance. \u201cLarge language models show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cHowever, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena in action: AI agents tackle diverse computer tasks, evaluated rapidly through Azure cloud technology. The system aims to advance human-computer interaction. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nWindows Agent Arena: A virtual playground for AI assistants\n\nWindows Agent Arena provides a reproducible testing ground where AI agents interact with common Windows applications, web browsers, and system tools, mirroring human user experiences. The platform includes over 150 diverse tasks spanning document editing, web browsing, coding, and system configuration.\n\nA key innovation of WAA is its ability to parallelize testing across multiple virtual machines in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud. \u201cOur benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes,\u201d the paper states. This dramatically accelerates the development cycle compared to traditional sequential testing that could take days.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena, a new benchmark for AI agents, simulates real-world Windows tasks across various applications. The platform allows for rapid testing and evaluation of AI assistants, potentially accelerating the development of more sophisticated human-computer interactions. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nNavi: Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent takes on human-level tasks\n\nTo showcase the platform\u2019s capabilities, Microsoft introduced a new multi-modal AI agent called Navi. In tests, Navi achieved a 19.5% success rate on WAA tasks, compared to a 74.5% success rate for unassisted humans. These results highlight both the progress made and the challenges that remain in developing AI that can match human capabilities in operating computers.\n\nRogerio Bonatti, lead author of the study, said, \u201cWindows Agent Arena provides a realistic and comprehensive environment for pushing the boundaries of AI agents. By making our benchmark open source, we hope to accelerate research in this critical area across the AI community.\u201d\n\nThe release of WAA comes amid intensifying competition among tech giants to develop more capable AI assistants that can automate complex computer tasks. Microsoft\u2019s focus on the Windows environment could give it an edge in enterprise scenarios, where Windows remains the dominant operating system.\n\nNavi, Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent, as it confronts a typical Windows task in the Windows Agent Arena: installing the Pylance extension in Visual Studio Code. This demonstrates how AI agents are being trained to navigate common software environments. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nBalancing innovation and ethics in AI agent development\n\nWhile the potential benefits of AI agents like Navi are significant, the development of such technologies raises important ethical considerations. As these agents become more sophisticated, they will have unprecedented access to users\u2019 digital lives, potentially interacting with sensitive personal and professional information across various applications.\n\nThe ability of AI agents to operate freely within a Windows environment \u2013 accessing files, sending emails, or modifying system settings \u2013 underscores the need for robust security measures and clear user consent protocols. There\u2019s a delicate balance to strike between empowering AI to assist users effectively and maintaining user privacy and control over their digital domains.\n\nMoreover, as AI agents become more capable of mimicking human-like interactions with computer systems, questions arise about transparency and accountability. Users may need to be clearly informed when they are interacting with an AI versus a human, especially in professional or high-stakes scenarios. The potential for AI agents to make consequential decisions or actions on behalf of users also raises liability concerns that will need to be addressed as the technology matures.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to open-source the Windows Agent Arena is a positive step towards collaborative development and scrutiny of these technologies. However, it also means that potentially less scrupulous actors could use the platform to develop AI agents with malicious intent, highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance and perhaps regulation in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nAs WAA accelerates the development of more capable AI agents, it will be crucial for researchers, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to engage in ongoing dialogue about the implications of these technologies. The benchmark not only measures technological progress but also serves as a reminder of the complex ethical landscape we must navigate as AI becomes an increasingly integral part of our digital lives."

But Apple hopes that what\u2019s underneath \u2014 new software that brings what it describes as artificial intelligence to the new phones \u2014 will convince people to upgrade.\n\nApple Intelligence, the company\u2019s new suite of AI services, automates tasks including image generation, rewriting emails and summarizing web articles.\n\nOnly the iPhone 16s or last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro can run the new software because older models are too slow to handle those tasks, according to the company.\n\nBut what if I told you there\u2019s another way to get the same perks?\n\nLong before Apple introduced Apple Intelligence at a software conference in June, many apps for automatically producing text and images had been widely available.\n\nRelying on a technology known as generative AI, which predicts what words and images belong together to write a catchy poem or generate a realistic-looking image of a cat on a windowsill, for instance, these types of services have been trendy for the last two years.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBy downloading a handful of apps, iPhone owners can get similar benefits and hold on to their older devices longer.\n\nAfter testing dozens of generative AI apps in the last year, here are my recommendations.\n\nSummarizing Text\n\nOne of Apple Intelligence\u2019s most anticipated features is its ability to take large blocks of text and distill the main points into a few sentences. This capability could be useful for summarizing a lengthy web article or lecture notes.\n\nBut there\u2019s already a popular tool for summarizing web articles: Arc Search, a free browser developed by a startup.\n\nTo test it, I loaded an 8,000-word feature from ProPublica about a chemist who blew the whistle on the manufacturer 3M. When I pinched the screen, the app generated a one-sentence overview of what the article was about, followed by three bullet points summing up the highlights. While the bullet points glossed over important details you would have gotten from reading the full article, I found the summary accurate.\n\nFor summarizing notes, the free web app Humata AI has become popular among academic researchers and lawyers. By visiting Humata.ai on a web browser, you can upload a document such as a PDF, and from there, you can type requests in a window to ask a chatbot to summarize the most important points. In response, the chatbot will show a digital copy of the PDF and highlight relevant portions of the text.\n\nWriting Tools\n\nApple Intelligence also includes tools to rewrite text \u2014 to make an email sound more professional, for instance. Lots of free apps can handle this task proficiently.\n\nThe most well known include the ChatGPT chatbot from OpenAI, along with rivals like Gemini from Google and Bing AI from Microsoft \u2014 all apps that can be downloaded in the App Store. Just paste text into the app and ask the chatbot to rewrite it in a different tone by typing, for instance, \u201cMake this email sound more personable for a client I\u2019ve known for many years.\u201d\n\nFor help with writing, I prefer a lesser-known tool called Wordtune, from the startup AI21 Labs. Its interface, accessible on wordtune.com, is designed like a word processor for composing and editing text. You can type in a paragraph and click on buttons to expand, shorten or rewrite sentences to sound more casual or formal; the app will show a list of rewritten sentences to choose from.\n\nImage Generation\n\nAnother of Apple Intelligence\u2019s hyped features is its ability to generate fun images, such as an emoji of yourself eating pizza, to send to friends.\n\nMany options for generating images exist, including a tool that most iPhone users are likely to already have: Meta AI, Meta\u2019s free chatbot that is included inside Instagram, WhatsApp and its other apps. In the search bar at the top of Instagram, you can ask the chatbot to conjure images by typing \u201c/imagine\u201d followed by a description.\n\nI typed \u201c/imagine me eating steak.\u201d Meta AI then loaded a tool to take photos of my face from multiple angles. It produced an obviously fake rendering of me salivating over a large, rare steak inside a restaurant.\n\nOther similar tools for typing prompts to generate images include Adobe Firefly, found on firefly.adobe.com, and ChatGPT.\n\nPhoto Editing\n\nAnother new Apple Intelligence tool can automatically remove photo bombers with the tap of a button.\n\nGoogle has offered a similar editing tool, Magic Eraser, inside its Google Photos photo album app for iPhone and Android users since 2023.\n\nInside Google Photos, select your photo, tap the \u201cedit\u201d button and select the Magic Eraser tool. You can then circle the distracting objects or people you would like to erase.\n\nI used Magic Eraser on a photo of my corgi, Max, in a dog park \u2014 to remove a citation form from a police officer for letting Max run off leash without a permit. It replaced the maddening piece of bureaucracy with some pine needles.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Can artificial intelligence be an effective wingman?\n\nRoman Khaves, co-founder and CEO of Rizz, thinks so. The AI dating assistant app analyzes screenshots of conversations you\u2019re having on other platforms \u2014 from Tinder to iMessage \u2014 and crafts reply suggestions. Rizz has amassed millions of downloads since launching in 2022, with more and more competition also emerging into the dating scene since.\n\nKhaves recently spoke with The Associated Press about the demand for this kind of platform, how AI is being used to find in-person connections, and what guardrails are needed to bring AI technology into such an intimate part of our lives. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: How does Rizz work?\n\nA: Rizz is an AI dating assistant. If you\u2019re stuck in a conversation or you don\u2019t know how to open up on a dating app, you can pull out Rizz and upload a screenshot of a particular profile or conversation that you\u2019re having trouble with on that other platform. It will give you tons of suggested replies \u2014 and also a strategy on how you could start the conversation or respond to certain things.\n\nThe more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you like. And that trains the model to improve over time.\n\nQ: Why launch this kind of app?\n\nA: Three years ago, I personally found myself stuck in the middle of dating app conversations. Sometimes, I would take a screenshot to send to some of my friends and say, \u201cHey, what do I say next?\u201d And we knew there had to be a better way.\n\nThe moment that ChatGPT hit the scene, that\u2019s when we launched Rizz. We integrated the API technology with our product to make it possible. And we saw immediate traction. We\u2019ve had over 7.5 million downloads to date, growing about 30% month over month, since launching in 2022. There\u2019s clear demand for this type of product.\n\nQ: Who are your biggest competitors?\n\nA: I\u2019d say at least 40% of our screenshots and conversations come from messaging apps like iMessage and Instagram. We get a lot of Instagram, which I would argue is the biggest dating app in the world today \u2014 and Instagram recently added an AI feature that can give you different variations of how to rephrase a message, like more funny or witty suggestions.\n\nSo, for now, Instagram is a huge competitor. Tinder also has suggested openers. It\u2019s still very different than what we do \u2014 we take it a step further and we give users a strategy \u2014 but I think those are the biggest competitors, as well as ChatGPT. And there\u2019s many similar apps now and new ones emerging every single day.\n\nQ: What would you say to folks who may be concerned about bringing AI into their dating life? Where do there need to be guardrails?\n\nA: We\u2019re not trying to replace human connection. We\u2019re just trying to help people get to the date in the first place \u2014 because it is hard out there. A lot of people don\u2019t even know how to start conversations online, and I think AI is helping boost that confidence.\n\nStill, privacy and control is critical in this new world of AI. We could have built Rizz very differently. We could have made it so that Rizz would respond automatically or connect to the dating apps \u2014 but we don\u2019t do any of that. All users are in control of exactly what gets sent out to their match. And we are going to continue building with these priorities in mind.\n\nQ: What\u2019s next for AI and dating?\n\nA: A lot of the big dating companies are thinking about how to leverage AI in order to enhance human connection in this space today. That\u2019s also what we set out to do, and are still improving on.\n\nRizz is currently built to help you get off dating apps as quickly as possible. Next, we might want to help you beyond the first date, perhaps with future date ideas or something like birthday gift ideas. It\u2019s really about supporting the user throughout their journey."

Visit North Carolina unveils First in Fright, a new campaign that highlights otherworldly points of interest from the cloud-shrouded Great Smoky Mountains to the Graveyard of the Atlantic.\n\nVisit North Carolina logo\n\nThe campaign features an 8-part \"First in Fright\" podcast, a new NC Haunted Trail and hotels that speak to encounters between living souls and figures (real or imagined) from other realms. From today's initial release of tales, seekers can sign up for future revelations at NCFirstInFright.com and expand what they know about mysterious lights, recurring sights and unexplained sounds that have long been reported.\n\n\"The timing might scream 'Halloween,' but the spirit of First in Fright rises from age-old narratives instead of costumes and props,\" said Wit Tuttell, executive director of Visit NC. \"The lore surrounding the Brown Mountain Lights near Morganton dates back centuries, and other stories have been retold for decades. It takes more skepticism than I can muster to dismiss the accounts, even if they're impossible to prove.\"\n\nThe First in Fright podcast directs intrepid travelers to places whose stories have endured attempts to explain them away. A Haunted Trail winds through Mountain Mysteries, the Paranormal Piedmont and the Creepy Coast. As they make their way through these regions, travelers can look into Spooky Stays for hotels where long-term guests have never checked out. For those in search of seasonal scares, a rundown of Halloween attractions and events addresses the quest.\n\n\"For anyone intrigued by ghosts, stories are the starting point,\" said Tuttell, who has stayed in the \"Pink Lady Room\" at Asheville's Omni Grove Park Inn (see Mountain Mysteries). \"The podcasts bring the mysteries to life while letting listeners decide what to believe and what to dismiss.\"\n\nWrapped in immersive sound design, the eight podcast segments feature local storytellers and first-hand accounts from the people who experienced them. Episode themes include Carolina Cryptids, Unexplained Phenomena, Old North Witches and Traveling Terrors. Among the stories that await:\n\nThe Devil's Tramping Ground, a strangely barren clearing near Siler City. Curious campers can reserve a spot near the perfect circle of a site that some say is cursed by the devil himself.\n\nBattleship North Carolina, a well-decorated World War II vessel moored in Wilmington. Frequent paranormal reports have emerged: hatches mysteriously opening, lights switched on and off, and the appearance of a young sailor in the washroom. Beyond regular tours, travelers can watch for special events such as those offered this fall by Haunted Rooms of America.\n\nBrown Mountain Lights, a phenomenon that unfolds over Linville Gorge near Morganton. For hundreds of years, the appearance of mysterious lights have been described as rising above the peaks of Linville Gorge. The size, shape and color often change. Viewer guides are available at the Discover Burke visitor center downtown.\n\nMadison Dry Goods, a shop in downtown Madison that owes its popularity in part to its museum, which occupies a former funeral parlor space on the second floor. Hauntings tied to a family's murder in 1929 have been reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe free podcast, with episodes being released today and Oct. 1, can be accessed at NCFirstInFright.com or through Apple, Spotify and other major streaming platforms.\n\n\"North Carolina is known for being 'First in Flight,'\" Tuttell said. \"We're excited that travelers will now recognize our state as 'First in Fright' as well.\"\n\nPhotos: Find photos and graphic for download here.\n\nAbout Visit North Carolina:\n\nVisit North Carolina is part of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, a private nonprofit corporation that serves as North Carolina's economic development organization. The EDPNC focuses on business and job recruitment, existing industry support, international trade, tourism and film marketing.\n\nThe mission of Visit NC is to unify and lead the state in positioning North Carolina as a preferred destination for leisure travel, group tours, meetings and conventions, sports events and film production. Each year, North Carolina welcomes about 43 million visitors who spend nearly $36 billion during their stay. The tourism industry employs more than 227,000 people and generates nearly $2.6 billion in state and local tax revenues.

        "article_content": "\n\n\n\nEssex is home to many myths and legends, and the odd ghost story or two. Hangman\u2019s Hill in Epping Forest is one such place that draws attention because of its alleged dark history that might have some of us scratching our heads. Not only is Epping Forest a place to walk among the idyllic ancient woodlands, but it is also said to be home to some not-quite-natural visitors.\n\n\n\nAs its name might suggest, the road itself might have seen some darkness, and stories about the road don\u2019t disagree. Like many places that are enveloped in conspiracy, there are many folk tales which tell conflicting stories about the place, why it has its name, and why there might be some strange paranormal goings on at this site.\n\n\n\nGhost hunters, or thrill seekers among us might head over to Hangman\u2019s Hill for the sole purpose of testing out a strange claim that all stories have in common. Park at Hangman\u2019s Hill at your peril, for if you were to leave off your handbrake, something unusual would happen. The hill is like no other, where instead of a car rolling downhill, when left without the handbrake on, it will actually roll in the opposite direction to what would be expected. Seemingly, cars roll uphill on this road, and tales about this haunted place give various explanations for why that would be the case.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Family's heartbreak as beloved Harlow mum was brutally murdered by her partner\n\nREAD MORE: Man who weighed over 19st loses 5st by swapping carbs for one thing\n\nOne such story tells us that when being a hangman was an actual, quite gruesome, job, one lost his mind with murder on the brain. His said choice of execution, unsurprisingly, was to hang his victims. Taking the doomed targets to the bottom of the hill, the hangman was said to, brutally, tie a noose around their neck and drag them via the rope up to the top of the hill. Once at the top, any poor soul who had not died in the ordeal was then executed, having their head cut off, and unceremoniously buried at the top of the hill. Legend has it that the crazed hangman is still spotted under the shadows of night looking for others to join them.\n\n\n\nIf that is too far-fetched, another tale claims that the hill is haunted by falsely accused criminals. According to this story, an appalling crime was committed by a group of three men in the 19th Century, before modern technologies could reasonably affirm a person\u2019s guilt. The story goes that on this occasion, those responsible for the unspoken spine-tingling crime, were not caught, and in fact three innocent people were tried, found guilty, and hanged, leaving the ropes and brackets behind.\n\n\n\nThe ghost stories seem to all have something in common, with a crime at the centre. A highwayman, an opportunist stealing from those travelling along Hangman\u2019s Hill, allegedly stopped people in their tracks as he dropped from a tree to stop any unsuspecting victims. It was then that, according to the tale, those on the road would see over the hill an empty landscape with a single tree growing. The tree is said to have been the site of a hanging, and from where the highwayman draws in his victims.\n\n\n\nAlthough these might be appealing stories that keep us curious, it is said that there\u2019s actually one simple reason that the cars are seen to roll uphill. With much interest in the area, apparently scientists have proven that the road might not be haunted, but disorientating in a different way. While on first look, the cars appear to be slowly moving up a hill, it has been confirmed that cars are rolling down the hill. Instead of ghosts, gravity is the cause of the cars moving, and an optical illusion at the site gives the impression of the opposite.\n\n"

Getty Images/Science Photo Library\n\n3 He\u2019s attempting to silence those who question him pointing to several other prophecies he alleges to have accurately predicted. Facebook / Athos Salom\u00e9\n\n\u201cOn 28 July this year, I posted a video in my Instagram stories again about the asteroid, predicting that NASA would make an announcement in September, confirming that the asteroid would enter a collision course with Earth by November,\u201d he told the Daily Star.\n\n\u201cMy predictions are not coincidences. They are grounded and come true.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Star reports that NASA is monitoring the \u201cGod of Chaos\u201d asteroid \u201cwhich is expected to brush past Earth at a mere 620,000 miles away on Sunday.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Salom\u00e9 also recently claimed to have alerted his followers to the Microsoft outage and warned it may lead to an \u201cescalation of confrontation\u201d and cyber war.\n\n\u201cBusinesses will have to improve the protection of cyberspace, and society might gain concerns over the use of internet services, led to discourses regarding intensive regulation. This event may result in shifts in political actions and military tactics on an international level, and the threat of an international war is real,\u201d he previously told the Daily Mail.\n\nSalom\u00e9 also says he predicted the planned cyberattacks targeting the 2024 Paris Olympics and corporate espionage in certain sectors.\n\n\u201cEvents of such magnitude like Olympics would be the ideal attack targets, capable of causing disturbances in the existing order,\u201d he told the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cIt correctly demonstrates my hypothesis when the French authorities acted quickly and increased its cybersecurity measures,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis is further indication that there is need for adequate and efficient measures of cyberspace protection during significant global occasions.\u201d\n\nAs he continues to warn of the increasingly important and nefarious role of technology, he\u2019s also warned that a significant cyberattack has the capability to \u201c\u2018cripple nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are approaching an era where technology plays a role, in conflicts,\u201d he previously said.\n\n\u201cForecasts are not set in stone but potential outcomes that can be changed. Our focus should be on resolutions and preventing conflicts,\u201d Salom\u00e9 said.\n\n3 He recently claimed to have alerted his followers to the Microsoft outage and warned it may lead to an \u201cescalation of confrontation\u201d and cyber war.

        "article_content": "The most volcanic world in our solar system has sprouted a new volcano. And its lava flows are enormous.\n\nJupiter's molten moon Io has been surveyed by a number of passing spacecraft, allowing planetary scientists to see changes on the surface. Recently, NASA's Juno mission made the closest swings by Io in two decades. The 2024 views show a dynamic volcano where, just decades ago, there was a featureless region.\n\n\"Our recent JunoCam images show many changes on Io, including this large, complicated volcanic feature that appears to have formed from nothing since 1997,\" Michael Ravine, the advanced projects manager at Malin Space Science Systems, which operates the spacecraft's JunoCam instrument, said in a statement. The discovery was just presented at the 2024 Europlanet Science Congress.\n\nProdigious amounts of lava have clearly poured from this new volcano; you can see it running to the left of the vent in two potent streams some 100 kilometers (62 miles) long. The lava, overlain over a map of the city of Berlin in another graphic below, would dominate a large swathe of Germany. Where the lava flows end and have pooled, intense heat from the molten rock created those two gray circles when frozen surface material vaporized into space.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

The entirety of the volcanic feature sprawls over an area about 180 km by 180 km (112 miles by 112 miles).\n\nOn left: Galileo spacecraft imagery from 1997.

The first-ever observations of Io, captured by the pioneering Voyager 1 craft, spotted at least eight different active volcanoes. The most recent flybys in 2023 and early 2024 spotted nine plumes from volcanoes.\n\nIt's a vicious world, inhospitable to life. And beneath its volcanic surface, it may harbor a sea of magma."

        "article_content": "Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nCeiba pentandra \u2014 one of the plants studied in the article.\n\nPlants have historically been a rich source of medicine. Many antibiotics used today were originally derived from natural compounds. But humans aren\u2019t the only ones who use medicine. Granted, we\u2019ve taken things way further than any other species on Earth, but other creatures have their own type of pharmacy.\n\nAnimals from primates to bees have been found to self-medicate in one form or another \u2014 and great apes are no exception. One day, plants consumed by gorillas may provide new avenues for drug discovery, especially in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nWild great apes in Gabon often consume medicinal plants when they are ill. Intriguingly, some of these plants are also used in local traditional medicine. So, a team of researchers led by Leresche Even Yinda wanted to see whether those plants have useful properties. They also conducted interviews with 27 people living in a nearby village.\n\nUltimately, they zoomed in on four plants, testing for antibacterial and antioxidant properties and investigating their chemical composition.\n\nCeiba pentandra (fromager tree): Known for its large, silk-producing pods, the bark of Ceiba pentandra has been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation, colic, and diarrhea.\n\nMyrianthus arboreus (giant yellow mulberry): This species is commonly used to treat stomach ulcers, coughs, and hypertension.\n\nFicus species (fig trees): Often used in wound care, Ficus bark is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.\n\nMilicia excelsa (African teak): this plant is highly valued for its timber and medicinal properties, particularly in treating diarrhea and other digestive issues.\n\nZoopharmacognosy: A natural medicine cabinet\n\nGraphical abstract of the study. Credit: Yinda et al., CC-BY 4.0 (creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\nZoopharmacognosy is the study of how animals use plants, minerals, and other natural substances for self-medication. In many cases, plants that animals consume for health benefits have also been found useful in human medicine. The western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) has been previously observed consuming plants that could play a role in regulating their health. Particularly, they may help to fend off infections from multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria like Escherichia coli.\n\nThe researchers collected bark samples from these four plant species in the Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, a region known for its rich biodiversity. Traditional healers from local communities provided valuable insight into the medicinal uses of these plants.\n\nUsing a combination of biochemical assays, the team evaluated the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of the plants\u2019 bark extracts. Basically, researchers tested how well the plants can neutralize harmful free radicals in the body and how well they fare against ten multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates using specialized methods.\n\nAntioxidants are essential in reducing oxidative stress, which can lead to chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease. They work by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS), harmful byproducts of normal cellular processes. Notably, the study found that all four plant species had significant antioxidant properties.\n\nEven more interesting, the antioxidant activities of these plants align with their traditional use in treating ailments related to inflammation and oxidative stress. This suggests that the gorillas may benefit from these properties, possibly aiding in their immune function and overall health.\n\nCan we make better drugs from the plants?\n\nThe results in this study were promising, with each plant showing varying degrees of activity against the bacteria. Ceiba pentandra was particularly effective, showing inhibitory activity against all the tested E. coli strains. And the ethanolic extract of Myrianthus arboreus displayed strong antibacterial activity, though it was less effective than Ceiba pentandra.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance is one of the most pressing health concerns globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that antibiotic resistance could lead to 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria highlights the urgent need for new antimicrobial agents. These pathogens are notoriously difficult to treat with existing antibiotics, thus causing more severe infections.\n\nThe ability of these plants to inhibit E. coli highlights their potential as sources for new antimicrobial agents. Given the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance, natural products like these could serve as valuable alternatives to synthetic drugs.\n\nThe researchers also conducted a phytochemical analysis to identify the active compounds responsible for the plants\u2019 medicinal properties. The analysis revealed the presence of several important secondary metabolites, including flavonoids (known for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties), tannins (known to promote wound healing and prevent infection), and phenolic compounds.\n\nThe presence of these compounds not only supports the medicinal use of these plants but also provides a scientific basis for their potential in drug development.\n\nAnother reason to protect these areas\n\nThe findings from this study underscore the importance of traditional knowledge in the discovery of new medicines. By studying the plants consumed by western lowland gorillas, the researchers may have found some valuable candidates for the development of new drugs. We may develop new approaches to combating antibiotic-resistant infections and oxidative stress-related conditions.\n\nBut none of this will matter if we don\u2019t protect the gorillas\u2019 habitat.\n\nThis study highlights the need for conservation efforts. The plants studied here are part of the rich biodiversity of Gabon, a country that plays a critical role in preserving the natural resources that could one day provide life-saving medicines. And these are far from the only promising drug candidates found in ecosystems both on land and in the oceans.\n\nAs researchers continue to explore the intersection of animal behavior, traditional medicine, and modern drug discovery, it becomes increasingly clear that the natural world holds immense untapped potential. The wisdom of animals like the western lowland gorilla may teach us a thing or two.\n\nJournal Reference: Antibacterial and antioxidant activities of plants consumed by western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Gabon, PLoS ONE (2024).

        "article_content": "There\u2019s been a lot of talk about AI PCs this year. But so far, it\u2019s been a lot of hype \u2014 and not much else.\n\nI\u2019ve just returned from a trip to Berlin to see the best laptops at IFA powered by new chipsets from Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. Alongside many new products launching soon, I saw a concept highlighting a distant future for computers and a vision of how useful AI could actually be.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Lenovo AI Twist PC is a concept that allows you to open and close the lid with a simple voice command. Other notable features right now include being able to follow you around the room \u2014 ideal if you like to pace during a video call \u2014 taking a panorama of the room and syncing with a ballerina movie that showcases the flexibility of the unique hinge mechanism.\n\nFinally, this wasn\u2019t just another device with Copilot. No \u2014 it was a laptop that actually took the idea of AI seriously, built into the hardware itself. It was just a concept, but it certainly made me excited for the future of AI PCs.\n\nThe challenge for the mobility-impaired\n\nThe key feature on the Lenovo AI Twist PC that stood out was opening and closing the lid with a simple voice command. Millions of people have health conditions that impair mobility, and as some diseases develop over time, many will have used a laptop at one point in their lives.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced firsthand how useful a product with a voice-controlled hinge would be.\n\nImagine waking up one day and realizing it\u2019s now too painful to open a laptop lid, especially if it doesn\u2019t have an easy lip to grab onto. Beyond major health conditions, there are also incurable diseases such as arthritis that can make typing and simple actions like opening a laptop incredibly difficult. Over time, these conditions become progressively worse, and I\u2019ve seen firsthand how suddenly being unable to do things you used to can affect your mental health as well.\n\nFor all of these users, opening and closing your laptop with just your voice can provide a freedom that didn\u2019t exist before this concept. Windows and Mac have long provided accessibility and voice control features to help navigate the OS with your voice, but none have been able to affect the hardware, just the software once you are logged in. The Lenovo AI Twist PC shows that a voice-activated hinge could still be the solution that\u2019s needed.\n\nWhat else could you control with your voice?\n\nThe AI Twist PC is a limited proof of concept, and there are no guarantees that Lenovo will make this product a reality for anyone to buy. However, if they were to, what other features could you control with your voice, and what problems could it solve?\n\nFor the same people who have mobility issues, what about adjusting the position of the hinge? Instead of just saying, \u201cHey, Twist, open the lid,\u201d what if you could say, \u201cHey, Twist, open the lid for a video call,\u201d and it recognized the exact angle at which it needed to be opened? I\u2019ve previously had spinal fusion surgery, and for several months, simple actions like adjusting the lid of my MacBook proved to be quite painful.\n\nThe Follow feature is quite impressive as it takes a similar approach to features like Center Stage or Reframe in Google Meet in that it follows you around during a video call. Those features by Apple and Google crop sensors and adjust your positioning accordingly, but if they were to be paired with a hardware hinge with the flexibility of the Lenovo AI Twist PC, we could have the ideal solution for great video calls: hardware and software working in tandem for the best experience. This would prove beneficial for everyone, not just those with mobility impairments.\n\nThe challenges with a hardware-only approach\n\nThe success of Apple hardware has always been down to its integration with the software. With control over both parts, Apple can integrate features deeply to achieve specific goals. Lenovo has proven that it can do so \u2014 the Aura Edition announced at IFA in partnership with Intel is a great example of this \u2014 but to achieve a true voice-controlled computing future, Microsoft would need to build support directly into Windows.\n\nImagine a world where you say, \u201cHey, Twist, open,\u201d it opens the lid, adjusts the angle, and Windows Hello automatically logs you in. Perhaps we go further, and it knows that you have a video call, so it automatically launches Meet, Zoom, or Teams based on the calendar invite. The power of a movable hardware hinge is that it can enable an entirely new experience controlled by voice that could bring freedom to those without.\n\nNow imagine the same hinge but in a convertible product like the Yoga XYZ. If you have loved ones who live alone, a voice-controlled version of one of those products could enable you to be their remote support. Need help cooking? A quick voice command fires up a video call and flips the keyboard over so it\u2019s in tablet mode.\n\nThe same could apply to helping solve any task. Having experienced severe mobility issues after my spinal surgery and having dealt with elderly people who struggle to carry or adjust their positioning without enduring pain, the future of voice control has me truly excited about its potential impact in helping people. None of these are new use cases, but using a laptop instead of a tablet could be a unique solution.\n\nIs this the first step toward a voice-controlled AI PC in the future?\n\n\n\nMany concepts don\u2019t become viable products, but this time feels uniquely different. The hinge on the Lenovo AI Twist PC seemed to work fairly well, with strong flexibility in terms of movement and the ability to adjust the angle. The ballerina demo was a great example of how flexible this hinge is, and its mobility in following you around the room has applications that extend far beyond video calls.\n\nThe Lenovo AI Twist PC feels like a big step in the right direction. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen a company attempt something like this, and it has spurred me to think of all the different people it could have a marked impact upon. Whether it\u2019s an ongoing chronic condition or a freak occurrence that disrupts your life \u2014 like the PT visit that resulted in my spinal surgery \u2014 I\u2019ve experienced firsthand how useful a product with a voice-controlled hinge would be.\n\nThis concept was designed with very specific demos in mind. Even with two PCs playing the same video, each acted slightly differently regarding response time and fluidity. It\u2019s called a concept for a reason, but the best part of a concept is imagining how it could change our lives. Many concepts often lack clearly defined use cases \u2014 Motorola\u2019s phone as a watch concept at MWC is a good example \u2014 but the Lenovo AI Twist PC is different, as it\u2019s clear just how useful it could be.\n\nIt also shows that true artificial intelligence is about more than just creating funky graphics, removing objects, and editing to create a specific persona: When done right, AI could help the world embrace technology in new and wonderful ways. I long for a future where technology is truly intelligent, and the Lenovo AI Twist PC is a step toward making that future a reality."
