Pentagon UFO office testifies to Senate emerging threats committee - YouTube Watch On\n\nA U.S. Senate subcommittee will hear from the Pentagon's UFO office tomorrow, and you can watch live.\n\nDirector Jon T. Kosloski of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, will testify before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities on Tuesday (Nov. 19) starting at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT). A closed-door session off-limits to the public will be held prior to the open session, beginning at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT).\n\nYou can watch the hearing live at Space.com, courtesy of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nAARO's logo in front of the Pentagon. AARO's Latin motto translates roughly as \"the universe is changing/our life is what our thoughts make of it.\" (Image credit: AARO/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Department of Defense created AARO in July 2022 in order to serve as a \"focal point for all UAP and UAP-related activities and may represent the Department for such activities,\" the Pentagon said at the time, in a statement.\n\nAARO has already released its 2024 report, which covers sightings of UFOs (or UAP, as they're now known) between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as \"all UAP reports from any previous time periods that were not included in an earlier report.\"\n\nThe document states that AARO received 757 total case reports during the period, 485 of which fell within the reporting timeframe. Of these cases, 118 were solved and another 174 are slated for closure pending a final review.\n\nStill, many cases remain unsolved, and AARO continues to study them. However, the report notes that \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe office's previous report, released in January 2023, came to similar conclusions.\n\nAARO also concluded in the report that it has \"no indication or confirmation\" that UFO reports are \"attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nAARO's latest findings might not sit well with some in the UFO/UAP community.\n\nThat's because, just last week, a quartet of high-profile witnesses \u2014 including a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, a former NASA associate administrator and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer \u2014 told the U.S. House of Representatives that a wide-ranging and long-running government conspiracy has, for decades, served to \"hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos\" from the American public.\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" one of the witnesses stated during the hearing.\n\nAARO was specifically named as being complicit in the cover-up during this hearing. \"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\""

        "article_content": "Jokes about UFO sightings have been floating around social media after lawmakers held \" ,\" to discuss UAPs, also known as unidentified objects or UFOs, last week.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability gathered for the follow-up hearing Wednesday, with several witnesses claiming the U.S. government hasn't been honest with the public about UFOs.\n\nJust two days later, news broke that an unidentified object on Feb. 12, 2023. Canadian authorities found debris from the UFO along Lake Huron's shoreline, according to a new report.\n\nSome people on social media said they are frightened by the thought of not only the presence of extraterrestrial lifeform, but also the possibility the government has been hiding important information from the public.\n\nOthers appeared indifferent.\n\n\"I believed in aliens when the government tried to say they were not real .. now they admit they are and I don't believe it,\" one person wrote on X.\n\nBut most people seemed to take it all in stride.\n\nThe majority posted snarky replies to news about the reports, with several including memes of aliens and spaceships.\n\nMany of the jokes centered around illegal immigration and the crisis at the border.\n\n\"They\u2019re just undocumented bro! How dare you! They just want a better life!\" one person wrote on a Facebook post.\n\nSo is there gonna be a border wall to keep the space aliens out?\" another wrote.\n\nBut the illegals get to come,\" a third added.\n\nDuring last week's hearing, which marked the Committee's second hearing since July 2023, Rep. Nancy Mace said UAPs are \"a controversial topic\" and claimed there were \"certain individuals who didn't want this hearing to happen because they feared what might be disclosed.\"\n\nBut, she said, she was determined to proceed.\n\n\"No amount of outside pressure would ever keep me from pursuing a subject to ground come hell or high water,\" Mace, a Republican who represents South Carolina, said at the hearing.\n\nThe Pentagon's latest report on UFOs revealed hundreds of new reports of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena -- but no indications suggesting an extraterrestrial origin.\n\nThe review includes hundreds of cases of misidentified balloons, birds and satellites, as well as some that defy easy explanation, such as a near-miss between a commercial airliner and a mysterious object off the coast of New York.\n\nWhile it isn't likely to settle any debates over the existence of alien life, the report reflects heightened public interest in the topic and the government's efforts to provide some answers.\n\nFederal efforts to study and identify UAPs have focused on potential threats to national security or air safety and not their science fiction aspects. Officials at the Pentagon office created in 2022 to track UAPs, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, have said there's no indication any of the cases they looked into have unearthly origins.\n\n\u201cIt is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\u201d the authors of the report wrote.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s review covered 757 cases from around the world that were reported to U.S. authorities from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2024. The total includes 272 incidents that occurred before that time period but had not been previously reported.\n\n___________\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: The Associated Press contributed to this report."

        "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nTwinMind, founded by former Google X employees, is building an AI assistant to better understand you.\n\nThe founders believe memory is key and something that rival products like OpenAI's ChatGPT lack.\n\nThe startup said it has raised over $2.5 million and was most recently valued at $30 million.\n\nA startup formed by a handful of former Googlers \u2014 specifically Google X, the skunkworks lab that explores sci-fi moonshot ideas \u2014 is coming out of stealth.\n\nNamed TwinMind, its app would function as an AI assistant that lives in your smartphone and always listens. Its founders like to compare it to Jarvis, the AI designed by Marvel's Tony Stark: It's constantly learning what you're doing and talking about and then uses that information to better understand you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwinMind founder and CEO Daniel George said the company raised over $2.5 million this year in two rounds, the latest giving TwinMind a $30 million post-money valuation. Notable investors to date include Oracle's chief AI scientist, Dan Roth; a Rocketship VC founding partner, Anand Rajaraman; and Michael Liou, an early investor in Robinhood and Zapier.\n\nTwinMind is emerging into a competitive market filled with chatbots galore. George told Business Insider he believes the idea of an AI assistant that learns and retains information about users could help set TwinMind apart.\n\nWhile other AI assistants and chatbots, such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are improving at memory, they're still not very good at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you had your own Jarvis, why would you Google? Why would you ask ChatGPT?\" George told BI. \"None of these other tools capture you. None of them understand you. They don't understand what's happening in your life.\"\n\nTwinMind would run in the background of your phone, store audio in the short term, and transcribe it to text, which would go into TwinMind's memory bank. Then, users could open the app and see a readout of their day broken down into key moments.\n\nYou could also ask it questions. Because TwinMind is learning about you, what you've done, and the people you've spent your day with, it aims to pull all that information in, allowing you to talk to TwinMind in a way that feels more natural and without having to add heaps of context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup is also rolling out a web browser extension, which (with permission) could see what users are browsing online and capture it in memory. By integrating calendars and Gmail, users could also ask TwinMind to draft emails. That's something you can already do with other chatbots, of course, but TwinMind's edge here would be drawing on all that memory it holds of the user, George said.\n\n\"You just go in there and, say, write your marketing email. And it knows everything about me, who my cofounders are, what my company is, what we have done before,\" said George. \"Imagine Grammarly, but instead of correcting grammar, it actually writes it based on all the memories and context.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWolverine origins\n\nAt Google X, George was the first machine-learning scientist working on Wolverine, a hearing-wearable project first reported on by Business Insider in 2021. That project has since spun out into a startup named Iyo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, George was working at JPMorgan with TwinMind cofounder and chief technology officer Sunny Tang, a Google X alum.\n\nHe said the two watched as colleagues started using AI chatbots in meetings. The pair hacked together a crude chatbot of their own that could transcribe meetings and answer questions about what was being said. The idea evolved into the startup ThirdEar, but they changed the name to TwinMind because someone else owned the ThirdEar domain name. George said the team also felt the name didn't reflect the visual elements they were building, such as the Chrome extension.\n\nTwinMind does most of its processing locally on the phone but could connect to the cloud if it needed to answer a question or if the user wanted an improved AI experience, George said. TwinMind plans to offer a free app version with a $20-a-month tier for users who want access to more advanced large language models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, it raises some questions about privacy. George said that because TwinMind does not capture images and only transcribes the audio, it falls under the same category of assistants as Siri or Alexa.\n\nPerhaps the more impressive feat here will be on the hardware side.\n\n\"The main innovation is figuring out how to get this thing running all day, in your pocket, without draining your battery, [and with] all the Apple walled garden stuff,\" George said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the team figured it out, and the TwinMind app could run for 12 hours nonstop in the background before running out the battery.\n\nThe team has just opened its seed round, and George said they're looking to raise at least $5 million. The company is also telling potential investors about its future plans, which include making the switch between phone and desktop more seamless so that TwinMind feels more embedded in users' lives.\n\nGeorge said more than 2,000 early testers have already provided feedback, and the team plans to launch the app this week on Product Hunt. It will be available first on the iPhone and as a Chrome extension, with Android and Mac apps to follow next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are sure that in a couple of years, everyone is going to have a personalized AI companion that knows their whole life and has access to all of the world's knowledge on the internet,\" George told BI. \"And that would be the way people access information. Not through Google.\""

Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and the late Harold Ramis starred as Manhattan-based paranormal investigators in the 1984 action-horror comedy movie.\n\nThey came back for Ghostbusters II in 1989, and they delighted fans in the 2021 reboot, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, where Aykroyd, Murray and Hudson reunited to honor their friend Harold Ramis. They came back once again this year for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and though it was a welcome return, it could be the last time they return.\n\nAykroyd was asked by the New York Post, while promoting his History Channel series The UnBelievable With Dan Aykroyd, if he saw himself returning to Ghostbusters films in the future. He responded:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that coming. I don\u2019t see where they would need us to carry it on. They\u2019ve got a whole new cast, and they\u2019ve got whole new ideas.\u201d\n\nThe latest installments in the franchise took place in Oklahoma and New York City, and they starred Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace and Carrie Coon.\n\nAykroyd went on to say about the franchise\u2019s direction, \u201cI think probably they\u2019re going to move on to advancing it beyond the originals, which they should.\u201d\n\nWhile Frozen Empire wasn\u2019t a strong critical nor commercial hit, director Gil Kenan expressed plans for additional films alongside writer-producer Jason Reitman, though nothing concrete has been announced.\n\nvia: Deadline"

But it has not quite gone to plan so far.\n\nHolloway has yet to win a league game as Swindon manager - leaving the side sitting 22nd in League Two. Their latest outing saw them draw 2-2 with Accrington Stanley.\n\nSwindon have also been beset with misfortune on the injury front, with captain Ollie Clarke becoming the latest to pick up an issue as he ruptured a tendon in his ankle during training. And Holloway believes that paranormal activity could have something to do with the situation that the club find themselves in.\n\nSpeaking with BBC Radio Wiltshire, he said: \"I'm absolutely devastated so I'm going to try and cleanse the training ground area because people are telling me it's haunted. There's a graveyard somewhere near. Honestly, I'm not joking.\n\n\"I think our training ground is very close to an ancient burial site so I'm going to get my wife to come up and say sorry to all these people and hopefully we'll have a bit more luck.\"\n\nAnd while Holloway is aiming to find a resolution to the ghostly goings-on, he has stopped short of following Barry Fry \u2019s example. The former Birmingham boss allegedly had a wee in all four corners of the St Andrews\u2019 pitch in an effort to lift an apparent curse put on the club.\n\n\"I don't want to do what he did, I think he had to urinate on the corners of his pitch but I'm going to get my wife to come up with her sage,\" Holloway added.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nWhat's the strangest reason you've ever heard for a defeat? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\n\"I've done the Glastonbury stuff and the hail and welcome - great if you believe it. Do I? Really I'm not sure but I'm going to get it just to help because there's some strange things happening.\"\n\nSwindon have an excellent chance to earn their first victory of the Holloway era this weekend. They take on bottom of the table Morecambe at home on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA win could potentially see Holloway\u2019s side move four points clear of the relegation zone. But a defeat could see them slump to the bottom of the table.\n\nThe side have been in League Two since their relegation at the end of the 2020/21 campaign. The highest they have finished since then has been sixth the following campaign. Swindon finished 19th last term - nine points clear of relegation.

Lead researcher Mengyuan Xiao believes that this discovery could significantly reshape our understanding of how the early universe developed, particularly in its first few hundred million years.\n\nJWST sheds new light on galaxy evolution with red monsters challenging traditional models\n\nRole of JWST in cosmic discovery\n\nNew insights to the early universe\n\nAlso Read |\n\nIn an astonishing new revelation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered the existence of three enormous \"red monster\" galaxies, each with a mass approximately 100 billion times that of our Sun. These galaxies, which formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, are forcing astronomers to rethink everything they know about early galaxy formation and cosmic evolution.The newly discovered galaxies are truly ancient, over 12.8 billion years old, dating back to a time when the universe was only 1 billion years old. This period, known as the \"cosmic dawn,\" marks the early stages of galaxy formation and the first generations of stars.These massive galaxies challenge the current models of how galaxies should form in the early universe. According to the prevailing theories, galaxies should take much longer to grow to such enormous sizes, with star formation occurring at a more gradual pace. But the \"red monsters\" defy these predictions, suggesting that our understanding of galactic evolution might be fundamentally flawed.The three galaxies discovered by JWST are not only massive but also exhibit some highly unusual properties. The term \"red monsters\" refers to their distinctive red glow, which is visible in the infrared spectrum captured by JWST\u2019s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). This red glow occurs because the galaxies are so distant that their light has been stretched (or \"redshifted\") due to the expansion of the universe. This stretching causes the light from these galaxies to shift into the infrared part of the spectrum.The red colour of these galaxies is also indicative of their age and the nature of their star formation. In the early universe, cosmic dust was far more abundant, which often obscured the light from forming stars. The JWST\u2019s ability to peer through this dust and capture the infrared light offers us an unprecedented view of galaxies that existed when the universe was still in its infancy.One of the most surprising aspects of these \"red monster\" galaxies is the sheer speed and efficiency with which they formed stars. Around 80% of their gas has been converted into stars\u2014a rate of star formation that vastly exceeds that of typical galaxies today, which convert only about 20% of their gas into stellar matter.This high conversion rate implies that these early galaxies were extraordinarily efficient star factories. They appear to have bypassed some of the natural limits on star formation that we currently understand. Normally, factors like gas availability, temperature, and the dynamics of interstellar matter constrain how quickly stars can form in a galaxy. But these galaxies, known for their dense and rapid star formation, seem to have shattered those limitations.Stijn Wuyts, an astronomer at the University of Bath, described these galaxies as a \"tantalising puzzle.\" Their rapid formation challenges the conventional wisdom about the time and conditions required for such massive growth. These findings suggest that there might be unknown factors at play in early galaxy evolution that we have yet to discover.At the core of this discovery is the question: how did these galaxies form so quickly and grow to such massive sizes in the early universe? These \"red monster\" galaxies, formed within just one billion years of the Big Bang, provide a stark contrast to the more gradual process of galaxy formation that was previously believed to be the norm.This rapid growth raises several important implications for our understanding of the universe's infancy:The discovery of these galaxies is part of a larger trend where JWST is revealing previously unknown aspects of the early universe. By studying galaxies that formed just after the Big Bang, astronomers hope to piece together a clearer picture of how galaxies evolved over time.The red monsters\u2019 rapid growth and massive size offer a unique opportunity to explore how the first galaxies might have differed from those in later cosmic epochs. Theories on galaxy formation must now account for the possibility of faster-than-expected growth, which could change the way scientists approach everything from star formation rates to the conditions of the early universe.JWST is providing astronomers with an unparalleled tool to study the deep universe. Its advanced infrared capabilities are able to detect light from the earliest galaxies, offering a view into a time when the universe was still in its infancy. This unprecedented observational power allows scientists to study cosmic phenomena that were previously unreachable, opening up new frontiers in astrophysics.As Wuyts puts it, \"JWST is launching a new era of cosmic exploration.\" The telescope\u2019s ability to peer into the farthest reaches of space\u2014and time\u2014has already led to a revolution in our understanding of the universe\u2019s early stages. The discovery of the \"red monster\" galaxies is just the beginning, and astronomers are eager to learn more about the mysteries these galaxies hold.With these discoveries, the next phase of investigation will involve deeper studies into the structure and formation of these galaxies. JWST, in combination with other instruments like the ALMA telescope in Chile, will continue to probe these galaxies, focusing on their internal dynamics and the processes that allowed them to grow so quickly.The findings from the James Webb Space Telescope are not just about discovering distant galaxies\u2014they are changing the very way we think about the universe. As astronomers continue to analyse these discoveries, they may unlock new insights into the nature of the early universe, the formation of galaxies, and the processes that shaped the cosmos as we know it.These \"red monster\" galaxies are forcing astronomers to rewrite the rules of cosmic evolution, and JWST is at the forefront of this exciting new chapter in the story of the universe."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA mummified ice age cub from Siberia is the first known mummy of a sabre-toothed cat, and its discovery is generating ripples of excitement among paleontologists. The mummy\u2019s exceptional preservation provided the first view of what sabre-toothed cats looked like. Written in its soft tissues are clues about where the cat\u2019s muscles were bulkiest and how that may have shaped its hunting style.\n\nAbundant fur and mummified flesh covered the partial corpse, and its face, forelimbs and torso were nearly intact, scientists reported Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The cub\u2019s dark brown fur was short but very thick, measuring about 0.8 to 1.2 inches (20 to 30 millimeters) long. Its fur was also surprisingly soft, said lead study author Alexey V. Lopatin, full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and chief researcher and director of the academy\u2019s Borissiak Paleontological Institute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic feeling to see with your own eyes the life appearance of a long-extinct animal,\u201d Lopatin told CNN in an email. \u201cEspecially when it comes to such an interesting predator as the sabre-toothed cat.\u201d These extinct carnivores, which are distant relatives of modern big cats, are known for their long, bladelike canines, which could measure up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) long.\n\nThe mummy is the first evidence from Asia of the sabre-toothed cat species Homotherium latidens, Lopatin said, though fossilized bones were previously found at sites in the Netherlands and in the Canadian Yukon. Other types of frozen ice age mummies, such as woolly rhinos and mammoths, are known from the Siberian region of Yakutia in Russia.\n\nBut mummified cats, by comparison, \u201care extremely rare,\u201d Lopatin said. Before this discovery, there were just two known cat mummies, both cubs of the cave lion Panthera spelaea from Yakutia\u2019s Uyandina River basin.\n\n\u201cNow, we have added the Homotherium cub to this list,\u201d Lopatin said. Extracting DNA from the mummy will be an important next step for understanding this species, as will more detailed examination of the mummy\u2019s skeleton, muscles and hair, he added.\n\nImages highlight the differences in external appearance of the heads of two 3-week-old cub specimens \u2014 the mummified Homotherium latidens (sabre-toothed cat) at the top and Panthera leo (modern lion) below. courtesy Prof. Alexey V.

Radiocarbon dating revealed that the cub was at least 35,000 years old and lived during the latter part of the Pleistocene epoch (about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago).\n\nPreservation of the cub\u2019s forelimbs in particular was extraordinary, the study authors wrote. Its front paws even retained claws and the oval, fleshy pads on the underside of the paw that are fondly referred to as \u201cbeans\u201d by admirers of modern cats.\n\nPictured here are the forepaws of 3-week-old large felid cubs.

D shows the plantar view of the right forepaw of a Panthera leo specimen. courtesy Prof. Alexey V. Lopatin\n\nAncient cat origins\n\nAlong with the partial mummy, articulated bones of the cub\u2019s pelvis and hind limbs were also found locked in ice. Based on comparisons with lion cub anatomy and analysis of the mummified cub\u2019s incisor growth, scientists estimated that the cub was about 3 weeks old when it died.\n\nHowever, the mummy also showed that sabre-toothed cubs differed dramatically from modern lion cubs of a similar age, Lopatin said. Its coat was darker, and its ears were smaller than those of lion cubs; it had longer forelimbs, a larger mouth opening and a more massive neck. The height of the mummy\u2019s upper lip is more than twice that of a modern lion cub\u2019s, probably so its lip could cover the long upper canines once they grew in, according to Lopatin.\n\nIts paw is also more circular than that of a lion cub; in fact, its shape more closely resembles the paw of a bear, Tseng added. Bears are known for using their powerful forearms to dig through trees and undergrowth for food; the size and shape of the mummified cub\u2019s paws and front limbs suggest that an adult Homotherium may have also relied on its forearms, perhaps using them to immobilize its kills, he said.\n\n\u201cThe idea about sabre-toothed cats is that they had to have some sort of assistance from the rest of the body \u2014 that it\u2019s not just a headfirst hunting technique,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cAnd the forearm has been one of the targets of research to think about. Are they buffer in their forearms compared to modern big cats of similar sizes, because they need a forearm to help stabilize their prey so that the sabre can be put to use?\u201d\n\nThe new mummy findings reveal that sabre-toothed cubs differed dramatically from modern lion cubs of a similar age. The image above highlights differences in the skulls of the mummifed Homotherium latidens (A, B) and Panthera leo (C, D) at 3 weeks old. courtesy Prof. Alexey V. Lopatin\n\nUntil now, scientists have hypothesized about sabre-toothed cat anatomy by scanning fossils and digitally modeling the animals\u2019 muscles in 3D, but that doesn\u2019t compare to seeing one of those limbs \u201cin the flesh,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cI think it makes it seem more possible that these sabre-tooths would have used their forearms.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the anatomy of the Homotherium mummy that makes it so special \u2014 the discovery also provides a unique glimpse into the evolutionary history of the entire feline group, Tseng said. Prior genetic analysis of DNA from Homotherium fossils showed that the genus split from other ancient cats about 18 million years ago. Not only is the cub the sole mummified example of the Homotherium genus, \u201cit represents a part of that cat family tree that goes back almost to the origin of the cat family,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat adds to the mind-blowingness of this discovery.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

        "article_content": "A section of one of Britain's most important Roman roads has been found after almost 2,000 years.\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered part of the ancient Roman road known as Watling Street beneath modern London's Old Kent Road.\n\nWatling Street was paved by the Romans in 43 AD and ran 276 miles (444km) from Dover to the West Midlands.\n\nThis is the first time that researchers have found physical proof that parts of the Roman highway survive directly below its modern counterpart.\n\nAlthough Roman roads are characteristically straight, it has proven exceedingly difficult to find hard evidence of Watling Street's path through the capital.\n\nHowever, during work to expand Southwark borough's heat network, a 5.8m (19ft) wide and 1.4m (5ft) tall section was found beneath the busy street.\n\nGillian King, director of archaeology at RPS Consulting Ltd, says that the discovery of this section has 'redrawn the Roman road map' for London.\n\nMs King added: 'It is a key finding for archaeological research for London.'\n\nArchaeologists have found a section of one of Britain's most important Roman roads directly beneath modern London's Old Kent Road (pictured), 2,000 years after it was first built\n\nThe Roman road known as Watling Street ran from Dover, through London and up to the Roman city of Viroconium (now Wroxeter near Shrewsbury) to the fort of Deva (now Chester)\n\nThe fragment of the Watling Street was found directly beneath the Old Kent Road (pictured). Although archaeologists know that the road passed through London, until now it has been hard to uncover the exact route\n\nWatling Street was built shortly after the Roman invasion in 43 AD and served as one of the most important arterial roads in Roman Britain.\n\nIt ran northwest from the critical port of Dover, through Verulamium (modern-day St Albans) to the Roman city of Viroconium (Wroxeter near Shrewsbury) and the fort of Deva, now Chester.\n\nThe road was so important that it was even used by visiting emperors, including Hadrian in 122 AD when he ordered the construction of Hadrian's Wall to separate England and Scotland.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Roman Empire, Anglo-Saxons named Wroxeter 'W\u00e6tlingaceaster', which gradually morphed into 'Watling' after which the road is named.\n\nLike many Roman roads, Watling Street's solid construction meant it remained an important part of the medieval transport system and slowly became absorbed into our modern road networks.\n\nAlthough we have a good idea of the road's general route from historical records, archaeologists have previously struggled to identify its path through London.\n\nHowever, as Southwark Council prepared for construction work, archaeologists were able to uncover a complete section of Watling Street.\n\nThe section sits south of the junction of Old Kent Road and Ilderton Road and is remarkably well-preserved for its age.\n\nThe road (pictured) is made up of three layers: a compacted gravel sealed by two layers of chalk, topped with another layer of compacted gravel and sand\n\nArchaeologists excavated a 5.8m (19ft) wide and 1.4m (5ft) tall section of the 2,000-year-old road\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nIt is made up of three distinct layers with a foundation of compacted gravel sealed by two layers of chalk and topped with another layer of compacted gravel and sand.\n\nThe archaeologists say that there originally would have been another surface layer made up of the same material around the level of the current street but this has been eroded over time and is now lost.\n\nDave Taylor, Museum of London Archaeology project manager, says: 'It\u2019s amazing this section of road has survived for almost 2000 years.\n\n'There has been so much activity here over the past few hundred years, from sewers to power cables, tramlines and of course the building of the modern road, so we\u2019re really excited to find such a substantial chunk of Roman material remaining.'\n\nThe researchers hope this discovery will lead to a better understanding of Watling Street's route and Roman construction techniques.\n\nSouthwark Council's archaeology officer Dr Chris Constable says that excavations in the early 1990s had found a section to the South of Old Kent Road but had not confirmed the exact course.\n\nDr Constable says: 'In the planning for this project, we\u2019d expected to solve this question but the extent of survival of the road is remarkable.\n\n'We hope this project will answer some other archaeological questions in the borough.'\n\nThe Roman Army created highways during the four centuries Britain was under the rule of the Roman Empire. From 43 to 410 AD, it is thought the army created 2,000 miles (3,200km) of surfaced roads across the UK (map pictured)\n\nArchaeologists say that there would have once been an extra layer on top which sat around the level of the modern street but this has long since been worn away and lost\n\nThe London portion of Watling Street was first discovered in 1671 as Christopher Wren rebuilt St Mary-le-Bow following the Great Fire of London in 1666.\n\nBefore this discovery, much of what experts could learn about Watling Street came from a series of Roman documents called the Antonine Itinerary.\n\nThese papers record the names of military stations and the distances between them which allowed researchers to trace the route all the way out to the Roman fort which would become Chester.\n\nArchaeologists now believe that the road ran from the bridgehead on the Thames towards modern-day Newgate near London Wall.\n\nWatling Street then led over Ludgate Hill and the Fleet River where it branched into the main path towards the West Midlands and the Devil\u2019s Highway west to Silchester."

        "article_content": "As college tuition increases and the student loan debt crisis continues, three former executives from language learning app Duolingo are building a new startup aimed at making college education more affordable and accessible.\n\nThe company, tentatively named Outsmart Education (the name is not final yet), is headed by co-founders Daniel Falabella (CPO), former senior director of product for learning at Duolingo; Gina Gotthilf (CMO), former vice president of growth and marketing at Duolingo; and Jorge Mazal (CEO), ex-chief product officer at Duolingo.\n\nOutsmart announced its $13 million seed funding round on Monday, led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Karman Ventures, Latitud Ventures, and Lightspeed Ventures, as well as angel investors, including Lenny Ratchinsky (ex-product lead at Airbnb) and 20Growth, among others. The capital will be used for hiring and product development.\n\nThe idea for Outsmart came out of Mazal\u2019s own frustration with the current system, he says. When Mazal moved to the U.S. to pursue his undergraduate degree, he didn\u2019t have the resources to pay for it and had to find a way to finance his education through a combination of jobs, scholarships, and other means. When he went on to complete two master\u2019s programs at Harvard and Wharton, he didn\u2019t realize how much debt he would end up with.\n\n\u201cI was like a quarter million dollars in debt,\u201d Mazal told TechCrunch. \u201cI had to take a part-time job where I was picking up trash in my apartment complex every morning just to make ends meet, and, to me, that was just so representative of what\u2019s broken in higher ed.\u201d\n\n(L-R) Gina Gotthilf, Daniel Falabella, and Jorge Mazal. Image Credits:Outsmart Education\n\nBecause the company is currently operating in stealth mode, it\u2019s not yet able to share its specific plans. Despite this, the venture shows promise given the caliber of its backers.\n\n\u201cCollege-level education is a basic, universal human right,\u201d Ethan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cI\u2019m actually a first-generation college student myself. Education has completely transformed my life and will impact my family for generations\u2026I just think what [Outsmart is] doing will be world-changing.\u201d\n\nOutsmart arrives at a time when many families find it hard to pay for a college degree. For the 2024-2025 school year, the average tuition and fees at private ranked colleges rose by around 5.5% over the last year, whereas public schools saw a rise of over 2%. Overall, Americans owe approximately $1.6 trillion in student loans.\n\nMazal told us, \u201cThe mission that we\u2019re trying to achieve is to dramatically increase access to higher education in a way that\u2019s been unprecedented and that we believe can change the world.\u201d\n\nMany companies aim to help college students get access to affordable education, including platforms that compare college tuition fees, such as Tuition Tracker, as well as companies that offer inexpensive online schooling. There are also matchmaking platforms, like College Rover and College Simply, that help students determine which college is the best fit for them.\n\nSince Outsmart is keeping the details of its offering under wraps, it remains unclear how, or if, it fits into these existing categories. Regardless, the founders themselves appear to be well-equipped to forge a path in the space. The trio worked at Duolingo for five years and have previously held positions at various other notable companies. Falabella has experience at Dropbox and Lucid Software, while Gotthilf previously worked at Tumblr. Mazal has worked at Lucid, MyFitnessPal, and Zynga.\n\nMazal believes Outsmart will be \u201cbetter than the higher ed options out there in basically every dimension, in terms of access, affordability, and personalization,\u201d he said."

        "article_content": "Customer relationship management systems can provide extensive analytics and reporting capabilities for businesses to better understand their sales processes on a more comprehensive level. Secure data mining, data recording, and report generation translate this information into visual representations of KPIs.\n\nPopular metrics businesses generate and track include their sales cycle length, marketing ROI, sales rep performance, and deal forecasting.\n\nWhat is CRM analytics?\n\nCRM analytics is internal programming that collects, organizes, and analyzes data around customers, sales, and revenue. Generating detailed reports like this is a top CRM feature that businesses of any size and market can benefit from.\n\nThis data provides actionable insights for leaders, managers, and individual users that assists in making timely and data-based decisions. CRM analytics has also recently been integrated with AI functionality, allowing for more niche reports and suggestions to be generated on command.\n\n5 key CRM metrics\n\nSales cycle length\n\nA sales cycle length is the average time it takes a deal to be closed from beginning to end. This starts with a prospect converting to a lead, and that lead becoming a confirmed customer. The goal is to have the sales cycle length be as short as possible, so that leads aren\u2019t lost to competitors, or their need for your solution dissipates. Measuring this metric will help identify opportunities where the sales cycle could be condensed.\n\nCustomer churn rate\n\nA churn rate is a percentage metric that shows how many customers leave your sales pipeline or stop doing business with your company entirely. A high churn rate is something businesses try to avoid, and typically it can also identify where in your sales process the churn is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s always good to know where you\u2019re succeeding, but equally important to understand where you are losing business in order to make immediate adjustments.\n\nMarketing ROI\n\nMarketing ROI directly tracks how resources that are allocated to marketing contribute to overall revenue growth. While CRM solutions are sales-oriented, marketing features are included in that. That includes social media communications, email marketing campaigns, and even web and landing page building. This is especially important for small to mid-sized businesses looking to invest more into marketing campaigns, because you need concrete data that supports such an investment.\n\nRep performance\n\nRep performance is tracked by monitoring their overall sales activities and close rates. Common activities that are monitored are sales calls, email performance, referral rates, and lead conversion rates. This tracking can be done on an individual scale, by team, according to location, or for an entire department\u2014and can help with quarterly reviews. This transparency is important especially in a commission-driven environment.\n\nBusiness forecasting\n\nThe best CRM solutions offer business and revenue forecasting as an advanced CRM metric. These reports take into account customer activity, sales length, churn rate, sales history, and more to come up with predictive analytics around projected revenue wins. While this information is always subject to change depending on any number of factors, having a projected idea of revenue QoQ or YoY helps immensely when planning bigger initiatives for a company.\n\nTop 3 benefits of CRM data analysis\n\nIncreased productivity\n\nI recommend using a CRM software as a way to increase productivity around customer interactions, and data analysis helps do exactly that. Since there isn\u2019t time being wasted on manually pulling and sorting data, users can focus on nurturing client relationships and closing deals. Trusted analytics make sure efforts are being put into the right place at the right time and optimize resource allocation. This way, reps, agents, or administrators are spending time doing tasks that are proven to be beneficial to the business.\n\nImproved customer satisfaction\n\nWhen you have detailed data analysis built around successful\u2014and less successful\u2014marketing and lead nurturing campaigns, it\u2019s easier to understand what customers consider as positive interaction. With the help of personalized engagement and detailed analysis of metrics like email click rates, conversions, and more, businesses won\u2019t need to guess which strategies actually move customers through their pipeline. This will build customer satisfaction with your business and improve customer retention.\n\nCompetitive advantage\n\nHaving strong analytics in a CRM software allows for businesses to keep a constant eye on market changes or trends. This way, they can anticipate those changes and plan accordingly. For example, these trackable trends help make informed decisions about where to invest more or invest less. If a company anticipates a seasonal increase in business, they should invest in marketing campaigns in advance to get ahead of their competitors. It also helps increase overall efficiency and allows for a flexible and agile business plan.\n\nCRM analytics use cases\n\nWhen choosing a CRM solution, opting for an analytical CRM tool means there\u2019s an emphasis on data warehousing and mining, plus advanced forecasting. These are great for medium to large teams or businesses that need detailed, secure, and constant data monitoring.\n\nIdentifying consumer trends\n\nIn industries that are completely driven by consumer trends, having analytical CRM helps businesses stay ahead and anticipate major changes. Whether it\u2019s financial forecasting, product and service trends, or mapping seasonal spikes, an analytical CRM will take complex data and turn it into understandable insights.\n\nFor example, a retail business might use purchase history and trends from their consumers to help identify when in the fiscal year their products are in demand. They can then plan to invest in more marketing campaigns leading up to that timeframe in the new year.\n\nScalability\n\nWhen your goal is to grow your business quickly, you need an analytical CRM that can grow and scale alongside you. This way, the key metrics you track over time can be consistent no matter how much more data is being saved. Some key metrics that CRM software can track that help with scalability include team, location, and individual rep performance, profit and revenue growth, product or service demand, and more.\n\nThis can be especially helpful for companies planning to expand physically with more locations, service more geographical markets, or determine the feasibility of allocating funds for hiring more employees to accommodate growth.\n\nCompetitor analysis\n\nWhile CRMs are meant to manage and track the metrics of companies and individual users who utilize them, they can still help with competitor analysis. Some metrics that can help managers understand exactly where their customer service and solution ranks against competitors are; lead and customer surveys, split testing results, lost deals versus won deals, and average deal closing time for your business versus industry standard. All of this will help companies not only understand their own internal operations but also lead to more sustainability in their markets.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is an analytical CRM?\n\nAn analytical CRM is a CRM solution that offers advanced data analysis features.
