        "article_content": "UFO sightings and alien abductions are often reported by folks in the boondocks without any witnesses around to back up their stories.\n\nNot for Linda Napolitano, who was in 1989 taken from her New York City apartment and beamed onto a spaceship by extraterrestrials, as 23 onlookers bore witness, it is claimed.\n\nNapolitano's story has gripped UFO enthusiasts for decades. Now, the incident has exploded onto the small screen \u2014 and into the courtroom.\n\nA Netflix show presents the abduction as an 'elaborate hoax,' and Napolitano has fought back with a lawsuit accusing the streamer of defamation.\n\nHer complaint reopens a rift between a husband-and-wife duo of alien researchers and raises tough questions about those who say they've encountered visitors from space.\n\nAs millions of viewers stream The Manhattan Alien Abduction, and lawyers duke it out in court, concerns about who is being honest will doubtless intensify.\n\nWhile the US government is increasingly open to discussing aliens, it's unclear whether those with abduction stories are telling the truth, or suffering from false memories, mental health issues or just making it up.\n\nNapolitano, a stay-at-home mom, stands by her story that on the night of 30 November 1989, three aliens kidnapped her outside her 12th-floor Lower Manhattan apartment.\n\nLinda Napolitano, 77, has stuck by her story of being abducted by aliens from her Manhattan apartment in 1989\n\nThey made her levitate out her window and into a spacecraft hovering above the city, where they carried out experiments on her, before returning her to her bedroom, she says.\n\nBut this astonishing event wasn't her first brush with aliens, she claims.\n\nThirteen years prior, upstate in the Catskills, she recalls finding a strange bump on the side of her nose.\n\nThis was later identified as a mystery foreign object.\n\nSeveral months before the 1989 incident, Napolitano says she wrote to UFO researcher Budd Hopkins about that incident in the Catskills, and joined his support group for abductees.\n\nHopkins believed the object in her nose was implanted by aliens.\n\nAn X-ray purportedly shows the object, but, when a specialist came to check Napolitano's nose, it could not be found.\n\nAfter the 1989 incident, Hopkins scoured downtown for people to corroborate Napolitano's story.\n\nAbout 20 people witnessed it; some even said they saw Napolitano floating above her building, it is claimed.\n\nHopkins documented this in his book Witnessed: True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge Abduction.\n\nBut he used pseudonyms for the witnesses, casting doubt on their authenticity.\n\nAmong the purported witnesses were two guards for then-UN chief Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar \u2014 but these testimonies have also been questioned.\n\nNapolitano insists they were all genuine onlookers who saw the night's mind-boggling spectacle.\n\nThe Netflix recreates Napolitano's story of being levitated out her window and into a spacecraft hovering above the city\n\nThe docuseries presents archive footage of Napolitano pointing up to where she says the abduction took place\n\nUFO researcher Budd Hopkins' hypnosis sessions with Napolitano have been called into question\n\n'If I was hallucinating, then the witnesses saw my hallucination,' she told Vanity Fair in 2013.\n\n'That sounds crazier than the whole abduction phenomenon.'\n\nHopkins' then-wife, Carol Rainey, a filmmaker and UFO researcher, was also embroiled in the case.\n\nShe initially believed Napolitano and they became friends, she said, but over time she grew skeptical.\n\nRainey says Hopkins interviewed abductees under hypnosis in search of suppressed memories.\n\nBut the results of his sessions with Napolitano were not credible, she said.\n\nThe three-part Netflix docuseries features interviews with Napolitano, 77, who now lives in Tennessee, and Rainey, who died in 2023.\n\nIt also features archive footage of Budd, who died in 2011.\n\nIn the show, Rainey, then divorced from Budd, said her ex-husband had 'lost his objectivity' and may have guided Napolitano's comments under hypnosis.\n\nShe vowed to 'continue to ask questions' about the suspect abduction story.\n\nIn her appearances, Napolitano maintains she told the truth.\n\nOnly a 'sociopath' would fabricate such a grand narrative, she says, while accusing Rainey of debunking her in a bid to 'get even with Budd.'\n\nNapolitano's story has gripped UFO enthusiasts for decades\n\nNapolitano (left) and Carol Rainey started out as friends but fell out over the abduction story.\n\nAn X-ray purportedly shows a mystery object in Napolitano's nose, but there are questions over its authenticity\n\nShe's in part backed up by her son Johnny, who appears in the documentary, though his likeness is obscured.\n\n'There\u2019s no way I believe she would want to make anything like this up,' he says.\n\nHe recalls seeing three 'beings' in the family living room, in what he calls a 'terrifying' experience that left him feeling 'hopeless.'\n\n'I just try to erase it from my life,' he says.\n\nAccording to Napolitano, the aliens were not done with her family after that night in 1989. She says they came back years later and targeted her family, giving them nosebleeds.\n\nNapolitano, Hopkins' estate, and others filed the lawsuit against Netflix, Rainey's estate, and others at New York Supreme Court, two days before the show started streaming on October 30.\n\nThe complaint seeks an undetermined amount of monetary damages for six claims, from fraud to defamation, and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nAnother request to stop the show from screening was not granted in time.\n\nThe complaint says Napolitano 'was not remotely close to be like or appear as the person that is on screen' and that she 'never had any bone to pick' with Rainey.\n\nNapolitano 'was set up as such a villain for purposes of controversy and conflict, all of which was a patently and deliberately false portrayal to support the false narrative of the truth,' it adds.\n\nNetflix did not answer our request for comment.\n\nNapolitano told DailyMail.com that she could not 'take any risks' by discussing her abduction amid the lawsuit.\n\n'I don't talk about the case at all,' she said."

        "article_content": "KUWAIT CITY, Nov 16: During a hearing by the US House Oversight Committee, Kuwait emerged as a focal point in discussions -- not for political or economic reasons but due to its association with unidentified flying objects (UFOs), reports Al-Seyassah daily. A 13-minute high-definition video of a UFO, technically referred to as an \u201cunidentified space object,\u201d was presented at the hearing on Thursday.\n\nThe clip reportedly filmed 20 miles off the coast of Kuwait from a helicopter, depicted a white spherical object, later joined briefly by a second identical sphere. The footage was sourced from the US Department of Defense\u2019s Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), which handles classified information. Journalist Michael Shellenberger, who obtained the video from an undisclosed source, shared the details during the session. According to the American Sky News network, the video provides one of the clearest documentation of UFOs over the Middle East.\n\nA report by Raseef22, an electronic magazine, highlighted Kuwait\u2019s history of UFO sightings, noting that the country ranks prominently among Arab nations experiencing such phenomena. The report attributes Kuwait\u2019s geographical location, in a region that has witnessed significant wars (e.g., the Iraq-Iran War and the Second Gulf War), as a potential factor for the increased frequency of sightings.\n\nThe Raseef22 report recounted notable UFO incidents in Kuwait:\n\n1970: A cylindrical object, larger than an airplane, was sighted over the Umm Al-Aish area.\n\n1978: Eyewitnesses reported a UFO landing near the media complex in the capital, temporarily disrupting television broadcasts.\n\n1986: Radar systems detected a mysterious object near Ahmadi, approximately 15 kilometers from the border, exhibiting unusual movement.\n\nA study by the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) suggested that UFO sightings are more frequent in regions of military conflict, adding credibility to the correlation between war zones and such phenomena. The hearing and the accompanying revelations about Kuwait bring the UFO debate closer to the Middle East, emphasizing the need for global cooperation in studying unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Whether these sightings hold scientific, security, or extraterrestrial significance remains an open question."

Maybe, but not because of Apple Intelligence.\n\nThis past week Google officially launched the Gemini app on iOS, allowing iPhone users to get the complete Gemini AI experience. The app is launching just weeks after Apple released the first version of its new Apple Intelligence AI platform, which also included a ChatGPT integration.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis means the iPhone now has access to all of the three biggest AI platforms... well, sort of. Here's what iPhone users should know about the new Gemini app, how it compares to Apple Intelligence, and why the iPhone could be the best device for AI now.\n\nGoogle brings Gemini app to iPhone\n\nThe Gemini app is now available for free on the App Store, although it is only compatible with iPhones at launch (sorry, iPad users). It includes the full suite of Gemini features such as text and image generation, live chat, study aid tools, image search, assistant features, and more. It's worth noting that you may need a Google Gemini Advanced subscription to access certain features.\n\nAll that's required to download the Gemini app is iOS 16 or above (and adequate storage, of course). That includes all iPhone models starting with the iPhone 8 and later, plus the iPhone SE 2nd and 3rd generation.\n\nThis is important to note since very few iPhones are compatible with Apple Intelligence right now. Only the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max, iPhone 16/16 Plus, and iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max can access Apple Intelligence as of late 2024. That's a far smaller list of compatible devices compared with those that can download the new Google Gemini app.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis opens new options for iPhone users who want to tap into AI. If you can't access Apple Intelligence, you now have a competitive new alternative. On the other hand, if you can access Apple Intelligence, you might now be wondering if it's still the best AI tool for your phone.\n\nApple Intelligence vs Google Gemini app\n\napple intelligence vs google gemini\n\nApple Intelligence and Google Gemini are both AI platforms that use large language models to generate text and images and comprehend verbal, text, and visual input from users. Both have some similar features, such as text and image generation, assistant features, and writing aid tools. However, there are some major differences iPhone users should know.\n\nFirst, it's important to keep in mind that Apple Intelligence is still in its early stages. Google Gemini has been out for longer (previously under the name \"Bard\"). As a result, it is a much more fleshed-out AI platform right now. Apple Intelligence will eventually have most of the same features, but Apple is planning to slowly roll them out over the next year, so you may be in for a long wait.\n\nThe main advantage of waiting it out for Apple Intelligence is privacy. Apple Intelligence is only compatible with specific iPhones because it runs mainly on-device, meaning it doesn't send all of your data to the cloud to process AI tasks. Gemini is a cloud-based AI platform, so be aware that Google will most likely save and utilize data from your Gemini interactions in some capacity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn contrast, Apple emphasized early on that it would not use iPhone users' personal data to train Apple Intelligence. If any data does need to go to the cloud for processing, it is completely anonymized, preserving users' privacy. If data security is important to you, Apple Intelligence may be the better AI platform if it's compatible with your iPhone.\n\nIs the iPhone the best device for AI now?\n\niphone 15 pro max in front of apple intelligence icons\n\nThe launch of Apple Intelligence coupled with the new Gemini app has quickly made the iPhone arguably the best device for AI, perhaps second only to a MacBook. At the very least, the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max and iPhone 16 line-up are now the best phones for AI since they have access to the most AI algorithms.\n\nWe predicted early this year that apps would become the best way to experience AI, rather than dedicated devices. This has largely panned out, especially on the iPhone. That's partly due to the sheer reach the iPhone has thanks to its massive user base. iPhones make up five out of the top ten bestselling smartphones in the world right now.\n\nSo, if a developer wants to get their AI platform to a large number of people as efficiently as possible, launching an iPhone app is the obvious strategy. Of course, that might not be good news if you're an Android user. However, if you're intrigued by the explosion in AI development this year and want to have access to the most algorithms possible, it might be time to buy an iPhone."

        "article_content": "In the new horror movie, \u201cHeretic,\u201d Hugh Grant plays a diabolical religious skeptic who traps two scared missionaries in his house and tries to violently shake their faith.\n\nWhat starts more as a religious studies lecture slowly morphs into a gory escape room for the two door-knocking members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, underscoring just how well-suited religion can be for terrifying and entertaining thrill-seeking moviegoers.\n\n\u201cI think it is a fascinating religion-related horror as it raises questions about the institution of religion, the patriarchy of religion,\u201d said Stacey Abbott, a film professor at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, whose research interests include horror, vampires and zombies.\n\n\u201cBut it also questions the nature of faith and confronts the audience with a debate about choice, faith and free will.\u201d\n\nHorror has had a decades-long attraction to religion, Christianity especially in the U.S., with the 1970s \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Omen\u201d being prime examples. Beyond the jump scares, the supernatural elements of horror and its sublime nature pair easily with belief and spirituality \u2014 and religion\u2019s exploration of big existential questions, Abbott said. Horror is subversive. Real-life taboo topics and cultural anxieties are fair game.\n\n\u201cIt is a rich canvas for social critique and it can also be a space to reassert traditional values,\u201d Abbott said in an email.\n\nDeath, demons and other tough topics religion and horror address\n\nReligions and horror tackle similar questions about what it means to be human \u2014 how people relate to one another and the world, said Brandon Grafius, a Biblical studies professor at Ecumenical Theological Seminary in Detroit and an expert on Christianity and horror.\n\n\u201cSo much of religion is about how we grapple with the reality of death. \u2026 Helping us make meaning even in the face of that reality,\u201d said Grafius. \u201cHorror really serves that same process, as a way to reflect on death.\u201d\n\nNot only does Christianity translate well for U.S. audiences, it has a lot of raw material for moviemakers to work with, he said.\n\n\u201cChristianity emerged as a strongly dualistic religion, where forces are either good or evil,\u201d Grafius said. \u201cEven though the U.S. is moving away from being a nation dominated by Christianity, we still have that dualism deep in our bones.\u201d\n\nAmong the more recent religion-themed horror films, \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d franchise, including \u201cThe Nun\u201d movies, show paranormal investigators battling demons, Abbott said, while \u201cThe First Omen\u201d and \u201cImmaculate\u201d offer critiques of patriarchal attempts to control women\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cThese films seem to be a direct response to many of the debates that are happening in the U.S. these days,\u201d Abbott wrote in her email. \u201cThese different approaches to religion in horror illustrate the way in which the genre is engaging with a very live debate around religion or more specifically how religion is being used to assert control (which is what \u2018Heretic\u2019 is all about).\u201d\n\nGrant, who plays Mr. Reed in the new movie, told The Associated Press that he shared some of his \u201cHeretic\u201d character\u2019s skepticism, although not necessarily from a religious perspective:\n\n\u201cThere is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit.\u201d\n\nHorror can be challenging. It acts as a dark mirror that can reveal things people don\u2019t want to admit and fears they don\u2019t want to face, said the Rev. Ryan Duns, a Jesuit priest and theology chair at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\nIf done well, both religion and horror are unsettling, he said.\n\n\u201cReligion, when it unsettles, asks us am I living up to the person I have been called to be or am I complicit in systems of violence, oppression, injustice, going with the status quo,\u201d said Duns, who wrote the \u201cTheology of Horror\u201d and teaches a course on it as well. \u201cIn the horror movie, the monster threatens normality \u2014 threatens to destroy our status quo.\u201d\n\nBut they deviate from there. In horror, there is no way out, Duns said. He pointed out that defeating a movie\u2019s monster doesn\u2019t prevent sequels, hence \u201cJaws 2,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d \u201cReturn of the Killer Tomatoes\u201d and more.\n\nIn Christianity, it is Jesus and the Gospels threatening the status quo, but they offer hope and a way out, he said.\n\nTi West mixes religion into the narrative of his new movie, \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d a horror film about an adult film star trying to break into mainstream movies. West, who also wrote and directed \u201cThe Sacrament,\u201d a horror movie inspired by the Jonestown Massacre in 1978, said he doesn\u2019t actively set out to tell stories with prominent religion narratives, but religion can be ripe for mining.\n\n\u201cIt kind of depends on the story,\u201d West said, \u201cAnything with morality wrapped up into it, they kind of go hand in hand at times. And it\u2019s like religion is such a major part of every culture everywhere that \u2026 I feel like sometimes it\u2019s such a major part of life that gets put aside in movies.\u201d\n\nWhen religion works in horror \u2014 and when it doesn\u2019t\n\nBeyond poor storytelling, the mixing of horror and religion can go wrong if the movie is meant to offend the believers of a particular faith, said Lisa Morton, an award-winning horror author whose written books on Halloween and paranormal history.\n\nBut it can really go right. Morton\u2019s all-time favorite movie is \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a holy horror icon and a peak example of the genre. \u201cThe Omen\u201d followed it.\n\n\u201cAll of the contemporary bloodlines kind of trace back through those two,\u201d said Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how they keep getting rebooted over and over.\u201d\n\nAbbott agrees religion should be portrayed respectfully, just as she expects accuracy and respect for science in movies, though not every detail needs to be perfect. \u201cBut some horror films, like exorcism movies, are built upon the fact that they are drawing upon real rituals and then taking them to a more extreme conclusion,\u201d she said.\n\nOsgood Perkins, who wrote and directed \u201cLonglegs,\u201d a horror movie about an occultist serial killer, invented the religious material in his film, piecing together whatever felt right from his imagination and real life.\n\n\u201cI just make it up,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cBut then you catch hold of something like the Bible verse and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this is really rich.\u2019 Beasts coming out of the sea with heads and horns and crowns and things like that. I didn\u2019t make that up.\u201d\n\nFor Duns, an accurate portrayal of religious rituals and symbols \u2014 without over doing it \u2014 can add heft to a scene.\n\n\u201cThe rituals of the churches have been stylized and lived out for centuries,\u201d Duns said. \u201cWhen movies are silly or are sloppy with it, the power of the gesture and the power of the symbols are lost.\u201d"

It sounds like something from a sci-fi movie, but thanks to a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have proof that this icy continent was once home to a thriving jungle.\n\nResearchers discovered the first pieces of amber found in Antarctica during an internationally-led mission back in 2017. The discovery gives us an extraordinary glimpse into a 90-million-year-old landscape as vibrant as any tropical paradise.\n\nThe tiny amber fragments\u2014each only a millimeter in size\u2014hold massive secrets about Antarctica\u2019s past. The amber is believed to have come from the jungle of coniferous trees that once called Antarctica home millions of years ago. A new study published in Antarctic Science highlights how the trees responsible for the amber would have had to survive months of total darkness during the mid-Cretaceous period.\n\nImage source: tonguy324 / Adobe\n\nBut survive they did, leaving behind markers in the forms of fossilized roots, spores, and even pollen\u2014all of which have been discovered by scientists exploring the region. All of this has long hinted at Antarctica having a forested past. However, the discovery of amber fragments is the first tangible evidence that resin-producing trees actually thrived here at one point.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

The mid-Cretaceous was a greenhouse world, a model for what our warming planet could resemble in the centuries ahead. As scientists analyze the amber fragments from Antarctica\u2019s ancient jungle, they hope to learn how life adapted to extreme conditions.\n\nThose same extreme conditions could one day be a part of our daily lives thousands of years down the line. Learning how these trees and perhaps even the insects that existed then survived long, dark winters and still came back to thrive each year could be pivotal in helping us prepare for the long road ahead, especially as Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets continue to melt each year."
