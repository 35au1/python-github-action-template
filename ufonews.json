Chief among them is Adobe, whose Terms of Service debacle in the summer led to a fierce backlash from creatives. But the brand's latest move might just help ingratiate the company with AI-sceptics.\n\nThe company has announced a new Content Authenticity Web App designed to \"champion creator protection and attribution\". An extension of the Content Authenticity Initiative we've already seen Adobe develop over the last couple of years, the new web app offers a free way for creators to apply content credentials to their work.\n\nAdobe\n\nAs well as adding credentials, the web app lets creators set AI training and usage preferences, essentially letting artists opt-out of being trained by models. Of course, this relies on other models recognising this, but Adobe is \"actively working to drive industry-wide adoption of this preference.\"\n\nA free, public beta of the Adobe Content Authenticity web app will be available in Q1 2025, and users can sign up for more information here. As well as the web app, there'll also be a handy Chrome extension for inspecting credentials.\n\nAdobe Content Credentials web app\n\n\"Adobe\u2019s new tool for signing artwork is a game-changer,\" gushes illustrator Pepita Sandwich via the Adobe website. \"It makes adding Content Credentials to digital pieces easy and professional. The interface is intuitive and ensures seamless integration, while the security features give me peace of mind. I also love that it offers the option to opt-out of AI training\u2014perfect for protecting my creative rights.\"\n\nIt's certainly a timely move for a company that has endured its fair share of criticism from artists this year, as well as facing the small matter of getting sued by the US government over its convoluted cancellation processes. But with the brand having previously committed to \"doing the right thing\" when it comes to AI, focussing its efforts on the Content Authenticity Initiative seems like a wise move."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nHugging Face, the fast-growing AI startup valued at about $4.5 billion, has launched Gradio 5, a major update to its popular open-source tool for creating machine learning applications. The new version aims to make AI development more accessible, potentially speeding up enterprise adoption of machine learning technologies.\n\nGradio, which Hugging Face acquired in 2021, has quickly become a cornerstone of the company\u2019s offerings. With over 2 million monthly users and more than 470,000 applications built on the platform, Gradio has emerged as a key player in the AI development ecosystem.\n\nBridging the gap: Python proficiency meets web development ease\n\nThe latest version aims to bridge the gap between machine learning expertise and web development skills. \u201cMachine learning developers are very comfortable programming in Python, and oftentimes, less so with the nuts and bolts of web development,\u201d explained Abubakar Abid, Founder of Gradio, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \u201cGradio lets developers build performant, scalable apps that follow best practices in security and accessibility, all in just a few lines of Python.\u201d\n\nOne of the most notable features of Gradio 5 is its focus on enterprise-grade security. Abid highlighted this aspect, telling VentureBeat, \u201cWe hired Trail of Bits, a well-known cybersecurity company, to do an independent audit of Gradio, and included fixes for all the issues that they found in Gradio 5\u2026 For Gradio developers, the key benefit is that your Gradio 5 apps will, out-of-the-box, follow best practices in web security, even if you are not an expert in web security yourself.\u201d\n\nAI-assisted app creation: Enhancing development with natural language prompts\n\nThe release also introduces an experimental AI Playground, allowing developers to generate and preview Gradio apps using natural language prompts. Ahsen Khaliq, ML Growth Lead at Gradio, emphasized the importance of this feature, saying, \u201cSimilar to other AI coding environments, you can enter a text prompt explaining what kind of app you want to build and an LLM will turn it into Gradio code. But unlike other coding environments, you can also see an instant preview of your Gradio app and run it in the browser.\u201d\n\nThis innovation could dramatically reduce the time and expertise needed to create functional AI applications, potentially making AI development more accessible to a wider range of businesses and developers.\n\nGradio\u2019s position in the AI ecosystem is becoming increasingly central. \u201cOnce a model is available on a hub like the Hugging Face Hub or downloaded locally, developers can wrap it into a web app using Gradio in a few lines of code,\u201d Khaliq explained. This flexibility has led to Gradio being used in notable projects like Chatbot Arena, Open NotebookLM, and Stable Diffusion.\n\nFuture-proofing enterprise AI: Gradio\u2019s roadmap for innovation\n\nThe launch of Gradio 5 comes at a time when enterprise adoption of AI is accelerating. By simplifying the process of creating production-ready AI applications, Hugging Face is positioning itself to capture a significant share of this growing market.\n\nLooking ahead, Abid hinted at ambitious plans for Gradio: \u201cMany of the changes we\u2019ve made in Gradio 5 are designed to enable new functionality that we will be shipping in the coming weeks\u2026 Stay tuned for: multi-page Gradio apps, navbars and sidebars, support for running Gradio apps on mobile using PWA and potentially native app support, more built-in components to support new modalities that are emerging around images and video, and much more.\u201d\n\nAs AI continues to impact various industries, tools like Gradio 5 that connect advanced technology with practical business applications are likely to play a vital role. With this release, Hugging Face is not just updating a product \u2014 it\u2019s potentially altering the landscape of enterprise AI development."

        "article_content": "The bomb that was \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d loomed large over this past weekend, but further down the box office tally lies a success story: the limited-release documentary \u201cSam and Colby: The Legends of the Paranormal\u201d finished sixth despite playing to just 350 screens nationwide.\n\nThis feat is just the latest example of YouTubers finding mainstream traction through horror \u2014 a genre that has been one of the most eclectic and innovative corners of YouTube \u2014 though the platform has made it increasingly difficult for some of these creators to reach audiences.\n\nOriginally launching a general vlogging channel in 2014, Sam and Colby gained most of their 13 million subscribers after going all in on paranormal investigation videos. The pair\u2019s most popular videos are one-to-two-hour explorations of such iconic haunts as the Stanley Hotel (43 million views), the Queen Mary (22 million views) and the house that inspired \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d (39 million views).\n\nA staple of Sam and Colby\u2019s channel is Hell Week, an annual tradition where the pair release their biggest and scariest project of the year each October. Last year\u2019s limited 168-theater run with Cinemark for their \u201cConjuring\u201d house series sold out at every location, and so the duo upped the distribution to 350 screens for \u201cLegends.\u201d\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates \u201cLegends\u201d grossed around $1.76 million over the weekend, even with the movie playing to the fewest number of theaters in the top 10. The high fan turnout generated an average of nearly $6,000 per theater.\n\nSam and Colby\u2019s box office win speaks to the unassuming power of niche yet large online communities and the ability of online content to compete with mainstream entertainment \u2014 something on which Michael Bay is banking as he preps \u201cSkibidi Toilet\u201d for the big leagues.\n\nBut it\u2019s also just the latest instance of horror-focused creators jumping from YouTube to the mainstream. Last year saw the release of A24\u2019s \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d the acclaimed debut film written and directed by Danny and Michael Philippou, better known as RackaRacka to their 6.86 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nPremiering the week after \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d weekend, \u201dTalk to Me\u201d not only went on to earn over $92 million globally but it\u2019s A24\u2019s third-highest-grossing film behind Best Picture winner \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and summer blockbuster \u201cCivil War.\u201d\n\nThe success of \u201cTalk to Me\u201d has seemingly opened the floodgates for scare-inclined creators to reach audiences beyond YouTube. A24 is looking to YouTube again for its next horror hit, this time striking a deal with 18-year-old Ken Parsons for a film based on his \u201climinal space\u201d-inspired \u201cBackrooms\u201d series.\n\nCurry Barker, who has made online waves with his award-winning short horror films (most recently the unsettling \u201cMilk & Serial,\u201d inspired by YouTube prank channels), is currently working on a full-length feature with \u201c47 Meters Down\u201d producer James Harris. In the meantime, YouTube film critic Chris Stuckmann\u2019s debut supernatural feature \u201cShelby Oaks,\u201d which raised over $1 million on Kickstarter, will be released by Neon next year.\n\nIt should be noted that this new era of online-bred scares hardly came out of nowhere. Horror is one of YouTube\u2019s most prolific genres, and its presence on the platform spans as far back as YouTube itself.\n\nAs a film genre, horror is often associated with low budgets, scrappy filmmaking and craftiness in the face of technical limitations \u2014 qualities that can also be applied to YouTubers, especially in the early \u201cBroadcast Yourself\u201d days. Some of the site\u2019s first viral scripted series, such as \u201cLonelygirl15\u201d and \"Marble Hornets,\u201d adapted \u201cfound footage\u201d-style horror for the vlogging era, sparking fierce online debates over whether these shows were real.\n\nDuring the 2010s, BuzzFeed\u2019s \u201cUnsolved\u201d series adapted the supernatural reality show format \u2014 a well-performing, if famously embellished, staple of cable \u2014 for online audiences, becoming one of the content studio\u2019s most beloved titles. The show\u2019s creator, Ryan Bergara, and co-host Shane Madej even leveraged the popularity of \u201cUnsolved\u201d to launch their own production company, Watcher Entertainment, alongside fellow BuzzFeed creator Steven Lim.\n\nToday, unscripted paranormal investigations are a fixture on YouTube. Offerings like Sam and Colby\u2019s or Watcher\u2019s \u201cGhost/Mystery Files,\u201d the spiritual successor to \u201cBuzzFeed Unsolved,\u201d regularly thrill millions with ghost hunts and paranormal encounters. Even non-horror YouTubers will occasionally embark on a ghost hunt for easy views.\n\nBut the biggest innovations for the horror genre are still coming from ambitious filmmakers including RackaRacka and Barker, despite YouTube\u2019s algorithm and monetization policy becoming more restrictive over the years. As part of its bid to keep advertisers happy and shed its amateurish reputation, YouTube is far from the wild West, anything-goes video platform that allowed creators to get gory in the 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nAs a result, creators of all genres are subject to the same monetization rules, which generally favor family-friendly content. The guys behind RackaRacka have even said they make little to no money on their videos \u2014 breakneck, bloody and stunt-fueled horror comedies \u2014 despite the millions of views on each.\n\nOn top of potentially being demonetized, more provocative creators also must contend with age-restriction warnings, which require users to sign into their YouTube account to confirm their age before watching the video. The issue is less about forcing users to sign in, and more that the ability for the video to be picked up by YouTube\u2019s algorithm and reach new audiences is drastically reduced. Creators can manually mark their videos as 18+, but that still impacts each one\u2019s standing in the algorithm and access to ad placement.\n\nYouTube\u2019s automation is also known to automatically age-restrict generally inoffensive videos \u2014 ones containing too many swear words, for instance \u2014 putting creators\u2019 livelihoods at risk. YouTube did loosen some of its monetization rules following creator backlash last year, but the constantly changing policies are still something creators need to tiptoe around.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, YouTube offers horror creators a platform to experiment, build a following and potentially break through. YouTube has also introduced additional income streams for creators outside of ads, including revenue from YouTube Premium and paid channel memberships in the vein of Patreon.\n\n\u201cWe welcome a variety of content and expression on YouTube, but not all videos are a fit for all advertisers, such as content that is age-restricted,\u201d said a spokesperson for the company. \u201cIn recent years, we have taken steps to increase transparency around our advertiser-friendly guidelines and have opened up new monetization opportunities, like channel memberships for creators whose content may not suit all advertisers. We\u2019ll continue to listen to the creator community about how we can support their success.\u201d\n\nAs YouTube takes on major streaming platforms, transforms its TV app into a full-on streaming platform and advocates for major awards recognition on behalf of its creators, it would be remiss to leave its horror-leaning creators out of the conversation.\n\nEven the most non-advertiser-friendly corners of the genre still generate passionate fandoms, and films like \u201cTalk to Me\u201d \u2014 and even \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d the indie horror game turned major franchise thanks to a fervent YouTube fanbase \u2014 prove that wider audiences are interested.\n\nAnd when it comes to the content itself, the quality is there. Barker\u2019s short films wouldn\u2019t look out of place next to Netflix\u2019s horror offerings. All YouTube has to do now is give these creators greater license to scare the hell out of more people."

        "article_content": "[author: Catherine J. Moynihan**]\n\nThe hype around Gen AI has contributed to a wave of interest in how to apply many forms of AI, not just Gen AI. As companies promote the adoption of AI enterprise-wide to remain competitive, some in-house legal departments are enjoying less restraint on investments tied to the use of AI-powered technology. Many are doing it the hard way \u2014 trying to apply emerging Gen AI technology to address specific, narrow pain points \u2014 and overlooking broader legal operation needs.\n\nWhile Gen AI can perform incredibly useful tasks, from answering questions about policies to redlining contracts, these tools typically lack the workflow orchestration and administration features that are critical for managing processes and gathering performance management data.\n\nAs the interest in using AI-driven technology continues to grow, it makes sense to consider investing in AI-powered workflow automation (WFA) solutions that are quickly adding Gen AI.\n\nLow/No Code Workflow Automation Solutions\u2019 Capabilities\n\nThe leading solutions marketed to corporate legal departments (Bryter, Checkbox, Josef, Kim, MyLegal, Neota, OnitX, TAP, and Tonkean) provide workflow applications and \u201ccitizen developer\u201d building blocks, along with strong integration, administration, document automation, compliance, and security capabilities.\n\nBuyers of WFA technology are advised to consider how these providers\u2019 approaches align with their needs in the following key areas:\n\nWorkflow Management \u2014 Controlling the flow of tasks, processes, or actions is generally handled under one of two approaches:\n\nDecision tree-oriented solutions use a flowchart structure. Their logic-based approach is intuitive to lawyers, with easy-to-follow visual representations, but interdependencies are more difficult to manage.\n\nsolutions use a flowchart structure. Their logic-based approach is intuitive to lawyers, with easy-to-follow visual representations, but interdependencies are more difficult to manage. Orchestration-focused solutions provide a centralized way to design and control workflows involving multiple tasks, systems, and actors. The tools gather data, monitor status, and trigger the next tasks. They are well-suited for complex workflows, but management can be challenging.\n\nIntegration \u2014 Interacting with adjacent systems, in the legal department or across functions, involves approaches that can be combined to facilitate making connections without engaging IT:\n\nOut-of-the-box integrations to commonly used collaboration tools such as Slack, Teams, and Outlook to \u201cmeet clients where they are.\u201d They are typically as simple as providing credentials to enable a link between the two systems.\n\nto commonly used collaboration tools such as Slack, Teams, and Outlook to \u201cmeet clients where they are.\u201d They are typically as simple as providing credentials to enable a link between the two systems.

Mastery can involve a learning curve, so administrator \u201cmindshare\u201d matters.\n\nDocument Automation \u2014 A number of workflow solutions automate the process of generating personalized documents efficiently and consistently. Common use cases include high-volume or low-risk contracts.\n\nBulk Processes and Campaigns \u2014 Some WFA solutions can launch processes at scale across many users:\n\n\u201cBatch\u201d processes involve data iteration and parallel execution. Use cases include issuing addenda per new regulations or policies and issuing outside counsel guideline updates \u2014 often one-way processes.\n\ninvolve data iteration and parallel execution. Use cases include issuing addenda per new regulations or policies and issuing outside counsel guideline updates \u2014 often one-way processes. Campaigns are multi-step processes involving a variety of tasks. They provide a \u201cwizard\u201d for executing and tracking progress. They are well-suited for two-way, iterative processes, such as compliance audits and policy management processes.\n\nCompliance and Security \u2014 Typically, audit trails and role-based access controls (user, builder, and administrator), while some provide fine-grained permissions using rules, geography, roles, data, actions (e.g., run or edit), and the specific workflow in use. Most WFA solutions provide data residency in both the US and Europe, with an ever-broader range of options.\n\nHow AI Supports Workflow Automation\n\nAI appears extensively across low/no code workflow automation solutions. Under this umbrella, more common capabilities include:\n\nIntelligent document processing, using optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP).\n\nData mapping and transformation between different formats, making it easier to integrate and process information from various sources.\n\nDecision automation using predefined rules and data inputs, which is especially helpful for applying conditional logic to determine workflow paths.\n\nMachine learning in low-code WFA to support continuous improvement based on new data and changing conditions.\n\nIt is interesting to understand what goes on \u201cunder the hood,\u201d but the focus should be on how the solution meets anticipated needs. Teams benefit by thoroughly testing solutions and planning for a \u201chuman in the loop.\u201d For example, a sophisticated paralegal with an AI-based contract redlining tool can conduct a first-pass analysis, minimizing the number of people needing training.\n\nHow Gen AI Is Enhancing WFA Tools\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding Gen AI has driven emerging capabilities to interpret queries, requests, and documents (all unstructured) and generate responses. Here are a few examples:\n\nBryter has added \u201cAI Agents\u201d for employees to get answers to policy questions, run health checks on policies, search across a defined knowledge base, extract data, and review contracts for deadlines and clauses.\n\nCheckbox has enhanced its \u201cfront door\u201d to the legal department with an \u201cAI Legal Chatbot\u201d that automatically responds and routes requests based on company policies and playbooks.\n\nJosefQ, which uses Gen AI for policy Q&A, can be implemented by itself or with Josef\u2019s core WFA tool.\n\nNeota, in keeping with its modular approach, announced the release of its \u201cAzure OpenAI Building Block\u201d for extracting text, language translations, and drafting context-aware messages.\n\nOnitX\u2019s \u201cCatalyst Virtual Assistant\u201d answers questions and drafts follow-up emails using the context of stored legal service request, matter, and contracts data.\n\nMitratech\u2019s TAP announced enhanced features that include text summarization and natural language search.\n\nTonkean\u2019s \u201cAI Front Door,\u201d which classifies legal service requests for routing and reporting, includes a \u201cLegalGPT\u201d chatbot and an \u201cAI Concierge\u201d help feature for business users.\n\nBefore the advent of Gen AI, these tools already used AI to interact with clients and to kick off and intelligently execute automated workflows. Now, with Gen AI enhancements, the client interface is more conversational. Chatbots can answer questions clearly and accurately, and lawyers can save time with better search and strong summarization and drafting capabilities.\n\nLegal departments that obtain WFA tools begin harnessing the power of AI and Gen AI within the infrastructure of software solutions that also provide integration, administration, document automation, compliance, and security capabilities. As AI evolves, so will the tools.\n\nObtain the Key Solution Components to expect, fact-based analysis, and evaluations of the nine Advanced Solutions in the 2024 Hyperion Low/No Code Workflow Automation MarketView\u2122 Report.\n\n** Catherine J.

I can\u2019t provide benchmarks or test some of the more advanced features that aren\u2019t available yet. But the EliteBook X G1a is a tantalizing vision.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDesign\n\nHP makes some good-looking and high-quality laptops. The EliteBook X G1a is a prime example. It\u2019s solid as a rock all around, with no bending, flexing, or twisting in the lid, keyboard deck, or chassis. And it all seems crafted from chunks of aluminum in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of of Apple\u2019s MacBooks. The silver color scheme is elegant and refined, with a chrome HP logo that stands out without being mere bling.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nThe hinge is smooth when opening the lid with one hand, and it stays firmly in place. It might be a pre-production unit, but it doesn\u2019t need much adjusting. I like the look and feel quite a bit, and I\u2019m sure HP\u2019s business market will agree.\n\nI don\u2019t have full specs for the laptop. But, it\u2019s not the thinnest or lightest 14-inch laptop. In fact, it\u2019s a little chunky compared to something like the incredibly thin MacBook Air M3 that\u2019s closer to a 14-inch than a 13-inch laptop. I don\u2019t mind it, but it\u2019s not going to lead its class. The display bezels are small enough to keep its width and depth in check, but the Dell XPS 14 remains the best in that department.\n\nI also liked the slightly rounded edges on the palm rest. That made it comfortable for longer typing sessions, like writing up this first look. Overall, I found the same kind of fastidious design that I\u2019ve always perceived in Apple products.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nHP also makes good keyboards. Its Spectre keyboards have always been among my favorites on Windows laptops, coming very close to my overall favorite, Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard. And they put a great keyboard in the EliteBook X G1a.\n\nFirst, the keycap size and key spacing is perfect, and HP put high-contrast lettering that stands out against the dark gray keys. That makes the lettering easier to see even without the backlighting turned on, and it\u2019s an accessibility feature for those with poor vision. Then, the switches are deep enough at 1.5mm, and they\u2019re precise and snappy. They\u2019re also consistent across the entire keyboard, including the space bar that can be too loose on some keyboards.\n\nThe touchpad is mechanical, which is a bit of a disappointment. Haptic touchpads are becoming more common on premium laptops, and HP has a great one on the Spectre x360 14. I wish it were available here. The touchpad is plenty large and its buttons have quiet, confident clicks. So it\u2019s a good mechanical touchpad.\n\nThe display is touch-enabled, which I like. Overall, input options are excellent even if I wish the touchpad were a haptic version.\n\nConnectivity and webcam\n\nThe EliteBook X G1a has plenty of connectivity, with a couple of Thunderbolt 4 ports, USB-C and USB-A, and an HDMI port. Again, I don\u2019t know all the specs, including wireless connectivity, but I have no doubt it\u2019s up-to-date and that cellular connectivity will be an option. Note that the inclusion of Thunderbolt 4 is a little surprising given the AMD chipset. That\u2019s usually not a thing.\n\nThe webcam is a 5MP version, but it\u2019s not just a high-res webcam. It includes on-chip AI processing that enables enhanced user presence detection that, for example, blurs the screen automatically when two people are in view. There\u2019s also the usual AI-enhanced functionality we expect with Microsoft\u2019s various Copilot+ features, and Poly Camera Pro that further enhances video quality and performance using the neural processing unit (NPU).\n\nPerformance\n\nHP uses a custom version of AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 9, specifically the R9-12c PRO that\u2019s based on the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 PRO. It enables the kind of security and manageability that enterprises demand, along with the sheer power of the Ryzen AI 9 chipset. I don\u2019t have details on the chipset and I can\u2019t publish any benchmarks.\n\nThe custom aspect is that the HP-specific chipset has faster on-device AI thanks to an NPU that runs at up to 55 tera operations per second (TOPS). That\u2019s faster than any other chipset available today, and that means faster AI processing with the efficiency of the NPU compared to using the GPU.\n\nThere\u2019s also custom RAM that runs at up to 8,000 MT/s, faster than you\u2019ll see from other AMD chipsets. That, too, helps speed up AI processing. And HP will be introducing its AI Companion software that will enable a variety of AI features above and beyond what Copilot+ provides. AI Companion includes Analyze that lets you dig into files, along with other features that have yet to be fully explained. All of the features will run on-device, though, keeping things theoretically safer and more private and using the NPU to maintain efficiency.\n\nHP also updated its SmartSense feature to use AI to better manage performance and fan speed. Now, there are just two options available \u2014 SmartSense and Best Performance \u2014 meaning that users won\u2019t need to spend as much time managing the EliteBook X G1a\u2019s performance, heat, and noise. We\u2019ll have to wait until we can run benchmarks to determine how effective the new software is in managing things.\n\nFinally, as a member of HP\u2019s business lineup, the EliteBook X G1a has Wolf Security for enhanced security and privacy.\n\nBattery life\n\nThe battery here is reasonably hefty at 74.5 watt-hours. That should be plenty to power the laptop for a reasonably long time regardless of the display choice. But, once again, it\u2019s not something I can test and report on.\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 9 chipset hasn\u2019t been as efficient as some others, though, such as Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake that we saw in the Asus Zenbook S 14.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nThere will be two display options with the EliteBook X G1a. There\u2019s a 14.0-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS panel and a 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED touch display. The latter runs at up to 120Hz, and it\u2019s the one on my pre-production unit.\n\nI can\u2019t test the display, but it seems to offer the same bright, dynamic colors and inky blacks that I expect out of a typical OLED display. The IPS panel will offer better battery life but much worse image quality.\n\nAudio is provided by a four-speaker setup \u2014 two downward-firing and two upward-firing. Dual microphones use AI Noise Reduction to improve quality.\n\nAn intriguing laptop for business users\n\nAt this point, the most I can say about the EliteBook X G1a is that it\u2019s an incredibly intriguing laptop with a host of features and functionality that could make for an elite (no pun intended) laptop for business users. It\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous and solidly built, even for a pre-production machine. And it promises great performance and AI integration.\n\nOf course, the devil will be in the details, including pricing, and those will have to wait until it\u2019s formally introduced. In the meantime, businesses should be looking into the EliteBook X G1a for its 2025 procurements."

        "article_content": "Jesse Anderson, managing director of the Big Data Institute and author of Data Teams, recently published the latest findings from his annual Data Teams Survey of 81 data leaders and engineers across a range of enterprise types. The 2024 survey shows a slow adoption of LLMs by data teams, a neutral impact from remote work, and an overall decline in the perception of delivered value. The survey also calls out that data-operations capabilities are missing from half of the respondents.\n\nThe Data Teams Survey\u2019s analysis emphasised the importance of spreading skills and cognitive load in the data domain across teams with data science, engineering, and operations capabilities. Anderson wrote that while data science and engineering teams are well-represented, \"operations teams are lacking in half of the respondents.\" Further, he also highlighted inconsistencies in how data teams tend to define the role of operations engineers, with only 20% aligning on a definition which covers systems engineering skills. He wrote:\n\nThe individual contributors must meet the criteria and definitions to represent the job title. We see well-represented responses for data scientists and data engineers with operations lagging.\n\nAnderson also published another article looking at the evolution of results from Data Teams Surveys between 2020 and 2024, in which he commented on the methodologies and practices used by data teams. Anderson wrote that over time he\u2019s seen a \"decline in DataOps and an increase in teams not using a methodology\" of any kind. Anderson wrote that \"choosing a methodology is still essential\" for successful teams.\n\nCommenting on differentiators between high and low-value teams, Anderson wrote that high performers followed \"more best practices.\" The survey showed that these practices include engineering norms such as unit testing, close business collaboration, picking the right technologies, and having appropriate cross-functional skills.\n\nA recent episode of the Data Engineering Podcast discussed the need for increased engineering and operational rigour in data teams with Petr Janda, founder of Synq.io. He started Synq, a data operations reliability and observability platform, following his experience with data teams that measured incident recovery times in weeks, compared to hours for other engineering teams. Janda talked about the need for incident resolution processes which factor in a granular, data specific, impact on stakeholders and downstream systems. Calling out missing processes, he said:\n\nEveryone was focusing on the problem of detecting issues \u2026 So once we detect that a certain table is missing data or that a certain test is now failing because some business validation is not met, what happens afterwards? What is the workflow from the perspective of finding the right team to deal with that issue, and assessing the impact on the company? Is this even an issue we have to deal with right now, or is that something that can wait and be dealt with later?\n\nAnderson also reviewed participants' responses to questions about their teams' delivery of value to the business. Looking back over previous surveys, he observed a downward trend that he said, \"should give everyone in the industry pause.\" Anderson noted that many respondents \"highlighted a disconnect between data teams and business needs.\" This was attributed to insufficient \"domain knowledge\" and issues with \"communicating data value to stakeholders.\" Anderson wrote:\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing this lower value creation trend anecdotally, and now we see it in the data. For a nascent industry like data teams, we should gradually increase the amount of value created or, at a minimum, stay the same. This downward trend has been troubling me for some time \u2026 It is concerning to me that there wasn\u2019t an increase in value creation over three years.\"\n\nOn the subject of remote work, the survey shows that the majority of respondents indicate that remote work has not impacted their team\u2019s productivity. The survey also showed a slow and shallow adoption of LLMs, with only 12% of surveyed teams using LLMs for data processing, which he described as their \"ideal\" use case. After accounting for 24% of teams not using LLMs at all, Anderson explained that the remainder primarily use them \"for code generation, ideation or copy creation, and code debugging.\"\n\nJanda concluded by reflecting on his hope that data teams would become more embedded into organisations\u2019 operational radar, rather than \"seeing data as this thing on the side.\" He also called out the need for more cross-functional skills on data teams, saying:\n\nI hope to see a lot more teams being cross-functional in the way I remember we removed boundaries between frontend and backend and infra teams, by creating cross-functional units."
