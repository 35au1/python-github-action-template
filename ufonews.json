        "article_content": "An alleged USAF intelligence insider has gone public with what he says is a 70-year history of the pentagon's negotiations with non-human intelligence \u2013 and says that a huge escalation is imminent\n\nOne of the most dramatic events in the history of mankind is set to take place in the coming months, according to claims from a UFO whistleblower. Charles McNeal alleges that he was recruited into a top-secret US Air Force intelligence unit tasked with maintaining a 70-year truce between the American government and an alien civilisation.\n\nThis truce agreement, McNeal claims (without any proof of his credentials) on his YouTube channel, is set to come to an end at the end of September 2024. He claims that a planned series of events, including the partial \u2013 or possibly total \u2013 destruction of the state of Israel, a brief global conflict and a staged alien invasion using reverse-engineered UFO technology will soon follow.\n\nOne of the first parts of this overarching plan, according to McNeal, will be the announcement of an alliance between the US and Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government.\n\nImage: Getty Images/Stocktrek Images) Getty Images/Stocktrek Images)\n\nMcNeal alleges that a slow drip feed of information, through both news outlets and fictional accounts of extraterrestrial contact through films and TV, has been part of a campaign to prepare the global population for the shock of encountering an alien species. \u201cThis is known as the Public Acclimation Program,\u201d he bizarrely says. \u201cFor decades you have been force-fed fictionalised version of the truth via TV, movies and books.\u201d\n\nHe outlines the entire shocking scheme on his \u201cAcclimate Now\u201d website, including an orchestrated third world war, the main purpose of which will be to intimidate the public while culling vast numbers of the civilian population. This war, he claims, will be interrupted by an \u201calien invasion\u201d that has been in the planning for decades.\n\nMany of the \u201calien craft\u201d on view during this phase, he claims, will in reality be a secret USAF development that he calls the TR3-B Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV).\n\nImage: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut soon, McNeal says, we willed be introduced to a variety of real aliens, including cybernetically enhanced humanoids from a planet in the Rigel star system: \u201cType A-C have a grey or greyish pigmentation that can come off a bit chalky sometimes,\" he says. \"They have four fingers with little suction cups on the ends of each finger and some have webbing in between their fingers and toes. Type D have a brownish pigmentation and five fingers and five toes.\n\n\u201cThis species started off fully biological until they ventured out into the cosmos and came into contact with what they now answer to, something called \"The Keeper\". They now worship technology and started to incorporate mechanics into their biological makeup thousands of years ago.\u201d\n\nHe further alleges that, following initial contact with these beings in the late 1940s, the US government has since had dealings with a number of different alien species over the years, and that news of all of these extraterrestrial civilisations will be made public in the coming few years.\n\nImage: US Navy/Youtube) US Navy/Youtube)\n\nBut even the public revelation of these alien visitors, he says, will not contain the whole truth:\u201dUnfortunately,\u201d McNeal says, \u201ceven the disclosure process is not planned to be 100% honest or transparent. It is only being used as tool for a very dangerous plan to bring the world together.\u201d\n\nMcNeal alleges that one of the core aims of this bizarre conspiracy is to establish a so-called \u201cNew World Order\u201d global government, under US control, to then establish a planet-wide alliance with these extraterrestrial visitors.\n\nBarring a few short videos of the alleged USAF \u201cAlien Reproduction Vehicle,\u201d McNeal has produced no hard evidence to support his claims. But, if his suggestion that the global realignment is set to begin at the end of September, we won\u2019t have long to wait to discover whether there is any truth to his allegations."

        "article_content": "When a Long Island-based UFO enthusiast named John Ford suspected that the government might be concealing information regarding a UFO crash landing, he resorted to some extreme lengths to ensure that the alleged truth about the existence of aliens prevailed. The chairman of LIUFON is the focus of the episode titled \u2018Lights Over Long Island\u2019 of Hulu\u2019s \u2018Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal.\u2019 It also features interviews with his associates, generating several questions regarding his well-being and current whereabouts.\n\nJohn Ford is Accused of Plotting to Murder Three Government Officials\n\nA big believer in UFOs, John Ford founded the Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON) in order to conduct studies related to the unknown and prove the existence of aliens through research and evidence. He and other members of LIUFON believed that a UFO had crash-landed in South Haven Park near the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the government officials were hiding them in the laboratory. When his research was constantly interrupted by the actions of the government, he reportedly devised a plan to kill three representatives \u2014 Anthony Gazzola, a leader of the Conservative Party in Brookhaven; John Powell, the chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee; and Fred Towle, a Suffolk legislator.\n\nHis plan involved putting radium in each of their car seats and mixing radioactive metal into their toothpaste, leading to them contracting fatal diseases. Not only that, reports suggested that he also had plans to set fire to the Suffolk Republican headquarters and promote Conservative Party politicians. When law enforcement learned about this conspiracy, they arrested John Ford in June 1996 and charged with three counts of second-degree criminal solicitation, three counts of second-degree conspiracy to commit murder, and one count of illegal possession of radioactive materials.\n\nUpon searching his property, they reportedly discovered five lead canisters containing the radioactive element radium, hand grenades, a mine detector, militia literature, ammunition, and around 50 handguns and rifles. Deeming him delusional, and thus, unfit for trial in 1997, John J. Ford was instead sent to the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, New York. About three years after his arrest, in 1999, the accused pleaded not responsible by reason of insanity.\n\nJohn Ford Seemingly Remains Admitted to a Mental Institution\n\nIn 2019, the retired court security officer from Bellport, John Ford, won a transfer order that allowed him to be released from a secure psychiatric hospital and admitted to a less restrictive one. Supreme Court Justice Elaine Zaritsky Slobod was of the opinion that John was not a danger to himself or anyone around him despite still being mentally ill. Along with her, his attorneys \u2014 Steven Metcalf II and Nanette Ida Metcalf \u2014 also spoke for their client, claiming that his mental health might improve if he is allowed to be in a less restrictive environment.\n\nIn Nanette\u2019s opinion, the significance of the conspiracy charges against him was the only reason John was kept confined in a mental institution for so many years. However, in 2019, she claimed that the Chairman of the Long Island UFO Network was \u201cvery competent, capable, calm.\u201d Around Christmas day in 2022, he was in good health and getting ready to return to court, fighting for his unsupervised privileges within the following few months.\n\nRead More: Tobias Wayland: Where is the Paranormal Investigator Now?"

While air fryers are popular in part because they are so easy to use, they can require some trial and error when it comes to cooking times and temperatures for food. As such, you might end up scouring the web to find out how long to cook fries or chicken wings, and if you\u2019ve ever visited a recipe site, you know how far you have to scroll for the information you need.\n\nAirFry.AI is a useful and free AI tool. Image source: AirFry.AI\n\nAirFry.AI removes all of the hassle and tells you precisely what you need to know. Input the food you\u2019re trying to cook, choose between \u00b0C and \u00b0F, and click the \u201cAir Fry\u201d button. When I searched for \u201cfrozen tater tots,\u201d this was the answer: \u201cCook frozen tater tots in an air fryer at 400\u00b0F for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cooking. Enjoy your crispy tater tots!\u201d\n\nNo long-winded videos or lengthy stories about the author\u2019s great-great-grandmother\u2019s original tater tots from the 1800s.

These responses are often longer and more detailed, providing a list of ingredients and a numbered set of instructions. When I searched for \u201cgarlic chicken wings,\u201d AirFry.AI told me how much of each spice to include as well as instructions for mixing, marinating, preheating, and cooking.\n\nObviously, you could use ChatGPT or any other generative AI chatbot for similar purposes, but having it all set up ahead of time makes it less overwhelming."

        "article_content": "Two genres mesh together in a uniquely grounded way for chilling new show Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal. The Hulu series digs into eight true crime cases containing elements of the paranormal world. The deep dive into these chilling stories is told through first-hand accounts from those who worked on the cases and family members of the deceased.\n\nMany of these cases have already made headlines, but have never been explored in this depth. Among those investigated are lizard people possibly motivating a Nashville bomber, a six-year-old\u2019s disappearance in the Smoky Mountains after being snatched by an ape-like beast, and the body of a Jersey teen found near the site of rumored witch activity.\n\nThe project comes from Duplass Brothers Productions and Number 18, the same creative team behind Sasquatch. Here executive producer Joshua Rof\u00e9 and producer Mark Duplass (The Morning Show) preview what\u2019s to come and how it may make you think twice about what you believe as myth or truth.\n\nWhat was the process like of deciding what cases you wanted to explore?\n\nJoshua Rof\u00e9: There were so many stories and cases we looked at. We wanted to make sure they can be first and foremost grounded in a certain amount of humanity. That was the bar we set for ourselves. Can we tell just human stories minus a genre element if you will and have it feel like a real documentary? If the answer was yes, then we moved over to another category, which was teh genre element of it. The paranormal, the cryptic. Is this satisfying if we set a high bar on that front also? Every story went through these two filters. Often we would find ourselves settling on a story and a lot of them falling by the wayside. Eventually, we got to these eight. It was a great team working for months and months and really just going through that process asking ourselves the same unpleasant questions over and over because we knew we were constantly going to be dismissing stories that might have something really compelling one way or another.\n\n\n\nMark Duplass: We were fortunate that with Sasquatch made we had a similar team before this. That tackled the human element and genre element together. It was similar here in terms of what we were chasing.\n\nAre there any of these stories that went in a different direction than you were expecting?\n\nMark Duplass: They all were in some way, but what was fascinating for me who is not a lifelong conspiracy theorist. Although I did come with this with such a fascination. It\u2019s that honoring someone\u2019s truth and where they\u2019re at that is so critical for a show like this. When someone sets a bomb off and harms another human being because they believe they were called to do it. That is their truth. Approaching them and being able to honor that truth for what it is was kind of the most critical element to getting these stories right. It\u2019s delicate and sensitive. Having directors who were tied to these communities so they could tell these stories with authority. Our showrunner Allie [Alexandra Orton] just researched this thing for so long. That was really one of the most important parts.\n\nWhat do you think this show does for the families of the victims like the murder of Navajo woman Sarah Saginston for example?\n\nJoshua Rof\u00e9: It\u2019s tough to answer that question, but what we hope is for the first time in a really long time the truth will be presented. Which is that Sarah and her family deserve so much better at every single turn. To follow the horrific tragedy with injustice is so painful. I hope what we\u2019re able to do is put on display what went wrong and how. You never know how someone is going to react and what they\u2019re going to get out of it or not. I believe we put the truth forward, and the truth is they never received justice in any way. And quite frankly, that is unacceptable.\n\nOut There: Crimes of the Paranormal, series premiere, September 24, Hulu"

My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris about what we can look out for around the house that could mean we\u2019re the subject of a \u2018classic haunting\u2019.\n\nBarri Ghai and Jayne Harris on Help! My House is Haunted (Discovery+)\n\nTemperature Changes\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai explains this is a \u2018common\u2019 sign or symptom of a haunting.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cPeople have inexplicable cold spots around their home, regardless of how much heating is on or whether doors and windows are closed,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe Unexplained\n\nHistorian and psychologist Harris advises keeping an ear and an eye out for the little unexplained things in your home.\n\nTypically, we all know which floorboards or steps in our home creek when we step on them, so if you hear that squeak while you\u2019re not there, \u2018you know that is unexplained, you know there\u2019s something there\u2019.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cGo with your gut instinct,\u201d she says. \u201cLook out for the little things. Often people will find things go missing or things move, and they will find them in places where they know they\u2019ve looked.\u201d\n\nGhai says to watch out for temperature changes (Discovery+)\n\nThe Feeling of Being Watched\n\n\u201cSometimes people walk around their own homes,\u201d Ghai says. \u201cEven though it\u2019s their stuff, they feel like they\u2019re trespassing. And then they feel that they have eyes on them.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nIn this case, he says to trust yourself because \u2018the human body is the best paranormal detector\u2019.\n\nCorner of the Eye Spots\n\nSimilarly, Harris says while we are \u2018very perceptive\u2019, we\u2019ll often just \u2018try and explain things away\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re sat watching the TV one night, and you think you've just seen someone walk past the door, a lot of people would just be like \u2018it\u2019s nothing\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut if it happens again on a separate occasion, it could be something.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cTrust yourself, trust your instincts. You know your house, you know when things don't feel quite right.\u201d\n\nHarris advises to try and be logical (Discovery+)\n\nAnomalous Sounds\n\nGhai says this one crops \u2018up time and time again\u2019 in cases he sees where people hear everything from \u2018whispering and chatting to actual spoken words\u2019.\n\n\u201cOr in the more sinister cases, someone whose voice is familiar to you,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s that mimicking sound - so your mum calling your name, but your mum's not there.\n\n\u201cThat kind of thing that happens a lot.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s a haunting\n\nWhile all of these can be classed as key signs of a haunting by the pros, obviously, you do need to rationalise as Harris says you shouldn\u2019t just \u2018assume\u2019 that\u2019s what it means.\n\n\u201cCheck for the logical things,\u201d she advises, urging to double check that windows are closed and the radiator\u2019s working if you get those cold spots.\n\n\u201cBecause it's only when you rule out all of those logical explanations that you're left with potentially a paranormal case,\u201d Harris adds.\n\nBut she does warn that once you\u2019re properly suspicious there is something in your house you should get \u2018professional advice\u2019.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and communicate with whatever you think might be there if you're not experienced in doing it, because it can make things worse,\u201d she warns.\n\nSpooky.\n\nSeries six of Help! My House is Haunted airs on Really, Fridays at 9pm. It\u2019s also available to stream on Discovery+."

The researchers published their findings Sept. 18 in the journal Nature .\n\nThe ATLAS experiment (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) is the largest detector at the LHC, and picks out the tiny subatomic particles created after beams of particles crash into each other at near light speeds.\n\n\"While particle physics is deeply rooted in quantum mechanics , the observation of quantum entanglement in a new particle system and at much higher energy than previously possible is remarkable,\" Andreas Hoecker , a spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment, said in an email statement. \"It paves the way for new investigations into this fascinating phenomenon, opening up a rich menu of exploration as our data samples continue to grow.\"\n\nParticles that are entangled have their properties connected to each other, so that a change to one instantaneously causes a change to another, even if they are separated by vast distances. Albert Einstein famously dismissed the idea as \"spooky action at a distance,\" but later experiments proved that the bizarre, locality-breaking effect is indeed real.\n\nRelated: Heaviest antimatter particle ever discovered could hold secrets to our universe's origins\n\nBut there are many aspects of entanglement that remain unexplored, and the one between quarks is one of them. This is because the subatomic particles cannot exist on their own, instead fusing together into various particle \"recipes\" called hadrons. Mixtures of three quarks are called baryons \u2014 such as the proton and the neutron \u2014 and combinations of quarks and their antimatter opposites are called mesons.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhen individual quarks are ripped from hadrons, the energy used to extract them makes them immediately unstable, and they decay into branching jets of smaller particles in a process known as hadronization.\n\nThis means that to observe the entanglement of a top quark and an antiquark, scientists at the LHC's ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detectors had to pick out the distinct particles that they decayed into from billions of others. In particular, they looked for particles whose decay products were emitted at a distinct angle that occurs only between entangled particles.\n\nBy measuring these angles and correcting for experimental effects that may have changed them, the team observed entanglement between top particles with a large enough statistical significance to be considered real. Now that the entangled particles have been spotted, the scientists say they want to study them to further probe unknown physics."

        "article_content": "Most scientists can never receive a Nobel Prize, arguably the most prestigious award in science. Only physicists, chemists, and specialists in physiology or medicine are eligible for the honor\u2014which comes with a gold medal, a diploma and currently up to 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1.07 million).\n\nMultimillionaire Alfred Nobel established the prize pot\u2014and those categories\u2014in 1895 via his last will and testament. He decreed:\n\n[My capital] is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. The interest is to be divided into five equal parts and distributed as follows: one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nThat seems straightforward. The first awards in the science categories were presented in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen (physics), Jacobus H. van \u2019t Hoff (chemistry) and Emil von Behring (physiology or medicine).\n\nBut the inaugural prizes in chemistry and physics honored work that traced further back in time than \u201cduring the preceding year\u201d\u2014one was connected to research that started in the 1870s and the other to research from 1895. Indeed, Scientific American calculated that between 1901 and 2023, the time between key research dates and a Nobel nod averaged 20 years across categories. And in 1902 joint winners began popping up, with Hendrik A. Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman sharing the physics prize for their work on magnetism and radiation.\n\nThat broadening of the award eligibility from Nobel\u2019s will is thanks to statutes instituted by the Nobel Foundation and his heirs in 1898. Specifically:\n\nThe provision in the will that the annual award of prizes shall be intended for works \u2018during the preceding year\u2019 should be understood in the sense that the awards shall be made for the most recent achievements in the fields of culture referred to in the will and for older works only if their significance has not become apparent until recently\u2026. A prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize. If a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.\n\nThe timing statute is relatively clear. Simply put, award-worthy research doesn\u2019t have to be limited to the year preceding the award. But the joint winner statute is more complicated. What does it mean?\n\nFor the science categories of physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine, up to three recipients\u2014also known as laureates\u2014can be awarded in any given year. Here\u2019s the breakdown from 1901 through 2023.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nBut joint laureates aren\u2019t always direct collaborators. For example, James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo were awarded the 2018 prize in physiology or medicine for their research on proteins that inhibit our immune system and the way those proteins could be manipulated to fight cancer. Both contributed crucial findings to the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, but they worked in parallel\u2014in different labs with a focus on different mechanisms.\n\nMany joint laureates aren\u2019t even contemporaries. For example, the 1986 prize in physics went to Ernst Ruska, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer to celebrate work completed 48 years apart. Ruska developed the first electron microscope in 1933, and Binnig and Rohrer developed the scanning tunneling microscope together in 1981.\n\nAnd although each recipient is awarded their own personalized gold medal and diploma, the prize pot of money isn\u2019t necessarily evenly distributed amongst joint laureates. This can all get a little confusing\u2014unless you shift focus from the people conducting the research to the work being celebrated.\n\nPer the statute, \u201cA prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize.\u201d Note the emphasis on \u201cworks.\u201d At its core, the research is being celebrated, not the researcher. Further, the statute says that \u201cif a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.\u201d\n\nOverall, there are five possible scenarios:\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nHere\u2019s how it played out in 2020. The prize in physics was awarded to Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez. Penrose was celebrated, as the Nobel Foundation states, \u201cfor the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity,\u201d a contribution pinned largely to an article published in 1965 in which he established the physical foundations of black holes. Genzel and Ghez were both celebrated \u201cfor the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy\u201d\u2014work done some 25 years later in parallel, with separate teams.\n\nOne half of the prize money was awarded to Penrose, and the other half was split between Genzel and Ghez.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nInterestingly, the statute doesn\u2019t strictly follow the language in Nobel\u2019s will. He centered the influential \u201cperson,\u201d not the \u201cwork.\u201d Even now, almost 123 years after the first ceremony, that tension doesn\u2019t feel resolved. The awards committee calls out and popularizes up to three people each year in each category and hands each of those scientists a check. Yet the awards are pinned to works, in a world in which the work being recognized is increasingly the result of many collaborators. This conflation of headlining scientist and work done by many is at the heart of many Nobel Prize critiques (although there are also other facets worthy of criticism, including a stunning and problematic lack of diversity among the laureates).\n\nAs Caroline Wagner, a scholar of science and technology with a focus on international collaboration, wrote in 2017:\n\nWhile practitioners have expanded the way contributions are credited, awards like the Nobel Prizes haven\u2019t caught up. The little bit of science history taught in school still focuses on individual contributors such as Marie Curie and Albert Einstein. Harder to explain or visualize are the cross-disciplinary collaborations that constitute most of science today.... The Nobel Prize, developed to recognize 19th-century creativity, may no longer reflect the true contributions within 21st-century science.\n\nAnd yet many people\u2014myself included\u2014are still charmed by the thought of a scientist getting caught off guard by that Nobel announcement phone call and having their routine day transformed into a spectacular one. And there\u2019s something lovely about the science communication flurry that follows, providing us all an excuse to revisit impactful research together."

        "article_content": "Discovery of the seed\n\n\n\nMedicinal and healing properties\n\n\n\nHistorical significance and future research\n\n\n\nAlso read:\n\nA remarkable discovery in the Judean Desert has sparked scientific curiosity\u2014a 1,000-year-old seed has grown into a 10-foot tall tree, named \"Sheba\" after the biblical queen. This ancient seed , found between the West Bank and Israel, dates back to a time between 993 AD and 1202 and is believed to be part of a now-extinct lineage of trees mentioned in the Bible.According to reports, after taking 14 years to grow, Sheba has shown incredible medicinal potential, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties . Scientists believe the tree may be linked to the biblical \"tsori\" balm, renowned for its healing powers, and could provide valuable insights into historical remedies.With its ties to the family of myrrh and frankincense, this ancient tree offers a unique opportunity to explore both its historical significance and potential modern medical benefits.The seed was uncovered in a cave located within the Dead Sea-Jordan Rift Valley, an area known for hosting around 14.5% of its flora, with origins in the Sudanian and Sudano-Zambezian regions. This ecological zone indicates that the Commiphora species , to which the seed likely belongs, may have migrated from Africa and adapted to the region's unique climate.Phytochemical analysis of the seedling's leaves and resin revealed an absence of aromatic compounds traditionally linked to healing. However, the plant was rich in medicinal substances. This aligns with biblical references to \"tsori,\" a balm associated with healing properties. Notably, scientists identified pentacyclic triterpenoids, compounds found in other Commiphora species, which are known for their medicinal value, potentially offering therapeutic benefits, including anti-cancer properties.One of the most intriguing aspects of Sheba is its potential medicinal value. Researchers believe the tree could be the source of \"tsori,\" a balm mentioned in the Bible for its healing properties. This resin, thought to possess significant medicinal potential, has long been a part of historical and biblical accounts.The tree's close relation to the Commiphora species, which produces fragrant resins, further links it to the famous \"Balm of Gilead,\" a biblical perfume known for its therapeutic effects. Chemical analyses of Sheba\u2019s leaves have revealed compounds with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, as well as antioxidant and skin-smoothing benefits.According to a study reported in The Economic Times, the ancient tree might hold promise in cancer treatment due to its unique properties, offering a significant opportunity for medical breakthroughs in modern research .Scientists have performed DNA, chemical, and radiocarbon analyses, confirming Sheba\u2019s relation to the family of myrrh and frankincense, both iconic biblical compounds. Despite this, the tree has not yet flowered or produced reproductive material, which limits further study on its full characteristics.The revival of Sheba raises questions about whether other ancient species might be resurrected through similar methods. While the exact species remains uncertain, researchers hope to continue exploring its lineage and uncovering its secrets.This ancient discovery offers not only a glimpse into the past but also a potential key to unlocking future medicinal breakthroughs."

The detector meticulously identifies each kaon and measures its decay products, excluding neutrinos, which appear as missing energy in the data.\n\nLazzeroni tells IE, \u201cKaons and pions are particles containing quarks.

        "article_content": "If your startup is only remotely related to working with data pipelines, you\u2019re probably trying to figure out how to capitalize on the current moment: Enterprises are trying to figure out how to best use data to power generative AI products, and to do that, they need robust data services. Airbyte, which launched in 2020, started with a focus on building a low-code/no-code open source data integration platform. Since then, Airbyte raised a total of $181.2 million, including a massive $150 million Series B round during the somewhat anomalous days of late 2021.\n\nAfter four years, the company is now launching Airbyte 1.0 \u2014 and the focus, of course, is on AI, both as an addition to Airbyte\u2019s own tools and to help its users build their own AI-based services.\n\nIndeed, the company is now leveraging AI in a clever way to expand on its overall low-code/no-code philosophy: Its model will be able to look at the documentation for an API and automatically create a connector based on that. You simply point it at the documentation, and it\u2019ll handle the rest (at least in theory; time will tell how well that works in practice, of course.)\n\nAs Airbyte co-founder and CEO Michel Tricot told me, he believes that one area where large language models are transforming how enterprise use their data is by making unstructured data far more useful \u2014 and usable.\n\n\u201cStructured data is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to leveraging data\u2019s full potential,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the rise of LLMs, we can now efficiently tap into previously untouched unstructured data. \u2026 We\u2019ve seen massive demand for handling multi-modal data. Our latest developments have been geared toward supporting intelligent, context-aware pipelines, optimizing frameworks like RAG, and automating pipeline creation based on customer data workflows. These innovations are crucial to unlocking advanced use cases and enhancing LLM performance.\u201d\n\nBecause Airbyte is now so much better at managing unstructured data, its users can now leverage their existing pipelines to do that, without having to rely on additional tools.\n\nIn non-AI news, Airbyte\u2019s connector now also supports GraphQL, which should help users access many additional datasets without even having to build custom pipelines.\n\nWith this release, Airbyte is also making its self-managed enterprise service generally available. Like with so many open source companies, the enterprise version, which is available on the AWS and GCP marketplaces, will offer features like single sign-on (SSO) and role-based access control (RBAC), as well as Airbyte-specific features like sensitive data masking and advanced observability.\n\nAirbyte says it has 7,000 enterprise customers and has seen over 170,000 deployments by now. Its customers range from Calendly and Coupa to Perplexity AI and Siemens.\n\n\u201cEvery company is a data company \u2014 to drive decision-making and as the foundation for AI initiatives,\u201d Tricot said. \u201cOnly Airbyte, with our open source strategy enabling hundreds of connectors, can give enterprises the ability to leverage any data they choose. As AI continues to drive transformation, we\u2019re delivering the technology and ecosystem required for organizations to build the data infrastructure needed for AI-driven innovation.\u201d"

Madeline Clarke, writing for TechRepublic Premium, presents this resource on SaaS to educate readers on the cloud-based software model, its pros and cons, and how this trend may shape the future of enterprise software.\n\nFeatured text from the download: FORMS OF APPLICATIONS SaaS applications can serve a range of purposes, typically depending on the type of business that will be utilizing them. But to understand the various forms, you should first know the difference between horizontal and vertical SaaS. Vertical SaaS: Applications are typically geared more toward a specific business sector or type of organization. Its features are fine-tuned to meet the needs of those industries and tend to be more customizable and attuned to the unique needs of the market it is servicing. A SaaS application that manages patient appointments would be an example of a vertical SaaS used by businesses in the healthcare industry. Horizontal SaaS: Applications can be used by companies across multiple industries, as their capabilities are applicable across many business settings. For example, SaaS solutions that manage customer relationships or provide team productivity tools would be considered horizontal SaaS applications.\n\nStrengthen your SaaS knowledge with our in-depth 10-page PDF.
