        "article_content": "The charismatic movie star, brought into this Emmy-snubbed but popular series as a marquee name, abandons a hit show responsible for his career rebirth. The next generations of Duttons (played by terrific ensemble Kelly Reilly, Luke Grimes, and Wes Bentley), orphans though they may now be, hope to keep the family traditions alive. There are still rumors , though no studio commitments, that a season six may happen without Costner.\n\nGoodbye, \u201cYellowstone\u201d road. The fifth and final season of Taylor Sheridan\u2019s breakout contemporary neo-western is circling its wagons starting Sunday at 10 p.m. on Paramount. Dutton family patriarch Kevin Costner has already ridden off into the sunset to make his multi-part western \u201cHorizon: An American Saga.\u201d Oops, the premiere flopped . Costner, though talented, has an epic penchant for self-sabotage.\n\nWhat else is coming this week?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out why,\u201d says \u201cInspector Ellis,\u201d a mantra for motive that underpins whodunits good and bad. The first-rate female-driven British procedural premieres today on Acorn. Striking Sharon D. Clarke plays DCI Ellis, a self-possessed detective-of-few-words-and-big-actions. With assistant DS Harper (Andrew Gower), the experienced pair are the pros from Dover who bigfoot the turf of flailing local cops. In this three-part miniseries, Ellis and Harper investigate a young man\u2019s mysterious death, the suspicious disappearance of a detective that leads to a trail of police corruption, and the disappearance of honeymooners where a severed hand points the way to the crime\u2019s solution.\n\n2. Discovery launches \u201cGame Changers\u201d Tuesday at 9 p.m. The limited series goes back to the dark ages of gaming \u2014 Pong \u2014 at the dawn of Atari and the gaming industry. According to the International Gaming Commission, that modest game of back-and-forth spawned what was to become a $184 billion global video game industry in 2023. The eight-part docu-series charts the pastime\u2019s short history, employing archival footage and talking to creators, investors, experts, and players about the intellectual challenges, backstage dramas, and discovery of new frontiers in gaming. Episode 1 charts the rise of Nintendo, a one-time Japanese family business that began over a century ago making playing cards and evolved into a global entertainment giant.\n\n3. While Alan Cumming may never star as a gladiator in a Ridley Scott sword-and-sandal epic, he has conquered pretty much everything else he\u2019s tried. One-man \u201cMacbeth\u201d on Broadway? Done it. Now, with the five-part \u201cAlan Cumming\u2019s Paradise Homes\u201d airing on BritBox Wednesday, the effusive Scottish star with a love for all things tartan enters the shelter show market. Over five episodes, presenter Cumming pokes through houses that fascinate him. Inspired by his love for architecture and design, and in search of the magical and unique, Cumming prowls dream homes, from a private retreat in Mull with 360-degree views and circling golden eagles, to a renovated barn in Northern Ireland, to a home with a naturalistic style that harmonizes with its Swedish island site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. On Thursday, Amazon Prime continues to expand its international programming, including spinoffs for the \u201cCitadel\u201d spy franchise spearheaded by the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe. The ambitious project known as The Citadel Cinematic Universe heads to India for the action prequel \u201cCitadel: Honey Bunny,\u201d dubbed and in subtitles. Samantha Ruth Prabhu stars as actress Honey, opposite Varun Dhawan\u2019s stuntman Bunny. The Mr. and Mrs. Smith types get swept up in a spy ring where pulling the trigger isn\u2019t just play-acting. Years later, the estranged pair come together again when their past comes calling \u2014 and they must ensure the safety of their daughter Nadia.\n\n5. UFO reporter George Knapp throws down the gauntlet: \u201cWe need to get beyond that obvious question \u2018Are UFO\u2019s real?\u2019 to what really matters. Why are they here, and what do they want from us?\u201d In \u201cInvestigation Alien,\u201d the Netflix series dropping Friday, Knapp goes in search of hard evidence to back up his claims, undeterred by the Pentagon, which only last year declared there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of alien intelligence on earth. Are we alone in the universe or not? Knapp travels the world, highlighting suspicious incidents and interviewing witnesses. The truth is out there, but proof remains Knapp\u2019s holy grail."

        "category": "ai+app",
        "date": "Windows Latest23h",
        "source": "Windows Latest",
        "article_content": "The LTSC edition of Windows adopts a lean, more stable approach. Windows 11 LTSC is now available with the third-version update, aka 24H2. However, it still maintains the simplistic design approach with the classic version of the system apps and outdated UI. AI, now the most precious thing for Microsoft, isn\u2019t included with Windows 11 LTSC.\n\nWindows Latest installed the latest version of the official Windows 11 LTSC ISO and then put it to test on a PC. The installation is smooth for the most part, except when it asks you to enter a work or school account. Note that Windows 11 LTSC is available for Enterprise users, so you cannot use a personal Microsoft account to set it up.\n\nBypassing the Work/School Account Requirement\n\nWe used a few techniques to bypass the work/school account requirement in Windows 11 LTSC. First, we tried the oobe\\bypassnro command, which used to work in previous versions of Windows 11. But its charm failed to deceive the setup, and we landed on the same page after the automatic restart.\n\nThen, we turned off the internet connection and tried again, but the account requirement page didn\u2019t let us pass. After that, we launched the command prompt using Shift + F10, opened Task Manager, and ended the Microsoft Account process. The screen flashed for a few seconds, and the much-awaited \u201cI don\u2019t have internet\u201d option appeared.\n\nWe proceeded with a local account setup. It didn\u2019t even ask us to set up security questions.\n\nOne thing that we liked about this was that there was no mention of adware, tracking, or promotional items on the OOBE page. It would be best if Microsoft adopted this approach for Windows 11 consumer editions (Pro and Home) as well, but we all know that it won\u2019t improve.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC is clean.\n\nAfter booting to the desktop, at first glance, it doesn\u2019t look like a simple, less-modern version. But when you open the Start menu, the difference becomes clear.\n\nThere are few system apps, unlike the clutter and promotions that you get with consumer editions. Windows 11 LTSC 2024 includes the new Outlook web app by default.\n\nWe checked a few system apps to verify if they have been updated. Most of them look like legacy apps from Windows 7, especially Snipping Tool and Paint. Microsoft is keeping the latest version of both these apps limited to Pro, Home and other editons.\n\n1 of 2\n\nThe new inbox apps multiple new features, like the background remover and layers in Paint and OCR in Snipping Tool.\n\nMicrosoft is making it challenging to customize Windows when the OS is not activated.\n\nIn Windows 11 24H2, most personalization options are locked, and it has patched the existing loopholes. For example, previously, you could apply a dark theme by clicking on the theme box, as shown in the image below. It doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nPreviously, some customization was available, but Microsoft really wants you to buy a license. This phenomenon is common in all editions of Windows 11.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC\u2019s File Explorer packs all the latest improvements. You can duplicate tabs; labels appear below commonly used actions, compressions formats support for TAR, and more. But the overall UI doesn\u2019t look as polished as the regular editions.\n\nHowever, LTSC promises a no-nonsense approach that doesn\u2019t overload the OS with newer features. So, users don\u2019t have to accustom themselves to unnecessary apps, design, or UI changes ship with each feature update. It doesn\u2019t include any AI component, so no Copilot app or any other bloatware.\n\nYou can still access Copilot via Edge, which is preinstalled in LTSC.\n\nMicrosoft Store isn\u2019t available, so you\u2019ll have to download the programs from the official sites and wait for updates to improve the system apps. We suggest trying it only if you don\u2019t need feature updates and the bugs that come with it and want a clean OS with a bare minimum of system apps.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of apps installed on our Windows 11 LTSC PC:"

It is capable of gathering and processing intelligence and offering information for operational decision-making and is 90% as capable as OpenAI\u2019s powerful ChatGPT-4, according to the papers.\n\nMeta\u2019s Stance on Public vs Military Use of AI\n\nMeta\u2019s usage policies state clearly that consumers cannot use Llama models for \u201cmilitary, warfare, nuclear industries or applications, espionage\u201d purposes under the US\u2019s International Traffic Arms Regulations (ITAR). The law mandated by the US Department of State prohibits the export of certain technologies for defence purposes.\n\nHowever, Meta has limited control over how its models are used, as they are open to public access. Molly Montgomery, Meta\u2019s director of public policy said that PLA\u2019s usage was \u201cunauthorized and contrary to our acceptable use policy.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added that \u201cIn the global competition on AI, the alleged role of a single, and outdated, version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing more than a trillion dollars to surpass the US on AI,\u201d encouraging the US to invest on AI.\n\nThe US military\u2019s use of AI\n\nThe United States military has collaborated with AI developers like OpenAI to create military wargame simulation videos and cybersecurity tools.\n\nThis came after OpenAI changed its usage policies to exclude an explicit prohibition on using its models for military and warfare purposes. OpenAI has also roped in former National Security Agency (NSA) head Paul Nakasone into its board of directors.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft provided US intelligence agencies a generative AI model disconnected from the internet, that would enable secure information sharing.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nUS\u2019s action against China using AI\n\nThe US has expressed concern repeatedly about China using American AI models to surpass its own capabilities. President Joe Biden\u2019s Executive Order on Preventing Access to Americans\u2019 Bulk Sensitive Personal Data called for protecting data from \u201ccountries of concern\u201d lest they use it for defence or cyber threat purposes. The order also said that these countries may innovate and refine AI technology, \u201cthereby improving their ability to exploit the underlying data and exacerbating the national security and foreign policy threats.\u201d\n\nIn May, the US introduced a Bill imposing export control on AI systems to prevent the exploitation of US AI models and other enabling tech by foreign adversaries.\n\nAn amendment to the Export Control Reform Act, 2018, the \u2018Enhancing National Frameworks for Overseas Restriction of Critical Exports Act\u2019 or \u2018ENFORCE Act\u2019 would grant the US President the power to\u201ccontrol the activities of United States persons, wherever located, relating to specific covered artificial intelligence systems and emerging and foundational technologies that are identified as essential to the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:"

He recalled, \u201cThere was a big mansion, it was dark, and the whole atmosphere felt eerie. Just before our shot, I was talking to someone when, out of nowhere, someone scratched me from behind!

From metros to non-metros, and from multiplexes to single screens, the film continues its dream run. That being said, the horror-comedy is set to cross the Rs 100 crore mark within three days of its release.

This marks the third successful horror-comedy release of 2024, joining the ranks of 'Munjya' and 'Stree 2', setting a promising trend for more films in this genre in the future.\n\nSpeaking of 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3', it is the third installment in the popular 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa' franchise. The first part Bhool Bhulaiyaa, released in 2007, starred Akshay Kumar and Vidya Balan in the lead roles.

These technologies are enabling companies to enhance efficiency, drive innovation, and improve patient outcomes in ways that were previously unimaginable. From optimizing commercial strategies to accelerating drug discovery in innovative medicine, data, analytics, and AI are transforming every aspect of the industry. This article explores how the convergence of these technologies is reshaping pharma commercial and innovative medicine, accelerating business growth, and driving unprecedented advancements in healthcare.\n\nThe Role of Data, Analytics, and AI in Pharma Commercial\n\nIn the commercial realm of the pharmaceutical industry, success is heavily dependent on understanding markets, customer behavior, and sales dynamics. Traditionally, this has been a labor-intensive process driven by manual analysis of historical data and market research. However, with the rise of advanced analytics and AI, pharma companies are now leveraging these technologies to gain real-time insights, optimize commercial strategies, and make more data-driven decisions.\n\nEnhanced Market Understanding and Segmentation\n\nOne of the primary applications of data and analytics in pharma commercial operations is the ability to deeply understand the market landscape. By analyzing vast amounts of sales data, prescription trends, and healthcare provider behavior, companies can segment their markets more effectively. AI models enable real-time analysis of these datasets, allowing companies to identify untapped opportunities, emerging trends, and potential high-value customer segments.\n\nFor instance, AI-driven predictive analytics can forecast demand more accurately, helping pharmaceutical companies align their production and supply chains with market needs. This level of foresight reduces the risk of product shortages or oversupply, ensuring that the right products are available in the right markets at the right time.\n\nOptimizing Sales and Marketing Strategies\n\nData and AI are also revolutionizing how pharmaceutical companies approach sales and marketing. Historically, sales teams relied on generalized strategies, often using a one-size-fits-all approach to engage healthcare providers. Today, advanced analytics allow companies to tailor their marketing efforts to the specific needs and preferences of individual healthcare providers, improving engagement and driving more effective outcomes.\n\nAI-powered customer relationship management (CRM) systems enable pharma sales teams to predict the behavior of healthcare providers and customize their interactions accordingly. For example, by analyzing prescription patterns, sales teams can identify which physicians are more likely to prescribe certain drugs and target their outreach efforts more effectively. This not only improves the efficiency of the sales process but also enhances the quality of the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers.\n\nPersonalizing Healthcare Provider Engagement\n\nAI and analytics have opened the door to personalized, data-driven engagement with healthcare professionals. Instead of blanket marketing campaigns, pharma companies can now provide tailored information that resonates with individual healthcare providers\u2019 needs. This personalized approach fosters deeper trust and collaboration between providers and pharmaceutical companies, ultimately improving the adoption of new treatments and therapies.\n\nThrough AI-powered tools, pharma companies can track a healthcare provider\u2019s prescribing habits, preferences for certain therapies, and responsiveness to various marketing channels. This enables the creation of more targeted marketing content that aligns with the provider\u2019s clinical interests and patient demographics. Such an approach not only improves the efficiency of marketing campaigns but also strengthens relationships with key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nRevolutionizing Drug Discovery and Development in Innovative Medicine\n\nWhile the commercial benefits of data, analytics, and AI are transformative, their impact on innovative medicine is nothing short of revolutionary. The process of drug discovery and development, which traditionally took years and cost billions, is being accelerated and streamlined through the integration of AI-powered data analytics.\n\nAccelerating Drug Discovery with AI\n\nDrug discovery has historically been a lengthy and expensive process, involving the screening of vast libraries of chemical compounds to identify potential drug candidates. AI is fundamentally changing this paradigm by enabling the rapid analysis of molecular structures, biological data, and patient health records to identify promising drug candidates more efficiently.\n\nAI models can process and analyze enormous datasets at a speed and scale far beyond human capabilities. By analyzing patterns in molecular data and predicting how different compounds will interact with specific biological targets, AI can narrow down potential drug candidates in a fraction of the time. This dramatically reduces the time and cost associated with the early stages of drug discovery, enabling pharmaceutical companies to bring life-saving treatments to market faster.\n\nFor example, AI has been successfully used to identify new drug candidates for diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Machine learning models analyze the genetic profiles of patients and molecular data from drug databases to predict which compounds are most likely to succeed in clinical trials. This data-driven approach not only speeds up the drug discovery process but also increases the chances of success in later-stage clinical trials.\n\nAI-Driven Clinical Trials: Enhancing Efficiency and Reducing Costs\n\nOne of the most time-consuming and expensive aspects of drug development is conducting clinical trials. Recruiting patients, managing trial logistics, and analyzing trial outcomes require significant resources. AI is transforming this process by optimizing trial design, improving patient recruitment, and enabling real-time analysis of trial data.\n\nThrough AI and advanced analytics, pharmaceutical companies can identify ideal patient populations for clinical trials based on genetic, demographic, and health data. This ensures that the trials are more targeted, reducing the number of participants needed and improving the likelihood of positive outcomes. AI can also help monitor clinical trial participants in real time, identifying adverse reactions or positive responses early in the trial process, allowing for quicker adjustments and reducing the time to market.\n\nMoreover, AI-powered predictive models can assess the likely success of a clinical trial before it begins, by analyzing historical data from previous trials and current patient populations. This helps companies make more informed decisions about which trials to pursue, reducing costly failures and streamlining the path to drug approval.\n\nAdvancing Personalized Medicine with Data and AI\n\nOne of the most exciting developments in innovative medicine is the rise of personalized treatments, where therapies are tailored to the individual characteristics of each patient. Data and AI are critical to the advancement of personalized medicine, as they enable the analysis of vast amounts of patient data, including genomic information, to develop treatments that are more effective and have fewer side effects.\n\nBy leveraging AI to analyze genetic data and patient health records, pharmaceutical companies can identify patient subgroups that are more likely to respond positively to a specific drug. This approach not only improves treatment outcomes but also reduces the risk of adverse reactions. AI is also being used to develop companion diagnostics\u2014tests that help physicians identify which patients will benefit from a particular drug based on their genetic makeup.\n\nFor instance, in oncology, AI is being used to analyze cancer patients\u2019 genetic profiles and identify the most effective therapies for their specific tumor types. This has led to the development of highly targeted cancer therapies that are tailored to individual patients, significantly improving survival rates and quality of life.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities in Scaling AI and Data in Pharma\n\nWhile the benefits of data, analytics, and AI are clear, there are challenges associated with scaling these technologies across the pharmaceutical industry. Regulatory requirements, data privacy concerns, and the complexity of integrating AI into existing workflows all present hurdles that companies must overcome.\n\nRegulatory agencies such as the FDA are beginning to embrace the use of AI in drug development, but there is still work to be done in establishing clear guidelines for its use. Pharmaceutical companies must ensure that their AI systems are transparent, explainable, and compliant with regulatory standards, especially when dealing with sensitive patient data.\n\nDespite these challenges, the opportunities for growth and innovation are immense. As AI and data analytics continue to mature, pharmaceutical companies that successfully integrate these technologies into their operations will be able to accelerate drug development, reduce costs, and deliver more effective treatments to patients.\n\nAI-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system\n\nAn AI-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for pharmaceutical industry data analytics enhances decision-making by integrating real-time, context-specific insights from vast data sources. This system leverages both internal and external datasets to retrieve relevant information and generate precise, tailored analyses for drug development, clinical trials, and market performance. By combining retrieval-based AI with generative models, RAG can provide rapid, evidence-backed reports, helping pharmaceutical companies accelerate research, optimize operational efficiency, and ensure regulatory compliance. The result is a more streamlined, data-driven approach to innovation and patient outcomes in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nConclusion: A Future Powered by Data, Analytics, and AI\n\nThe convergence of data, analytics, and AI is transforming the pharmaceutical industry at an unprecedented pace. In pharma commercial, these technologies are enabling companies to optimize their strategies, personalize healthcare provider engagement, and gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics. In innovative medicine, AI is accelerating drug discovery, enhancing clinical trial efficiency, and driving the development of personalized treatments that improve patient outcomes.\n\nAs the pharmaceutical industry continues to embrace AI and data analytics, the potential for innovation and growth is limitless. Companies that leverage these technologies to their fullest potential will not only drive business success but also make a profound impact on global healthcare, delivering life-saving treatments to patients faster and more efficiently than ever before.

Using a Bubble Template\n\nUsing a Bubble template is one of the quickest and most cost-effective ways to start building your app. Bubble\u2019s template library provides pre-built, customizable solutions, allowing you to hit the ground running without starting from scratch.\n\nPros of Using a Bubble Template\n\nCost-effective : Templates are significantly cheaper than custom development, which makes them perfect for startups and small businesses on a budget.\n\nTime-saving : With much of the work already done, templates allow you to get a prototype or even a full app up and running quickly.\n\nCustomizable : Most templates are flexible, so you can tweak and adjust elements to fit your brand and functionality needs.\n\nCons of Using a Bubble Template\n\nLimited customization : Although customizable, templates have limits, which can make it challenging to create unique features or complex workflows.\n\nNot fully tailored : Templates are designed for a broad audience, so they may not precisely match your vision or industry-specific needs.\n\nWhen to Use a Template\n\nTemplates are ideal if you\u2019re a non-technical founder who needs a quick, affordable solution or if you\u2019re testing an MVP and don\u2019t need highly customized features. Many successful startups began with templates and later transitioned to more tailored solutions.\n\n5. Hire a Bubble Coach or Mentor\n\nA Bubble coach or mentor is a great option for those who want to learn Bubble while building their app. A coach can guide you through the process, troubleshoot issues, and ensure that your app is built with best practices in mind.\n\nPros of Hiring a Bubble Coach\n\nHands-on learning : Coaches teach you how to build on Bubble, giving you skills that you can use to manage and update the app yourself.\n\nExpert guidance : Coaches are Bubble experts who know the platform\u2019s ins and outs and can help you avoid common mistakes.\n\nCustomized assistance : Coaches can work with you to ensure your app has the specific features and workflows you need.\n\nCons of Hiring a Bubble Coach\n\nTime investment : Learning Bubble takes time, even with guidance, which may not be ideal if you need a faster launch.\n\nCost : Hiring a coach may be more expensive than using a template, especially if you need extensive support.\n\nWhen to Hire a Bubble Coach\n\nIf you\u2019re committed to learning Bubble, have time to invest in the process, and want to gain long-term skills, hiring a Bubble coach is an excellent choice. A coach is also a great resource if you want to build a unique app but don\u2019t have the technical skills to do it alone.\n\nWhich Approach is Right for You?\n\nChoosing the right approach depends on your budget, timeline, and desired level of customization.\n\nFor example, if you need a quick, affordable solution, a template is a fantastic starting point. If you\u2019re looking to learn Bubble and want hands-on guidance, a coach can help you build skills while developing your app.\n\nFinally, if you want to create a unique, long-term app solution and share the development workload, partnering with a Bubble agency can provide the support you need.\n\nTo see what\u2019s possible with a tailored approach, check out Big House, a Bubble agency that builds custom software for enterprises and MVPs for entrepreneurs.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: How long does it take to build a Bubble app using a template?\n\nA: Depending on the template and the level of customization, you can have a prototype ready within a week. With more customization, it may take longer, but templates generally offer the fastest route to launch.\n\nQ: What is the cost difference between hiring a Bubble agency and hiring a Bubble coach?\n\nA: hiring a coach can range from $100 to $300 per session. While agencies can be more expensive upfront, an agency provides personalized guidance throughout the process and thinks about your project beyond the individual hour sessions that you hire, which may be more beneficial for complex apps.\n\nQ: Can I combine these approaches?\n\nA: Absolutely! Many users start with a template, then work with a coach to customize it, or partner with a Bubble agency for ongoing development. Combining methods can provide the best of all worlds.\n\nMaking the Right Choice for Your Bubble App\n\nDeciding how to build your Bubble app comes down to these factors:\n\nBudget : DIY is the cheapest, while agencies offer the most comprehensive service at a higher cost\n\nTimeline : If you need a faster launch, a freelancer or agency is usually quicker than doing it yourself.\n\nComplexity : Complex apps with specific design or functionality needs are best suited for an agency.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a small business creating an MVP, a freelancer might fit your needs well. If you\u2019re a growing enterprise looking to streamline internal tools or create scalable software, partnering with a trusted agency like Big House ensures quality and professional support.\n\nConclusion: Start Building Your Bubble App Today\n\nBuilding a Bubble app is a flexible and accessible process, whether you\u2019re learning as you go, partnering with a freelancer, or engaging an agency. Bubble\u2019s platform makes it possible for anyone\u2014from solopreneurs to large enterprises\u2014to bring powerful, custom apps to life faster and more affordably than traditional development.\n\nAre you ready to take the first step?

        "date": "12h",
        "source": "Tampa Bay Times",
        "article_content": "This story originally appeared in Florida Trend Magazine.\n\nGrowing up in Flagler Beach, Matthew Marcusky watched his older brother and sister go off to college and it was expected he would follow. He had other ideas. \u201cI was pretty much ruling it out,\u201d he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sit in a classroom for another four years.\u201d Marcusky cleaned pools after high school, then heard about a welding program at Orange Technical College, a part of the Orange County public school system.\n\nMembers of Generation Z like Marcusky have swelled the numbers of students and apprentices pursuing careers that don\u2019t require a four-year degree and student debt. The 2022-23 year saw an 8% increase in Florida in public, post-high school career and technical education enrollment, and a 14% increase to a record 19,605 apprentices and pre-apprentices, according to the state Department of Education. \u201cThese trends indicate a visible shift towards vocational training and workforce education in Florida,\u201d says Nathalia Medina, state education department press secretary.\n\nThe trends cause trepidation at some four-year colleges but represent a welcome shift for many young people and Florida employers and business groups. Employers have long lamented that society, families and K-12 schools focus young people on four-year college as the expected next step without considering student needs \u2014 and the community\u2019s need for people to install or repair power lines, vehicles, plumbing, wiring, air conditioners and more.\n\nThe value proposition of a sheepskin has become a little woolly for Gen Z. They\u2019ve seen millennials become the most educated generation but also burdened by student debt. Higher education enrollment has been in decline because of the pandemic and a smaller number of students. A sizable share of young people also are skeptical of college, according to a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-funded study of high school juniors and seniors and 18- to 30-year-olds not enrolled. The majority surveyed still saw value in a two- or four-year degree to make money, have a better job, train for a career and have job security. But the percentage who were confident in a degree\u2019s value was down, especially among those out of high school. Debt, lack of interest in school and poor return on investment were survey respondents\u2019 concerns. Increasing percentages saw value in on-the-job training and certificate or license programs. Indeed, larger shares had confidence in certification as the path to a good job than had confidence in college.\n\n\u201cMore and more students are enrolling. We have had very strong recovery and are exceeding our pre-pandemic levels for enrollment at the technical college level, at the Florida College System institution level and for registered apprenticeships here in Florida,\u201d says Lee Chipps-Walton, the Florida Education Department state director of career and technical education. In addition to private career schools and registered apprentice programs run by businesses or unions, the state has 47 public technical colleges and 25 state colleges.\n\nApprentice track\n\nMarcusky received a grant to cover tuition at Orange Technical. He completed the program and began a five-year apprenticeship with the pipefitter union, the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada. He started at $15 an hour, earning as he learned. It wasn\u2019t easy, he says, to put in 10 to 12 hours a day and then twice a week spend another three hours at night in training. But he says hands-on training suits him.\n\nThat sentiment would resonate with Mike Brannen, an executive at Jacksonville-based Miller Electric, a 3,400-employee company in 40 states where 80% of workers come from an apprentice program. Brannen, in a July workforce webinar hosted by the Florida Chamber of Commerce, described his own start as an apprentice 37 years ago after he finished high school. \u201cI knew college was not something I wanted to do. I was more of a hands-on learner. Reading about it isn\u2019t going to work. If I could get my hands on it, I could figure it out.\u201d He\u2019s now senior vice president of industrial and workforce development for the company. \u201cIt\u2019s been great for my family, great for our company. I can confidently say apprenticeships work. You get a good wage. It\u2019s all \u2018earn while you learn.\u2019 You learn without tuition and college debt.\u201d\n\nBefore or aside from apprenticeships, tuition at career programs generally runs just a few thousand dollars. Many students like Marcusky graduate from trade school debt-free thanks to federal or state resources, veterans benefits, the Bright Futures program or the largesse of donors. In Collier County, for example, Best Buy founder and Naples philanthropist Richard Schulze supports job-training programs and individual students with need.\n\nSays education department press secretary Medina, \u201cWe are committed to continuing to provide students with opportunities to gain job-ready skills without the accumulation of debt.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Chamber of Commerce says Florida needs a net gain of 1.36 million jobs by 2030 to meet the organization\u2019s goal of moving Florida from the world\u2019s 16th largest economy to 10th. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get our talent right, then a lot of the other things we want to accomplish probably aren\u2019t possible,\u201d says Rachel Ludwig, the Florida Chamber\u2019s vice president of talent development for the future of work. Gov. Ron DeSantis says he wants Florida to be the top state for workforce education by 2030. This year\u2019s state budget has $765 million to support workforce education programs.\n\nBeyond shop class\n\nAlong with more funding, the Legislature in recent years has given career and technical education more flexibility to meet businesses\u2019 needs and maximize the dollars for training and business services. The state has cut the number of CareerSource local workforce boards from 24 to 21 and began grading them. The CareerSource board for Miami-Dade and Monroe counties ranked highest in the state by numerical grade and rated an A-plus, while the lowest grades in the state were the C-plus grades earned by the two Career-Source boards covering Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, Union, Alachua and Bradford counties.\n\nThe state overhaul aims to make it easier to start new apprentice programs, and the state has seen them proliferate. \u201cIt\u2019s just not shop class anymore,\u201d says state career education director Chipps-Walton. Project management, IT support, software development, business analysis, home health, teaching, law enforcement and solar panel installation have become \u201capprenticeable\u201d occupations. Miller Electric, for example, now has support staff apprenticeships in the fields of cybersecurity, software development, and business intelligence, and 35 people in a project management development apprenticeship \u2014 with another 35 coming in the next cohort, Brannen said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get the new employees so we\u2019re going to better train the ones we have,\u201d he says.\n\nSome 64% of apprentices in Florida, the state says, are found in five occupations traditionally known for apprentices: electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, boilermakers and elevator constructors. The attractive pay, pensions and benefits outweigh the disadvantages of physically demanding, potentially dangerous, dirty work, in sometimes loud, hot environments \u2014 perhaps at heights. St. Petersburg College has a wait list for its utility lineworker program, which lasts 14 weeks for a daytime cohort and 19 weeks for night school, says Jackie Skryd, the college\u2019s vice president for workforce development and corporate partnerships. The sticker price is $7,500. Successful completion can bring a job with Duke Energy or another industry employer that generally pays $60,000, she says. Continuing their education as apprentices can bring them to six figures after several years.\n\nWage outlook\n\nOverall, for all occupations for 2022-23, the average starting apprentice salary in Florida was approximately $33,000, and the average \u201cexit\u201d wage upon completion \u2014 which can take years in some fields \u2014 was $53,642, the state reports. One year after completing apprenticeships, the average wage hit $61,623, and five years after finishing apprenticeships, the pay on average reached $65,293.\n\nFor comparison, the average annualized pay the fall after graduation for 2021-22 Florida public university bachelor\u2019s degree grads was $53,741, according to state Department of Education data. Community college career certificate earners averaged a tad more \u2014 $54,862. Those with only a high school diploma or high school vocational completion were at the bottom of the earnings ladder, averaging $32,800. Those who finished high school with a career certificate made an average of $45,336.\n\nCaveat: Averages obscure the considerable variation in earnings by career field or major. Apprenticing in some occupations thus far has led to low-paying jobs. Apprentice cooks start a program at $8,320 per year and exit at $16,640, the state reports. Other low-paying apprentice fields are childcare, bricklaying and sheet metal working. High-wage skilled trades, meanwhile, can take some doing to enter. The highest exit wage for apprentices that the state tracked was $95,097 for an elevator constructor. According to the union website, union locals take applications only every two years. The Tampa region local, for example, next takes applications in 2026.\n\nDemand from Gen Z, Gen Alpha behind it and employers forces innovation and flexibility on Florida\u2019s career education approach. Each year, public Lorenzo Walker Technical High School in Collier, where students take regular academic courses and job-training electives, has had about twice as many students apply as it had room for in its 150-student first-year cohort. But only about half of the students, by the time they\u2019re juniors and seniors, take dual-enrollment courses at the post-high school technical college on the same campus.\n\nTo open up more space for dual enrollment, this year marks the last time Lorenzo Walker takes in a first-year cohort. Instead, the college will expand into the high school space. Students will stay in traditional high schools for academic classes and take buses to Walker for dual-enrollment technical college career classes. \u201cI can tell you unequivocally (in) 2023-24, we had the highest adult enrollment at Lorenzo Walker Technical College ever. We had the highest enrollment at iTech ever. (iTech is the system\u2019s career college in Immokalee). We had the highest adult education numbers ever. We are booming,\u201d says Carlos Artime, Collier\u2019s career and technical education director. He says all programs are in high-wage, in-demand fields. \u201cEverything we\u2019re doing is workforce driven,\u201d he says.\n\nMarcusky, the young welder, saw his wages regularly increase as he became more proficient in his trade. He\u2019s now 25 and makes just over $30 per hour, or roughly $60,000 a year before overtime. Benefits are robust. Still, the combination of work and training at nights wasn\u2019t smooth for everyone. Only about half the cohort he started with graduated with him in July as journeymen. \u201cI feel like I accomplished something,\u201d he says. He\u2019s worked on projects at Orlando area resorts, amusement parks, hospitals and the airport. \u201cI love it,\u201d he says.\n\nCareer takeoff\n\nWith two years of training, Daniela Gonzalez landed a job with Bombardier repairing airplanes.\n\nAll her life, Daniela Gonzalez has had a love of airplanes. The Colombia native came to the U.S. at 16, enrolled in Barron Collier High School in Naples, played soccer for the school team and graduated in 2019. A few months later, she joined the airplane mechanic program at Lorenzo Walker Technical College, the public school system vocational school in Collier County. It cost a couple of thousand dollars.\n\nRoughly two years later, she graduated in airframe mechanics and aviation powerplant mechanics, and the next month started work in Miami-Dade for aircraft maker Bombardier. The 23-year-old says she makes in the mid-five figures. That\u2019s about the average for a graduate of a Florida four-year university but earned in half the time and with no student debt.\n\nGonzalez says she dreamed of being a pilot but is aware of the expense of accumulating the necessary flight time hours and also wanted to get to work after high school. \u201cI always wanted to challenge myself to do different stuff and I said, \u2018OK, why not do the mechanical side?\u2019 I\u2019ve been working two years and three or four months. I really love it. You always learn every day. I want to keep learning.\u201d\n\nA&P mechanics like Gonzalez are licensed to work on the external frame (the airframe) of the aircraft and the engine, or powerplant.\n\nShe hopes one day to manage a crew and be a supervisor. And perhaps one day, she\u2019ll get her private pilot license. \u201cMaybe as a hobby,\u201d she says.\n\nPilot pipeline\n\nWithin 20 years, the aviation industry will need more than half a million new pilots. JetBlue is teaming up with schools like Broward College to train them.\n\nEducators and businesses are innovating to improve the pipeline of workers available outside traditional four-year colleges. This year, Broward College became the first community college to partner with airline JetBlue\u2019s 16-year-old Gateway University pilot development program. JetBlue has one of its largest crew bases at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Students accepted in the program get a conditional job offer as a first officer for JetBlue, along with guidance and mentoring. Students earn a two-year, associate\u2019s degree in professional pilot technology and the foundational FAA flight certificates necessary to progress toward becoming an airline pilot: private pilot, instrument rating, commercial pilot, multi-engine rating, certified flight instructor and certified flight instructor instrument. Students can go on to earn a bachelor\u2019s in aerospace science.\n\nThe major hurdle for all would-be pilots is accumulating expensive flight time. The payoff is an airline salary. \u201cBecoming a pilot is a well-paying and fulfilling career with a starting salary of more than $100,000 for a first officer with most major airlines,\u201d says Russell McCaffery, dean of Broward College Transportation Programs. \u201cThere is tremendous opportunity for upward mobility, with senior captains making a $500,000 salary.\u201d Boeing, in its annual study, projects a need for 649,000 new commercial pilots by 2042.\n\nJetBlue\u2019s Gateway University program also has partnerships with Embry Riddle, Jacksonville University and Florida Tech. Additionally, JetBlue partners with Aviator College in Fort Pierce, offering programs to JetBlue employees and their immediate family members that help them develop the skills, certifications and experience to become a JetBlue pilot or aviation maintenance technician."
