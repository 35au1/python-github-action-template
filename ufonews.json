            "article_content": "An ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the United States Capitol building have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.\n\nThe photo \u2014 taken at night just outside of Congress, with the dome of Capitol Hill in full view \u2013 was taken by US Air Force veteran Dennis Diggins who now works as a licensed tour guide in the Washington DC area, as well as a professional travel director.\n\nThe eerie triangular formation of lights that Diggins captured in his photo seems to hover just feet over the 'Statue of Freedom' at the top of the Capitol dome.\n\n'That\u2019s absolutely insane,' one spectator said of the strange glowing orbs, which looked like landing lights on some otherworldly craft.\n\nThe image comes just weeks after a pair of stunning public hearings in both the US Senate and the House of Representatives, where lawmakers probed current and retired Pentagon officials over the state of intelligence on what used to be called 'flying saucers.'\n\nThe House's hearing included a first look at a bizarre, unsettling report alleging that an illegal 'Unacknowledged Special Access Program' named 'Immaculate Constellation' had been set up to 'detect, quarantine, and transfer' UFO data away from public view.\n\nBut while some were clamoring for video that might link this new sighting to this wider UFO debate on the Hill, others pushed back on the speculative furor over these strange lights.\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived. The photo (above) was taken by US Air Force veteran Dennis Diggins, now a licensed tour guide in Washington DC\n\nBizarre, unidentified craft above Langley Air Force base - home to at least half the USAF fleet of stealth F-22 Raptor fighter jets (pictured) - lead to two weeks of emergency White House meetings last year. The 17-day episode has put government officials on high alert about UFOs\n\nAbove, a military witness testifies to the drones displaying 'flashing red, green, and white lights.' This testimony was released via the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), along with 50 pages of Air Force records on the December 2023 wave of 'drone swarms' over Langley\n\n'The picture is clearly a glare reflection off of the lens of the camera of the street lights below it,' argued a former paranormal investigator, who now goes by the moniker Average Chris. 'Same spacing, just inverted pattern.'\n\nOther eyewitnesses in the DC area, however, believed they had caught similar UFOs on video during the same evening, November 26, 2024.\n\n'My partner and I have spotted a mix of multiple stationary/hovering and slow moving lights from her apartment rooftop in Washington DC,' the anonymous witness who taped this video said. 'Appears that they are hovering over [Capitol] Hill, Navy Yard, or south of there.'\n\nThe witness, who posted the UFO video to Reddit, stated that the 'hovering' lights had been appearing for over a week, since at least November 15.\n\nThe Pentagon has not yet commented on these UFOs over our nation's capital \u2014 but DailyMail.com has reached out to a spokesperson for its UFO hunting unit, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), and will update this article if AARO responds.\n\nWhile these recent cases above DC might have perfectly ordinary causes, Pentagon officials and the US intelligence community are nevertheless increasingly concerned about the troubling rise of 'drone swarm' UFOs encroaching on restricted US airspace.\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com that a 17-day wave of UFO sightings above Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'The picture is clearly a glare reflection off of the lens of the camera of the street lights below it,' argued that former paranormal investigator, who now goes by the moniker Average Chris. 'Same spacing, just inverted pattern.' He accused others on social media of promoting the pics for clout\n\nAverage Chris also accused UFO influencers of suppressing explanations for a citizen video that appears to depict UFOs swarming above Washington DC (below). 'My post (above) shows that these are commercial airplanes lining up to land at the several airports in the area,' he noted\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'\n\nAnd now, dozens of British troops are fanning out in cooperation with the US Air Force (USAF) in an effort to track down the parties responsible for still more UFO swarms spotted over three air bases in England, amid fears it all could be linked to a 'sinister' plot.\n\nThe craft, possibly unmanned drones, were spotted overnight above Royal Air Force (RAF) base Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Feltwell in Norfolk, USAF confirmed.\n\nWhile Lakenheath is technically an RAF base, it currently houses mainly American aircraft and military personnel, officials noted.\n\nA former British Army intelligence officer told DailyMail.com that these strange UFOs over England may prove to be Russian spy craft agency, although US military sources say the UAVs were 'not identified as hostile.'\n\nNevertheless, it remains unclear if the recent sightings in DC bear any relationship to the events over Langley, or over the USAF operations in the UK.\n\nAverage Chris made the case that the video posted to Reddit, shows nothing more than 'commercial airplanes lining up to land at the several airports in the area.'\n\nBut the witnesses who posted the video remain unconvinced: 'I don\u2019t believe these are planes waiting to land at Reagan airport as many of them do not appear to be moving at all, and we watched for quite a while, maybe 15-20 minutes.'\n\n'Also some of the lights seem to turn on and off,' the witness continued.\n\n'Can anyone rule these out as police drones, military helos, balloons, or other mundane technology?'"

            "article_content": "Thanksgiving is the perfect time to settle in and binge one\u2019s favorite shows after feasting on holiday staples, and Netflix has made that easier than ever by finally dropping the latest installment in the Mononoke franchise on Netflix. Originally released in Japan in July 2024, fans have been waiting anxiously to see the Medicine Seller make his Netflix debut. Mononoke the Movie: Phantom in the Rain is a supernatural horror film that follows the Medicine Seller from the Mononoke anime series as he arrives to the Inner Chambers to unravel an increasingly bizarre mystery that takes a dark and deadly turn.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nBeing the first installment in a currently in-progress film trilogy, Phantom in the Rain is directed by Kenji Nakamura, who directed the original anime series and stars Hiroshi Kamiya (Levi Ackerman in Attack on Titan, Izaya Orihara in Durarara!!) as the Medicine Seller. The film adaptation was originally announced in June 2022 with an anticipated release window in 2023 but was later postponed to 2024. The film initially debuted in Montreal during the 28th Fantasia International Film festival before receiving a theatrical run in Japan. Shortly after, Netflix acquired the global streaming rights for the trilogy.\n\nThe Medicine Seller in mononoke\n\nMononoke Is a Technicolor Nightmare That Every Anime Fan Should Experience\n\nOriginally produced by Toei Animation in 2007, Mononoke is actually a spin-off of an anime series from 2006 titled Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales. One of the stories in Ayakashi, which featured the Medicine Seller, became so popular that it just made sense to give him his own series, allowing him to continue on his macabre journey, facing off against many supernatural threats.\n\nThe original anime ran for 12 episodes and follows five separate story arcs. In each, the wandering Medicine Seller takes on different nefarious spirits that attach themselves to negative human emotions and plague those around them. The Medicine Seller aids those under the effects of the evil spirits by using his knowledge of the paranormal to learn the spirit\u2019s shape (Katachi), truth (Makoto), and reasoning (Kotowari).

            "article_content": "An ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the United States Capitol building have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.\n\nThe photo \u2014 taken at night just outside of Congress, with the dome of Capitol Hill in full view \u2013 was taken by US Air Force veteran Dennis Diggins who now works as a licensed tour guide in the Washington DC area, as well as a professional travel director.\n\nThe eerie triangular formation of lights that Diggins captured in his photo seems to hover just feet over the 'Statue of Freedom' at the top of the Capitol dome.\n\n'That\u2019s absolutely insane,' one spectator said of the strange glowing orbs, which looked like landing lights on some otherworldly craft.\n\nThe image comes just weeks after a pair of stunning public hearings in both the US Senate and the House of Representatives, where lawmakers probed current and retired Pentagon officials over the state of intelligence on what used to be called 'flying saucers.'\n\nThe House's hearing included a first look at a bizarre, unsettling report alleging that an illegal 'Unacknowledged Special Access Program' named 'Immaculate Constellation' had been set up to 'detect, quarantine, and transfer' UFO data away from public view.\n\nBut while some were clamoring for video that might link this new sighting to this wider UFO debate on the Hill, others pushed back on the speculative furor over these strange lights.\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived. The photo (above) was taken by US Air Force veteran Dennis Diggins, now a licensed tour guide in Washington DC\n\nBizarre, unidentified craft above Langley Air Force base - home to at least half the USAF fleet of stealth F-22 Raptor fighter jets (pictured) - lead to two weeks of emergency White House meetings last year. The 17-day episode has put government officials on high alert about UFOs\n\nAbove, a military witness testifies to the drones displaying 'flashing red, green, and white lights.' This testimony was released via the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), along with 50 pages of Air Force records on the December 2023 wave of 'drone swarms' over Langley\n\n'The picture is clearly a glare reflection off of the lens of the camera of the street lights below it,' argued a former paranormal investigator, who now goes by the moniker Average Chris. 'Same spacing, just inverted pattern.'\n\nOther eyewitnesses in the DC area, however, believed they had caught similar UFOs on video during the same evening, November 26, 2024.\n\n'My partner and I have spotted a mix of multiple stationary/hovering and slow moving lights from her apartment rooftop in Washington DC,' the anonymous witness who taped this video said. 'Appears that they are hovering over [Capitol] Hill, Navy Yard, or south of there.'\n\nThe witness, who posted the UFO video to Reddit, stated that the 'hovering' lights had been appearing for over a week, since at least November 15.\n\nThe Pentagon has not yet commented on these UFOs over our nation's capital \u2014 but DailyMail.com has reached out to a spokesperson for its UFO hunting unit, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), and will update this article if AARO responds.\n\nWhile these recent cases above DC might have perfectly ordinary causes, Pentagon officials and the US intelligence community are nevertheless increasingly concerned about the troubling rise of 'drone swarm' UFOs encroaching on restricted US airspace.\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com that a 17-day wave of UFO sightings above Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'The picture is clearly a glare reflection off of the lens of the camera of the street lights below it,' argued that former paranormal investigator, who now goes by the moniker Average Chris. 'Same spacing, just inverted pattern.' He accused others on social media of promoting the pics for clout\n\nAverage Chris also accused UFO influencers of suppressing explanations for a citizen video that appears to depict UFOs swarming above Washington DC (below). 'My post (above) shows that these are commercial airplanes lining up to land at the several airports in the area,' he noted\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'\n\nAnd now, dozens of British troops are fanning out in cooperation with the US Air Force (USAF) in an effort to track down the parties responsible for still more UFO swarms spotted over three air bases in England, amid fears it all could be linked to a 'sinister' plot.\n\nThe craft, possibly unmanned drones, were spotted overnight above Royal Air Force (RAF) base Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Feltwell in Norfolk, USAF confirmed.\n\nWhile Lakenheath is technically an RAF base, it currently houses mainly American aircraft and military personnel, officials noted.\n\nA former British Army intelligence officer told DailyMail.com that these strange UFOs over England may prove to be Russian spy craft agency, although US military sources say the UAVs were 'not identified as hostile.'\n\nNevertheless, it remains unclear if the recent sightings in DC bear any relationship to the events over Langley, or over the USAF operations in the UK.\n\nAverage Chris made the case that the video posted to Reddit, shows nothing more than 'commercial airplanes lining up to land at the several airports in the area.'\n\nBut the witnesses who posted the video remain unconvinced: 'I don\u2019t believe these are planes waiting to land at Reagan airport as many of them do not appear to be moving at all, and we watched for quite a while, maybe 15-20 minutes.'\n\n'Also some of the lights seem to turn on and off,' the witness continued.\n\n'Can anyone rule these out as police drones, military helos, balloons, or other mundane technology?'"

            "article_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nMore than 1.5 million years ago, two different species of ancient human crossed paths on a lakeshore, perhaps locking eyes with each other. These early forerunners of Homo sapiens wandered in a landscape teeming with wildlife, including giant maribou storks that stood 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall.\n\nA stunning discovery of fossilized footprints pressed into soft mud preserved the unexpected and extraordinary moment, suggesting that the two distinct types of hominin were able to live as neighbors sharing a habitat, rather than as competitors who kept to their own territory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that you would have two kinds of similarly sized, large-bodied hominin species on the same landscape,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, first author of a study on the footprints that published in the journal Science on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe see them in the very same lake margin environment, passing within this area within hours to a couple of days of one another. They probably would have been aware of each other\u2019s existence. They saw each other and they might have interacted,\u201d added Hatala, who is an associate professor of biology at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe first part of the find occurred in July 2021 during an excavation at Koobi Fora, on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya, where the skeletal remains of several ancient human relatives have been found. That excavation revealed one hominin footprint, alongside several other tracks made by large birds. The team decided to rebury the tracks with fine sand until a detailed excavation was possible.\n\nThe researchers found 12 hominin tracks in a line, suggesting they were made by the same individual. Neil T. Roach, Harvard University\n\nThe dig took place in 2022, when Hatala and his colleagues exposed 23 square meters (248 square feet) of sediment, revealing 11 more hominin tracks similar to the first in a line that suggested they were made by the same individual, plus three isolated footprints that were oriented in a perpendicular direction.\n\nThe researchers also found 94 nonhuman tracks belonging to birds and cow- and horse-like animals. The largest bird track was 27 centimeters (10.6 inches) across and likely belong to a kind of giant stork known as Leptoptilos.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one long trackway with 12 (hominin) footprints in it. It was made at a decent walking pace \u2026 especially since they were walking through mud. There\u2019s not a clear destination at the end,\u201d Hatala said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what exactly they were doing, but they walked in that perfect zone of mud,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about the shoreline of a lake or a modern beach, you\u2019ve got kind of a narrow zone where the mud is perfect for making footprints. If you move too far this way, it\u2019s too dry, if you move too far the other way, it\u2019s too wet. And they\u2019re walking almost like in a straight line through the perfect area for their footprints to be made, which is very lucky for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three other footprints perpendicular to the trackway were scattered across the site. Hatala thinks they were made by three separate individuals, their other tracks perhaps wiped out by other animals walking around the surface at the same time.\n\nMembers of the research team excavated the trackway surface in 2022. Neil T. Roach/Harvard University\n\nPristinely preserved\n\nHatala and his colleagues couldn\u2019t directly date the footprints. But Hatala said the fossils were found below \u2014 and therefore were \u201cslightly older\u201d than \u2014 a layer of volcanic ash on the same site known as Elomaling\u2019a Tuff, which has been dated to 1.52 million years ago, according to the study.\n\nHowever, the researchers said they are confident that the tracks were imprinted within hours to a few days of one another because there is no cracking on the surface of the footprints, which would be the case if they were exposed to air and dried under the sun for a longer period.\n\nInstead, the scientists said the prints were all pristinely preserved in a similar fashion under the accumulating strata of sediment, thanks to fine and silty sand that gently covered the tracks soon after they had formed.\n\n\u201cThis was probably a delta system, with lots of shallow, low-energy water in this area and lots of nice muds,\u201d Hatala said.\n\nThe term hominin refers to all species in the human family tree that emerged after the split from the ancestors of the great apes 6 million to 7 million years ago. This group includes more recently extinct species such as Neanderthals, which disappeared 40,000 years ago, and Australopithecus afarensis, represented by the famous Lucy skeleton in Ethiopia, which was 3.2 million years old.\n\nHomo sapiens, our own species, is the only living type of hominin, making the idea of encountering another species from the same lineage particularly tantalizing to imagine. The researchers found some clues as to which groups of ancient humans crossed paths during this encounter.\n\nAn aerial view of Koobi Fora where the footprints were unearthed near Lake Turkana in Kenya. Louise N. Leakey, Turkana Basin Institute and Stony Brook University\n\nThe team concluded that hominins belonging to the species Homo erectus and the smaller-brained Paranthropus boisei made the footprints. P. bosei made the long trackway, while Homo erectus made the other three footprints, the study suggested. The skeletal remains of both species have been found at the site.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious that the footprints were made by two different species. Hatala, who is an expert in foot anatomy, determined they reflected different patterns of gait, stance and motion only after detailed 3D imaging and analysis.\n\nThrough experiments in the field and in the lab, he compared the footprints with those made by living humans, including 59 of the Daasanach people in Ethiopia, who typically don\u2019t wear shoes, as well as other fossilized hominin prints and tracks made by chimpanzees.\n\nHatala found that the 12-print trackway was made by an individual whose footprints didn\u2019t fall within the range of variation seen in Homo sapiens, unlike the three scattered footprints, which plotted more closely to those made by living humans.\n\n\u201cHomo erectus, from the neck down, they look very similar to modern humans, and within this time period, they are the best candidate for being a direct ancestor of ours. We hypothesize that those more humanlike footprints are more likely Homo erectus just because the rest of their anatomy is so human,\u201d Hatala said.\n\n\u201cParanthropus boisei, they look quite different. Most of the fossils that are confidently attributed to them are skulls or teeth. They have very large jaws, very large teeth and large attachments for chewing muscles. It looks like they adapted to eating a very different kind of diet than Homo erectus,\u201d he said. Hatala explained that Bosei likely ate a plant-based diet, whereas Homo erectus was more of an omnivore.\n\nShown here is a fossil footprint hypothesized to have been created by Homo erectus, a species of ancient human. Kevin G. Hatala/Chatham University\n\nHatala and his colleagues reviewed old fossil data from the site and found evidence the two species overlapped at the site for a significant period of time \u2014 perhaps over the course of 100,000 years, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exciting to see and to us that implies that direct competition between the two of them must have been relatively low, that they must have been OK with one another living on the same landscape. They weren\u2019t driving each other out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a risky area, there would have been hippos, crocodiles, other sorts of dangerous animals that were living in those areas, too,\u201d Hatala added. \u201cSo there must have been some appeal for both of them to go to those areas repeatedly over such a long time.\u201d\n\nThe footprints are the first physical proof that different hominin species overlapped in exactly the same time and space, dodging predators and finding food in the ancient landscape, according to the study. Homo erectus went on to thrive for 1 million years more. Paranthropus boisei, however, went extinct within the next few hundred thousand years. Scientists don\u2019t know why.\n\nBriana Pobiner, a research scientist and museum educator at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History\u2019s Human Origins Program, said it was \u201cmind-blowing\u201d to find footprints of not just one but two species walking in the same area.\n\n\u201cMaybe, they actively competed for the same food; maybe they just eyed each other warily from across a grassy patch. Maybe they ignored each other entirely,\u201d said Pobiner, who was not involved the new research.\n\nWhile it\u2019s the first time that footprints have suggested hominins of two species directly encountered one another, genetic evidence has revealed that Neanderthals interbred with Homo sapiens and Denisovans, a little understood hominin only known from a scant few fossils. Denisova Cave in Siberia was home to a girl who had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father.\n\nMaybe, Pobiner said, P. boisei and H. erectus \u201cwere similar enough that they even mated with each other on occasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis finding tells us that they lived in the same place, at the same time, and walked around practically next to each other,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to go back in time to actually observe these species 1.5 million years ago \u2014 but having both of their footprints on the same surface? That\u2019s the next best thing.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key tool in scientific discovery, opening up new avenues for research and accelerating the pace of innovation. Among the various AI technologies, Graph AI and Generative AI are particularly useful for their potential to transform how scientists approach complex problems. Individually, each of these technologies has already made significant contributions across diverse fields such as drug discovery, material science, and genomics. But when combined, they create an even more powerful tool for solving some of science\u2019s most challenging questions. This article explores how these technologies work and combined to drive scientific discoveries.\n\nWhat Are Graph AI and Generative AI?\n\nLet\u2019s start by breaking down these two technologies.\n\nGraph AI: The Power of Connections\n\nGraph AI works with data represented as networks, or graphs. Think of nodes as entities\u2014like molecules or proteins\u2014and edges as the relationships between them, such as interactions or similarities. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a subset of AI models that excel at understanding these complex relationships. This makes it possible to spot patterns and gain deep insights.\n\nGraph AI is already being used in:\n\nDrug discovery: Modeling molecule interactions to predict therapeutic potential.\n\nModeling molecule interactions to predict therapeutic potential. Protein folding: Decoding the complex shapes of proteins, a long-standing challenge.\n\nDecoding the complex shapes of proteins, a long-standing challenge. Genomics: Mapping how genes and proteins relate to diseases to uncover genetic insights.\n\nGenerative AI: Creative Problem-Solving\n\nGenerative AI models, like large language models (LLMs) or diffusion models, can create entirely new data including text, images, or even chemical compounds. They learn patterns from existing data and use that knowledge to generate novel solutions.\n\nKey applications include:\n\nDesigning new molecules for drugs that researchers might not have thought of.\n\nfor drugs that researchers might not have thought of. Simulating biological systems to better understand diseases or ecosystems.\n\nto better understand diseases or ecosystems. Suggesting fresh hypotheses based on existing research.\n\nWhy Combine These Two?\n\nGraph AI is great at understanding connections, while Generative AI focuses on generating new ideas. Together, they offer powerful tools for addressing scientific challenges more effectively. Here are a few examples of their combined impact.\n\n1. Speeding Up Drug Discovery\n\nDeveloping new medicines can take years and cost billions of dollars. Traditionally, researchers test countless molecules to find the right one, which is both time-consuming and expensive. Graph AI helps by modeling molecule interactions, narrowing down potential candidates based on how they compare to existing drugs.\n\nGenerative AI boosts this process by creating entirely new molecules designed to specific needs, like binding to a target protein or minimizing side effects. Graph AI can then analyze these new molecules, predicting how effective and safe they might be.\n\nFor example, in 2020, researchers used these technologies together to identify a drug candidate for treating fibrosis. The process took just 46 days\u2014a huge improvement over the years it usually takes.\n\n2. Solving Protein Folding\n\nProteins are the building blocks of life, but understanding how they fold and interact remains one of the hardest scientific challenges. Graph AI can model proteins as graphs, mapping atoms as nodes and bonds as edges, to analyze how they fold and interact.\n\nGenerative AI can build on this by suggesting new protein structures that might have useful features, like the ability to treat diseases. A breakthrough came with DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold used this approach to solve many protein-folding problems. Now, the combination of Graph AI and Generative AI is helping researchers design proteins for targeted therapies.\n\n3. Advancing Materials Science\n\nMaterials science looks for new materials with specific properties, like stronger metals or better batteries. Graph AI helps model how atoms in a material interact and predicts how small changes can improve its properties.\n\nGenerative AI takes things further by suggesting completely new materials. These might have unique properties, like better heat resistance or improved energy efficiency. Together, these technologies are helping scientists create materials for next-generation technologies, such as efficient solar panels and high-capacity batteries.\n\n4. Uncovering Genomic Insights\n\nIn genomics, understanding how genes, proteins, and diseases are connected is a big challenge. Graph AI maps these complex networks, helping researchers uncover relationships and identify targets for therapy.\n\nGenerative AI can then suggest new genetic sequences or ways to modify genes to treat diseases. For example, it can propose RNA sequences for gene therapies or predict how genetic changes might affect a disease. Combining these tools speeds up discoveries, bringing us closer to cures for complex diseases like cancer and genetic disorders.\n\n5. Knowledge Discovery from Scientific Research\n\nA recent study by Markus J. Buehler demonstrates how a combination of Graph AI and Generative AI can discover knowledge from scientific research. They used these methods to analyze over 1,000 papers on biological materials. By building a knowledge graph of concepts like material properties and relationships, they uncovered surprising connections. For instance, they found structural similarities between Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony and certain biological materials.\n\nThis combination then helps them to create a new material\u2014a mycelium-based composite modeled after Kandinsky\u2019s artwork. This material combined strength, porosity, and chemical functionality, showing how AI can spark innovations across disciplines.\n\nChallenges and What\u2019s Next\n\nDespite their potential, Graph AI and Generative AI have challenges. Both need high-quality data, which can be hard to find in areas like genomics. Training these models also requires a lot of computing power. However, as AI tools improve and data becomes more accessible, these technologies will only get better. We can expect them to drive breakthroughs across numerous scientific disciplines.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe combination of Graph AI and Generative AI is already changing the way scientists approach their work. From speeding up drug discovery to designing new materials and unlocking the mysteries of genomics, these technologies are enabling faster, more creative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in science. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more breakthroughs, making it an exciting time for researchers and innovators alike. The fusion of these two AI technologies is just the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery."

Adv. 10, eadq1444\n\nA vast array of ancient fish-trapping facilities created by the direct ancestors of the Maya has been discovered in Belize.\n\nThe facilities were capable of capturing enough fish to feed up to 15,000 people a year. They consisted of a network of canals and ponds that guided fish into areas where they could be easily caught.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHunter-gatherers constructed these complex networks about 4,000 years ago, during the Archaic period, a time before people in the region were practicing agriculture on a large scale, scientists wrote in the study, published Nov. 22 in the journal Science Advances .\n\n\"This is the earliest large-scale Archaic fish-trapping facility recorded in ancient Mesoamerica,\" the team wrote in the paper. The success of these hunter-gatherers appears to have helped lead to the formation of the Maya , a civilization that later came to dominate the Maya Lowlands in Central America and modern-day southern Mexico.\n\nThese fish-trapping facilities would have encouraged people to gather and develop permanent settlements and, later, cities. \"It seems likely that the canals allowed for annual fish harvests and social gatherings, which would have encouraged people to return to this area year after year and congregate for longer periods of time,\" study co-author Marieka Brouwer Burg , professor of anthropology at the University of Vermont who is co-director of the team, said in a statement .\n\n\"Such intensive investments in the landscape may have led ultimately to the development of the complex society characteristic of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization, which subsequently occurred in this area by around 1200 [B.C.],\" Brouwer Burg said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRelated: Lasers reveal Maya city, including thousands of structures, hidden in Mexico\n\nA map showing the Maya lowlands\n\nAt the time the fish-trapping facilities were built, the region was becoming drier and people may have been dealing with droughts, the team wrote in the study. This may have encouraged people to come together and build the facilities to ensure they had enough to eat.\n\nThe team used satellite images and aerial images taken by drones to detect the canals and ponds. They also conducted excavations and radiocarbon dated organic sediments and charcoal to determine when the fish trapping facilities were built.\n\nThe Maya continued to use these fishing facilities in Formative times (circa 2000 B.C. to A.D. 200), the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Honestly, this discovery is stunning,\" Thomas Guderjan , an anthropology professor at the University of Texas at Tyler, told Live Science in an email. \"We have always thought of large-scale land modification projects as being something that occurred in the Maya classic period,\" or roughly A.D. 250 to 900, Guderjan said.\n\nAn elevation map of a pond\n\nThe research may encourage scholars to reconsider what the Maya were like around 4,000 years ago, Guderjan, who was not involved in the study, added.\n\nNicholas Dunning , a geography professor at the University of Cincinnati who has studied the Maya extensively, also praised the research.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u2014Why did the Maya civilization collapse?\n\n\u2014Mysterious Maya underground structure unearthed in Mexico\n\n\u2014What's hidden inside the ancient Maya pyramids?\n\n\"Over the past several decades, quite a few scholars of the ancient Maya, including myself, have suggested that aquaculture may have played an important role in the development of Maya civilization,\" Dunning told Live Science in an email. \"However, the present study is the first that I know of to specifically attempt to test this hypothesis.\" The study \"is an important work in helping scholars of the ancient Maya understand the origins of sedentary society in the region,\" he added.\n\nLive Science contacted the research team but has not heard back at time of publication. In their paper, the scientists said they plan to continue their research in the region."
