As per some more code digging by the team at Android Authority, the advanced Gemini Live voice mode could soon let you dig deeper into YouTube videos.\n\nThe idea is you could have a natural conversation with Gemini Live about a video you're watching on your phone, in addition to the Ask about this video feature that's already available if you need explanations or summaries.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLastly, a potential interface change has been spotted for Gemini Live, again by Android Authority. Hidden code in the Android app suggests you'll soon be able to pause and resume chats from a notification in the status bar.\n\nThe advantage of using Gemini Live over the other Gemini input modes is you can talk with it as you would a real person \u2013 with interruptions, pauses, and so on \u2013 and these tweaks would make the AI app even more useful."

But can AI also plan a trip or vacation better than you can?\n\nTo put AI to the test, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave used Google's Gemini bot to explore travel options, while CBS News correspondent Nancy Chen, herself a seasoned traveler, relied on more conventional online tools to compare deals across flights, hotels and activities. Here's what they found.\n\nWhich approach saved time and money?\n\nFor the sake of comparison, both Van Cleave and Chen set out to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada, but they went about planning the trip in different ways.\n\nUsing Google's Gemini AI app, Van Cleave spent under a minute on his mobile phone to generate a potential itinerary. For her part, Chen spent about 45 minutes comparing deals and reviews across websites including Expedia, Kayak and Tripadvisor.\n\nThe upshot? He saved time, while the total cost of a flight and three nights at a five-star hotel came out to $741.48, compared to $780.05 for the same itinerary rustled up by Chen.\n\n\"I think he won this round, and I really need a vacation now,\" Chen said.\n\nCommunication breakdown\n\nYet while Gemini found some savings, it fell short once the pair was on the ground, and Van Cleave tasked it with creating an itinerary of free activities and events.\n\n\"I am on my way, letting AI guide my day,\" Van Cleave said. The technology directed him to visit the Bellagio Resort & Casino, where it suggested he visit a free botanical garden. But that information appeared to be outdated.\n\n\"What it didn't tell me \u2014 they seasonally tear it down for a holiday display,\" Van Cleave said.\n\nChen, guided by her own internet research, visited the Pinball Hall of Fame, which was open and which displayed hundreds of pinball machines, including vintage games from 1953.\n\nAI also fell short for Van Cleave when it told him that morning fountain shows at the Bellagio are less crowded than those that take place in the afternoon.\n\n\"The reason the morning fountain shows are less crowded is because there are no morning fountain shows,\" Van Cleave said. \"They don't start until three.\"\n\nVan Cleave was misdirected yet again when he arrived at what he expected to be the Mirage, a casino resort, for a volcano show. In its place was a construction site where a new Hard Rock Cafe has yet to open.\n\nMore successfully, AI steered Van Cleave to Vegas' art district on Fremont Street, and booked a dinner reservation that was to the correspondents' liking.\n\nTo err is human\n\nNot that Chen's search was foolproof. She visited the Stratosphere Tower, the tallest observation tower in the U.S., in hopes of scoring a free ride to its top floor drinks lounge. There was just one hitch.\n\n\"I thought it would be free to go up to the drinks lounge...but turns out it charged admission as well,\" she said.\n\nIn the end \u2014 and recognizing the unscientific nature of CBS News' experiment \u2014 AI was a clear winner on speed. But it still appears to require human surveillance to ensure its recommendations are up to date and accurate.\n\nOne AI travel tool company, GuideGeek, told CBS News it is 98% accurate, but that it is continually upgrading the tech to better advise users on attractions' business hours and other information. Users are also instructed to give the AI feedback when it provides a faulty recommendation in order to improve the product for other travelers.\n\nIndeed, major travel service providers seem confident that \"generative AI,\" which functions by creating text, videos and other content based on existing data, is here to stay. Expedia, just to name one major travel site, has also launched its own AI travel tool, to provide customers with a range of information, such as the best time to visit certain destinations.\n\nand contributed to this report."

            "article_content": "Anthropic is proposing a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data resides.\n\nCalled the Model Context Protocol, or MCP for short, Anthropic says the standard, which it open sourced today, could help AI models produce better, more relevant responses to queries.\n\nMCP lets models \u2014 any models, not just Anthropic\u2019s \u2014 draw data from sources like business tools and software to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments.\n\n\u201cAs AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post. \u201cYet even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data \u2014 trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale.\u201d\n\nMCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications (e.g. chatbots). Developers can expose data through \u201cMCP servers\u201d and build \u201cMCP clients\u201d \u2014 for instance, apps and workflows \u2014 that connect to those servers on command.\n\nHere's a quick demo using the Claude desktop app, where we've configured MCP:\n\n\n\nWatch Claude connect directly to GitHub, create a new repo, and make a PR through a simple MCP integration.\n\n\n\nOnce MCP was set up in Claude desktop, building this integration took less than an hour. pic.twitter.com/xseX89Z2PD \u2014 Alex Albert (@alexalbert__) November 25, 2024\n\nAnthropic says that companies including Block and Apollo have already integrated MCP into their systems, while dev tooling firms including Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are adding MCP support to their platforms.\n\n\u201cInstead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cAs the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and data sets, replacing today\u2019s fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.\u201d\n\nDevelopers can start building with MCP connectors now, and subscribers to Anthropic\u2019s Claude Enterprise plan can connect the company\u2019s Claude chatbot to their internal systems via MCP servers. Anthropic has shared pre-built MCP servers for enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub, and says that it\u2019ll soon provide toolkits for deploying production MCP servers that can serve entire organizations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cWe invite [developers] to build the future of context-aware AI together.\u201d\n\nMCP sounds like a good idea in theory. But it\u2019s far from clear that it\u2019ll gain much traction, particularly among rivals like OpenAI, which would surely prefer that customers and ecosystem partners use their data-connecting approaches and specifications.\n\nIn fact, OpenAI recently brought a data-connecting feature to ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot platform, that lets ChatGPT read code in dev-focused coding apps \u2014 similar to the use cases MCP drives. OpenAI has said that it plans to bring the capability, called Work with Apps, to other types of apps in the future, but it\u2019s pursuing implementations with close partners rather than open sourcing the underlying tech.\n\nIt also remains to be seen whether MCP is as beneficial and performant as Anthropic claims that it is. The company says, for example, that MCP can enable an AI bot to \u201cbetter retrieve relevant information to further understand the context around a coding task,\u201d but the company offers no benchmarks to back up this assertion."

The project is one of 16 being funded by the Council\u2019s \u00a362.6 million Towns Deal.\n\nThis world-class centre has transformed a disused underground Victorian reservoir into a 59-seater Planetarium, showcasing journeys through space with immersive shows. The original features of the reservoir, such as the intricate brick arches, have been preserved, keeping the history of the building alive.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe centre also features an exhibition hall, classrooms, meeting rooms, and a caf\u00e9. It is set to open to the public on Monday, 25 November.\n\nCllr Jason Zadrozny, Leader of Ashfield District Council, said:\n\n\u201cIt really is spectacular, and it is something that will transform the lives of not just the people of Ashfield but also further afield.\n\n\u201cIt has been incredible to see the building through the various stages of construction and to see the vision really come to life. I am proud to have played a small part in the process.\n\n\u201cThe immersive shows really are incredible, and I would encourage everyone to make sure they experience the Planetarium and all that it has to offer. This is something so unique and will see more visitors coming to Ashfield as they are transported through space.\n\n\u201cIt truly is an educational experience like no other and will hopefully inspire more young people to develop an interest in learning about space.\u201d\n\nSteve Wallace, Planetarium Project Manager, said:\n\n\u201cThis project has been a great example of how collaborative effort can produce amazing things. Our fantastic new Planetarium and Science Centre, sitting alongside our original observatory, will be a huge draw to bring people to the area and to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. We cannot wait to welcome our first visitors when we open our doors on 25 November.\u201d\n\nAdrian Grocock, Group Managing Director of G F Tomlinson, which delivered the project, said:\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to have completed works on this unique and significant Nottinghamshire landmark scheme \u2013 providing a world-class immersive facility for all ages in the heart of the Midlands.\n\n\u201cThe Sherwood Observatory will inspire and entertain visitors, and for many years to come, they will enjoy the knowledge and wonder that comes with understanding the science of space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wholeheartedly enjoyed working alongside the Sherwood Observatory team, Ashfield District Council, and other stakeholders who helped bring this incredible project to life.\u201d"

            "article_content": "A recent customer survey by Rockwell Automation shows that improving product quality is considered to be the top accelerant for manufacturing\u2019s digital transition. In addition, survey respondents said the number one area of impact for artificial intelligence (AI) is in closed-loop quality control.\n\nAt Automation Fair 2024, Amanda Thompson, Rockwell Automation product manager for FactoryTalk Analytics VisionAI, held a session highlighting the newest edition of VisionAI that was released in September 2024. This new release of VisionAI addresses the quality and AI capabilities ranked so highly by Rockwell Automation\u2019s customers.\n\nThompson explained that, while VisionAI does leverage machine vision technology, it\u2019s more than a machine vision system. \u201cThis is a quality inspection platform designed to help you understand the quality of the product you're producing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt not only tells you if a part or product is good or bad, it also tells you why.\u201d\n\nShe added that the system can support vision inspection at line speeds up to 500-600 parts per minute, depending on the application, to read barcodes, classify parts for identification and sorting, detect defects on surfaces, perform presence/absence detection and read/verify text.\n\nBeyond inspection, VisionAI also provides traceability so that users can see the images highlighted by the system as defective to drive comparisons with acceptable images and provide proof of specific defects. \u201cVisionAI features root cause analysis capabilities that will tell you why an item failed, and it provides notifications so that detected issues can be addressed immediately,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nIn keeping with Rockwell Automation\u2019s direction of developing AI-powered technologies that depend on end user domain expertise to refine them, Thompson pointed out that VisionAI is a no-code platform designed for operations and quality control personnel and \u201crelies on your expertise to provide the information needed for the system to make good quality decisions.\u201d\n\nVisionAI architecture and operation\n\nThe architecture of VisionAI stretches from the cloud to the edge, incorporating embedded analytics, data storage, and application programming interfaces for integrations with manufacturing execution and enterprise resource planning systems. The cloud hosts the AI engine and remote access features for monitoring, management, and deployment of VisionAI's edge functionalities. At the edge are local hardware such as edge computers, human machine interfaces, PLC integration and the vision system cameras, lenses and lighting.\n\nThompson noted that VisionAI currently works with Basler cameras but support for more third-party vision systems will be announced in 2025.\n\nExplaining how VisionAI works, Thompson said the first step is for the user to \u201cdefine the type of inspection they want VisionAI to run. Then they can start capturing images and labeling them as good or bad. The number of images needed to train the system will depend on the type of inspection.\u201d\n\nShe added that VisionAI provides a chart for image training that shows the user when enough images have been supplied to successfully train the model. A training report generated by VisionAI shows the model accuracy as it\u2019s developed to indicate if you\u2019ve labeled images incorrectly and allows users to correct them to improve accuracy before deployment.\n\nOnce the cloud-based model has been trained, it\u2019s then deployed to the edge where up to eight cameras can be supported on one system, with live camera feed capabilities available on site and via remote access.\n\n\u201cThe defect carousel feature shows failed images, which lets users double-click on the images to learn more about the failure reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cVisionAI also aggregates data across systems and time periods so that the system\u2019s dashboard supports comparison of batches, stations, production days and other factors to support specific troubleshooting needs.\u201d\n\nQuality reports are generated directly by VisionAI so that every stakeholder receives the same report.\n\nThompson added that VisionAI\u2019s remote access also lets users label images so that they can train and deploy models even if they are not on site. \u201cPlus, version control allows users to see when models were changed so that if a new model doesn\u2019t perform as expected, you can revert back to a previously deployed model,\u201d she said.\n\nIndustry applications\n\nThompson noted several different industry applications suitable for VisionAI, including:\n\nPackaging. VisionAI can do numerous packaging inspections, such as checking a bottle for defects, checking the expiration date and time stamps on labels, and assessing a cap to see if it\u2019s twisted correctly or leaking. Thompson pointed out that all of these inspections can be done at the same time with VisionAI to provide one quality result for the product. She added that VisionAI works on a recipe concept. \u201cIf you are running different shampoo brands on a line and you want to run a slightly different set of inspections, you can create an inspection recipe per product or SKU,\u201d she said.\n\nFood and Beverage. VisionAI can identify issues even on complex backgrounds. For example, it can be used to inspect cereal as it passes on a conveyor to verify correct shape and color and to flag imperfections or foreign objects. It can also assess the placement of toppings on a product to identify issues like gaps in topping placement on bagels or doughnuts.\n\nAutomotive. Applications here can include presence/absence of required labels, verification of correct label placement, identification of wrinkles/bunching on car seat covers and note the specific area on the seat where these wrinkles are located for ease of physical assessment."

While Kafka enables you to move data around in real time, Flink allows you to process data according to your needs and Iceberg helps you access stored data in a structured and navigable manner so that it\u2019s ripe for querying. All three are influencing how we build data systems.\n\nNew features are continuously being added to each of the three tools by their open source software communities, often in collaboration with one another. This means that best practices are constantly evolving. And that means data professionals must stay on top of wider industry trends like the recent increased focus on data governance.\n\nHere are three trends I\u2019ve been seeing lately around the Kafka, Flink, and Iceberg communities. Each presents a new way for engineers to manage data and meet application needs."
