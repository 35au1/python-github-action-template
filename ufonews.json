It\u2019s a collection of 50 original 8-bit games that both reference gaming history and iterate on it. Even with a handful of misses in the oddball package, these are lovingly crafted retro throwbacks that encapsulate what made that creative era of gaming so special. It\u2019s also a game that is invested in creating a fiction that its players will buy into. The invented premise is that all of these games were created by a cult classic studio named UFO Soft in the 1980s. It\u2019s a fictional company with very real roots in pioneers like Jeff Minter\u2019s Llamasoft.\n\nTo properly communicate how well UFO 50 builds that fiction, we decided to take a structural swing of our own crafted from the same historical roots. The below review imagines a fictional Digital Trends Magazine, modeled after historic gaming publications like Zzap!64. It is both a review of all 50 games in the collection, as well as a fictional play about three critics that unfolds through their writing over an eight-year span. If you\u2019re just here for a straight recommendation, UFO 50 will give you more value for your buck than any game released in 2024. But if you\u2019re willing to get a little experimental with us, read on.]\n\nHappy New Year, Trendsetters! We have a good feeling that 1992 is going to be a great year for video games, especially with the continued rise of the Super Nintendo. We\u2019ll have plenty of great games to review this year, but before barreling forward, we wanted to take a moment to reflect. Sometimes we\u2019re so focused on the future of tech here at Digital Trends Magazine that we lose sight of the games, developers, and lost eras that brought us so much joy. It\u2019s with that thought that we present a very special issue.\n\nThis year marks the 10-year anniversary of UFO Soft (originally known as LX Systems). The eccentric developer was a staple of the 8-bit era, reaching cult classic status after releasing a barrage of 50 games between 1982 and 1989 on LX home computers. Its wide-ranging catalog represents what we love about video games. The bulk of these games carry an oddball creative spirit. They are not afraid to experiment with new ideas, or iterate on old ones in ways that make them feel brand new. Even its \u201cduds\u201d are at least interesting failures that reach for innovation rather than playing it safe. And all of those games are lovingly crafted with memorable visual and sound design that showcases how expressive 8-bit tech could be.\n\nTo celebrate that achievement, we\u2019ve put together this issue as a comprehensive retrospective on UFO Soft. In these pages, you\u2019ll find every single review we published for the studio\u2019s games over the years. These works paint a picture of a changing era as the shape-shifting joys of gaming\u2019s Wild West days slowly coalesced into repeatable formulas and franchises of rising scale, sometimes to the detriment of even these games.\n\nThis was a great time of change for Digital Trends Magazine, too. Our own writers went through their own transformation during this eight-year span. Their outlooks on art and life morphed alongside these games and the real-world tragedies surrounding them, including the shocking death of one of our own critics. This UFO 50 issue is not just a fun excuse to revisit some old games; it\u2019s a reminder that our worlds are ever-shifting.\n\nOur very own Mark Kemp put it best in his landmark review of Mortol 2: \u201cGames, like lives, are fragile things. Cradle them carefully in your hands as long as you can before they become fading memories.\u201d\n\n~ Amelia Bancroft, Editor in Chief\n\nBarbuta (1982)\n\nArthur Webb: Exploring a winding castle, collecting gold, and dodging devious traps. It all sounds like the recipe for a grand adventure. So then why am I so bored? My gran moves faster than this plodding hero, and the only danger she\u2019s running from is gout! This sprawling play area is too often let down by an overabundance of dead ends and sparse sounds. But I admit, I\u2019m still thinking about this castle\u2019s dense secrets and unexpected tricks even after putting it down. I wish to solve it like a crossword puzzle.\n\nRating: 51%\n\nBug Hunter (1983)\n\nMark Kemp: I\u2019ve slayed more insect baddies than I can count in my life, but never quite like this! Though it took me a few tries to wrap my head around Bug Hunter\u2019s delicate energy and action juggling act, the strategic bug-slaying actions quickly got their hooks in me. With so many special movement and attack patterns to experiment with, all of which change how I manage a lethal grid that fills with evolving nasties on each turn, this is the kind of brainy action you could lose a job to.\n\nRating: 89%\n\nNinpek (1983)\n\nBarty Hughes: Don\u2019t you dare call this another Ninjamania clone! Ninpek brings plenty of new thrills to the trendy action formula. My colourful hero is quite nimble thanks to his second jump (I wish I could do that!), which lets him whiz past enemy attacks as he sends back his shuriken in midair \u2014 just like a real ninja! The use of advanced screen scrolling on the LX just makes that action even more exciting. It\u2019s an easy to learn high-score chase that requires some real discipline to master.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nPaint Chase (1983)\n\nMark Kemp: Paint Chase is a peculiar program that\u2019s more about out-painting rival cars than outracing them. Each level places your car in a small maze, and the goal is to paint as much of the ground as possible by driving over it before the timer runs out. It\u2019s a novel idea helped by a few handy power-ups and nail-biting rounds, but it runs out of gas eventually. For more fun, bring a pal along for some tense two-player battles that are sure to ruin friendships!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nMagic Garden (1984)\n\nBarty Hughes: Aside from showing off the power of the LX-IT\u2019s visual power with its splendid pastel colours, Magic Garden is an otherwise fine program. The player simply walks around a checkered grid picking up blobs, who follow the witch hero like a snake until she drops them off in designated zones to rack up points. It\u2019s pleasant in short bursts, but I can\u2019t say that it fully cast a spell on me! At least these slimes are cute little buggers.\n\nRating: 69%\n\nMortol (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Death is not the end \u2026 or at least it isn\u2019t in the bloody brilliant Mortol. The player embarks on a dangerous quest to save the world of Mortolia. In order to overcome its obstacles, the player can sacrifice one of their 15 lives to stick into a wall like an arrow, turn into a stone, or explode to take out walls and alien nasties. Each decision will let the next summoned soldier move forward by trampling on the remains of their predecessors. Grim, but morbidly fun! Only by using each life wisely to solve the level like a puzzle can the player reach the finish. It\u2019s a suicide mission you\u2019ll want to go on over and over again!\n\nRating: 90%\n\nVelgress (1984)\n\nArthur Webb: Velgress has it all on paper. It requires precise jumping as the pirate Alpha scrambles up a well full of small footholds that crumble almost instantaneously, while blasting baddies or dodging them with her second jump. And yet, it\u2019s all a bit of a science fiction snoozefest with all the repetitive jumping, lame power-ups that can be bought between levels, and a musical ditty that grates after your hundredth death. I\u2019ll give credit where it\u2019s due, though. The fact that the layout of the well changes with each play makes every attempt feel just a bit new. The programmers may be on to something there.\n\nRating: 61%\n\nPlanet Zoldath (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: I must say, this is one of the more cerebral adventure games I\u2019ve played as of late, even if it\u2019s not the most exciting. This vibrant alien planet is filled with mysterious gizmos, resources that power them, and secret areas that can only be accessed by using the right one. It really feels like I\u2019m learning the ins and outs of a foreign world each time I take another crack at its ever-changing map.\n\nRating: 76%\n\nAttactics (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Never before has a program captured the epic scale of war as well as Attactics. The tactical battles here, as soldiers automatically march forward every few seconds, make for a brainy game of split-second decision-making. You\u2019ll feel like a general sending your troops to their death! With several distinct unit types, two-player clashes, and even a never-ending mode, this is the total bloody package!\n\nRating: 84%\n\nDevilition (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Dare I say that LX Systems is becoming devilishly clever? Like Attactics and Bug Hunter, this is another unique strategy game that turns battles against demons into a puzzle. The goal is to rid a checkerboard of beasts by placing down forces with specific attack patterns. Once all are placed to your liking, you choose to detonate one and begin a chain reaction. That is, if you\u2019ve placed your units in the right spot! It\u2019s a bit too hard to keep track of that once I place down a piece, so getting through all 10 boards and protecting the civilians on them requires a lot of concentration. God help you if you accidentally blow a pilgrim to smithereens!\n\nRating: 79%\n\nKick Club (1984)\n\nBarty Hughes: Now here\u2019s a game I can get behind! Football becomes deadly in this famil- friendly sports game where the player kicks their ball to destroy some menacing athletic equipment. It\u2019s an enchanting scenario propped up by pleasant cartoon visuals and jaunty music. It\u2019s perhaps a little too simple to command long-term interest from the tykes, but I\u2019m just glad to be allowed back on the pitch after getting a lifetime ban a few months back (don\u2019t ask!).\n\nRating: 75%\n\nAvianos (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: I can\u2019t make heads or tails of this one \u2026 or should I say beaks or wings? This strategy game imagines a world where birds and dinosaurs have gone to war. I appreciate the idea and the detailed reptile portraits to match it, but its actual battles are a mess. From what I can gather from the unclear instructions and cluttered screen, players take turns gathering resources, summoning monsters, and using them to overtake castles. Oh bother, just devour me already and get it over with!\n\nRating: 55%\n\nMooncat (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: LX Systems has really outdone itself this time. It\u2019s managed to make an adventure game even more frustrating than its dull debut Barbuta. The cryptic art and eerie sounds are enticing, but don\u2019t let those fool you. The strange control scheme and boring level construction aren\u2019t nearly as exciting as its psychedelic world. Don\u2019t bother writing in to complain, Barbuta fans. I\u2019ll send your letters straight to the trash along with this art house rubbish!\n\nRating: 46%\n\nBushido Ball (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: As far as Pong clones go, you could do worse than this straightforward, but thin offering. The twist is that the paddles are replaced with samurai and ninjas who can trick one another with special shots. That freshens up a tired formula a bit, but not enough to cut through the competition. Hey Arthur, how about you let me take some of those artsy games off your hands next time! Why do I get stuck with all the simple ones these days, huh? Don\u2019t you trust me?\n\nRating: 59%\n\nBlock Koala (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: Don\u2019t let these adorable marsupials mislead you. Koala Park will put your brain to the test. Each stage tasks the player with moving a star block to an end goal, but there are pesky number blocks in the way. Creating a clear path becomes a bit of a math problem, as there are rules to remember. For instance, a block can\u2019t push another if the first one has a smaller number value than the other. It might be too tricky for youngsters (or our own Barty) despite its cutesy visuals, but adults will find a lot of tough challenges to crack.\n\nRating: 75%\n\nCamouflage (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: Who\u2019s the dumb one now, Mark? Old Barty boy had no trouble at all with this ingenious puzzle game. The player takes control of a friendly chameleon who must evade the sight line of hungry frogs by properly camouflaging to match the coloured environment. The boys didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be smart enough for this one, but joke\u2019s on them! This is an easy to pick up puzzler that oozes with charm. I made it all the way to level 5 even!\n\nRating: 87%\n\nCampanella (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: Imagine your average program where you duck and dodge through a screen full of obstacles. Now, replace your grounded hero with a spaceship that must be piloted with careful precision. That\u2019s what LX Systems delivers with Campanella, perhaps the most tense game since Lunar Lander (which it no doubt draws inspiration from). If you fly into an obstacle, your ship will shatter into a million pieces! I do have a few qualms. I find the little UFO\u2019s slashing action is too short-ranged, and the music and visuals aren\u2019t up to par with LX sci-fi offerings like Planet Zoldath, but the anxious energy kept my palms constantly coated with a layer of sweat.\n\nRating: 77%\n\nGolfaria (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: By now, our most loyal readers likely know that LX Systems has not taken kindly to my reviews over the past few years. I have been dragged through the mud in several of its newsletters, with so-called visionaries like Thorson Petter calling me a \u201chack.\u201d Well add some more hate mail to the pile, because Golfaria is another stinker! As LX so often tends to do, this game overthinks an ambitious adventure by putting players in control of an unwieldy golf ball. I\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s a cutesy idea, but it\u2019s simply a pain to navigate confusing topography before going over a needless \u201cstroke limit\u201d and getting warped back to faraway checkpoints. LX\u2019s inventive design may be its defining quality, but that strength can just as easily be its weakness.\n\nRating: 57%\n\nThe Big Bell Race (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: Oh, I see how it is. I thought we were all equals here, but no! \u201cCampanella is a high-priority game, Barty! You can\u2019t review it, Barty! Here, why don\u2019t you do the Campanella spinoff racing game that we\u2019re too smart to review instead, Barty!?\u201d Is that how it\u2019s going to be? Well fine. The Big Bell Race is a mediocre racing game hastily built from Campanella\u2019s visuals to capitalize on its instant success. I beat it in 12 minutes. It\u2019s an unremarkable afterthought. I\u2019m starting to know the feeling!\n\nRating: 52%\n\nWarptank (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: This has proved to be a strange year for LX Systems. It may have had a big hit in Campanella, but the company\u2019s offerings have proved divisive. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone will disagree with Warptank. This isn\u2019t just the finest LX offering of 1985; it may just be the best game of this whole year! This mind-bending game has the player controlling a little tank that can warp onto the wall opposite of it. That opens the door for some of the year\u2019s sharpest puzzles. It makes Camouflage look like a baby\u2019s toy!\n\nRating: 88%\n\nWaldorf\u2019s Journey (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: A walrus game. A bloody Walrus game. Is that all I\u2019m good for? You know, I studied at uni like the rest of these tossers. So what if I didn\u2019t attend Oxford? And alright, I flunked out! But that means I have to review the cartoon animal games now? Well, fine. This is a sweet little program about a sleeping walrus who dreams of leaping through the air and collecting fish. It\u2019s a simple little jumping game that can be tricky to control as the player must hold the jump button to move, but it is elevated by some lovely illustrations and a dreamlike musical ditty. But don\u2019t expect another review like this from me this year! New year, new Barty, I say!\n\nRating: 66%\n\nPorgy (1986)\n\nArthur Webb: Well, well, LX Systems has changed its name to UFO Soft. Now, was that to capitalize on the success of Campanella or to salvage their reputation? No matter, because you can smell the LX stink on Porgy. Sure, this is an improvement over Barbuta and the dreadful Mooncat. This submarine exploration game is suitably tense, as the player must find ship upgrades and then return to base to install them before their fuel runs out. But that\u2019s not without frustration, as persistent enemies like sharks can appear at random and ruin a perfectly good dive. It\u2019s another overworked concept, but I\u2019ll be the bigger man and admit that the sprawling ocean play area and loads of upgrades make for a sizable underwater journey.\n\nRating: 73%\n\nOnion Delivery (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: How alien it is to be human! That is the thesis of Onion Delivery, a story of an extraterrestrial forced to spend his menial days delivering vegetables around a chaotic city by car. A troglodyte may tell you that this is a simple-minded driving game with poor controls that render it nearly unplayable. But I beg thee, look beneath the hood. Consider the sharp social satire here about how, uh, cars are \u2026 sort of \u2026 weird. Oh, this isn\u2019t working either.\n\nRating: 45%\n\nCaramel Caramel (1986)\n\nMark Kemp: I can already hear Arthur calling this one \u201coverworked.\u201d What a load of codswallop! Well, let me tell you, Caramel Caramel shows the exact thing I enjoy about UFO Soft. This is your standard scrolling spaceship shoot-\u2019em-up, yes. But it makes that idea new again with a camera function that lets the player attack aliens by taking pictures, a bevy of colourful alien planets, and an imaginative alien world. The appeal of games is the way they build on one another\u2019s ideas. It\u2019s a conversation between programmers who are unafraid to be a little silly, try something new, and reinvent themselves. It\u2019s not the most sophisticated product, but who would root against a spirited underdog?\n\nRating: 76%\n\nParty House (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: This brilliant game about managing a house party is one that\u2019s easy to relate to. Who hasn\u2019t felt like an outcast from the \u201ccool kid\u2019s club\u201d who\u2019s struggling to be let into the party? The goal is simple: throw the ultimate party. To do that, the player collects a set of partygoers, each of which has their own popularity and cash value. Those resources can be used to add more guests to your rolodex or increase the size of the house to invite more guests. All players need to do is open the door to fill the room with guests and amass points to add new ones to the guest list. But watch out! Some guests bring trouble, which can alert the police and shut down the shindig for the night. It\u2019s one of the most clever games UFO Soft has made yet and I simply can\u2019t stop playing it.\n\nRating: 94%\n\nHot Foot (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: Yet another relatable game from UFO Soft! I guess they must be reading my diary! This is a sports game where children play dodgeball with beanbags. It\u2019s a fine adaptation of the schoolyard game that adds special throws and duos combat, but it\u2019s mostly a shallow little sports game that\u2019s only good for a few plays. Do you know what stands out, though? At the start of each round, you and the computer take turns drafting a team from five students. After four are drafted, the last one is left crying on the sidelines. Very sad, wouldn\u2019t you say, readers?\n\nRating: 59%\n\nDivers (1986)\n\nArthur Webb: Oh hardy har har. The fools at UFO Soft must have read my complaints on Porgy and made a much worse underwater adventure to punish me. This aimless exploration game is burdened by dull turn-taking battles, a confusing shop system, and an environment that feels empty, as impressively detailed as it is. This is where Mark and I disagree. Just because a program is doing something different doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s suddenly worthy of praise. Some things, such as a UFO Soft adventure game, are just destined to be unremarkable, no matter how many times they may change their gimmick!\n\nRating: 58%\n\nRail Heist (1987)\n\nBarty Hughes: I bought a motorcycle. That\u2019s right, I\u2019m a wild man now, just like the gun-toting cowboy in Rail Heist. This strategic heist game has the player stealing cash from train cars while avoiding the sight of gunmen. The twist is that the action happens in turns, so the player has a few seconds to move through the train, knock out guards, hide behind walls, or punch holes in the wall to create faster getaway routes. It takes some time to get the hang of, making it one of UFO Soft\u2019s more expert level games. But it\u2019s no match for a dangerous man like me!\n\nRating: 84%\n\nVainger (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: Readers, I come bearing some sad news. Barty is in the hospital. He got into a motorcycle accident. He is in a coma and the doctors don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll wake up. Arthur and I are stunned. Barty didn\u2019t even know how to ride a motorcycle. I guess he just bought one to impress us.\n\nIt\u2019s all weighing heavily on me, so much so that I can\u2019t even get excited about a spiritual follow-up to the excellent Warptank. This larger iteration takes the gravity-shifting hook and applies it to a shoot-\u2019em-up adventure. It\u2019s a thrilling sci-fi action game filled with secrets and an intriguing mystery, though it loses the elegance of its predecessor in its larger scale. I wish I could enjoy it more right now. But like its hero standing on the ceiling, my world is upside down. Maybe a map would help.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nRock On! Island (1987)\n\nArthur Webb: You know, this is the kind of game that we would have just made Barty do. I would have said it was beneath me. Let that big, old oaf take it so I can handle the big adventure games! Maybe I\u2019ve had it wrong all these years. Rock On! Island is, dare I say \u2026 fun? The player places down cavemen who defend their home from waves of dinosaurs with their automatic attacks. It\u2019s not deep, sure, but the light strategy is refreshing after years of reviewing overly complicated games that I don\u2019t even care for. Maybe there is more joy in a simple, easily communicated idea than I had realized. Barty must understand that. I hope to ask him about it one day.\n\nRating: 75%\n\nPingolf (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: This is a fine miniature golf game. You charge your shot and hit a ball toward a hole while avoiding science-fiction obstacles that look like they were pulled out of Campanella. Lose the intergalactic tournament and you can try again. You don\u2019t need me to tell you if you\u2019ll enjoy it. It does what it says on the package, no more, no less.\n\n(Readers, we have heard you. We, too, miss Barty\u2019s odd sense of humour. There is still no word on his recovery, but we will be starting a new writer in the coming months to bring some levity back to this magazine. You will be seeing a lot of him soon, as Arthur has opted to take a sabbatical for the next few months. He says he needs to find himself. Bear with me as I run the show alone for the next month or so.)\n\nRating: 61%\n\nMortol 2 (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: I\u2019ve been thinking about death a lot recently. Not just human death, though that weighs heavy on my mind too. But this video game world is itself always in a cycle of death. Home consoles live out their lives and then fade away. Development studios have their meteoric rises, but we know they will not be around forever. Even franchises like Mortol no doubt have an expiration date. It is too easy to take for granted that this 8-bit era \u2014 its games and its stars, like UFO Soft \u2014 will leave us one day. We will cherish them later in life, looking back on them with fond nostalgia, but it is so easy to forget that in the moment. We must soak in this era of inventive play, one that fights back the tide of commercialization. We must hold on to the strange, quirky games we love, for they will die 100 deaths before we know it.\n\nMortol 2 is a reminder of that truth. In this adventure, the player must navigate a map full of traps and demons, but they only have 100 lives to do it. Like in the first Mortol, these heroes can be sacrificed to help the ones that come later to navigate. One turns into a platform upon their demise. Another leaves behind a teleporter. Each death is a reminder of what came before; lost lives that paved a path for the future. It\u2019s maddeningly difficult, often to a fault, but there is truth in this somber scenario. Let the dead be a monument. Let them be a persistent reminder to embrace the present while it is here. Games, like lives, are fragile things. Cradle them carefully in your hands as long as you can before they become fading memories.\n\nRating: 83%\n\nFist Hell (1987)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Wacky Jerry reporting in for duty all the way from the U.S. of A! Honk honk! I\u2019m new to the team, but I just know we\u2019re going to have fun together! Now, I hope you didn\u2019t just eat, because Fist Hell will make you puke \u2014 in a good way! This gross-out beat-\u2019em-up has you pummeling zombies and werewolves up and down the city streets with your deep arsenal of attacks. It\u2019s like having a Hollywood action movie in your hands. There\u2019s so much blood \u2026 it\u2019s awesome!!! No more of this sci-fi crud or boring puzzles. This is the future of games!!\n\nRating: 85%\n\nOverbond (1987)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Say goodbye to boring old Velgress and say hello to Overbond. This sequel cuts out all the crap like jumping. Instead, the bounty hunter Alpha gets dropped in an arena and she has to survive eight battles against enemies, all while collecting money to upgrade her gear between fights. Best of all? She has a gun! It\u2019s all like POW POW! And then you drop a bomb and they EXPLODE. It\u2019s crazy!!! I wish there were more kinds of guns and blood and stuff, but I think the \u201cshooter\u201d game is going to be big, you watch. I wish every game was like this!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nCampanella 2 (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: Something is changing. I can feel it. Games are getting bigger, more spectacular, but more templatized too. Compare Campanella to its new sequel. The original was a concise concept built on a simple tension. Campanella 2 is bigger. There are on-foot shooting segments, upgrades, and a vast world to explore. It should feel grander. It does, sometimes. But why, I ask, does it feel narrower too? It\u2019s as if UFO Soft\u2019s eclectic vision is all funneling toward one \u201caction-adventure\u201d bucket? What is happening to imaginative games like Bug Hunter or Warptank? Is there still hope that the underdogs can survive?\n\nPlease wake up, Barty.\n\nRating: 73%\n\nHyper Contender (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Hyper Contender is chock-full of action! This fighting game has players beating the snot, and rings, out of one another! The first to get five rings wins the match, so it\u2019s not just about who\u2019s better at punching. That\u2019s a radical spin on the fighting game, even if there aren\u2019t too many modes or characters here. But what I really love is that this game features characters from a bunch of other UFO Soft games! Isn\u2019t that so cool?? Give me more, more, more of my favorite characters please!!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nValbrace (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: This fantasy adventure has shades of classic maze games like 3D Monster Maze, but with more modern RPG touches that you\u2019d see in something like Gauntlet. The player crawls through a labyrinthian dungeon full of traps in search of valuable treasure. It\u2019s a basic concept, but it replaces turn-based encounters against monsters with real-time slashing. It\u2019s a more fast-paced spin on an old formula that fits with UFO Soft\u2019s push toward more mechanically sophisticated action. Won\u2019t Mr. Wack Job be happy to hear it \u2026\n\nRating: 76%\n\nRakshasa (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Namaste, readers. Where have I been the past few months? Well, where haven\u2019t I been? I have cleansed my soul in the waters of the world. I feel refreshed, born anew. How fitting is it, then, that my first task upon returning is writing about the great Rakshasa? At first, this feels similar to the side-scrolling high-score action of Ninpek, but there\u2019s a hopeful twist. Every time the hero dies, their spirit pops out. By dodging enemies and collecting shards, they can bring themselves back to life. It is a game of second, third, and even fourth chances. It posits that there is always hope that we may wipe the slate clean and come back anew. Perhaps I am not fated to become an old grump. And maybe this era of 8-bit games does not have to end with the advent of 16-bit fast approaching. Maybe it too can rise again, a reinvented version of itself crafted by developers who care enough to return to this style of game-making with new ideas. I hope to see that day.\n\nRating: 82%\n\nStar Waspir (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: This space shoot-\u2019em-up is par for the course. Fly a ship through the air, blast baddies, rack up a high score. Its sole innovation is that the enemies drop power-up blocks, with the player needing to collect three. And the ability they ultimately get is determined by which blocks they collect. That adds some mix-and-match potential that upgrades each of the three ships with additional tools like helper drones or more powerful shots. It\u2019s a smaller twist than UFO Soft usually delivers on familiar formulas. Maybe it\u2019s running short on ideas. It must be exhausting to keep this kind of creative pace up. (Sigh, after turning in this draft, the powers-that-be here asked me to include a \u201csecond opinion\u201d from Jerry.)\n\nWacky Jerry: POW! POW! POW! Isn\u2019t it so cool when you get to blast spaceships and watch them explode in fiery glory?? I say, don\u2019t listen to Mark! He\u2019s such a drag! Buy this game today from your local Electro-Mart! Shop today and save 15% off* on a purchase of an LX-III! And don\u2019t forget to spank my butt and call me wacky!\n\n*Terms and conditions apply, see in-store for details.\n\nMark\u2019s Rating: 69%\n\nJerry\u2019s Rating: 90%\n\nGrimstone (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! OK, so you know those lame-o Dragon Quest games? Well what if I told you they made them cool? Grimstone is basically that game but with cowboys and guns! You shoot bandits and monsters in turn-based battles where you need to press a button at the right time to hit. There are tons of towns to explore, horses to ride, and more. It\u2019s a full-on Western fantasy! I\u2019m so glad to see UFO Soft making more games with American sensibilities! Yee-haw partner!!!\n\nRating: 82%\n\nLords of Diskonia (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: Finally, UFO Soft makes a return to the innovative strategy games I came to love them for in 1982. This creative wargame imagines troops as discs that can be flung into one another. Battles see the player bouncing off their foes\u2019 discs to damage them, sending them retreating to their camp to restock. The goal is to eventually overtake their camp after winning battles and pushing them back enough, all while using gold to hire more troops. Perhaps it speaks to me so much because sometimes it feels like we\u2019re always fighting a war in the world of games. There is a push and pull between creativity and safety. More and more, the latter seems to be winning. Games are settling into formulas. The enthusiasts who refuse to question it gain control of the battlefield. The people who care fall one by one. All these forces ricochet into one another, but I fear that it\u2019s the ones with the most gold who will stand tall at the end of the day. What will we lose when the frontlines of creativity fall?\n\nRating: 89%\n\nNight Manor (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky because I\u2019ve got some great news to share today! I\u2019ve been promoted to lead reviewer! Apparently, our bosses love how excited I sound about every game in all my reviews! I\u2019m going to celebrate hard tonight, but first let\u2019s talk about Night Manor because this game is tubular! This is a point-and-click horror game (ew, I know, reading), and it is totally awesome. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat and the atmosphere is total creepsville. And it\u2019s so freaky and bloody! Your parents are gonna flip!\n\nRating: 85%\n\nElfazar\u2019s Hat (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Well, I\u2019m not sure how to say this, but I\u2019m sad \u2014 well more puzzled, I suppose \u2014 to report that Jerimiah Johnson (or Wacky Jerry, as you know him) has passed away. I guess his promotion celebration went awry. Something about a deep-fried turkey and a fireworks snafu. I\u2019ll spare you the details. I have sent word to the elders of Aswan, who I lodged with during my travels to Egypt. With their blessing, may he be born anew in the waters of the Nile.\n\nThere\u2019s no real elegant way to transition to a review of a game about cute animals escaping the clutches of an evil wizard, is there? Well, then I\u2019ll just say that this is a charming little adventure that iterates on Star Waspir\u2019s power-up matching system. This feels like a far more fully realized version of that project, as it combines shoot-\u2019em-up play with a more traditional level-based adventure. It is further proof that a boorish game can get a second life as something vibrant and delightful. I\u2019m sure Jerry would have loved it.\n\nOn second thought, I haven\u2019t the slightest clue. I\u2019m not even sure he played the games he reviewed.\n\nRating: 76%\n\nPilot Quest (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Now, this is something. Imagine a program that you barely have to play at all. That is the conceit of Pilot Quest, a sort of automation game about a spaceman who crash-lands on an alien planet. First, I must smack a crystal to gather some moon resources. But soon, I spend them to create a few plants that automatically produce crystals every second. After a bit of setup, I don\u2019t need to play at all. I leave my LX-III running in the background until I have enough to set up my next task, culminating in me repairing my ship. Occasionally, I can enter a zone for a few minutes to smack enemies with my yo-yo and obtain supplies, but I have gotten so much done as it played itself. I went for a walk. I watched the Goldfinches flutter merrily. What real adventures have I been missing all these years while trudging through digital ones? Like my little spaceman, I yearn for escape.\n\nRating: 78%\n\nMini & Max (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: When Mini & Max begins, I am a little girl locked in a tiny storage room. I can barely move. But soon, my dog, Max, shows me a trick. By holding the down button, I shrink to the size of a bug. Suddenly, that tiny room becomes a sprawling metropolis full of stars to collect, dust bunnies to aid, and abilities that make the world feel even bigger. As an 8-bit game that feels like the last of a dying breed (especially as I hear that Sega\u2019s fancy 16-bit console may be coming to more countries imminently), Mini & Max is a revelation. It is a reminder that there is infinite depth in even the smallest things. These pixel games may seem limited, but UFO Soft continues to show us how boundless they are. Just when it feels like we\u2019ve hit the bottom, we discover a whole subatomic level of design decisions. There is more to explore in this 8-bit world. Why, I wonder, are we so eager to leave uncharted territory behind?\n\nRating: 90%\n\nCombatants (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: Since its second game, UFO Soft have long been obsessed with war. Combatants once again explores that idea, but at an insect level. The player controls an army of ants with a list of commands. They can summon workers to spawn more creepy-crawlies, send them into battle, or tell them to fall back. Rushing in without a plan is a surefire way to lose. These missions are frustrating. You\u2019ll want to throw your controller out the window and give up. But with patience and strategy, there is hope for survival.\n\nOh, I wasn\u2019t going to say this. I fear I\u2019ll jinx it, but \u2026 I visited Barty over the weekend and I swore I saw his eyes flutter. They fluttered! The doctor told me not to get too excited. His condition is unpredictable. I know I should be measured, but I feel a surge of hope. My sweet friend. My eccentric pal, so full of life and spirit. Will you wake up once more? Will you bring back what I was so sure we had lost? For the first time in ages, it feels as though we may win this war yet.\n\nRating: 62%\n\nQuibble Race (1989)\n\nArthur Webb: Readers, forgive me if this week\u2019s writing is sloppy. Mark has gone to be with Barty and I am taking on his work for this issue. I have also consumed a fair amount of opium this week. In any case, Quibble Race is a psychedelic alien racing game that continues UFO Soft\u2019s newfound automation experiments. You do not control your alien racer here. Rather, you bet on a winner, give them illegal boosters, and sabotage your opponents. Perhaps it is just the purple albatross with great wings of water speaking through me, but the less and less I actually have to play these games, the more at peace I become. Peculiar.\n\nRating: 65%\n\nSeaside Drive (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: Yes, yes, Seaside Drive is a blast. It is a brilliant driving-action hybrid in which players shoot at enemies from their convertible while drifting along a highway to charge their weapon\u2019s power. It\u2019s a simple, fun shoot-\u2019em-up concept with great high-score-chasing potential. I don\u2019t mean to rush through it, but I have more important news to share.\n\nI was sitting by Barty\u2019s side on a warm Sunday afternoon. A light beam poked in from the window and warmed his face. As I looked at him, bathed in angelic light, it happened. He woke up. His pupils were red and tired, but I could see that light shining through.\n\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d he said weakly. I could barely speak. My lips too stunned to move.\n\n\u201cBarty. You \u2026 there was \u2026 an accident. You\u2019ve been \u2026 asleep \u2026 for two years.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me, trying to process this, his head ever so slightly cocked to the side.\n\n\u201cDid Campanella 2 come out?\u201d he asked me, his sense of goofball humour awakening before his body.\n\n\u201cBarty,\u201d I said through tears, \u201cThey\u2019re about to release Campanella 3. And I want you to review it.\u201d\n\nRating: 83%\n\nCampanella 3 (1989)\n\nBarty Hughes: In my dreams, I saw UFOs.\n\nIsn\u2019t that something? Bloody UFOs! I don\u2019t remember much about being unconscious for two years, but I remember seeing those little pink buggers flying about. I was afraid they would shatter, as they so easily do in Campanella, but they never did. There were no walls for them to smash against in my dreams. There was only black space stretching to infinity. They could fly on forever.\n\nMark tells me that Campanella 3 is nothing like Campanella 2 even though it features that blasted UFO. I hear it shares more in common with a game called Seaside Drive (oh dear, I have a lot of catching up to do, don\u2019t I?). Mark seemed a bit peeved that the tense ship-flying of the past two games had gone away in favor of a shoot-\u2019em-up with a 3D scrolling trick. Well, that doesn\u2019t bother me very much! I think this is a fun little jolt of action, simple as it may be. And anyways, why would I want to play the same old thing again? I\u2019d be cross if I came out of a bloody coma only to play the same game again!\n\nWhen I told Mark that, he looked surprised. We got to talking and he told me that he\u2019s just afraid that everything is changing. He doesn\u2019t know where games are going with this 16-bit world coming, and he hears rumors that UFO Soft may be on the verge of closing its doors soon. I told him he worries too much! It\u2019s not like his memories of the 8-bit age are going to shatter when the Sega system comes to the United Kingdom! You don\u2019t have to lock the past in a storage closet full of junk to crash into. Let those UFOs loose into the night sky where they belong. They\u2019ll always wave down to us with their blinking lights.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe they\u2019ll touch down on Earth again once they\u2019ve explored the deepest reaches of space and find something new to show us!\n\nRating: 81%\n\nCyber Owls (1989)\n\nArthur Webb: It\u2019s the end of the world as we know it and only a gang of militarized owls can save it. Cyber Owls takes the player through four missions with very different playstyles, from a standard beat-\u2019em-up to a motorbike chase to a top-down stealth infiltration segment. It\u2019s action-packed, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s the last game I will ever review.\n\nYes, I am retiring, dear reader, to pursue a new career in bird conservation. The Cyber Owls may defend the world from harm, but who will protect the real owls in our own world? Don\u2019t let anyone tell you there\u2019s no such thing as second chances \u2014 especially me! As the great wise men of Chaukhamba once told me, resurrection is not so much a miracle as it is a trust that even the simplest things contain an infinite capacity for reinvention. There may yet be a future within the past. Or something like that. Namaste, readers. May you rise anew one day.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nIn loving memory of Jerimiah \u201cWacky Jerry\u201d Johnson."

        "article_content": "PC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\n\nDo you remember spending entire weekends playing games with your friends on your family's LX game console? Losing hours after school on Fist Hell, Cyber Owls, and Vainger? No of course you don't, because the entire line of systems and all their games were invented for UFO 50, a game collection that wants to recapture not just a certain style of retro gaming but the feeling of playing them at home as well.\n\nNeed to know What is it? An alternative '80s timeline packed with amazing games\n\nExpect to pay: Not listed\n\nDeveloper: Mossmouth\n\nPublisher: Mossmouth\n\nReviewed on: Intel i9-13900HX, RTX 4090 (laptop), 32GB RAM\n\nSteam Deck: Not listed\n\nMultiplayer? Yes\n\nLink: Official site\n\nThe volume of experiences on offer and their randomness is designed to replicate that nostalgic pirate NES multicart feel, the sort of thing that had a picture of Rambo fighting a dinosaur on the label and was packed with games like TURBO KOMBAT RACER 12. Poking around the menu and finding out what the heck these games are is as much a part of the experience as playing any of the fully featured 50 games themselves.\n\nEvery game comes with a (very) short description to help make that poking a little easier. There's a tab for basic controls\u2014more often than not as simple as X=SHOOT\u2014and a history tab revealing an imaginary background for the game. I ended up playing something called Divers first, mostly because I had to pick something and my cursor happened to be hovering over its retro floppy disc icon at the time. I muddled through the short opening menu, a shop where I could equip my team of three lizard-like beings with elementally-aligned sticks, assuming I was in for some stiff 8-bit style RPG action. Instead I found myself swimming through dark caverns teeming with monsters, with only the on-screen depth counter for guidance.\n\nSome passageways were blocked off, levers glimpsed on the other side. Large stone carvings could be investigated, but seemed to serve no further purpose. Aquatic battles felt intimidating and exciting. It was an incredible experience to go into completely blind, like I'd uncovered an atmospheric indie game that had been lost for over 30 years.\n\nWell aware that there were 49 other games waiting to be played, I backed out as soon as I hit a roadblock and tried something else. This turned out to be Mini & Max\u2014the cute icon caught my eye\u2014which is a completely different, cartoonish adventure about a bored girl and her talking dog stuck in a single room.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Mossmouth) (Image credit: Mossmouth) (Image credit: Mossmouth) (Image credit: Mossmouth) (Image credit: Mossmouth)\n\nThe pair can both shrink to a size that turns bundles of fluff into secret lands and ordinary books into giant platforms, a max-sized Mini able to use the room as an interactive level select. Walking just a couple steps completely changed the starting point for a micro-adventure that would begin wherever I made her stand before shrinking.\n\nI had a great time with this charming platformer, but I couldn't help wonder what other delights were waiting for me. After a bit of jumping around, through Warp Tank's fantastic gravity defying puzzle-action and another with Pocky & Rocky-style shooting, I stumbled upon the horror adventure Night Manor: \"Our only game to require a warning text,\" according to its description. A few intriguing puzzles, bloodstained pieces of furniture, ominous notes, and one extremely effective hiding sequence later, and I was entranced\u2014and eager again to try another game. If Night Manor was this good, what else was waiting for me?\n\nMy haphazard stumble through UFO 50's library highlighted its general brilliance but its one major self-inflicted flaw, too. Night Manor, as well as the others I've mentioned by name above and many more besides, are more than good enough to stand on their own merits. Valbrace offers an inventive fusion of arcade-like fighting/spellcasting with traditional first-person dungeon crawling and deserves to be praised by name. Attactics is a moreish blend of straightforward combat and strategic timing that's dangerously easy to lose hours to. Caramel Caramel brilliantly combines cutesy shmupping with point-boosting photography.\n\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: Mossmouth) (Image credit: Mossmouth) (Image credit: Mossmouth) (Image credit: Mossmouth)\n\nBut the buffet-like nature of 50 whole games means that by design some get lost in the mix, just one more easily skipped icon amongst many.\n\nBecause the collection throws everything at me straight away and then makes it so easy to back out, it takes serious effort to give many of these games the time or attention they clearly deserve. It's always easier to give up when I die or encounter a knee-high obstacle and immediately bounce to play something else in here, poorly, for five brainless minutes. I have to will myself to spend time learning them, much less mastering any advanced tricks.\n\nMaking the effort often ends up souring the mood anyway, not because the games themselves aren't good, but because it becomes clear that the enforced retro styling means so many withhold basic information that would make them much more fun to play. Some of the puzzle games in particular are much more difficult to get into\u2014and much less enjoyable in those crucial opening minutes when a game needs to give me a clear reason to stick with it\u2014than they would be if I found them on the Steam store or had a physical manual to flip through. UFO 50 chooses to keep general rules, advanced tricks and subtle details secret, and the puzzlers in particular don't make a great case for putting in the effort.\n\nThese issues can be overcome with some practice, but I have to want to practise in the first place, and then I have to want to keep practising after I've been abruptly kicked back to the title screen at the earliest opportunity. A few of the 50 are just a little too retro for their own good.\n\n(Image credit: Mossmouth)\n\nBut UFO 50 is more than a bundle of imagined retro games: it's a wonderful experience in its own right, a chance to spend another rainy afternoon sitting in front of a (fake) console playing nothing in particular. Even if it fails to make each game sing, the disjointed dipping turns every session into a pleasant '80s-themed haze, a nonspecific wave of happy nostalgia for something that never existed. There's almost literally something for everyone here, from cute hoppy-jumpy action to cyber pinball golf, fantasy air hockey, walrus leaping, tactical party planning, and the tennis-with-katanas action of Bushido Ball, my personal favourite sports game of 2024.\n\nThe way the collection encourages me to casually flit around its well-crafted delights virtually guaranteed I'd \"discover\" something new every time I played for nearly a full week. The reliable quality and raw inventiveness of it all makes me wish UFO 50's treasures weren't quite so well hidden."

        "article_content": "Microsoft is unveiling new features in its $30 per user Microsoft 365 Copilot monthly subscriptions that are designed to improve AI integration inside of Office apps. Excel is getting Python integration inside of Copilot, PowerPoint has an improved AI-powered narrative builder, Word is getting better at AI-assisted drafts, and Copilot will be able to help you organize your Outlook inbox, too.\n\nAfter bringing Python to Excel last year, Microsoft is now combining its Python support with Copilot to let Excel users easily perform advanced analysis on spreadsheet data. \u201cNow, anyone can work with Copilot to conduct advanced analysis like forecasting, risk analysis, machine learning, and visualizing complex data \u2014 all using natural language, no coding required,\u201d says Jared Spataro, corporate vice president of AI at work at Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s like adding a skilled data analyst to the team.\u201d\n\nThe Copilot and Python integration inside of Excel enters public preview today, just as Microsoft makes Copilot in Excel generally available to its Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers. Microsoft has also added Copilot support for XLOOKUP and SUMIF, conditional formatting, and the ability for the AI assistant to produce more charts and PivotTables.\n\nCopilot in PowerPoint is also getting improvements, with an improved narrative builder that\u2019s designed to let you quickly create a first draft of a slide deck. The AI assistant will even soon use a company\u2019s branded template to create drafts or company-approved images from SharePoint libraries.\n\nCopilot in Microsoft Teams will summarize conversations that happened in the text chat as well as spoken ones in meetings later this month. This will help meeting organizers make sure they didn\u2019t miss any unanswered questions that were typed into the chat. \u201cOur customers tell us Copilot in Teams has changed meetings forever \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the number one place they\u2019re seeing value,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nCopilot is getting more useful inside of Outlook inboxes. Image: Microsoft\n\nI\u2019ve personally been waiting for improvements to Copilot in Outlook beyond drafting and summaries, and now Microsoft is starting to allow its AI assistant to organize your inbox. A new \u201cprioritize my inbox\u201d feature lets Copilot automatically prioritize emails. Later this year, you\u2019ll also be able to \u201cteach Copilot the specific topics, keywords, or people that are important to you,\u201d according to Spataro. These emails will then also be marked as high priority in your inbox.\n\nLater this month, Microsoft is also improving Copilot in Word to let you reference data from emails and meetings, alongside data from documents. This will make it easier to bring in attachments from emails or entire talking points from meetings. Microsoft is also rolling out Copilot in OneDrive later this month, making it easy to summarize and compare up to five files to spot differences between them.\n\nOneDrive\u2019s file comparison tool. Image: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s improvements to Copilot in Office are designed to make the AI assistant more enticing to businesses, alongside a new Copilot Pages feature and AI agents that will automate certain tasks. Recent reports have suggested there has been a lukewarm reception to Microsoft\u2019s paid Copilot version for businesses, due to bugs and a reluctance to pay the $30 per user price."

        "article_content": "The new AI search can also surface results with file and app knowledge.\n\nSalesforce has rolled out some new AI features for its business-focused Slack chat app designed to take over mundane chores like transcription.\n\nA key new feature is Slack AI huddle notes to \"capture key takeaways and action items so users can focus on the work at hand,\" the company wrote. This looks like a more powerful version of a previous Slack AI feature that recaps channel highlights and generates summaries for threads in a single click.\n\nWhen invited to a huddle, Slack AI creates a transcript based on real-time audio and messages shared in the thread. It can also organize notes with citations, action items and files shared into a canvas. All huddle attendees can then view the notes later, even if they weren't able to attend.\n\nSlack also updated its AI search feature so that it can surface unique results for a user based on files and apps they uploaded in Slack, including canvases, transcripts from clips, documents from connected apps, Google files and more.\n\nAnother timesaver is the new AI Workflow Builder that helps automate tasks. For instance, users can enter a prompt like \"send a welcome message to teammates that join a channel\" and Slack AI and Workflow Builder will will generate that functionality with no programming required.\n\nAlso arriving in the latest update are Slack templates, pre-configured for specific use cases like managing a project, collecting feedback and triaging help requests. The new Slack AI features are now available as a paid add-on for all subscription plans, and Slack templates will roll out in October 2024."

However, it appears that with the updated Amazon app interface, the AI tool is hitting more devices. Over the past few days, we spotted this appearing on more of our own Android hardware. We are seeing this on version 28.17.0.100 and higher,. If you don\u2019t see the changes, force stop the application and relaunch.\n\nWhen launching the Amazon app on your Android device, you\u2019ll notice a new search bar and removal of the blue gradient section that has been present for several years. The entire region has been reduced significantly with smaller tabbed sections for various store areas and less prominent delivery location tab.\n\nRecently viewed items are more integrated into banner ads, while the bottom navbar also has the extra Rufus icon that, when activated, allows you to get information on products or services. Rufus allows you to compare products quickly, which is useful given the limitations of the single-product view that is a limitation of the Amazon Android app.\n\nOther changes are fairly minimal and mainly relate to the new AI tool. So, when viewing a product, you may see an expandable tab that lets you pull up to ask or find quick answers about the item in question. All of the core functionality remains the same and other sections such as your account information and more are identical to previous versions of the Amazon Android app.\n\nMore on Android:"

        "article_content": "Few genres have evolved as drastically as horror. We\u2019ve come a long way from the old-school, practical scares of creature features and haunting psychological slow burns, but there\u2019s still plenty to learn from the B-movies of old.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true in an era that values IP above all; when it comes to finding the next franchise, no story is off-limits. Remakes and sequels are more prevalent than original ideas, and classics like William Castle\u2019s House on Haunted Hill have joined a growing list of stories ripe for recycling. The 1950s film starred horror legend Vincent Price in one of his most famous roles, and has been remade before, with mixed results. Whether another addition to the franchise is necessary is, as always, a question worth asking, but the team behind a new adaptation might find a way to justify it.\n\nAn exclusive report from Bloody Disgusting has confirmed the cast and crew of the upcoming House on Haunted Hill remake. Underground director Dustin Ferguson will helm it, with Victoria Price, Vincent Price\u2019s daughter, set to produce. She\u2019ll also play a role in the film, although details have yet to be revealed.\n\nCan the new House on Haunted Hill live up to the original? Allied Artists\n\nPrice won\u2019t be the only one carrying on the legacy of the original Haunted Hill, as Ferguson has also chosen Mitchel Wyatt, the great-grandson of Haunted Hill actress Julie Mitchum, to star. Brinke Stevens (of Slumber Party Massacre fame), Daniel Roebuck, Jennifer Moriarty, August Kyss, C. Courtney Joyner, and Erik Anthony Russo round out the cast.\n\nThe upcoming film is a direct sequel to Castle\u2019s Haunted Hill. The original follows a sadistic millionaire (Price) who invites five strangers to a haunted house and offers $10,000 to anyone who can survive the night, but with paranormal horrors lurking around every corner, that\u2019s easier said than done. The Haunted Hill remake is reportedly set 17 years later, in 1976. Rather than a group of strangers fighting for a life-changing amount of cash, our heroes are a team of reporters \u201cinvestigating the infamous Hill House on live television, only to face dire consequences.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how the sequel will measure up to its predecessor, but the presence of two legacy actors does speak to the project\u2019s intent. Maybe the new Haunted Hill will recapture the magic of the original; if not, it could at least offer an update on the old-school spookiness that turned Vincent Price into a horror icon. If nothing else, it would be hard to do worse than the \u201890s version."

Panels will explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and art, the recent rise of weight-loss medications and their impact, and global and local sustainability initiatives and what they might mean for humanity\u2019s future.\n\nCreating opportunities like the festival for South Side residents to learn about emerging areas of science is also at the heart of the broader Inclusive Innovation initiative UChicago is leading in partnership with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermilab. The initiative seeks to engage local students, educators, and workers and connect them to the city\u2019s growing scientific ecosystem, thereby helping to generate a diverse talent pipeline in the sciences and spur economic growth on the historically under-resourced South Side.\n\n\u201cThe South Side Science Festival allows for wide-reaching public engagement, with the aim of stimulating curiosity and excitement about STEM,\u201d says Nadya Mason, Dean of the UChicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering; Robert J. Zimmer Professor of Molecular Engineering; and Interim Vice President for Science, Innovation, and Partnerships. \u201cThe next generation of innovators may well find their passion from our hands-on science activities and demonstrations during the festival. We\u2019re excited to engage with our neighbors and share our activities and enthusiasm. Everyone benefits when science and engineering are inclusive.\u201d\n\nFor UChicago\u2019s Vice President for Civic Engagement Christian Mitchell, the festival embodies the University\u2019s commitment to leverage its strengths in a way that positively impacts its broader shared community: \u201cThis event is a chance for the campus community and the broader South Side community to come together and really take advantage of all the incredible STEM resources the University has to offer.\n\n\u201cScience only gets better when it draws on more perspectives, so opportunities like this to spark and stoke curiosity about STEM are critical\u2014especially when those sparks are igniting in people who haven\u2019t always seen themselves in these spaces,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to our students, faculty, and staff sharing their passion for STEM with attendees, and we\u2019re hopeful that the exchanges and experiences will inspire especially our young attendees to see science as a place where they can belong.\u201d"

And yet, to date, only two full skeletons have ever been uncovered at the battleground which has fascinated historians for centuries.\n\nWaterloo Uncovered, \u201ca UK charity that combines archaeology with veteran care,\u201d found the most recent of those, CNN notes, at Mont-Saint-Jean farm in Belgium believed to have been the site of the Duke of Wellington\u2019s field hospital.\n\nRelated Story Forensic Scientist Identifies Century-Old WWI Body\n\nBolstered by this discovery, the group returned to the site earlier in September to see what else they could uncover in the area surrounding where they found the skeleton. But while a full skeleton certainly qualifies as macabre on its own, what they ended up finding upon further digging was something far more grisly.\n\nThey described what they found as a \u201cunique battle clearance trench.\u201d But it's also known by another, more descriptive name: a gore pit.\n\nThierry Monasse // Getty Images Volunteers from \u2019Waterloo Uncovered\u2019 examine remains discovered within a gore pit found at the site of the famed battle\n\nThe pit appears to have been dug purposefully to collect the remains of battlefield surgeries and dead animals that would have otherwise overwhelmed the field hospital. Per a press release put out by the University of Glasgow, the contents of the pit were \u201cdeposits of human and animal remains separated by a barrier of ammunition boxes stripped from soldier\u2019s leather satchels.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Roman Wall From the Fight Against Spartacus Found\n\nOf the animal remains, there was an ox and \u201cat least seven horses.\u201d Most of the animals showed signs of being slaughtered, but three appeared to have been \u201ceuthanised via a musket ball to the head.\u201d On the other side of the pit, nearer where the complete skeleton had been discovered in 2022, they found what was described as a \u201cpile\u201d of human limbs. The limbs had been amputated, it was determined, as many \u201cstill contain evidence of removal by the surgeon\u2019s saw.\u201d This, according to the press release, aligns with eyewitness reports from the battle, which described amputated limbs as \u201cpiling up in all four corners of the courtyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any other site that has this combination of elements,\u201d notes Waterloo Uncovered's Archaeological Director Tony Pollard. \u201cIt\u2019s truly unique, within Napoleonic archaeology and beyond. The layout of the trench, with all animal remains on one side of the ammunition box barrier and all the human remains on the other, strongly suggests that the men who buried this individual attempted to offer him a level of dignity and respect despite the horrific scene they would have found themselves facing while clearing the field hospital of the dead.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Company Logo\n\nUnited Kingdom HR Analytics Market\n\nUnited Kingdom HR Analytics Market\n\nDublin, Sept. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"United Kingdom HR Analytics Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2019-2029F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom HR Analytics Market was valued at USD 165 Million in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 352 Million by 2029 with a CAGR of 13.33% during the forecast period.\n\n\n\nThe HR Analytics market includes a range of software solutions designed to collect, analyze, and visualize HR data, enabling organizations to forecast workforce needs, identify skill gaps, and improve retention strategies. As companies increasingly recognize the value of a data-driven approach to HR, the demand for HR Analytics tools has surged across various industries.\n\nThis market is driven by the need for organizations to remain competitive in a rapidly changing business environment, where the ability to effectively manage and develop human capital is critical. As a result, the HR Analytics market continues to expand, with vendors offering more sophisticated solutions tailored to the specific needs of businesses of all sizes.\n\nIncreased Adoption of Predictive Analytics\n\n\n\nOne of the prominent trends in the United Kingdom HR Analytics market is the growing adoption of predictive analytics. Predictive analytics uses historical data, machine learning algorithms, and statistical techniques to forecast future outcomes, enabling HR professionals to anticipate trends and make proactive decisions. In the UK, where competition for talent is fierce, organizations are increasingly turning to predictive analytics to optimize their workforce strategies.\n\n\n\nPredictive analytics in HR can be applied to various areas, such as predicting employee turnover, identifying high-potential employees, and forecasting future talent needs. By leveraging predictive models, HR departments can identify employees who are at risk of leaving and implement retention strategies before attrition occurs. Additionally, predictive analytics can help in succession planning by identifying employees who are likely to succeed in leadership roles, enabling organizations to invest in their development.\n\n\n\nThe trend towards predictive analytics is driven by the need for organizations to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing business environment. As the UK labor market becomes more dynamic, with shifts in job roles, skills requirements, and workforce demographics, the ability to predict future trends is becoming increasingly valuable. This trend is expected to continue as more organizations recognize the strategic benefits of predictive analytics in HR.\n\n\n\nIntegration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\n\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into HR Analytics is another significant trend in the United Kingdom. AI and ML technologies are transforming HR Analytics by enabling more sophisticated data analysis, automating routine tasks, and providing deeper insights into workforce dynamics. In the UK, organizations are increasingly adopting AI-driven HR Analytics solutions to enhance decision-making and improve HR processes.\n\n\n\nAI and ML can automate tasks such as candidate screening, performance evaluations, and employee engagement analysis, freeing up HR professionals to focus on more strategic activities. For instance, AI-powered chatbots can handle routine HR inquiries, while ML algorithms can analyze employee feedback to identify patterns in engagement and satisfaction. These technologies can also predict workforce trends, such as identifying skills gaps or forecasting the impact of organizational changes on employee morale.\n\n\n\nThe trend towards AI and ML integration is driven by the demand for more efficient and effective HR operations. As these technologies continue to evolve, their capabilities in HR Analytics are expected to become even more advanced, allowing organizations in the UK to gain a competitive edge by leveraging cutting-edge tools to manage their workforce.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 88 Forecast Period 2023 - 2029 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2023 $165 Million Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2029 $352 Million Compound Annual Growth Rate 13.3% Regions Covered United Kingdom\n\nReport Scope:\n\nKey Market Players\n\nSAP SE\n\nOracle Corporation\n\nIBM Corporation\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\nWorkday, Inc.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.
