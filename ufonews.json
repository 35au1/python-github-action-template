            "article_content": "The White House has ruled out foreign adversaries and hobbyists as the cause of the drone invasion in New Jersey, leaving many residents to speculate it could be aliens.\n\nThe internet has been flooded with images and videos showing bright orbs and triangle-shaped craft having in the night sky that move in bizarre flight patterns.\n\nGeorge Noory, host of Coast-to-Coast AM and a leading voice of the unexplained, told DailyMail.com: 'It's bizarre. There's something else very, very nefarious about this.'\n\nThe drones are avoiding capture, he said, adding, 'They shut their lights off, they are undetectable in some cases. It's very, very bizarre. This could be an act of war for all I know.'\n\nBut alien tech? Noory said it doesn't add up.\n\n'I'm going to rule out extraterrestrial. It doesn't sound like that,' he said. 'It sounds more like a military effort than anything else.'\n\n'I'm going to rule out extraterrestrial. It doesn't sound like that,' he said. 'It sounds more like a military effort than anything else.'\n\nPentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the initial assessment is that 'this is not the work of a foreign adversary or a foreign entity.'\n\nThe FBI and Homeland Security are investigating, and politicians have conflicting takes.\n\nWhite House National Security spokesman John Kirby said this week that many of the reported drones are manned aircraft being operated lawfully.\n\n'A congressman out of New Jersey believes that there is an Iranian ship parked off the East Coast of the US and it is sending these drones over certain military bases, Donald Trump's golf course, and strange strategic locations,' Noory said.\n\nThe drones were first spotted in northern New Jersey, near Morris County, in November.\n\nResidents said the drones gather in clusters at night and fly with their lights off. They appear to avoid detection by helicopter and radio.\n\n'There's some helicopters that have been seen in the area, and these things seem to avoid those,' said Noory.\n\nA few spots drones have surveyed: military research facility Picatinny Arsenal, President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster, and around critical infrastructure including water reservoirs, electrical transmission lines, police stations and military bases.\n\n'Drones are legal as long as they're registered with the FAA and are allowed to fly around certain spots,' Noory said. 'But this is weird.'\n\nThere are some notable no-fly zones even for registered drones: around airports, military installations, certain landmarks, nuclear plants and stadiums during sports games.\n\nSwarms of drones have been spotted in the skies of New Jersey for weeks, sparking officials to call for a 'limited state of emergency'\n\nAbout Kim Komando National Radio Hall of Famer, Host on 510+ stations, Podcaster & Tech Expert. Join over 500,000 people who are in the know with her free daily newsletter. Advertisement\n\nThe FAA issued a temporary ban on flights over Trump's golf course and Picatinny Arsenal Military Base after requests from federal partners.\n\nNoory said the fact that there's been no official statement on what's going on could mean the government doesn't want to worry U.S. citizens.\n\n'Maybe there's something that's a little more nefarious, a little more dangerous and they don't want to alert and panic the public,' he continued.\n\n'I'm hoping to God that our government is investigating this very thoroughly. I have to assume they are \u2014 they're just not letting us all know what's going on.'\n\n'The other thing you've got to be concerned about is, drones carry missiles in some cases. Hope to God that these aren't warfare.'\n\nOne of the strangest parts of this story is the size of the reported drones, Noory said.\n\n'They obviously are not from hobbyists. There's not a bunch of kids flying these little toys around,' he added.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is one of several politicians who have called for shooting down the drones if necessary.\n\nIs that even possible? Would we have time to disable them? 'Oh, yeah, we've got the technology to take these out,' Noory says. 'There's no question.'\n\nSo, why is the government permitting them to stick around at this point? Will we get answers, or is this destined to remain another unexplained phenomenon?\n\n'I think we may be watching them right now,' Noory says. 'But eventually, we're going to take action and probably start shooting these things down.'\n\nMeanwhile, a Facebook group with 32.8K members and growing is buzzing with theories and concerns. One poster, Madison Leigh, said she'd heard reports the drones were leaving chemtrails.\n\nFor most folks, it's fear of the unknown that has them commenting and sharing stories on Facebook.\n\nJenna Diehl of Pohatcong, New Jersey posted that she saw hundreds of drones over her house in one night. 'These are not manmade drones. These are huge.'\n\n'We are being watched and we are being invaded,' she wrote.\n\nHow to report a UFO\n\nThe more info, the better. If you're making a report be prepared with:\n\n\u25cf The date, time, location, duration and a detailed description of the sighting.\n\n\u25cf Photos or videos if you have them.\n\n\u25cf Names and contact information of anyone else with you at the time who observed the event.\n\nThe National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is a civilian organization that's been collecting UFO data for decades. NUFORC shares info with various agencies. Submit a report here.\n\nThe Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has a reporting tool available for U.S. government employees, service members or contractors with direct knowledge of U.S. government programs or activities related to UAP. Submit a report here.\n\nIf you're worried there's an immediate threat, call your local law enforcement."

This is why it\u2019s been hard to get facts from any US Agency,\u201d DeLonge wrote on social media Saturday. \u201cSome of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal, stat and federal authorities have thus far been mystified about the nature of the drones, with the White House saying Thursday that the objects do not appear to be of foreign origin, but their investigation.\n\nOver the past week alone, the drones \u2014 which are reportedly bigger than most recreational drones, according to some witnesses \u2014 have been seen by hundreds of Garden State denizens, with Governor Phil Murphy admitting that there were nearly 50 sightings alone last Sunday, NPR reports.\n\nThe situation reminded DeLonge, an expert on the subject of UFOs and UAPs, to similar mass sightings that happened in the 1960s \u2014 \u201cThere is a good chance that these things could potentially be \u2018mimicking\u2019 other aircraft,\u201d the guitarist said \u2014 and shared documents from 1965 about a military base that \u201cexperienced a considerable number of reports pertaining to unidentified flying objects.\u201d\n\nThen and now, the UFOs/drones flew in formation, had \u201cred and green flashing lights,\u201d and made \u201cno sound.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all something to consider, and although we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time,\u201d DeLonge speculated.\n\n\u201cWhy?

            "article_content": "The likes of Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo have been the best photo editors for a long time now. There have, however, been rumblings of change. A number of creators I know have moved away from Adobe products in favor of more affordable solutions, while others have begun embracing editing tools that are built around AI technology.\n\nYou may have heard of Topaz Labs Photo AI and Photoroom. They are relatively new kids on the block but with their focus on generative tools and mobile functionality, they\u2019re seeing a huge rise in popularity. I know that Adobe is doing everything it can to reposition itself within the market but it better move fast to keep up with these upstarts.\n\nAnother option is Picsart , which I\u2019ve been using recently. This mobile and web app accelerates creative projects and processes so you can edit photos and videos as well as generate new ones. It\u2019s quick, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive compared to an Adobe subscription.\n\nHomescreen heroes This is part of a regular series of articles exploring the apps that we couldn't live without. Read them all here.\n\nI began my Picsart journey by putting all the photo editing tools through their paces. What better place to start than the background removal tool? I, and countless creatives, have had decades of painstakingly cutting objects out using manual selection tools. It looks like those years of hard labor might now be over.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nI loaded in a picture of a child with wispy hair. I did, after all, want to give Picsart a proper test. The child was also holding a couple of objects, which some background removal tools might find tricky to differentiate. After pressing the button and waiting a couple of seconds, I was amazed that Picsart had done a near-perfect job, even around the hair. Unbelievable.\n\nThrough an easy-to-use interface, I was then able to insert a plain colored background or a picture from their presets library. All fairly straightforward but then I opened up the AI background tool and this is where things jumped to an eerily scary level. Picsart inserted the child into a range of different scenes, all perfectly. One option even included her standing on a chair. Anyone would struggle to know she wasn\u2019t originally photographed in that location.\n\nSuitably impressed, I then headed into the AI enhancement tools. This is where images can be sharpened and defects removed. I gave Picsart a pretty decent image already and yet it still provided a higher level of clarity and even smoothed out blemishes on the person's skin. I particularly liked the ability to adjust the intensity of the enhancement.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Considering these often require dedicated hardware, I was intrigued to see what my iPhone XR would be able to cope with. Again, I was blown away. I gave it the prompt \u201cCute animal like Father Christmas,\u2019 and it absolutely nailed it! I can definitely see myself using this feature on a regular basis to generate bespoke imagery, although maybe not Father Christmas-themed.\n\nThese tools only scratch the surface of what is possible with Picsart and it really has to be seen to be believed. There is also an AI logo maker, an avatar creator, and a whole host of impressive video tools.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nPicsart has opened my eyes to how far AI tools have come. The fact that most tools can be utilized on a mobile is truly exceptional and helps open up new creative possibilities to creatives who don\u2019t want to be tied down to a laptop. In reality, it has challenged my own creative processes while having a lot of fun along the way.\n\nPicsart Pro is available to try for 7 days with the ability to cancel at any time. To continue using the app, you\u2019ll need the free, plus, or pro licenses. As you\u2019d expect, the free version has a serious limit on the use of generative AI tools and very little cloud storage. It does, however, have a decent set of photo and video editing tools.\n\nThe Plus license includes more generous use of AI tools, a full range of templates and fonts, and 5GB of cloud storage. The Pro version builds on this by offering branding, productivity, and team tools. Plus costs $5 / \u00a35 per month, while Pro costs $7 / \u00a37 per month. Picsart is also available as a web app."

            "article_content": "No chipmaker has benefited more from the rapid rise in artificial intelligence (AI) spending than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential for any company looking to develop and train large language models and build generative AI applications.\n\nNvidia flew past the $1 trillion milestone in May 2023. It's more than tripled since that point, becoming one of just three companies with a market capitalization above $3 trillion. But Nvidia isn't the only company that's seen its market capitalization soar as AI spending booms. In fact, AI advancements are virtually inseparable from the success of nearly every company valued at over a trillion dollars. The newest member, which both complements and competes with Nvidia, is no different.\n\nThe newest artificial intelligence chip stock in the $1 trillion club is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The stock passed the milestone after a stellar fourth-quarter earnings report on Dec. 12. Here's how the company became a leading AI chipmaker worth 13 figures.\n\nA graphic of a computer chip in a circuit with the letters AI standing on it.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company making the next generation of AI chips\n\nBroadcom is a well-diversified business. It has an enterprise software segment, led by VMWare and Symantec. It also makes semiconductors for applications, including wireless phones, WiFi, and Bluetooth. But what's really driving the business are two specialized semiconductor applications: Its networking chips, and its AI accelerators.\n\nBroadcom's networking chips are essential infrastructure for AI data centers. While hyperscalers are paying billions for Nvidia's GPUs, they need Broadcom's chips to get the most out of their processing power. Broadcom's Tomahawk and Jericho switches ensure that data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another. That means there's less redundancy and downtime in processing. And when you're trying to make the most out of billions of dollars' worth of chips, every second counts.\n\nThere's no company that's even close to Broadcom's technology when it comes to developing these chips. Moreover, there's nobody in charge of a hyperscale data center who's going to risk their job by switching to a competitor's offering, no matter how much money it could save the business. So, as data centers grow the number of expensive GPUs and other chips in their server racks, Broadcom's business has grown exponentially.\n\nEven more promising is its custom AI accelerator business. These are the next generation of AI chips.\n\nBroadcom works with several companies to develop purpose-built AI chips for their data centers. Its three biggest customers are Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. Management estimates that these three companies will present an addressable market of between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027. Considering all three companies' potential gains from advancements in AI, the high end of that number seems more likely than the low end.\n\nManagement also announced that it signed deals with two new customers building their own next-generation chips. Broadcom won't disclose the details, but many believe those customers to be Apple and OpenAI.\n\nApple is familiar with Broadcom's work. It used Google's TPUs to train Apple Intelligence. Apple's big push to incorporate AI into its devices at a system level could lead it to become Broadcom's biggest customer in short order. That leaves tremendous upside in management's addressable market outlook, which doesn't include the new customers.\n\nIndeed, with its networking chips and AI accelerators, Broadcom looks well-positioned to benefit from the maturing development of artificial intelligence. Going forward, management plans to split its semiconductor reporting into AI and non-AI segments. The growth of the former will drive results for the entire business for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's not too late to buy\n\nDespite shares soaring more than 24% after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings, the outlook for the business remains strong enough to justify its current price.\n\nManagement's $60 billion to $90 billion addressable market outlook represents a compound annual growth rate for the AI semiconductor segment of greater than 60%. And with the upside of two potential new customers, the growth could be significantly higher by 2027.\n\nWhile AI semiconductors remain a small part of Broadcom's business today, they're the driving force behind its future. Even after tripling AI sales in 2024, management still expects AI chips to account for roughly one-quarter of the company's total revenue in the first quarter of 2025. But as AI chips become a bigger part of Broadcom's business and continue to grow at a rapid pace, the company's earnings growth should remain strong for a very long time. Analysts currently expect 28% earnings growth next year and 20% growth in 2026.\n\nAs a result, investors should be willing to pay a premium valuation today for a stock that's already growing earnings at a strong pace. Shares trade for about 36 times forward earnings as of this writing. That's definitely a premium price, and investors should consider the risks of investing at this price. Specifically, AI spending may not continue at the rampant pace it's seen in the last two years. But the stock traded at a similar valuation earlier in 2024, and management just showed why it was worth the price then. Investors looking for an alternative to Nvidia may want to consider Broadcom for their portfolios.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is making life easier not just for us but also for cybercriminals.\n\nIt is enabling them to create elaborate campaigns to deceive people, efforts that would otherwise take months. Security researchers have discovered a new info stealer malware that masquerades as video-calling software. Hackers have built a whole website and set up companies using AI to make the malware appear harmless.\n\nThey have even created social media accounts to add an extra layer of legitimacy. People are tricked into installing malicious video-calling software, and once they do, it steals their personal data and cryptocurrency.\n\nGET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2013 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE\n\nWhat you need to know about the malware\n\nCado Security Labs has uncovered a new, sophisticated scam targeting people. The scam involves a crypto stealer called Realst, which has versions for both macOS and Windows and has been active for about four months.\n\nThe hackers behind this malware have gone all out, setting up fake company websites complete with AI-generated blogs, product content and social media accounts on platforms like Twitter and Medium. The company they're pretending to be is called \"Meetio,\" though they've used different names in the past few months, including Clusee, Cuesee, Meeten and Meetone.\n\nThe scam works in a few different ways. Often, users are contacted on Telegram by someone pretending to be a friend or acquaintance. The scammers pitch a business opportunity and ask to schedule a call. In one case, the scammer even sent an investment presentation from the target's own company, making the scam feel more real and personal. Other victims report being on Web3-related calls, downloading the software and having their cryptocurrency stolen.\n\nOnce the scammer makes contact, the target is usually directed to the Meeten website to download the malicious software. But even before the malware is installed, the website has JavaScript that can steal cryptocurrency stored in web browsers. It\u2019s a multi-step scam that\u2019s designed to trick you.\n\n4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH\n\nHow the malware works\n\nOnce victims are sent to the \"Meeten\" website, they\u2019re given the option to download the software. The file they download contains a program called \"fastquery,\" though other versions of the malware come as a different file type (DMG) with a multi-architecture setup.\n\nWhen the victim opens the program, two error messages pop up. The first one says, \"Cannot connect to the server. Please reinstall or use a VPN,\" and has a \"continue\" button. The malware also uses a macOS tool to ask the user for a password, a common trick in macOS malware.\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n\nThe malware then looks through various files on the victim's computer to find sensitive information, such as passwords and account details. It creates a folder to store this stolen data, then compresses it into a zip file. This zip file, along with some system data, is sent to a remote server. The server receives information like the system's build version, along with the stolen data.\n\nOnce the data is sent, the malware deletes any temporary files it created. The stealer is capable of grabbing sensitive information like Telegram credentials, banking card details and data from web browsers (like Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Arc, CocCoc and Vivaldi). It can steal things like saved passwords, cookies and browsing history.\n\nMASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC\n\n6 ways you can stay safe from sneaky macOS malware\n\n1. Verify sources before downloading software: Always ensure that you are downloading software from legitimate, trusted sources. Be cautious of downloading anything from links sent via unsolicited messages or emails, especially if they involve urgent requests or business opportunities.\n\nThe best way to safeguard yourself against malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my top picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices .\n\n2. Be cautious of unexpected contact: If you receive messages from unfamiliar contacts on platforms like Telegram or social media, especially those asking you to schedule calls or discuss business opportunities, verify the identity of the sender before taking any action. Cybercriminals often pose as friends or colleagues to gain trust.\n\n3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on your accounts, particularly for sensitive services like cryptocurrency wallets, banking and messaging apps. This adds an extra layer of protection in case your credentials are compromised.\n\n4. Use strong and unique passwords: To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords for different sites or services. A password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIt also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2024 here.\n\n5. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my guide on keeping all your devices updated .\n\n6. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach and cuts down on the chances that potential attackers will find you or contact you in the first place. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\n\nKurt\u2019s key takeaway\n\nAI is enabling scammers to launch malicious campaigns at a scale we've never seen before, and it's likely to get worse as AI models continue to improve. This makes it crucial to have tools that can detect AI-generated content, helping people better protect themselves against these scams. In the meantime, rely on your common sense, watch out for red flags and only install software from reputable platforms. For video calls, stick to well-known and trusted platforms like Zoom, FaceTime, Google Meet and Webex. If someone sends you a random video call link, politely ask them to schedule the call using one of these trusted platforms instead.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShould companies be doing more to help users detect and protect themselves from AI-powered scams?

Fossils of their faces and jaws revealed a mosaic of traits, some reminiscent of Neanderthals, combined with others unseen in Denisovans, Homo erectus, and even modern humans. These distinctions led Wu and Bae to propose the Juluren as a distinct form of ancient humans who coexisted with various hominins in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"What really sets the Juluren apart is their brain size, which surpasses that of other known hominins of the era, including early Homo sapiens,\" said Wu.\n\nThis characteristic, along with their diverse physical traits, underscores the complexity of human evolution, particularly in eastern Asia.\n\nFor decades, fossils from this region that didn't fit neatly into categories like Homo erectus or Homo sapiens were often grouped under the broad label of \"Denisovans.\" However, Wu and Bae\u2019s research now suggest that these human fossils represent a far more diverse evolutionary history of ancient human forms than previously assumed.\n\nExperts in the field have responded with intrigue. emphasizing how much still remains to be uncovered about the human story in Asia. He agreed that the name Juluren may help researchers better contextualize the fossils, offering a clearer picture of their place within the human family tree.\n\nThis discovery added to the growing complexity of our evolutionary history. Discoveries in recent decades have turned the human family tree into a tangled web of interrelated branches going in every direction."

            "article_content": "The field of materials science is no stranger to unexpected breakthroughs. A recent example comes from the University of Hong Kong, where Professor Mingxin Huang and his team have developed a groundbreaking stainless steel for hydrogen production. This innovation, dubbed SS-H2, exhibits remarkable corrosion resistance and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional materials like titanium.\n\nThe discovery of SS-H2 is particularly intriguing due to its sequential dual-passivation mechanism. This unique property allows the steel to resist corrosion in chloride media up to an ultra-high potential of 1700 mV, surpassing the limitations of conventional stainless steel. Dr. Kaiping Yu, the first author of the study, remarked, \u201cMn-based passivation is a counter-intuitive discovery that cannot be explained by current knowledge in corrosion science.\u201d\n\nThis breakthrough could revolutionize hydrogen production from renewable sources, potentially reducing structural material costs by up to 40 times. Such advancements in green hydrogen technology align with efforts to develop AI-powered sailboats for green hydrogen production, further pushing the boundaries of sustainable energy solutions.\n\nUnexplained phenomena in energy research\n\nThe quest for efficient and sustainable energy sources has led to several unexplained discoveries. One such example is the development of a tiny nuclear battery capable of operating for 7,000 years. This groundbreaking energy solution challenges our understanding of long-term power generation and storage.\n\nIn the realm of hydrogen technology, researchers continue to encounter puzzling phenomena. Recent advancements have led to the creation of a new catalyst that enhances efficiency and reduces emissions in hydrogen engines. These innovations often emerge from unexpected sources and defy initial scientific predictions.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of these unexplained phenomena on energy research, consider the following table :\n\nTechnology Conventional Understanding Unexplained Breakthrough Stainless Steel Limited corrosion resistance SS-H2 with ultra-high potential resistance Nuclear Batteries Short lifespan 7,000-year operational capacity Hydrogen Engines High emissions New catalyst for cleaner operation\n\nThe role of serendipity in scientific breakthroughs\n\nMany unexplained phenomena in science arise from serendipitous discoveries. The development of SS-H2 is a prime example of how unexpected results can lead to significant advancements. Initially, the research team was skeptical of their findings, as the prevailing view suggested that manganese impairs the corrosion resistance of stainless steel.\n\nThis serendipitous discovery highlights the importance of :\n\nOpen-mindedness in scientific research\n\nRigorous testing and validation of unexpected results\n\nChallenging established scientific paradigms\n\nCollaboration between different scientific disciplines\n\nThe journey from initial discovery to potential industrial application of SS-H2 took nearly six years, emphasizing the patience and persistence required in unraveling unexplained phenomena. Professor Huang noted, \u201cOur strategy overcame the fundamental limitation of conventional stainless steel and established a paradigm for alloy development applicable at high potentials.\u201d\n\nFuture implications of unexplained scientific phenomena\n\nAs scientists continue to grapple with unexplained events and discoveries, the potential for groundbreaking applications grows. The development of SS-H2, for instance, could dramatically reduce the cost of structural components in water electrolyzers, making green hydrogen production more economically viable.\n\nThese unexplained phenomena often lead to :\n\nNew research directions and funding opportunities Interdisciplinary collaborations to solve complex problems Technological innovations with far-reaching impacts Paradigm shifts in scientific understanding\n\nAs we move forward, it\u2019s crucial to remain open to the unexpected and unexplained in scientific research. By embracing these mysteries, we pave the way for transformative discoveries that can shape the future of technology, energy, and our understanding of the natural world."

            "article_content": "Two breakthroughs in material science, both related to manipulating the arrangement of atoms in a material, were reported recently.\n\nThe first is the discovery of a new way of changing the phase of a material, from crystalline to amorphous, using an electrical pulse, which has the potential to revolutionise data storage in gadgets, mainly computer RAM. This new method consumes \u201ca billion times less electricity\u201d than the traditional melt-quench process, according to a paper published in Nature by researchers of IISc-Bengaluru, University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nElectronic storage devices use a type of glass called chalcogenide, which can change its phase from crystalline to amorphous (and back, when needed). In a solid, the atoms are in an ordered state. In an amorphous phase, the atoms are disordered, as in a liquid, but frozen into solid state \u2014 sort of a \u2018liquid in solid form\u2019. These two phases of a material are used to attribute the values \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for storing data. The phase change from crystalline to amorphous is achieved by highly localised application of laser pulses, which consumes a lot of electricity. The crystals must be heated beyond 800 degrees C and then rapidly cooled. If there is a way to convert crystal directly to glass without the intermediate liquid phase, then the power required for memory storage can be greatly reduced.\n\nA group of 12 researchers have demonstrated amorphisation of indium selenide using pulsed electric current. The localised electric pulse causes the weakly bonded layers of the material to slide over each other, like tectonic plates \u2014 and, like the plates, they too generate a shock wave, explains one of the researchers, Dr Pavan Nukala of the Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering, IISc, Bengaluru. The wave propagates through the material and causes amorphisation.\n\nThis new process has immediate application in microelectronics, but is really a breakthrough in material science as it shows a new way of thinking about amorphisation, he tells Quantum.\n\nDesired misfit\n\nThe second discovery \u2014 by a team led by Prof Kanishka Biswas, New Chemistry Unit, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru \u2014 has led to the synthesis of a new material with high potential for conversion of waste heat into electricity. The group researched into ferecrystals, a class of \u2018misfit layered compounds\u2019 (MLC) \u2014 so called because their atomic layers are misaligned, like an uneven stack of cards.\n\nMLCs have an interesting property \u2014 they do not allow the smooth conduction of heat and thereby block heat transfers. This ultra-low thermal conductivity creates a heat gradient across the material. According to the \u2018Seebeck effect\u2019, discovered in 1821, wherever there is a heat gradient, the material can also generate electricity.\n\nThe ferecrystal material shows a \u2018thermoelectric figure of merit\u2019 of 2.3, a high number that means the material can convert a lot of heat into electricity.\n\n\u201cThe material is already generating electricity in the lab. However, it needs to be scaled up for practical use,\u201d Biswas says.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "Suchir Balaji, the 26-year-old OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower, was found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, US last month. His death on November 26 was determined suicide by the San Francisco medical examiner's office as police found no evidence of wrong doing.\n\nBalaji, who left OpenAI in August, has spoken out against the artificial intelligence company's practice of training the chatbot on copyrighted material scraped from the internet very openly in recent months. The artificial intelligence (AI) giant has been fighting several lawsuits relating to its data-gathering practices.\n\nAbout Suchir Balaji\n\nIndian American Suchir Balaji grew up in Cupertino, California. A remarkably sharp kid, he excelled in programming contests, placing 31st in the ACM ICPC 2018 World Finals and winning first place in the 2017 Pacific Northwest Regional and Berkeley Programming Contests.\n\nBalaji also secured 7th place in Kaggle's TSA-sponsored \"Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge,\" earning a $100,000 prize. Per his LinkedIn profile, he was the US Open 2016 National Champion and a USACO Finalist.\n\nLike most others in his field, Balaji had been captivated by the promise of artificial intelligence since an early age. In an interview given to the New York Times in October, he mentioned his interest in AI started after he stumbled across a news story about the technology in his teens and imagined that neural networks could solve humanity's greatest problems.\n\n\"I thought that AI was a thing that could be used to solve unsolvable problems, like curing diseases and stopping ageing...I thought we could invent some kind of scientist that could help solve them,\" he said, according to the NYT report.\n\nEven before graduating, he worked at Scale AI, Helia, and was a Software Engineer at Quora. In 2020, Balaji joined a stream of Berkeley grads who went to work for OpenAI.\n\nSuchir Balaji's Time At OpenAI\n\nHe worked at OpenAI for four years, during which for one and half years, he helped gather and organize the enormous amounts of internet data the company used to build its online chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nBalaji told NYT that during his initial data at OpenAI, he did not carefully consider whether the company had a legal right to build its products using both copyrighted and open internet data. It was only after the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 that he started to contemplate the issue and realised that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet by using copyrighted data, violating the law in the process.\n\nBy 2024, Balaji said realised \"he no longer wanted to contribute to technologies that he believed would bring society more harm than benefit.\" He left the company in August this year without any new job and started working on what he called \"personal projects.\"\n\nHe died a day after he was named in a court filing as someone whose files OpenAI would search as part of a lawsuit brought by those who sued the AI giant.\n\nSuchir Balaji's Allegation Against OpenAI\n\nAfter leaving OpenAI, Suchir Balaji spoke out publicly against the way AI companies are using copyrighted data to create their technologies. He alleged that the AI models were too dependent on the labour of others as they are trained on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without authorisation.\n\n\"This is not a sustainable model for the internet ecosystem as a whole,\" he told the NYT.\n\nHe also explained his concerns on his personal website, where he noted that while generative models rarely produce outputs identical to their training data, the act of replicating copyrighted material during training could violate laws if not protected under \"fair use.\"\n\n\"Because fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, no broad statement can be made about when generative AI qualifies for fair use,\" he noted.\n\nBalaji argued in several cases the chatbots directly compete with the copyrighted works they learned from. \"Generative models are designed to imitate online data, so they can substitute for \"basically anything\" on the internet, from news stories to online forums,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, the biggest problem is that with AI technologies gradually replacing existing internet services, they sometimes produce \"false and sometimes completely made-up information - what researchers call \"hallucinations.\"\"\n\nThe internet, he said, is changing for the worse.\n\nAllegations Against AI Companies\n\nBalaji was not alone in his concerns about AI companies misusing copyrighter data to train their chatbots. Several US and Canadian news publishers, including the New York Times, have filed lawsuits against OpenAI and its primary partner, Microsoft, claiming they used millions of their articles to build chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.\n\nMany best-selling writers, including John Grisham, also have filed lawsuits against the company.\n\nOpenAI Disputes Claims\n\nOpenAI has disputed Balaji's claims, insisting that their data use adhered to fair use principles and legal precedents.\n\n\"We build our AI models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by longstanding and widely accepted legal precedents. We view this principle as fair to creators, necessary for innovators, and critical for US competitiveness,\" OpenAI said in a statement.\n\nThe company told BBC in November that its software is \"grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation\".\n\nReacting to BAlaji's death, a spokesperson for OpenAI said, \"We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time.\""

Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto's best minds are heading east, and it's gaining at a pace that other regions are finding hard to catch up to.\n\nAsia was responsible for 32% of global crypto developer activity in 2024, according to a report from venture firm Electric Capital. The firm recently published its comprehensive annual report, analyzing over 900 million code commits across the crypto industry.\n\nThe transformation represents a nearly threefold increase from Asia's 12% share in 2015, while North America's position declined from 43% to 24% during the same period.\n\nWe are delighted to release the 6th annual @ElectricCapital Developer Report! We analyzed a record 902M code commits across 1.7M repos thanks to the 829 people who contributed to making this report since inception. How did 2024 in crypto look in data? Long thread below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd pic.twitter.com/vHzjWnThct \u2014 maria \ud83d\udc38 (@MariaShen) December 12, 2024\n\nNotably, the report only tracks the geographic location of the code commits and repository data. Information about developers' nationalities, citizenship, or other demographic indicators do not appear to be parameters in the study.\n\nThe study's methodology specifies that certain types of code, such as data lists and asset repositories, were excluded to effectively limit the study to code made by \"active\" developers.\n\nMaria Shen, a General Partner at Electric Capital, said on X (formerly known as Twitter) that the study had to \"undercount\" because \"we look at open-source dev activity only.\"\n\nThe report shows that India stands out as a primary driver of this shift, claiming 11.7% of global crypto developer share. This places the country second only to the United States' 18.7% share.\n\nThe surge in Asian development talent has reshaped traditional industry dynamics as well, with India now leading in new developer recruitment since 2023, outpacing all other regions globally.\n\nMore \"established\" devs than ever\n\nIn terms of active development on a global scale, Electric Capital says that there's been a 7% decline this year, which means that the crypto industry lost more developers than it gained. The study notes, however, that this figure is still on a safe margin based on annual trends.\n\nEstablished developers, or those with more than two years of experience in crypto, have increased 27% year-over-year. These veteran devs now account for over 70% of code commits across major blockchain ecosystems.\n\nThe report analyzed 902 million code commits across 1.7 million repositories, revealing significant changes in development patterns and platform preferences.\n\nEthereum maintains its position as the dominant development platform in most regions. However, Solana has emerged as the preferred choice for new developers. Solana also secured strong second-place positions across major markets including the United States, United Kingdom, China, and Canada.\n\nNew devs are building\n\nDespite a highly volatile year, crypto is steadily attracting software talent, bringing in over 39,000 new developers in 2024. For these new developers, Solana had become the top choice by July this year. Even ecosystems outside of Ethereum and Solana are drawing numbers.\n\nInternet Computer, Aptos, Base, Bitcoin, Sui, NEAR, Polkadot, and Polygon rank as the chains with the most number of new devs after the top two. For each of these chains, at least 1,000 new developers were brought in over the course of the last year.\n\nThis influx of new talent shows particular strength in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, which claimed 41% of new devs. This suggests growing technical sophistication in regions that were previously underrepresented in the space.\n\nThis shift in geographic distribution also signals how the crypto industry in general is maturing, branching out and outgrowing the Western hemisphere's dominance. This means that, at least in terms of developer activity, emerging markets are driving much of the new growth.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Fossils of their faces and jaws revealed a mosaic of traits, some reminiscent of Neanderthals, combined with others unseen in Denisovans, Homo erectus, and even modern humans. These distinctions led Wu and Bae to propose the Juluren as a distinct form of ancient humans who coexisted with various hominins in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"What really sets the Juluren apart is their brain size, which surpasses that of other known hominins of the era, including early Homo sapiens,\" said Wu.\n\nThis characteristic, along with their diverse physical traits, underscores the complexity of human evolution, particularly in eastern Asia.\n\nFor decades, fossils from this region that didn't fit neatly into categories like Homo erectus or Homo sapiens were often grouped under the broad label of \"Denisovans.\" However, Wu and Bae\u2019s research now suggest that these human fossils represent a far more diverse evolutionary history of ancient human forms than previously assumed.\n\nExperts in the field have responded with intrigue. emphasizing how much still remains to be uncovered about the human story in Asia. He agreed that the name Juluren may help researchers better contextualize the fossils, offering a clearer picture of their place within the human family tree.\n\nThis discovery added to the growing complexity of our evolutionary history. Discoveries in recent decades have turned the human family tree into a tangled web of interrelated branches going in every direction."

            "article_content": "The field of materials science is no stranger to unexpected breakthroughs. A recent example comes from the University of Hong Kong, where Professor Mingxin Huang and his team have developed a groundbreaking stainless steel for hydrogen production. This innovation, dubbed SS-H2, exhibits remarkable corrosion resistance and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional materials like titanium.\n\nThe discovery of SS-H2 is particularly intriguing due to its sequential dual-passivation mechanism. This unique property allows the steel to resist corrosion in chloride media up to an ultra-high potential of 1700 mV, surpassing the limitations of conventional stainless steel. Dr. Kaiping Yu, the first author of the study, remarked, \u201cMn-based passivation is a counter-intuitive discovery that cannot be explained by current knowledge in corrosion science.\u201d\n\nThis breakthrough could revolutionize hydrogen production from renewable sources, potentially reducing structural material costs by up to 40 times. Such advancements in green hydrogen technology align with efforts to develop AI-powered sailboats for green hydrogen production, further pushing the boundaries of sustainable energy solutions.\n\nUnexplained phenomena in energy research\n\nThe quest for efficient and sustainable energy sources has led to several unexplained discoveries. One such example is the development of a tiny nuclear battery capable of operating for 7,000 years. This groundbreaking energy solution challenges our understanding of long-term power generation and storage.\n\nIn the realm of hydrogen technology, researchers continue to encounter puzzling phenomena. Recent advancements have led to the creation of a new catalyst that enhances efficiency and reduces emissions in hydrogen engines. These innovations often emerge from unexpected sources and defy initial scientific predictions.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of these unexplained phenomena on energy research, consider the following table :\n\nTechnology Conventional Understanding Unexplained Breakthrough Stainless Steel Limited corrosion resistance SS-H2 with ultra-high potential resistance Nuclear Batteries Short lifespan 7,000-year operational capacity Hydrogen Engines High emissions New catalyst for cleaner operation\n\nThe role of serendipity in scientific breakthroughs\n\nMany unexplained phenomena in science arise from serendipitous discoveries. The development of SS-H2 is a prime example of how unexpected results can lead to significant advancements. Initially, the research team was skeptical of their findings, as the prevailing view suggested that manganese impairs the corrosion resistance of stainless steel.\n\nThis serendipitous discovery highlights the importance of :\n\nOpen-mindedness in scientific research\n\nRigorous testing and validation of unexpected results\n\nChallenging established scientific paradigms\n\nCollaboration between different scientific disciplines\n\nThe journey from initial discovery to potential industrial application of SS-H2 took nearly six years, emphasizing the patience and persistence required in unraveling unexplained phenomena. Professor Huang noted, \u201cOur strategy overcame the fundamental limitation of conventional stainless steel and established a paradigm for alloy development applicable at high potentials.\u201d\n\nFuture implications of unexplained scientific phenomena\n\nAs scientists continue to grapple with unexplained events and discoveries, the potential for groundbreaking applications grows. The development of SS-H2, for instance, could dramatically reduce the cost of structural components in water electrolyzers, making green hydrogen production more economically viable.\n\nThese unexplained phenomena often lead to :\n\nNew research directions and funding opportunities Interdisciplinary collaborations to solve complex problems Technological innovations with far-reaching impacts Paradigm shifts in scientific understanding\n\nAs we move forward, it\u2019s crucial to remain open to the unexpected and unexplained in scientific research. By embracing these mysteries, we pave the way for transformative discoveries that can shape the future of technology, energy, and our understanding of the natural world."

            "article_content": "Two breakthroughs in material science, both related to manipulating the arrangement of atoms in a material, were reported recently.\n\nThe first is the discovery of a new way of changing the phase of a material, from crystalline to amorphous, using an electrical pulse, which has the potential to revolutionise data storage in gadgets, mainly computer RAM. This new method consumes \u201ca billion times less electricity\u201d than the traditional melt-quench process, according to a paper published in Nature by researchers of IISc-Bengaluru, University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nElectronic storage devices use a type of glass called chalcogenide, which can change its phase from crystalline to amorphous (and back, when needed). In a solid, the atoms are in an ordered state. In an amorphous phase, the atoms are disordered, as in a liquid, but frozen into solid state \u2014 sort of a \u2018liquid in solid form\u2019. These two phases of a material are used to attribute the values \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for storing data. The phase change from crystalline to amorphous is achieved by highly localised application of laser pulses, which consumes a lot of electricity. The crystals must be heated beyond 800 degrees C and then rapidly cooled. If there is a way to convert crystal directly to glass without the intermediate liquid phase, then the power required for memory storage can be greatly reduced.\n\nA group of 12 researchers have demonstrated amorphisation of indium selenide using pulsed electric current. The localised electric pulse causes the weakly bonded layers of the material to slide over each other, like tectonic plates \u2014 and, like the plates, they too generate a shock wave, explains one of the researchers, Dr Pavan Nukala of the Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering, IISc, Bengaluru. The wave propagates through the material and causes amorphisation.\n\nThis new process has immediate application in microelectronics, but is really a breakthrough in material science as it shows a new way of thinking about amorphisation, he tells Quantum.\n\nDesired misfit\n\nThe second discovery \u2014 by a team led by Prof Kanishka Biswas, New Chemistry Unit, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru \u2014 has led to the synthesis of a new material with high potential for conversion of waste heat into electricity. The group researched into ferecrystals, a class of \u2018misfit layered compounds\u2019 (MLC) \u2014 so called because their atomic layers are misaligned, like an uneven stack of cards.\n\nMLCs have an interesting property \u2014 they do not allow the smooth conduction of heat and thereby block heat transfers. This ultra-low thermal conductivity creates a heat gradient across the material. According to the \u2018Seebeck effect\u2019, discovered in 1821, wherever there is a heat gradient, the material can also generate electricity.\n\nThe ferecrystal material shows a \u2018thermoelectric figure of merit\u2019 of 2.3, a high number that means the material can convert a lot of heat into electricity.\n\n\u201cThe material is already generating electricity in the lab. However, it needs to be scaled up for practical use,\u201d Biswas says.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "A new study has demonstrated that a tiny bundle of optical fibers can continuously, accurately, and simultaneously measure six biomarkers of brain health, helping to prevent serious complications that can follow a traumatic brain injury.\n\nOptical fiber technology, a.k.a. fiber optics, uses pulses of light to transmit data along a bundle of thin strands of glass or plastic. It\u2019s a technology that, more often than not, is closely associated with the internet, a means of achieving things like faster download and upload speeds and reduced latency.\n\nA new study led by Imperial College London (ICL) has used the technology to improve healthcare, particularly the diagnosis and treatment of dangerous swelling that can follow a traumatic brain injury.\n\n\u201cContinuous and comprehensive brain monitoring is crucial for timely identification of changes or deterioration in brain function, enabling prompt intervention and personalized treatments,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cHowever, existing brain monitoring systems struggle to offer continuous and accurate monitoring of multiple brain biomarkers simultaneously.\u201d\n\nBrain monitoring after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is critical to patient care. After the initial injury, the brain swells, a delayed response known as a secondary injury. Swelling presses the soft brain tissue against the hard, inflexible skull, causing further damage. Secondary injury is the leading cause of hospital death. Unlike the initial injury, secondary brain injury can be mitigated by closely monitoring parameters such as EEG, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow, and brain oxygen levels. Separate devices are currently used to measure these parameters.\n\nFor the present study, the researchers took advantage of technological advances to create a bundle of optical fiber sensors that simultaneously monitor six biomarkers that are indicative of brain health: temperature, pH, and concentrations of dissolved oxygen, glucose, sodium ions, and calcium ions. The biomarkers are measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the watery liquid that fills and surrounds the brain and spinal cord and provides nutrients, removes waste, and acts as a shock absorber for these delicate organs.\n\nA catheter containing the bundled optical fiber sensing system is inserted into the brain tissue to monitor biomarkers in CSF via selective fluorescent sensing films Zhang, Y et al. CC BY 4.0\n\nThe tips of six optical fibers were fitted with fluorescent sensors, which, by using a multi-wavelength laser, enabled the selective and continuous measurement of each of the biomarkers. A spare optical fiber was included in case it was needed for signal enhancement or a seventh biomarker. The fibers were bundled up into a 2.5-millimeter-thick (0.1-inch) catheter, which was initially inserted into animal brain models of TBI. Machine learning algorithms were used to decipher the incoming biomarker measurements.\n\nAfter demonstrating that the device could continuously and accurately measure the six biomarkers in animal brains, the researchers moved on to validating their findings using clinical human CSF samples. They obtained samples from 11 patients and used the optical fiber sensing system to measure the select biomarkers.\n\n\u201cIn the measurement of clinical human CSF samples, the multiplexed sensing system demonstrated high sensing precision for the continuous measurement of multiple biomarkers simultaneously with high selectivity and stability,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cTherefore, we conclude that the sensing system, coupled with intelligent algorithms, possesses great potential in the multiplexed monitoring of deep brain biomarkers for TBI treatment.\u201d\n\nThe device is not limited to only measuring six biomarkers, though.\n\n\u201cIn the current design, the system is developed for the monitoring of six biomarkers simultaneously with one spare fiber to accommodate a seventh biomarker,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cHowever, it is not the maximum capacity of the system. With careful optimization of the connector and individual fiber dimensions, it has the potential to measure more than 10 biomarkers concurrently. Achieving this would require additional lasers with varying wavelengths to efficiently excite all of the sensors.\u201d\n\nThe sensing device could be used in various clinical scenarios, including brain injury, stroke, and brain tumor resection Depositphotos\n\nAnd the researchers say the sensing device could be used in other situations.\n\n\u201cThe device also holds potential to be utilized with other modalities,\u201d they said. \u201cThe device\u2019s optical fiber-based design offers full compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), making it suitable for use in MR-guided surgeries with long-distance fibers and remote monitoring capabilities. It could also be integrated with drug delivery systems, utilizing hollow fibers to directly measure responses to pharmacological interventions. Further studies are necessary to assess the performance of the sensing system in diverse environments to fully explore its potential in multiplexed sensing and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said that the probe\u2019s small size and its being made from soft, highly biocompatible materials reduce the risk of it damaging brain tissue and prompting an inflammatory response, making it suitable for long-term implantation. However, the biocompatibility of the system needs to be evaluated over extended periods.\n\n\u201cThe system is minimally invasive, multiplexed, sensitive, selective, robust, and fully reversible and suitable for long-term applications,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cIt holds great promise for precise and continuous monitoring of deep brain physiology, aiding in pathological identification and clinical guidance in various clinical cases, including but not limited to brain injury, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and brain tumor resection.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the journal ACS Sensors.\n\nSource: American Chemical Society"

            "article_content": "Thirteen years after the Obama administration, along with its regional allies, began its relentless campaign to topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad using Islamist proxy forces, the al-Qaeda-linked Hayat al-Sham (HTS) has taken Damascus.\n\nSyria now faces a reactionary, imperialist-led carve up as the US, Turkey and Israel each pursue their own interests in the country.\n\nA masked fighter carries a flag of the Al-Qaeda linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in the courtyard of the Umayyad Mosque in the old walled city of Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla)\n\nWashington and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have carried out hundreds of aerial strikes to destroy the military bases and weaponry of Syria and its allies, including those of Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia. Turkey-backed Syrian opposition groups seized Manbij and other towns in northern Syria from US-backed Syrian Kurdish Forces (SDF), while the SDF took control of Deir al-Zur and its oil installations on the western bank of the Euphrates. Israel took over the security zone on Syria\u2019s Golan Heights and adjacent territory in breach of international law. Washington has emphasised the US\u2019s commitment to defeating ISIS that has carried out attacks on the SDF in eastern Syria\u2014a signal that it will continue its efforts to gain control over the war-torn country.\n\nThe prospect of renewed fighting and the dismemberment of the country comes atop the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.\n\nWashington utilised the Syrian regime\u2019s lethal suppression of anti-government protests over declining social and economic conditions, even as the rich grew richer, in several cities in March 2011, as in Libya before it, as the pretext for a large-scale operation in pursuit of its geostrategic interests\u2014against a regime it had long opposed.\n\nIn a chorus of moral outrage, the United Nations, the US and the European Union all condemned Syria\u2019s crackdown while issuing only pro-forma criticisms of far worse repression in allied states Bahrain and Yemen, amid the broader upsurge of the working class in the region that became known as the Arab Spring.\n\nThe CIA and Washington\u2019s regional allies\u2014the Gulf petro-monarchs, Turkey and Israel\u2014financed, sponsored, trained and aided a succession of Islamist militias as their proxies to carry out the task of unseating Assad. These Sunni sectarian forces, some of whom like al-Nusra Front were linked to al-Qaeda, were ludicrously hailed as \u201crevolutionaries.\u201d\n\nA plethora of pseudo-left groups rushed to promote these forces as \u201crevolutionaries.\u201d They made no attempt to explain who these \u201crevolutionaries\u201d were\u2014in many cases discredited former regime figures. They ignored the class forces involved. They did not bother to describe their political programme, or to explain why feudal Gulf despots who outlaw all opposition to their rule at home would support a progressive revolution abroad\u2014let alone with the support of the imperialist powers. The vast scale of the funding for these reactionary forces, through CIA programs that later became public such as Operation Timber Sycamore, emerged years later. These pseudo-left groups are now embracing the Assad regime\u2019s downfall at the hands of these Islamist reactionaries in alliance with the financiers and perpetrators of the genocide in Gaza.\n\nThey backed a war in which nearly 500,000 people lost their lives, nearly half of all the conflict-related deaths worldwide over the same period. While the scale of the conflict abated after Russia and Iran\u2019s intervention on the side of the Syrian regime, intense fighting has continued in the northern and eastern parts of the country. In the first 10 months of last year, more than 450 civilians were killed in the conflict.\n\nThe war decimated the two main pillars of the economy, oil and agriculture. While small compared to other Middle East countries, oil exports accounted for about a quarter of government revenue in 2010 while food production contributed a similar amount to GDP. The government lost control of most of its oil fields to rebel groups, including ISIS and later the US-backed Kurdish forces. International sanctions in 2011 severely restricted the export of oil, with output down to less than 9,000 barrels per day (from 380,000 bpd in 2010) in regime-controlled areas last year. Syria became heavily reliant on imports from Iran. This is likely to be curtailed now that the US-backed forces have seized control of the Bukamul crossing into Iraq. Electricity has long been in short supply, with power cuts most of the day. It means that families have no working refrigerators and must get up at 2am to use their washing machines.\n\nThe war laid waste to Syria\u2019s cities and infrastructure, its agricultural system and irrigation networks, and left a deadly legacy of unexploded artillery shells, mines, cluster bomblets and other munitions on farmland, roadsides and in buildings. Once a lower middle-income country positioned 68th in the global GDP rankings of 196 countries in 2011, Syria has lost more than half of its GDP since 2010 and fallen to 129th place, on a par with the Palestinian Territories and Chad. It now ranks as a low-income country where families struggle to put food on the table.\n\nAround 5 million of the country\u2019s 21 million population have left the country. A further 7 million, one third of the population, are internally displaced within Syria, many of whom live in overcrowded camps and have lost their civil, land and property documentation. Around 30 percent of households have an absent member due to death or the migration of young men in the 20-40-year age group.\n\nThe migration of some of Syria\u2019s most skilled people has left the country with reduced public services, particularly in water, sanitation and health, putting the health of more and more people at risk. Syria is currently dealing with an active cholera outbreak. Recurrent disease outbreaks, waterborne diseases, vaccine shortages and food shortages are contributing to rising malnutrition rates.\n\nWith much of the country\u2019s productive facilities destroyed in the war, most people now work in the informal sector, on low rates of pay. As the government withdrew the limited subsidies available for fuel and food, families became increasingly reliant on remittances from family members working abroad. At the same time, as wages have fallen, the wealth and income of the rich has grown.\n\nWhile extreme poverty was virtually non-existent in 2010, by 2022 it affected more than 25 percent of Syrians, 5.7 million people. Based on the international poverty line, about 16.7 million people\u201470 percent of the population\u2014are in poverty. More than 50 percent of the extremely poor live in the Aleppo, Hama and Deir el-Zur governorates and the north eastern governorates have the highest levels of poverty.\n\nHousing in Damascus in 2010\n\nThe primary responsibility for the terrible conditions across Syria rests with US imperialism and its European counterparts that have sought to starve Syria into submission.\n\nWhile Assad, aided by Iran and Russia and its regional allies, regained control of much of the country, economic and social conditions failed to improve as the first Trump administration sought to bankrupt Syria\u2014imposing bilateral and secondary sanctions in 2020 targeting its banking sector and choking its export industries and businesses.\n\nThe US, via its control over multilateral financial institutions, also engineered the collapse in 2019 of Lebanon\u2019s economy with which Syria is inextricably linked, to tighten the noose around Damascus. Together, these measures drastically increased the demand for dollars, led to a massive rise in the cost of living and prevented any aid to help with Syria\u2019s reconstruction. The COVID pandemic and the rising cost of wheat due to the US/NATO-led war against Russia in Ukraine further increased poverty in the country.\n\nThe devastating February earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria intensified Syria\u2019s socio-economic crisis, killing more than 6,000, destroying some 10,000 buildings and leaving about 265,000 people homeless. The earthquakes caused more than $5 billion in direct physical damage in Syria and a 5.5 percent contraction in its GDP, already down from $67 billion in 2011 to $12 billion in 2022, according to the World Bank. They deprived many families of their main breadwinner, making millions of people dependent upon humanitarian aid.\n\nPeople remove their furniture and household appliances out of a collapsed building following a devastating earthquake in the town of Jinderis, Aleppo province, Syria, Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2023. [AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed]\n\nPublic sector wages fell precipitously, forcing workers to take on second jobs and destroying whatever support remained for the Assad regime. Last year saw strikes and demonstrations break out in Suwayda, Dara\u2019a and Idlib over deteriorating conditions.\n\nWhile the Arab League readmitted Assad after suspending him at the start of the proxy war and the Gulf states re-established relations with Damascus, this did not result in either investment or significant aid, undermining the Assad regime\u2019s last chance of surviving.\n\nThe economy is now in freefall. Between February and November 2023, the Syrian pound lost half its value against the US dollar, pushing up inflation by a massive 88 percent, double the previous year\u2019s inflation rate, according to the World Food Programme, due to reduced access to goods, disrupted supply chains and higher distribution costs. The Syrian Center for Policy Research said more than half of Syrians were living in abject poverty, unable to secure basic food needs.\n\nThe UN asked for $4.07 billion to fund its response inside Syria this year and has thus far received only 31.6 percent of it.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s report published last spring expected Syria\u2019s protracted economic contraction to persist in 2024, with a further 1.5 percent decline, assuming the conflict was largely contained, with government subsidies for food and fuel declining. This truly desperate situation is set to get worse as the rival groups and their backers carve up the country."

            "article_content": "The environmental and social impact assessments for the Rogun project are outdated and do not consider the advancements in renewable energy technologies or the increased risks of climate change.\n\nBuilding the Rogun Dam to its maximum height would be an economic and environmental disaster for Tajikistan and the region.\n\nBuilding the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan to its maximum projected height and specifications would be an economic disaster for Central Asia\u2019s poorest nation, and an environmental nightmare for the entire region, according to a newly published expert report. The advent of new technologies for electricity generation means that Tajikistan\u2019s already decades-old mega project would be outdated before it became fully operational.\n\nThe report, compiled by the Kazakhstan-based environmental organization Rivers Without Boundaries, is being distributed shortly before a World Bank Board of Directors meeting, scheduled for December 17, is due to discuss financing options for the Rogun project, the costs of which have spiraled upward in recent years. Current projections put the price tag of completing the dam at its projected height of 335 meters at $6.4 billion.\n\nThe project was first conceived in the 1970s and revived by the Tajik government in 2016. Work has continued on the dam sporadically since then.\n\nExperts assembled by Rivers Without Boundaries compiled data on eight different scenarios for achieving the Rogun project\u2019s intended goal of producing enough electricity to both meet the country\u2019s domestic needs and generate revenue via the export of power. The results contained in the report suggest that a mix of renewable power generation, along with the completion of a significantly smaller Rogun Dam, would be the optimal solution.\n\n\u201cOur preliminary calculations of alternative scenarios for project implementation show the combination of solar generation development with the completion of Rogun HPP with a smaller dam may make it possible to fully cover the winter energy deficit in Tajikistan by 2030-2031,\u201d the report states. The \u201cdiversification of energy sources within the unified energy system of the country will also significantly reduce climate change risks for the energy sector and the economy.\u201d\n\nThe environmental and social impact assessments that officials are relying on for the Rogun project are outdated, relying on over decade-old data, according to the report. Since then, there have been major advances in wind and solar power generation technologies, and the risks posed by global warming in Central Asia have risen. \u201cOne of the recurrent planning mistakes made each time this project has been revived and reviewed is the lack of assessment of alternative solutions to the project's challenges,\u201d the report states.\n\nWhen completed the 335-meter-tall dam would have an annual power-generating capacity of 3,600 megawatts, roughly equivalent to the output of three nuclear plants. But by the time the facility can reach full generating capacity, the cost of its electricity would be uncompetitive compared to renewable sources, the report asserted. The unit cost of building Rogun is up to four times higher than that of a solar power plant (SPP).\n\n\u201cThe cost of Rogun's electricity will be more expensive than that produced by solar photovoltaics (SPP) and wind (WPP) power plants. If Tajikistan intends to become an electricity exporter to its neighbors, it needs to develop SPP and WPP,\u201d the report adds.\n\nA new environmental impact study, along with a comprehensive regional water-usage framework, is needed, before any additional financing for Rogun is allocated, Rivers Without Boundaries argues. Environmentalists say the alteration of the water flows of the Vaksh and Amu Darya rivers caused by Rogun construction and operation to date already has degraded regional ecosystems, and \u201cworsened conditions for irrigation in dry years.\u201d\n\nRogun would also be a potent source of greenhouse gasses at a time when Central Asia is straining to curtail emissions as part of an effort to slow global warming. The draft environmental impact assessment currently in use shows that Rogun will \u201cstill have a large carbon footprint,\u201d the report states. \u201c The completion of the Rogun HPP with the highest dam [335-meter level] will not only fail to result in rapid decarbonization of Central Asian energy systems, but rather, on the contrary, will slow down this process.\u201d\n\nBy Eurasianet.org\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

            "article_content": "A woman made a 'mind blowing' revelation about UK number plates that left her - and countless others - stunned.\n\nWhile most drivers might view registration plates as little more than a jumble of letters and numbers, it turns out they hold a lot more information than meets the eye.\n\nCourtney Wright, a mum and TikTok user posting under the handle @courtneywrightxxx, shared her discovery in a viral clip, admitting that she was shocked to learn what the letters on car's number plates really mean.\n\n\"I've just learnt something new this morning. I actually can't believe it,\" she said in the video. \"Apparently, the first two letters on your number plate - so, like, my old car was MV - mean that car was registered in Manchester.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"They all have different codes, so it goes from MA to M- whatever, and that's all from Manchester.\"\n\nCourtney went on to explain: \"The first two letters actually mean something. You've got where the car was registered, the year it was registered, and then just a random sequence. I'm literally mind blown.\"\n\nHer video has since sparked a flurry of comments, with other people either sharing her amazement or confessing they had no idea about the system themselves.\n\nOne user wrote: \"How did I not know this? Mind blown too,\" while another joked: \"I've been driving for years, and this just made me feel like I missed an entire class on life.\"\n\nWhat do UK number plates actually mean?\n\nIf you've ever wondered about the seemingly random assortment of characters on UK number plates, Jon Kirkbright, the sales director of Private Number Plates, broke it down.\n\nAdvert\n\nCourtney shared her discover with TikTok (TikTok/@courtneywrightxxx)\n\nSpeaking to Diamond Advanced Motorists last year, Jon said: \"To the untrained eye, number plates may look like a random combination of letters and numbers.\n\n\"While many people are aware that the numbers indicate the year the car was made and registered, fewer people realise that the letters better them serve as 'regional identifiers.' These refer to the DVLA office where the car was registered.\"\n\nFor instance, plates beginning with MV, MA, or MB originate from the Manchester and Merseyside region, LA, LB, LV, etc., are assigned to London and BA, BB and BC indicate registration in Birmingham.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"This may be why your number plates start with the same letters if you buy more than one car from the same dealership - it's not just a coincidence,\" Jon added.\n\nWhat are the rules around private plates?\n\nFor those with private plates, the rules are a little stricter. Jon highlighted that while it's legal to make a car seem older using a dateless plate, it's illegal to make it look newer.\n\nEach car's number plate are assigned to where the car was registered (Getty stock image)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"For example, you cannot put an '11' number plate on a car registered in 2007,\" he said. \"It is an offence to misrepresent the registration in any way.\"\n\nThose wanting to hide the age of their car often opt for dateless plates, which allow for complete customisation while avoiding this issue.\n\nIf you're curious about your own car's registration, you can find a full list of regional number plate identifiers online - and join the ranks of those whose minds have been well and truly blown by the hidden meaning behind UK plates."

There's something else very, very nefarious about this.'\n\nThe drones are avoiding capture, he said, adding, 'They shut their lights off, they are undetectable in some cases. It's very, very bizarre. This could be an act of war for all I know.'\n\nBut alien tech? Noory said it doesn't add up.\n\n'I'm going to rule out extraterrestrial. It doesn't sound like that,' he said. 'It sounds more like a military effort than anything else.'\n\n'I'm going to rule out extraterrestrial. It doesn't sound like that,' he said. 'It sounds more like a military effort than anything else.'\n\nPentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the initial assessment is that 'this is not the work of a foreign adversary or a foreign entity.'\n\nThe FBI and Homeland Security are investigating, and politicians have conflicting takes.\n\nWhite House National Security spokesman John Kirby said this week that many of the reported drones are manned aircraft being operated lawfully.\n\n'A congressman out of New Jersey believes that there is an Iranian ship parked off the East Coast of the US and it is sending these drones over certain military bases, Donald Trump's golf course, and strange strategic locations,' Noory said.\n\nThe drones were first spotted in northern New Jersey, near Morris County, in November.\n\nResidents said the drones gather in clusters at night and fly with their lights off. They appear to avoid detection by helicopter and radio.\n\n'There's some helicopters that have been seen in the area, and these things seem to avoid those,' said Noory.\n\nA few spots drones have surveyed: military research facility Picatinny Arsenal, President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster, and around critical infrastructure including water reservoirs, electrical transmission lines, police stations and military bases.\n\n'Drones are legal as long as they're registered with the FAA and are allowed to fly around certain spots,' Noory said. 'But this is weird.'\n\nThere are some notable no-fly zones even for registered drones: around airports, military installations, certain landmarks, nuclear plants and stadiums during sports games.\n\nSwarms of drones have been spotted in the skies of New Jersey for weeks, sparking officials to call for a 'limited state of emergency'\n\nAbout Kim Komando National Radio Hall of Famer, Host on 510+ stations, Podcaster & Tech Expert. Join over 500,000 people who are in the know with her free daily newsletter. Advertisement\n\nThe FAA issued a temporary ban on flights over Trump's golf course and Picatinny Arsenal Military Base after requests from federal partners.\n\nNoory said the fact that there's been no official statement on what's going on could mean the government doesn't want to worry U.S. citizens.\n\n'Maybe there's something that's a little more nefarious, a little more dangerous and they don't want to alert and panic the public,' he continued.\n\n'I'm hoping to God that our government is investigating this very thoroughly. I have to assume they are \u2014 they're just not letting us all know what's going on.'\n\n'The other thing you've got to be concerned about is, drones carry missiles in some cases. Hope to God that these aren't warfare.'\n\nOne of the strangest parts of this story is the size of the reported drones, Noory said.\n\n'They obviously are not from hobbyists. There's not a bunch of kids flying these little toys around,' he added.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is one of several politicians who have called for shooting down the drones if necessary.\n\nIs that even possible? Would we have time to disable them? 'Oh, yeah, we've got the technology to take these out,' Noory says. 'There's no question.'\n\nSo, why is the government permitting them to stick around at this point? Will we get answers, or is this destined to remain another unexplained phenomenon?\n\n'I think we may be watching them right now,' Noory says. 'But eventually, we're going to take action and probably start shooting these things down.'\n\nMeanwhile, a Facebook group with 32.8K members and growing is buzzing with theories and concerns. One poster, Madison Leigh, said she'd heard reports the drones were leaving chemtrails.\n\nFor most folks, it's fear of the unknown that has them commenting and sharing stories on Facebook.\n\nJenna Diehl of Pohatcong, New Jersey posted that she saw hundreds of drones over her house in one night. 'These are not manmade drones. These are huge.'\n\n'We are being watched and we are being invaded,' she wrote.\n\nHow to report a UFO\n\nThe more info, the better. If you're making a report be prepared with:\n\n\u25cf The date, time, location, duration and a detailed description of the sighting.\n\n\u25cf Photos or videos if you have them.\n\n\u25cf Names and contact information of anyone else with you at the time who observed the event.\n\nThe National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is a civilian organization that's been collecting UFO data for decades. NUFORC shares info with various agencies. Submit a report here.\n\nThe Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has a reporting tool available for U.S. government employees, service members or contractors with direct knowledge of U.S. government programs or activities related to UAP. Submit a report here.\n\nIf you're worried there's an immediate threat, call your local law enforcement."

            "article_content": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Scientists have introduced what they believe may be a new ancient human species.\n\nThe Juluren, or \"large head people,\" are believed to have lived in eastern Asia over 100,000 years ago.\n\nsuggesting that the Juluren, formally named Homo juluensis, possessed significantly large brains and unique traits that could dramatically alter our understanding of human evolution.\n\nThe Juluren exhibit has features unlike any other hominins previously identified. Fossils of their faces and jaws revealed a mosaic of traits, some reminiscent of Neanderthals, combined with others unseen in Denisovans, Homo erectus, and even modern humans. These distinctions led Wu and Bae to propose the Juluren as a distinct form of ancient humans who coexisted with various hominins in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"What really sets the Juluren apart is their brain size, which surpasses that of other known hominins of the era, including early Homo sapiens,\" said Wu.\n\nThis characteristic, along with their diverse physical traits, underscores the complexity of human evolution, particularly in eastern Asia.\n\nFor decades, fossils from this region that didn't fit neatly into categories like Homo erectus or Homo sapiens were often grouped under the broad label of \"Denisovans.\" However, Wu and Bae\u2019s research now suggest that these human fossils represent a far more diverse evolutionary history of ancient human forms than previously assumed.\n\nExperts in the field have responded with intrigue. emphasizing how much still remains to be uncovered about the human story in Asia. He agreed that the name Juluren may help researchers better contextualize the fossils, offering a clearer picture of their place within the human family tree.\n\nThis discovery added to the growing complexity of our evolutionary history. Discoveries in recent decades have turned the human family tree into a tangled web of interrelated branches going in every direction."

            "article_content": "Following historian and philosopher Hanna Arendt, there is the belief that the public should assert their needs and interests in scientific endeavors.1 But, before the public can weigh in, someone must fully inform them of the issue involved. Once citizens understand a problem, they can ensure, through their political representatives, that the science aligns with their demands and does not go off on its own. For example, once Americans understood the gravity, they clearly articulated that they would not allow science to create human beings in a laboratory or have computers governing the world.\n\nSource: CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\nIn contrast, modern medicine illustrates what happens when the public lacks information and has little input: educators and researchers go on their own\u2014and continue to do so in the face of abject failure. Here is one example in medicine, US citizens do not know how frightful their mental health care is, that medicine refuses to adopt the teaching that would cure it, or that they can direct their politicians to require that change.\n\nWhat do Americans need to know to activate and direct change?\n\n1. Although mental illness is the most common health condition in the US (nearly 100 million Americans in any one year), most people do not know that only 25 percent of patients receive any care, most of which does not meet standards. Compare this to 70 percent of physical disease patients receiving care of high quality. Mistakenly, some uninformed Americans even assume mental health care matches medical care.\n\n2. Few realize that compromised mental health care results from two easily remediable medical derelictions: a) medicine fails to train enough mental health professionals (psychiatrists and psychologists each conduct only 12 percent of care); and b) it provides almost no training for the primary care clinicians who, by default, conduct over 75 percent of mental health care; their lack of training explains why most mental health care is substandard. Shockingly, educators devote only 2 percent of physicians\u2019 training to mental health care. These facts identify the simple but surprisingly overlooked solution to the mental health crisis: train more mental health professionals and train the medical doctors who provide most of the care.\n\n3. Almost no one understands why medicine would resist such obvious solutions. The \u201cmind-body split\u201d philosophy or theory developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries caused this blind spot. In a political compromise, church and science leaders of the scientific revolution agreed to the split: the mind, soul, and spirit went together and were the church\u2019s province alone. Medicine could only consider the physical body and its diseases from the neck down. That made mental disorders and other mind issues, such as emotions, off base for medicine. Although mental health care became medicine\u2019s responsibility in the 1800s, physicians have never deviated from their isolated focus on the physical body and its diseases. Only a small minority of clinicians ever showed any interest in mental health, and the tiny field of psychiatry formed around them; this was often disdained and dismissed by the majority culture. Sadly, medical education has never exhibited an interest in mental illness training for medical students or producing enough residencies to train psychiatrists. On the other hand, medicine has not failed. The mind-body split led to massive physical healthcare improvements in the last century when life survival doubled from 40 years to 80 years.\n\nSource: CC-BY-2.5\n\nNevertheless, the exclusion of a patient's psychological and social life now renders the mind-body split obsolete. It worked primarily for the acute physical and surgical illnesses that medicine has now cured or controlled for the most part (for example, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough; and ether anesthesia). But modern medicine\u2019s patient population has changed\u2014mental illnesses and chronic physical diseases are the most common conditions practitioners face.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s obvious why eschewing the mind shortchanges mental illnesses, almost no one recognizes it is also harming chronic disease care. Most chronic physical disorders are caused by the very psychological and social factors excluded by medical education\u2014lifestyle issues such as cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, overeating and overweight, drug addiction, and stress. Doctors must incorporate lifestyle issues into treatment to improve the underlying physical disease, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, yet they are not taught how to do this. More incriminating, medicine could prevent some 80 percent of heart disease and diabetes and 40 percent of cancers by addressing lifestyle factors. But it waits for cancer and heart disease to occur and then treats the problem.\n\n4. Although most people think medical education and research are scientifically based, the public will no doubt be aghast to learn that it does not follow modern scientific principles. Among all sciences, only medicine does not adhere to modern scientific theory: a systems view of life\u2014where physicians and other scientists must consider all parts of a problem and their interactions.2 Medicine\u2019s isolated disease focus omits the equally important psychological and social parts of its patients. More disturbing, medicine ignores the systems approach proposed for it in the 1970s, the biopsychosocial model. Demonstrably superior and research-based, the model links the patient\u2019s physical disease (biological) features with their psychological and social parts, thus integrating mental health care with medical care. Actively teaching the model would guarantee that the quality of mental health care matched physical disease care. Yet four centuries of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d by a now effete theoretical concept has left physicians immune to recognizing its profound shortcomings.\n\nExactly how do we initiate change? Inform the public. Typically, after citizens are informed and angry, they direct their politicians to confront refractory institutions. People knew little, for example, about the risks of automobiles and chemical pollutants. Then came Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader3 and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.4 These books made millions of Americans aware that seat belts saved lives and that we had poisonous DDT in our drinking water\u2014but that the auto and chemical industries refused to install seat belts and remove DDT for financial reasons. An irate US population insisted on change. That\u2019s why you have seat belts and clean water today. And a model for change\u2014informing the public."
