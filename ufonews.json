Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d. Lenticular clouds were visible on Thursday and Friday mornings in North-east England.\n\nTrending"

The 44th annual United Food Operation food drive kicked off Friday. It\u2019s a 12 week effort to collect as much non-perishable food as possible to be passed along to the region\u2019s needy.\n\n\u201cWe do our pre-planning and get everything together and as we\u2019re talking to the pantries, they\u2019re running out of food. The need is so great we\u2019ve got to keep this going,\u201d said Elaine Harris, UFO Chairperson.\n\nEach Friday through April, the organization will accept donations of food at their warehouse in Institute to be distributed to a dozen food banks across two counties.\n\n\u201cOur warehouse is right off the Institute exit, there will be a big sign. We can take food and store it there and then distribute to the food banks,\u201d she explained.\n\nThis year the American Postal Workers Union Local 133 has joined the effort. The union members are employed at the U.S. Postal Service Processing Center at Southridge. The facility had originally been slated for closure, but thanks to efforts by the community and West Virginia\u2019s Congressional delegation it was saved and will stay in place. Harris said the organization wanted to get involved in the food drive out of gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their way of giving back to the community because the community was so very involved and supportive of them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur members are very excited to take part in this,\u201d Tim Holstein, Vice President of APWU Local 133, said in a news release. \u201cWe have a table set up in front of the union office at the plant and at the Main Post Office and are asking everyone to bring canned/nonperishable food to donate. One can of food could make a difference in someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe effort accepts any non-perishable goods. They\u2019ll take them at the warehouse each Friday or they can also make arrangements to pick up large donations. Harris said it\u2019s a never ending labor of love.\n\n\u201cThe need is so great. This is working people falling through the cracks. This is how we started this program almost 45 years ago,\u201d she said."

In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly to promote his new film, Better Man, Williams, 50, dished on his favorite gifts that he\u2019s received [\u2026]\n\nFor more fun facts from Williams \u2014 including why Better Man, a musical fantasy film based on his life and career in theaters now, is the movie he would watch for the rest of his life \u2014 keep scrolling:\n\n1. I\u2019ve given all of my awards away for two reasons: I don\u2019t want my success to be constantly reaffirmed every day as something that happened in the past, and I also retain great cynicism when it comes to awards and awards ceremonies. You don\u2019t get to meet the people that nominate you and figure out whether you want them to tell you if you are good or not. Let me also say I\u2019m very grateful to be invited to the party and I\u2019m a very sensitive person that if you don\u2019t tell me I exist, then I don\u2019t exist. So it\u2019s a very interesting conundrum in the industry that I find myself in.\n\n2. My dream collaborator is Dolly Parton.\n\n3. The song I\u2019m most proud of is \u201cAngels\u201d because it gave me my career. It is the song that exists outside of myself that means so much to lots of people. It\u2019s like the national anthem of Robbie. I\u2019ve written nearly a thousand songs now, and I\u2019ve not managed to recreate that.\n\n4. My favorite tattoo that I have is a teddy bear for my eldest daughter, Teddy.\n\n5. I don\u2019t drive \u2014 I never learned \u2014 and I don\u2019t have a license.\n\nRelated: Kyle Richards Comes Clean: \u2018I Don\u2019t Care What People Think of Me Anymore\u2019 Kyle Richards is showing off her 10 tattoos. It\u2019s the first day of October, and she\u2019s just sat down in the spacious living room of her 10,000 square-foot Colonial-style Los Angeles home \u2014 which is decked out for Halloween with pumpkins and autumnal decor \u2014 to talk to Us Weekly about being crowned Reality Star [\u2026]\n\n6. Ryan Reynolds is the most famous person in my phone book.\n\n7. My computer is my most valuable possession.\n\n8. I always get starstruck around comedians \u2014 like Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler and Chris Rock \u2014 and also Brad Pitt. Movie stars [have] a quality that is unusual, beguiling and magical, but at the same time means nothing. It\u2019s so strange. And it\u2019s not their fault.\n\n9. I\u2019m a good raconteur.\n\n10. If I could watch one movie for the rest of my life, it would be Better Man, genuinely. I\u2019m not just saying that for promo.\n\n11. Lynda Carter and Kylie Minogue were my celebrity crushes growing up.\n\n12. My alternate profession would be an artist, and I\u2019ve actually got a [few] exhibitions.\n\n13. The proudest moment of my career is that I\u2019m still here.\n\n14. All I do is listen to and watch podcasts. Right now, I\u2019m back on the UFO and paranormal trail, so that\u2019s where I get all of my entertainment needs, [including] finding out what the drones are in New Jersey.\n\n15. Dean Martin, Bing Crosby and Chuck D were the entertainers I looked up to when I was younger.\n\n16. I love the Housewives franchise. Right now, I\u2019m into The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Kathy Hilton doesn\u2019t get enough airtime.\n\n17. I collect ideas that form in my head, and then I try to draw them and make them funny.\n\n18. The most exciting moment from my time in Take That was being No. 39 on the charts with \u201cPromises.\u201d It was the happiest I\u2019ve been for the shortest amount of time.\n\n19. I sold double glazing \u2014 which are windows in the U.K. \u2014 door-to-door for two weeks before I joined Take That.\n\n20. The childhood memory that makes me smile is the round of applause that I got when I played the Artful Dodger when I was 12 years old. I got a standing ovation, and it made me believe that I had a future in showing off.\n\n21. My bucket list includes building hotels, building entertainment venues and creating a university of entertainment and writing the syllabus.\n\n22. My favorite comfort meal is sweet and sour chicken or pork Chinese [food].\n\n23. I can\u2019t leave the house without my phone, Mac [laptop] and sunglasses.\n\n24. I\u2019m an introvert and don\u2019t do parties unless I\u2019m paid to or I have to promote something.\n\n25. My favorite place to vacation is Mustique.\n\nWith reporting by Leanne Aciz Stanton"

            "article_content": "A staple in Minnesota\u2019s science innovation and education has hit a major milestone. The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis is celebrating 50 years of bringing electricity and scientific education to life.\n\nThe museum has become a hub for scientific research, exhibition and archiving, including a rare book and instrument collection, as well as exhibits about electricity, architecture and more.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just a profound love of learning and exploring and discovery at this organization,\u201d the museum\u2019s vice president of programs Anika Taylor said. \u201cI absolutely adore opportunities to work with visitors who are here exploring something and to see them make a connection or make a discovery, or have a moment of sort of lighting up.\u201d\n\nEarl Bakken, famous for co-founding Medtronic and creating the first external wearable battery-powered pacemaker, founded the museum in 1975 in hopes of becoming a research center focused on \u201cElectricity in Life.\u201d It now also includes exhibits about plants, medicine and even Mary Shelley and her book \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d a special inspiration of Bakken\u2019s.\n\nTurn Up Your Support MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all.\n\nAs a child, Bakken spent his time building and taking apart different electronic devices. When he saw the movie version of \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d he knew he wanted to pursue a career in electrical engineering, which he studied at the University of Minnesota.\n\nTaylor says the Mary Shelley exhibit is truly a favorite.\n\n\u201cI just love it, because there are so many fun stories and ideas that connect to this exhibit, the story of who Mary Shelley was and what led her to write that story, the notion that this is sort of our first example of science fiction, and that science fiction has, in turn, also inspired science and inspires the public to consider the science that we do in different ways because we can explore it in fictional realms.\u201d\n\nThe Bakken Museum. pictured on Sept. 18, 2020, is located on the West shore of Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis. Found by Earl Bakken in 1975, it is features interactive exhibits for all ages and STEM education programs. Courtesy of the Bakken Museum\n\nInterim Vice President of Advancement Stu Silberman says what makes the Bakken special is how it \u201cinvests in the future of the state of Minnesota while leveraging its wonderfully historic past.\u201d A past that started before the museum became a nonprofit and was established at its current location on Bde Maka Ska in 1975. Before that, Bakken had been collecting artifacts and literature at his company\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe Bakken is a popular field trip destination with hands-on opportunities like the shock circle that plays with static electricity that sticks students\u2019 hair on its ends or the Bakkenspiel, an interactive musical workshop. Heather Walch, a board member, loves seeing students light up.\n\n\u201cMy absolute favorite part is the kids that are visiting the Bakken when they learn something new, and they don\u2019t really realize they\u2019re learning anything because it\u2019s fun and it's just filled with giggles,\u201d Walch said.\n\nThrough its STEM education program, the Bakken Museum has begun taking educational programs on the road to sites and schools across the state where educators spend a week with students.\n\nTaylor hopes the museum continues to change its \u201chidden gem\u201d persona.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming to visit our museum or whether it\u2019s bringing us out to whatever corner of the state folks are in, we\u2019d love to get as many people involved in celebrating this 50th year,\u201d she said.\n\nThe museum will be hosting events throughout the year to mark its milestone birthday, including a party in October and family discovery day events throughout the year, as well as their \u201cBakkenalia\u201d 21+ events."

Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet sent a letter to Altman worrying he was attempting to \"cozy up to the incoming Trump administration\" to \"avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.\" The letter noted that Altman donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.\n\nHow do we know about this letter?

As Mashable has noted in previous coverage, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla's Elon Musk, among other tech power players, are all set to attend the inauguration. TikTok's CEO went out of his way to praise the president-elect ahead of the looming ban. Pretty much everyone in the tech world has lurched rightward into Trump's waiting arms.\n\nSo of course Altman would troll Democrats online \u2014 that's exactly what folks on the right love to do."

Even if you're not the type to spend all your time out on the town, it's hard to deny the influence that nightlife has had on pop culture as of late. Of course, there are other historical periods in which partying was a pivotal part of society\u2014there's a whole era called the roaring twenties, after all! However, that impact shifted with the COVID-19 pandemic, which effectively put the party on hold when social-distancing measures were put into place worldwide. Only in the last few years have we begun to see nightlife play a more influential part in culture again\u2014permeating everything from what's charting on the billboards to what's going viral in our social media feeds.\n\nThe latter has been particularly significant, as much of the cultural shift surrounding nightlife stems from viral discourse online. Who could forget the online debates that ensued after a video went viral on TikTok asking, \"What happened to heels in the club\"? For weeks, our feeds were filled with satirical dancing videos of people sporting \"anti-club\" shoes to the lyrics \"stilettos, pumps in the club.\" And then, there were the recent calls for the return of \"recession club music\" as older pop songs from Pitbull, Nelly Furtado, and Timbaland trended on TikTok. Even beyond social media, we've seen nightlife become a central part of the more \"high-brow\" aspects of culture\u2014refer to the critical acclaim surrounding Charli XCX's recent pop album, Brat, or the viral think piece about the need to party more in The Atlantic, or even the infamous rave scene in the recent film Babygirl.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many aspects of culture exploring, reinventing, and dissecting nightlife, it's no surprise that we've seen going-out attire surface in recent runway collections, too. Although we'll admit that it's pretty standard to see some eveningwear in every collection, it was as if designers took Charli XCX's line, \"I'm your favorite reference, baby,\" as a call to action with their fall 2024 and spring 2025 collections. In fact, there were so many going-out trends that we felt compelled to sift through them all to determine which would shift what broader culture considers to be \"club classics\" in 2025. Ahead, we're breaking down the eight party trends that not only were prominent on the runways but also will be spotted at a bar, club, or social feed near you soon. Prepare to put on your preferred dancing shoes!\n\nCredit: Launchmetrics Spotlight; Pictured: Aniye Records S/S 25; Ann Demeulemeester F/W 24; DSquared2 F/W 25; Markgong F/W 24\n\nNothing entirely embodies the cultural renaissance club culture has experienced in the last few years quite like the runway trend we're dubbing \"3-6-5 party girl\"\u2014an overall disheveled aesthetic that gives the appearance that you've rolled directly from your bed to the bar (and back again). Whether you consider it one of the cultural implications of record-breaking inflation or the cultural phenomenon of the Brat album, it's safe to say that the F/W 24 and S/S 25 collections were all about embracing the messiness of going-out culture. It was less about maintaining some perfectly curated image but rather rewinding to the past to create runway looks reminiscent of the mid-2000s indie-sleaze aesthetic, with, of course, some contemporary updates.\n\nA prime example of this would be Markgong's F/W 24 collection, entitled The Heartbreak Club, which featured the type of looks you'd imagine Carrie Bradshaw wearing after crashing out over the fact Big is going to Paris. Models sauntered down the runway looking like they had just left their lover's house after a long night\u2014bottles of alcohol in hand, overflowing luggage in tow, with only a nightgown, sleep mask, and oversize coat on their backs. While Markgong's collection took the whole \"crying in the club\" meaning to another level, other runway shows tapped into the energy without being quite as literal. We saw other designers lean into the idea that their models had gone to the club after a cat nap by styling sleepwear and lingerie as going-out attire. (See: Ann Demeulemeester, DSquared2, and Aniye Records.) Each show was a reminder that being a party girl is a lifestyle, period.\n\nThe Aurora in 1999\n\nThe perfect slip dress to wear to bed (or the bar).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nBra Top Black\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing says Brat quite like just wearing a bra top to your local bar.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nBabaton New Slip Satin Mini Skirt\n\nSlip skirts are an effortless way to ease yourself into this aesthetic.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nIsabelle Set Ivory\n\nJust add a longline leather jacket, combat boots, and a crippling cigarette dependency.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nCredit: Launchmetrics Spotlight; Pictured: 3.1 Phillip Lim S/S 25; Brandon Maxwell S/S 25; The Attico S/S 25; Burberry S/S 25\n\nUnless you've been off the grid, the current cultural obsession with debating whether club culture is \"dying\" hasn't blindsided you. You've likely seen your fair share of tweets or TikToks discussing whether or not you should adhere to a dress code when you go out dancing for the night. No matter your opinion of the matter, designers made it clear with their F/W 24 and S/S 25 collections that the party dress code has been undone. No other going-out trend is more symbolic of that shift than the styling of sportswear and eveningwear together as a way to give eveningwear pieces a casual spin.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe saw that approach across F/W 24 and S/S 25 collections in the form of sequin gowns peeking out underneath oversize parka jackets and funnel-neck trench coats. (See Burberry's and Brandon Maxwell's spring shows.) Similarly, we saw a sheer-black feather gown styled with a yellow puffer jacket at The Attico's S/S 25 runway show. While at 3.1 Phillip Lim's spring show, we saw baggy denim shorts dressed up with black sheer blouses, cargo pants paired with crystal bra tops, and crystal fringe peeking out underneath oversize utility jackets. Each collection proved that while the jury may still be out about changes around club dress codes, their undoing is worth celebrating (at least when discussing these runway collections).\n\nCropped Funnel Neck Trench Coat in Stone\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nJust imagine how chic your sequin dress will look under this trench coat!\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nDia Embellished Tulle Midi Skirt\n\nIt's perfect for layering under an oversize parka jacket.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nShort Faux Fur Trim Cotton Parka in Hunter\n\nYou'll never get cold while bar hopping again.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nSequined Dress With Low-Cut Back\n\nA dress so cute the DJ will be forced to queue \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" when you enter the room.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nCredit: Launchmetrics Spotlight; Pictured: 16Arlington S/S 25; LaQuan Smith S/S 25; Sportmax S/S 25; Knwls S/S 25\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOh, you thought the no-pants fashion trend would be left in the past? Think again. Long before the internet was beefing over what shoes to wear to the club, the girlies disagreed about whether or not the exposed-panty trend should ever come back\u2014blame our collective trauma from the exposed-G-string trend that dominated the early '00s. Alas, no online \"controversy\" could keep this trend from returning a few years ago, especially as celebrities such as Kendall Jenner , Hailey Bieber, and Bella Hadid were spotted wearing their \" panties out .\" With every season since this trend's debut, we've seen it subtly evolve into something that no longer sends the internet into a tailspin. In part, the evolution of sentiments surrounding this formerly \"risqu\u00e9\" trend can be partly attributed to the loss of the shock factor.\n\nBut it's also because we've seen designers shift from creating looks where the exposed panties were the focal point to taking a more \"modest\" approach to the look by experimenting with layering and textiles. Hot pants came in materials that didn't necessarily feel lingerie-adjacent. For example, 16Arlington's S/S 25 collection had briefs made from red leather snakeskin. Sportmax's S/S 25 collection dialed up the contrast of white briefs by styling them with a white fringe T-shirt and matching mesh pumps. If textiles weren't how designers aimed to make the exposed-panties trend more polished, they did so through layering. From Knwls to LaQuan Smith, we could see exposed bodysuits, thongs, and briefs peaking out underneath sheer gowns and catsuits, adding just the right amount of coverage. The looks proved that not only is pulling off the whole \"panties out\" look very possible but it's something worth celebrating.\n\nFever Hot Pants\n\nReal hot-girl pants!\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nGemma Catsuit\n\nIt's so Sabrina Carpenter coded.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nFaux Leather Hot Short\n\nHot, hot, hot.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nHalter Shirred Front Fishtail Gown\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGo ahead.

But who said all party trends had to be overly revealing to surprise us? Occasionally, a few things shake us to our core just because we could never imagine them coming back in style. Such is the case with the dress-over-pants trend. Considering how much this combo used to make us all cringe, it's almost confounding to see how dresses styled over pants have become\u2014dare we say\u2014cool again. Before you think we're seeing double, hear us out: Dresses styled over pants are primed for a night out on the town. Our case rests not merely on the fact that there were so many examples of the trend in F/W 24 and S/S 25 collections but on how designers made this \"dated\" styling hack look sophisticated.\n\nFor example, Louis Vuitton's F/W 24 show made the dress-and-pant combo feel contemporary thanks to the unconventional pairing of a semi-formal sheer sequin frock with black leggings, a matching bralette, furry mittens, and round-toe pumps. Similarly, we saw the same approach in Rotate's and Monse's fall collections. Sheer lace and billowing organza dresses were layered over relaxed black jeans and pleated black trousers. But possibly the chicest example of all could be found at David Koma, where an extra-long satin blouse was layered over black trousers, creating the illusion of a train\u2014proving that this pairing can indeed be posh. Sure, dresses over pants won't make it onto everyone's 2025 bingo card, but the trend proves that the best party clothes are the ones that make us do a double take.\n\nSemi-Transparent Disc Dress\n\nDisco balls will have nothing on you in this dress.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nLong Satin Blouse\n\nThe styling of this long satin blouse?

Yeah, we all might initially love the idea of a night out, but the second we have to change into overly revealing clothing? Well, there's nothing more off-putting, in our humble opinion. Luckily, one trend will appeal to even the most indecisive dressers: asymmetrical necklines. In the last few seasons, we've seen a rise of designers swaying to one side (quite literally) by embracing the one-shoulder neckline throughout their F/W 24 and S/S 25 collections. We've seen the asymmetrical silhouette in every style imaginable, especially going-out dresses\u2014e.g., Coperni's fall collection gave the classic black dress a cutting-edge feel through a sharp one-sided halterneck, a sleek body-con shape, and a finish of feather embellishments all over.\n\nSimilarly, we saw the black dress made sultrier in the form of a black chain-mail sheer dress with an asymmetrical neckline and prominent keyhole cutout at The Attico's spring show. While the neckline was an effortless way for designers to make the little black dress feel bolder, it wasn't the only classic eveningwear item reimagined in recent seasons. For example, at Michael Kors's fall show, the quintessential sequin gown was made far chicer thanks to the adaption of an asymmetrical neckline and decadent chocolate-brown color. While at Andre\u0101damo, the staple synonymous with a night out (a simple black top) felt spicier because of a semi-sheer material that felt like it had been sliced up to create a relaxed asymmetrical silhouette. With so many variations of this neckline available across collections, there's no shortage of ways to embrace this trend in a way that will take the stress out of choosing what to wear for a special night out.\n\nJamen Knit Dress\n\nFor a swankier evening, you can't go wrong with this off-the-shoulder sea-green dress.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nColetta Top\n\nIt's the bow detail that sold us, TBH.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nTwine Dress\n\nParty like a rock star!\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nChiffon Wrap Around Top\n\nChannel your inner Carrie Bradshaw.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nCredit: Launchmetrics Spotlight; Pictured: Balmain S/S 25; Theophilio S/S 25; Schiaparelli F/W 24; Monse S/S 25\n\nSequin dresses have long been an unsung going-out staple because they can be worn for almost every occasion. Date night? Check. Drinks? Approved by the girls. Weddings? Brides love them. It's no surprise that the sequin dress carries over from season to season. But to say that designers sent any old sequin dress down the runway in recent seasons would be denying what anyone can clearly see for themselves\u2014especially after scrolling through countless F/W 24 and S/S 25 images. Unlike previous versions of this perennial staple, designers played with our peripheral vision by using colors, opacity, and 3D appliqu\u00e9s to create what we're calling \"shiny illusions.\" It wasn't just about slapping a few sequins onto a dress but embroidering them in a way that would create the appearance of real-life objects around them. In some collections, sequins were used to re-create images that felt more surrealist-leaning than literal.\n\nSchiaparelli's fall collection was a prime example of this approach, as a floor-length gown was embroidered with black and brown sequins to re-create the shape of the female body. Similarly, at Monse's spring show, a simple slip dress was adorned with different colored fringe sequins, creating the illusion of a floral print from far away. Others used sequins more realistically to re-create exact depictions of their own world\u2014including graffiti print covered in opaque sequins at Theophilio's spring show and even beads depicting the New York skyline in Staud's collection. The best example of all was the slip dresses spotted in Balmain's spring collection, in which sequin appliqu\u00e9s transformed into a lifelike re-creation of a woman's red lips. Each subtle tweak to the sequin dress reminded us that we shouldn't be so quick to overlook those more \"basic\" going-out staples, because they'll change how we see the world around us every so often.\n\nLucina Embellished Stretch-Mesh Mini Dress\n\nIn the club, we're all fans of Clio Peppiatt.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nShort Embroidered Dress With Body Motif\n\nThe embroidered body motif on this minidress will surely make heads turn.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nLe Sable Dress in NYC Skyline\n\nIf the phrase \"night out on the town\" were a dress.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nTagged Graffiti Sequin Dress\n\nGet it fresh off the runway!\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nCredit: Launchmetrics Spotlight; Pictured: Gucci S/S 25; Stella McCartney S/S 25; 16Arlington F/W 24; Rotate S/S 25\n\nOne of the most surprising ways designers have spoken to the social unrest that is driving large swaths of the population to find solace in clubbing again wasn't through cutting-edge silhouettes or shades of Brat green. Rather, they channeled the \"prickly\" or \"fringy\" feelings by evoking the senses\u2014specifically touch. Although all textiles are influenced by texture in some way, none are as tactile as fringe. While most might associate this trimming with festival fashion, it's become a pivotal part of collections over the past few seasons. Fringe has overcome its previous connotations as the clich\u00e9 trend you wear to Coachella (no shade) because designers have found new ways to reinvent it by playing with form and fabrication.\n\nWith the former, we saw that reflected in the spring shows of Stella McCartney, Rotate, and 3.1 Phillip Lim. No longer were the decorations relegated to the hemline; crystal fringe was draped all over the body to highlight every aspect of the female form, resulting in some of the sultriest fringe pieces we've seen in a long time. But the creativity doesn't end there, as we also saw designers play with fabrics as a way to make fringe feel feistier\u2014whether through creating fringe from tinsel, as seen at 16Arlington, or semi-shiny allover fringe at Gucci. By getting a bit craftier with their F/W 24 and S/S 24 collections, designers have channeled our collective desire to feel something again.\n\nMirror Metal Top\n\nThey can look but they can't touch.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nMetallic Fringe Straight Leg Pant\n\nPut on your party pants!\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nBatiste Crystal Fringe Double-Breasted Blazer Jacket\n\nFor the girls who go from the bar at 5 a.m. to the boardroom at six.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nRiver Fringe Skirt\n\nA fringe miniskirt is always a good idea.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nCredit: Launchmetrics Spotlight; Pictured: Kim Shui S/S 25; Christopher Esber S/S 25; Stella McCartney S/S 25; LaQuan Smith F/W 24\n\nLastly, we'd be remiss if we didn't share a little something extra for the girls who are somewhat extra themselves\u2014enter extra-long scarves into the chat. While you may associate the built-in scarf trend with the viral designer coats that cropped up all over social media in the last couple of years, it's unexpectedly crossed over into club culture. Across F/W 24 and S/S 25 collections, we saw designers use attached scarves and long cape details as a way to give traditional going-out silhouettes a little something extra. For example, a model jaunted around a ballroom wearing a silk bra top with a long attached scarf billowing behind her at LaQuan Smith's fall runway show (thereby giving the bra top a bougie update). But that wasn't the only going-out basic that was made a bit more sophisticated. The naked dress was elevated through an asymmetrical neckline that featured a long built-in skinny scarf tapered down the back at Christopher Esber's spring show.\n\nSimilarly, Kim Shui's spring collection made the little black dress feel sultrier with the addition of a sheer black train, draped off-the-shoulder neckline, and corset bodice. And then, there was Stella McCartney's spring collection, which adapted the evergreen embellished minidress by playing with draping, which bunched around the hips and shoulders to create a dramatically long train and voluminous bubble hemline. Although each runway look differed in approach, the through line seemed to be the designers' dedication to making occasionwear feel special again. The trend embodied so much of the driving ethos behind the entire club-rat aesthetic that's taken over: a \"radical\" desire to reclaim the elements of ourselves that may be labeled as \"extra,\" \"messy,\" or \"bratty\" in the hopes that we can learn to celebrate them.\n\nIryna Dress\n\nEverything about this dress is worth celebrating\u2014from the cobalt-blue color to the ruched bodice to the matching skinny scarf.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nRuched Tulle Sleeveless Top\n\nIt's getting hot in here\u2026\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nOne Shoulder Mini Dress With Scarf Detail\n\nNo one will be able to take their eyes off you in this red dress.\n\n\n\nView Deal\n\nDelphine Top\n\nYou can wear this classic black going-out top to the club, bar, or frankly, any other occasion.\n\n\n\nView Deal"

            "article_content": "Claudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall. The six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d She and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said. They're not alone. Surging auto insurance premiums, driven by the rising cost of claims and other factors, have led to a record number of consumers shopping for cheaper policies, experts said. Analytics company LexisNexis Risk Solutions ranked New York third among the states with the largest annual increases in shopping growth in the third quarter of 2024, reporting a 58% jump. The most expensive auto insurance in 2024 in Nassau County \u2014 and on Long Island \u2014 was in an Inwood ZIP code, 11096, where the average annual premium was $4,464 last year, 52% higher than a year earlier, according to The Zebra, an insurance comparison company. The second-highest premium was in a Valley Stream ZIP code, 11581, where the 2024 average was $4,436, a 53% hike from the 2023 price. Nassau County's average insurance rates are higher than Suffolk County's, partly due to Nassau's higher wages and its proximity to heavily congested New York City, which has the state's highest premiums. (The most expensive car insurance in the state last year was in a Brooklyn ZIP code, 11212, which had an annual average premium of $7,799, according to The Zebra.) But Suffolk car owners are still feeling the pinch. The highest auto insurance rate in Suffolk County was in a Brentwood ZIP code, 11717, where the average annual premium in 2024 reached $3,653 \u2014 a 43% increase compared to 2023, according to The Zebra. A Central Islip ZIP code, 11722, ranked second with a $3,640 average premium in 2024 \u2014 also a 43% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, last year, the statewide average rose 50% to $2,526 and the national average increased 19% to $2,189, according to The Zebra\u2019s \u201c2025 Auto Insurance Trends Report.\u201d The rising costs are leading some car owners to make difficult decisions, experts said. An increasing number of motorists are going uninsured, said David Seider, chief commercial officer at The Zebra, which is based in Austin, Texas. \"The trend is totally understandable, as Americans have grappled with how to manage basic household spending amidst rapidly inflating costs on everything from groceries to rent,\" Seider said. Driving without car insurance is illegal in New York and almost every other state, and can come with stiff penalties, including driver's license suspensions, steep fines and even jail time. Car insurance prices are rising for several reasons, including an increase in the number of car accidents and their severity, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a Malvern, Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that represents the insurance industry. The number of drivers on the road has returned to the levels that existed before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the driving behavior that led to the high losses has not improved, institute spokeswoman Loretta L. Worters said. \"More accidents \u2014 a lot caused by distracted driving, texting while driving, etc. \u2014 with severe injuries and fatalities have driven up claims and losses in terms of both vehicle damage and liability, while attracting greater attorney involvement and legal system abuse,\u201d she said. Also, cars are being built with more advanced technology, which saves lives but also makes repairs more costly, she said. Wildfires, flooding and other weather disasters also are a factor in insurers raising rates to account for financial losses, according to The Zebra report, which cited the 24 separate billion-dollar weather events last year in the U.S., including Hurricanes Helene and Milton on the East Coast. While the rising costs of parts and labor to repair cars contribute to higher insurance premiums, a bigger factor is the greed of insurance companies whose rate hikes have exceeded the nation\u2019s overall rate of inflation, argued Michael DeLong, a research and advocacy associate at the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. \u201cAnd most of the [states\u2019] insurance regulators are letting them get away with it,\u201d he said. Insurers seeking to raise premiums in the state must get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, but there are exceptions. The state has a \u201cflex rating\u201d law that allows insurers to raise premiums by an average of less than 5% in a 12-month period without seeking department approval. \u201cAll auto rates, whether prior approval or flex rating, must be actuarially justified and cannot be excessive, inadequate, destructive of competition, or detrimental to the solvency of insurers,\u201d according to the agency, which said that it reviews applications individually. Insurance companies consider several factors when calculating auto premiums, including consumers\u2019 driving records, education, occupations, credit scores, ages and genders. They also consider ZIP codes, which take into account the prevalence of auto insurance fraud, costs of medical care and weather in the area. New York, California, Georgia, Hawaii and Massachusetts have banned insurance companies from considering consumers\u2019 education and occupations when setting auto policy rates, DeLong said. While the price of auto insurance is surging in New York, the number of insured vehicles is declining. Registration suspensions for uninsured vehicles increased by 25,959, or 7%, to 406,051 statewide between 2022 and 2024, according to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. The number of tickets that police wrote to drivers operating uninsured vehicles in the state grew by 5,711, or 9%, to 70,733 between 2022 and 2023, according to the DMV. The 2024 ticket data is not available yet, but the number is expected to be a few thousand higher than the amount in 2023, the agency said. The DMV cannot definitively attribute the increase in registration suspensions and tickets for uninsured vehicles to the rising costs of auto insurance, according to the agency. The rate of uninsured driving is increasing in some states by as much as 30%, said Shannon Martin, insurance analyst at Bankrate, a Manhattan-based consumer financial services company. But driving without insurance is a risk that should be avoided, she said. \u201cAllowing car insurance to lapse due to non-payment can trigger a range of issues, including state fines and higher insurance rates when the policy is reissued,\u201d Martin said. Not only does driving uninsured put car owners at grave risk of having to pay for damages or injuries they cause, but the practice also helps drive up insurance costs for motorists who do have coverage, DeLong said. Instead of dropping insurance, drivers should discuss with their insurers removing unnecessary coverage, or consider switching to a usage-based insurance policy, Martin said. Stony Brook resident Lee Chaconas, 67, was able to apply discounts to her Geico policy for her 2019 Honda Accord, she said. A retired Geico personal-injury claims adjuster, Chaconas pays $789 for a six-month premium, with a 10% discount because she is a member of the insurer\u2019s credit union and an additional 10% discount for taking a defensive driving course every three years, she said. But with her premium increasing $20 to $30 annually, \u201cwhich adds up,\u201d she doesn\u2019t plan to ever buy another car if she can help it. \u201cThey\u2019re going to bury me in that car,\u201d she said. Insurance companies experienced big profit losses in 2022, as steep inflation drove up the costs of repairs, labor and used cars. They have raised rates in the past few years to try to offset those losses. \u201cInsurance companies now are running to the bank with record profits,\" said Aaron J. Stein, president of Norton & Siegel Inc., an insurance agency in Babylon. \"They\u2019re trying to make up for the years they lost, but at some point \u2026 this is a problem.\u201d Geico\u2019s underwriting profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. In the third quarter of 2024, Progressive\u2019s revenue grew 25% to $19.5 billion compared to the same period a year earlier. The company had 33.9 million active insurance policies, a 14% increase from the same period in 2023. In New York state, Geico, State Farm, Allstate and Progressive accounted for 70.87% of the market share for auto insurers in 2023, according to a report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Among the insurers with more than $100 million in written premiums in the state, State Farm had the biggest auto insurance rate increase for renewing customers last year, an average of 24.9%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a Manhattan-based financial analysis provider. State Farm, New York's second-largest auto insurer, said it has experienced unprecedented growth in its car insurance business in the state. \u201cWhile it is a privilege to be chosen by so many New York drivers, it is important that our rates are adequate to support the business and that we\u2019re able to match price to risk,\u201d said Justin Tomczak, a spokesman for the Bloomington, Illinois-based company. During the pandemic in 2020, State Farm enacted a double-digit rate cut in its auto policies in New York state, he said. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Co. had the second-largest car insurance rate increase in New York last year, averaging 18.7%, according to S&P. The insurer did not respond to requests for comment. Progressive, which averaged increases of 19.7% in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024, also did not respond. Geico is New York state's largest auto insurer, holding 28.37% of the market share in 2023, according to NAIC. Geico had an average New York car insurance rate hike of 7% in March 2024 and a 10% increase in August 2023, according to S&P. Newsday asked Geico about the premiums it charges in the state and why it has increased them. The Chevy Chase, Maryland-based company forwarded the inquiry to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, which responded by email: \u201cAcross the country, auto insurance premiums have been on the rise for the simple reason that the cost of things that auto insurance pays for has been rising,\" said Kristina Baldwin, vice president in state government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based association. \"The cost of medical care for accident victims continues to increase as well as the cost of the parts and labor to repair vehicles.\u201d She also cited riskier behavior, including distracted and impairing driving, as factors that are increasing injury and collision claim costs and compounding the effects of inflation. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of car crashes in the state fell 18% to 418,687, but fatal crashes rose 16% to 1,022, according to the Institute for Traffic Safety Management & Research in Albany. On Long Island, the number of crashes dropped 5% to 77,547, while fatal crashes grew by nearly a fifth, reaching 204 annually. Insurance rate increases are expected to continue in 2025 across Long Island, New York and the nation, but will likely proceed more modestly than in the past two years as inflationary pressure eases on the cost of repairing and replacing damaged vehicles, said Tim Zawacki, insurance sector strategist at S&P. The second half of the year should bode better for consumers, he said. \u201cAssuming no unexpected economic events, we would expect price competition to pick up across markets,\" he said. \"And we\u2019re already seeing carriers spend significantly more money on advertising seeking to attract new customers.\"\n\nClaudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall.\n\nThe six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said.\n\nThey're not alone.\n\nSign up for the Daily Business newsletter Stay in the know on jobs, retail and all things business across Long Island. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nSurging auto insurance premiums, driven by the rising cost of claims and other factors, have led to a record number of consumers shopping for cheaper policies, experts said. Analytics company LexisNexis Risk Solutions ranked New York third among the states with the largest annual increases in shopping growth in the third quarter of 2024, reporting a 58% jump.\n\nThe most expensive auto insurance in 2024 in Nassau County \u2014 and on Long Island \u2014 was in an Inwood ZIP code, 11096, where the average annual premium was $4,464 last year, 52% higher than a year earlier, according to The Zebra, an insurance comparison company. The second-highest premium was in a Valley Stream ZIP code, 11581, where the 2024 average was $4,436, a 53% hike from the 2023 price.\n\nNassau County's average insurance rates are higher than Suffolk County's, partly due to Nassau's higher wages and its proximity to heavily congested New York City, which has the state's highest premiums.\n\n(The most expensive car insurance in the state last year was in a Brooklyn ZIP code, 11212, which had an annual average premium of $7,799, according to The Zebra.)\n\nBut Suffolk car owners are still feeling the pinch.\n\nThe highest auto insurance rate in Suffolk County was in a Brentwood ZIP code, 11717, where the average annual premium in 2024 reached $3,653 \u2014 a 43% increase compared to 2023, according to The Zebra. A Central Islip ZIP code, 11722, ranked second with a $3,640 average premium in 2024 \u2014 also a 43% increase from the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, last year, the statewide average rose 50% to $2,526 and the national average increased 19% to $2,189, according to The Zebra\u2019s \u201c2025 Auto Insurance Trends Report.\u201d\n\nThe rising costs are leading some car owners to make difficult decisions, experts said. An increasing number of motorists are going uninsured, said David Seider, chief commercial officer at The Zebra, which is based in Austin, Texas.\n\n\"The trend is totally understandable, as Americans have grappled with how to manage basic household spending amidst rapidly inflating costs on everything from groceries to rent,\" Seider said.\n\nDriving without car insurance is illegal in New York and almost every other state, and can come with stiff penalties, including driver's license suspensions, steep fines and even jail time.\n\nCar insurance prices are rising for several reasons, including an increase in the number of car accidents and their severity, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a Malvern, Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that represents the insurance industry.\n\nThe number of drivers on the road has returned to the levels that existed before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the driving behavior that led to the high losses has not improved, institute spokeswoman Loretta L. Worters said.\n\n\"More accidents \u2014 a lot caused by distracted driving, texting while driving, etc. \u2014 with severe injuries and fatalities have driven up claims and losses in terms of both vehicle damage and liability, while attracting greater attorney involvement and legal system abuse,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, cars are being built with more advanced technology, which saves lives but also makes repairs more costly, she said.\n\nWildfires, flooding and other weather disasters also are a factor in insurers raising rates to account for financial losses, according to The Zebra report, which cited the 24 separate billion-dollar weather events last year in the U.S., including Hurricanes Helene and Milton on the East Coast.\n\nWhile the rising costs of parts and labor to repair cars contribute to higher insurance premiums, a bigger factor is the greed of insurance companies whose rate hikes have exceeded the nation\u2019s overall rate of inflation, argued Michael DeLong, a research and advocacy associate at the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group.\n\n\u201cAnd most of the [states\u2019] insurance regulators are letting them get away with it,\u201d he said.\n\nInsurers seeking to raise premiums in the state must get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, but there are exceptions. The state has a \u201cflex rating\u201d law that allows insurers to raise premiums by an average of less than 5% in a 12-month period without seeking department approval.\n\n\u201cAll auto rates, whether prior approval or flex rating, must be actuarially justified and cannot be excessive, inadequate, destructive of competition, or detrimental to the solvency of insurers,\u201d according to the agency, which said that it reviews applications individually.\n\nInsurance companies consider several factors when calculating auto premiums, including consumers\u2019 driving records, education, occupations, credit scores, ages and genders. They also consider ZIP codes, which take into account the prevalence of auto insurance fraud, costs of medical care and weather in the area.\n\nNew York, California, Georgia, Hawaii and Massachusetts have banned insurance companies from considering consumers\u2019 education and occupations when setting auto policy rates, DeLong said.\n\nFewer insured cars\n\nWhile the price of auto insurance is surging in New York, the number of insured vehicles is declining. Registration suspensions for uninsured vehicles increased by 25,959, or 7%, to 406,051 statewide between 2022 and 2024, according to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe number of tickets that police wrote to drivers operating uninsured vehicles in the state grew by 5,711, or 9%, to 70,733 between 2022 and 2023, according to the DMV. The 2024 ticket data is not available yet, but the number is expected to be a few thousand higher than the amount in 2023, the agency said.\n\nThe DMV cannot definitively attribute the increase in registration suspensions and tickets for uninsured vehicles to the rising costs of auto insurance, according to the agency.\n\nThe rate of uninsured driving is increasing in some states by as much as 30%, said Shannon Martin, insurance analyst at Bankrate, a Manhattan-based consumer financial services company.

            "article_content": "Kareena Kapoor Khan recalled the attack on actor and husband Saif Ali Khan at their Bandra residence during the early hours of Thursday, saying that she saw the intruder stab Mr Khan repeatedly. Ms Kapoor was recording her statement with the Bandra Police.\n\n\"The attacker was aggressive. I saw him attack Saif repeatedly...Our priority was to take Saif to the hospital,\" she told the police.\n\nThe actor further mentioned that the attacker ran from the spot and did not take any valuables with him.\n\nAccording to her, Mr Khan was trying to protect their children Taimur and Jehangir (also known as Jeh). When the attacker could not reach Jeh, he attacked Mr Khan multiple times, she said.\n\nHours after the incident, terrified Ms Kapoor went to her sister Karisma's house and Mr Khan underwent surgery.\n\n\"After the attack, I was terrified, so Karisma took me to her house,\" she said.\n\nAlso Read | Dark Skin, Slim Build: Nanny Describes Intruder Who Attacked Saif Ali Khan\n\nMr Khan sustained serious injuries after he was stabbed six times by an intruder at his residence in Mumbai's Bandra area on Thursday. The incident took place when the accused allegedly entered Mr Khan's house on the 11th floor of the Satguru Sharan building for a burglary. Left bleeding after the attack, Mr Khan was rushed to a nearby hospital where he underwent surgery as his spinal fluid leaked out after shards of the attacker's knife lodged into his spine.\n\nDoctors at the Lilavati Hospital - where Mr Khan is undergoing treatment - said that Mr Khan is recovering well post-surgery. He is likely to be discharged in a couple of days, sources said.\n\nWhat initial investigation revealed\n\nAccording to preliminary investigation, the attacker's breaking in at Mr Khan's house lasted for nearly 30 minutes. Police sources said that the intruder had scaled the wall of an adjacent compound to enter the premises. He was familiar with the layout of the building and took the stairs on the rear side of the building to reach the floor where the actor lives and entered the house through the fire escape, they added.\n\nA nurse caring for Jeh Eliyama Philips was the first one to encounter the intruder who stabbed Mr Khan. According to her, he demanded Rs 1 crore before Mr Khan intervened.\n\nTwo CCTV footage have emerged so far showing the man who stabbed Mr Khan.\n\nAlso Read | New Videos Emerge Of Saif Ali Khan's Attacker, He's Seen Buying Headphones\n\nIn one of the videos, the accused - who had his face covered and was carrying a bag - can be seen climbing the stairs before entering the actor's house. In another footage from the building's sixth floor, the intruder was seen taking the stairs while fleeing after the incident. He was not seen thereafter.\n\nOver 30 statements recorded, no arrests yet\n\nThe Mumbai police have recorded statements of over 30 people in connection with the attack, including a carpenter who worked at Mr Khan's place two days before the incident. One person was also detained on Friday, but released hours later as he had nothing to do with the attack, police said.\n\nNo arrest has been made so far in the case.\n\nThe cops have formed 20 teams, along with 10 teams from the Crime Branch, to investigate the case. CCTV footage from the Bandra area has also been seized."

            "source": "InfoQ",
            "article_content": "The Apache Software Foundation has recently announced the general availability of Apache Hudi 1.0, the transactional data lake platform with support for near real-time analytics. Initially introduced in 2017, Apache Hudi provides an open table format optimized for efficient writes in incremental data pipelines and fast query performance.\n\nOriginally developed at Uber as an incremental processing framework on Apache Hadoop and submitted to the Apache Software Foundation in 2019, Hudi is designed to bridge the gap between database-like functionality and open data lakehouse architectures. Hudi\u2019s main strength lies in its ability to support both near real-time and batch queries simultaneously.\n\nThe latest release introduces new features aimed at transforming data lakehouses into what the project community considers a fully-fledged \"Data Lakehouse Management System\" (DLMS). Vinoth Chandar, creator of the Hudi Project at Uber and CEO at Onehouse, writes:\n\nHudi shines by providing a high-performance open table format as well as a comprehensive open-source software stack that can ingest, store, optimize and effectively self-manage a data lakehouse. This distinction between open formats and open software is often lost in translation inside the large vendor ecosystem in which Hudi operates. Still, it has been and remains a key consideration for Hudi\u2019s users to avoid compute-lockin to any given data vendor.\n\nReleased under an Apache License 2.0, Hudi 1.0 introduces a new secondary indexing system designed to enhance query performance and reduce data scanning costs. Users can now create SQL-based indexes on secondary columns, significantly speeding up query execution. The release also includes expression-based indexing, similar to a feature in PostgreSQL, which replaces traditional partitioning strategies to enable more flexible and efficient data organization. When the preview was announced last year, Boris Litvak, principal software engineer at Snyk, wrote:\n\nAmong the big 3 ACID storage formats on Object Storage, Apache Hudi 1.0 (beta) is the first one introducing \"functional indexes\" over the data. We usually call it \"secondary indexes\" in SQL DB jargon. When will Delta.io and Apache Iceberg follow?\n\nSource: Apache Hudi Blog\n\nThe release introduces support for partial updates, which improves storage and compute efficiency by allowing updates to specific fields instead of entire rows. Additionally, non-blocking concurrency control enables multiple streaming jobs to write to the same dataset without causing bottlenecks or failures. Discussing the database architecture, Chandar adds:\n\nRegarding full-fledged DLMS functionality, the closest experience Hudi 1.0 offers is through Apache Spark. Users can deploy a Spark server (or Spark Connect) with Hudi 1.0 installed, submit SQL/jobs, orchestrate table services via SQL commands, and enjoy new secondary index functionality to speed up queries like a DBMS.\n\nHudi 1.0 introduces enhancements to the storage engine, including the adoption of a log-structured merge (LSM) tree for efficient timeline management. This supports long-term data retention and ensures high-performance query planning, even for datasets containing billions of records. Bhavani Sudha Saktheeswaran, software engineer at Onehouse and Apache Hudi PMC, comments:\n\nWhether you're building an open data platform, streaming into the data lakehouse, moving away from data warehouses, or optimizing for high-performance queries, Hudi 1.0.0 makes it easier than ever to work with lakehouses.\n\nSaktheeswaran and Saketh Chintapalli, software engineer at Uber, presented a session on incremental data processing with Apache Hudi at QCon San Francisco. The session recording is available on InfoQ."

            "article_content": "Obesity can lead to several lifestyle diseases. Reducing weight to the optimum level can help prevent several diseases. Once someone becomes obese, it is tough to lose weight. If someone knows about the risk of becoming obese, they can take corrective measures.\n\nWoxsen University Researchers, along with US scientists, developed an AI-based prediction model to detect what they call \u2018Obesity Risk\u2019.\n\nThe team, which includes Shahid Mohammad Ganie, Hemachandran Kannan, and Bobba Bharath Reddy, along with Manjeet Rege, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, USA, have explored how combining multiple machine learning methods can predict the risk of obesity based on lifestyle data.\n\nThey introduced an AI-based prediction model that leverages boosting techniques to assess the risk of obesity more effectively.\n\nTheir research paper, \u2018An Investigation of Ensemble Learning Techniques for Obesity Risk Prediction Using Lifestyle Data,\u2019 was published in the Decision Analytics Journal by Elsevier.\n\n\u201cIdentifying the underlying causes of obesity risk in its early stages has become a challenge for medical practitioners,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to use technology to create meaningful solutions to real-world problems. By focusing on lifestyle factors and ensemble learning methods, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights while empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their well-being,\u201d Hemachandran Kannan said.\n\nThe researchers observed that while BMI (body mass index) is commonly used as the primary indicator of obesity risk, it has limitations in capturing the full complexity of obesity, which is influenced by behavioural, environmental, and genetic factors.\n\n\u201cThey noted that BMI does not account for critical health indicators such as muscle mass, fat distribution, or other variables, potentially reducing the precision of obesity classification,\u201d they argued.\n\n\u201cOur study highlighted that while some machine learning models for obesity classification incorporate lifestyle factors, sex, and 3D body scans without relying solely on BMI, the datasets used in these models often stem from smaller sample sizes in specific regions or countries,\u201d they said.\n\nThis limited scope restricts the models\u2019 ability to generalise findings to broader or global populations.\n\nThe study also noted that the perfect climate for obesity to flourish has been created by traditional diets heavy in processed foods and low physical activity as technology develops and urbanisation picks up speed. The resultant effects include an increase in disorders linked to obesity, such as diabetes, heart problems, and other ailments.\n\nThe researchers utilised a publicly available dataset drawn from diverse populations in countries like Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. The dataset incorporated factors such as eating habits, age, sex, physical condition, water and alcohol consumption, and the frequency of vegetable intake.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

In the film, Israelis described what it was like to experience the deadliest day for Jews since World War II as the Oct. 7 attacks unfolded, with around 1,200 people killed, 5,000 injured and 251 taken hostage. And in Gaza, where more than 40,000 people have reportedly been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliation against Hamas, Palestinians described \u2014 and recorded \u2014 the horrors of large-scale devastation.\n\nAs outrage over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza deeply divided American campuses and in some places devolved into hate-filled rhetoric and arrests, this June 2024 documentary with Retro Report investigated how universities responded, how powerful interests joined the fray, and how the conflict over the conflict ultimately spiraled out of control.\n\nThis documentary, updated in May 2024, offered a sweeping examination of the critical moments over the course of the past three decades leading up to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the role of a central player: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn this January 2024 documentary, correspondent Ramita Navai investigated rising support for militant groups, including Hamas, since the Oct. 7 attack, Israel\u2019s military campaign in the West Bank, and the implications for a region on edge.\n\nThis December 2023 documentary with The Washington Post examined how Hamas was able to breach Israel\u2019s vaunted security barrier and carry out the attack that ignited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nRe-released in October 2023, this seminal 2002 documentary examined how the Israeli-Palestinian peace process begun at Oslo in the 1990s was derailed and ultimately undone by the dynamics of politics and violence. The documentary included interviews with key figures from both sides of the negotiating table, including Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Saeb Erekat and Ehud Barak.\n\nExplore more from FRONTLINE on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

            "article_content": "What silently pulls the levers and gives liquidity to markets? Automation and complex algorithms trade securities at a blistering speed, shaping financial exchanges \u2013 and investors can use this algorithmic trading to their advantage.\n\nHere, Telegraph Money explains what algorithmic trading is and how it works in live markets.\n\nSimply, algorithmic trading is the use of computer functions to automatically make trades in financial markets.\n\nThe algorithms are pre-programmed to execute buy and sell orders based on certain variables, or a set of variables, taking place without human intervention.\n\nIn forex markets, roughly 90pc of trades are done using algorithms. In equities, roughly 60-75pc of trades in American, European and Asian capital markets are done through pre-programmed functions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAn individual or, as is predominantly the case, an institutional investor will use automated algorithmic strategies to execute trades.\n\nInstitutional investors dominate the space through sheer position size, placing large trades to reduce transaction costs.\n\nGiven that size, one large trade from a hedge fund or investment bank has the ability to disrupt the market. Algorithmic trading can break up that trade into smaller increments to be deployed at coordinated times.\n\nFor instance, an order of 1 million shares would send a strong signal to the market, whereas an algorithm trading instruction of 1,000 shares every 15 seconds is more palatable and, in some cases, less noticeable.\n\nInitially, algorithmic trading can appear daunting. Indeed historically, trading platforms required a knowledge of coding to build the algorithms.\n\nNow, platforms cater for those with minimal coding experience and a degree in computer programming isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nTo use it, the first step is to gain an understanding of common algorithmic strategies, such as trend-following, mean reversion, high-frequency trading and arbitrage (more on these later).\n\nThen develop a strategy based on data and knowledge of the market. Consider: how will the algorithm react to certain trading signals? What has to happen for it to place orders according to those signals?\n\nBacktesting the algorithm \u2013 that is testing it using historical data \u2013 may not be necessary for a pre-existing algorithm. That said, thorough testing of how the algorithm works and its suitability for live markets is key.\n\nLike all trading strategies, implementing good risk management, like stop-losses, position sizing and diversification, is essential."

            "article_content": "The inauguration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last Friday ushers in a new chapter for Venezuela, marked by deep socioeconomic wounds. The ongoing financial crisis \u2014 arguably the population\u2019s greatest source of discontent \u2014 persists despite a modest reactivation of consumption. Crisis and political conflict remain intertwined, and after a decade of catastrophic governance and escalating tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, the Maduro government now faces an especially turbulent period.\n\nThe evidence of electoral fraud, which Maduro has been unable to convincingly refute, have heightened international pressure. Both the United States and the European Union have stepped up sanctions, and Maduro is bracing for a new wave of isolation. As in the past, this isolation is likely to exacerbate the nation\u2019s economic struggles.\n\nThe start of Maduro\u2019s new mandate follows three years of moderate economic recovery, a relative improvement considering the depths from which Venezuela has emerged. This recovery was preceded by a historic economic contraction that drastically altered the nation\u2019s landscape over the past decade. Amid this unprecedented economic crisis \u2014 exacerbated by the political isolation of Chavismo \u2014 in 2020, the Maduro government began to distance itself from the statist orthodoxy outlined in the Plan de la Patria, its flagship economic program. Instead, it adopted a series of market-oriented reforms in an effort to stabilize the economy.\n\nThe partial dollarization of the monetary system, the introduction of new exchange and fiscal policies, a more business-friendly stance, and a shift in the treatment of international capital have led to a reduction in year-on-year inflation, a recovery in purchasing power, and some improvement in trade. However, the damage to Venezuela\u2019s productive and social fabric had already been done. The socioeconomic collapse experienced between 2014 and 2020, during Maduro\u2019s presidency, delivered a devastating blow to the nation\u2019s economic framework. This trauma has left many Venezuelans struggling to fully recover from its far-reaching effects.\n\nDuring the years of strict economic controls, company takeovers, conflicts with capital, and excessive bureaucratization, Venezuela\u2019s economy contracted by more than 80%. The local industrial sector was decimated, and now operates at just 30% of its capacity. Thousands of businesses went bankrupt. A wave of nationalizations severely undermined the country\u2019s ability to respond to economic challenges. Hyperinflation, which peaked at an astronomical 9,500% in 2019, wreaked havoc on the economy, devastating the financial stability of millions. Meanwhile, the oil industry, once the backbone of Venezuela\u2019s economy, collapsed under the weight of a fixed exchange rate policy and pervasive corruption in the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Income poverty doubled, and now affects an estimated 80% of the population, according to the Venezuelan Academy of Economic Sciences (ANCE).\n\nAccording to the ANCE, the current level of income poverty in Venezuela is 2.6 times higher than the Latin American average. Income distribution is also among the most unequal in the region, with the wealthiest 10% controlling 37% of the nation\u2019s income.\n\nThe crisis of the past decade left profound scars: wages were decimated, prices soared, shortages of essential goods became widespread, and public services deteriorated dramatically. This collapse triggered a mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans, many of whom fled the country on foot, seeking refuge across South America.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of Venezuela, under Maduro\u2019s control, stopped publishing monthly economic data. Media censorship also worsened. The ruling party\u2019s popularity, which began to decline in 2014, has not recovered since. In 2019 and 2020, the national economy displayed metrics comparable to those of a war-torn nation, with GDP contracting by a staggering 30 percentage points, according to estimates from private consulting firms.\n\nThe popular social assistance programs created by the Chavista government \u2014 such as the Barrio Adentro preventive health initiative, the Mi Casa Bien Equipada goods transfer program, Mercal\u2019s cheap food markets, and the Cuban-assisted Comprehensive Diagnostic Centers \u2014 collapsed during the crisis, largely due to widespread corruption among government officials.\n\nThe minimum monthly wage, traditionally around $400, has dropped to just $3. The government provides periodic bonuses every four weeks, but without retroactive benefits, these only raise the effective minimum wage to $150 per month.\n\nInternational sanctions, particularly from the United States, were introduced in 2016 in response to the political crisis driven by popular discontent. These sanctions significantly restricted Maduro\u2019s ability to explore alternative trade options or revitalize the oil industry. The global search for new markets, spurred by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, fostered a period of cautious d\u00e9tente between Caracas and Washington, leading to a modest revival in the oil sector. However, with the return of Donald Trump to the White House, it is likely that sanctions on Venezuelan oil will tighten further.\n\nNational revenues, heavily reliant on crude oil extraction, hit a critical low point in the last decade, with production dropping from nearly 3 million barrels per day to just 300,000 in 2019. Today, after significant challenges, production is slowly approaching the 1 million mark again.\n\nSince 2016, for the first time in its history, remittances from emigrants have become a significant source of Venezuelan tax revenues. The exodus of between seven and eight million people, according to United Nations estimates, represents an unprecedented event in recent Latin American history, highlighting the severity of Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and the erosion of its citizens\u2019 political rights. Despite implementing measures like food rationing based on the last digit of each citizen\u2019s identity card, the Maduro government has refused to acknowledge its responsibility for the crisis or the existence of a Venezuelan diaspora.\n\nThe disastrous performance of the Chavista administration triggered a political shift. In December 2015, the Venezuelan opposition achieved a decisive victory in the parliamentary elections, sending shockwaves through Chavismo. In response, Chavismo moved quickly to consolidate control over all state institutions. This led to the absolute concentration of power in the hands of Maduro and a select group of loyalists, while the government implemented social programs aimed at maintaining Chavista support and building networks of loyalty.\n\nMaduro introduced the Carn\u00e9 de la Patria, a document offering access to a range of digital subsidies, though the contributions are now minimal, along with the CLAP food bags, which are part of the Local Supply and Production Committees. While the population continues to accept these initiatives, surveys consistently show a sharp decline in popularity. However, any assistance remains inadequate given the collapse of the country\u2019s productive activity. In the meantime, Venezuelans are facing a period marked by political uncertainty and looming economic instability.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

Alongside that were children's toys made of clay, cartonnage (a material used to make funerary masks and coffins) as well as funerary masks that covered mummies.\n\nThere were also winged scarabs, beads and funerary amulets.\n\nAdvert\n\nMore basic offerings were also present, including a pottery table used for bread, wine and meat. Archery bows were also present in the tomb.\n\nZahi Hawass (Mohamed Elshahed/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Hawass himself, he said the find could 'reconstruct history' as it has been told.\n\nThe hope is that it will now provide a fuller picture of the lives people had, as well as the culture they were a part of, in Ancient Egypt.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe ancient city of Luxor is famous for housing the Valley of the Kings, included the world famous King Tutankhamun's tomb, discovered in 1922.\n\nEgypt is full of surprises (Mohamed Elshahed/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSituated 340 miles from the Pyramids of Giza, it is known as the 'world's greatest open-air museum'.\n\nThe recent find is different to, say, Tutankhamun, who was buried in a constructed tomb. This week's revelation showed burial chambers carved in to rock to create tombs in the environment that surrounded Ancient Egyptians."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d. Lenticular clouds were visible on Thursday and Friday mornings in North-east England.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "MAJMA\u2019 Lagos Graduates New Set Of Students\n\nThe Secretary General, Association of Arab Universities, and Egypt former Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Professor Amr Ezzat Salama, has said that societal progress should not solely be measured by advancements in natural sciences, because unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity.\n\nSpeaking at the graduation ceremony of the 2023 and 2024 classes from the MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Lagos in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah studies, Salama stated that human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\n\nHe, therefore, underscored the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness.\n\nSalama urged the graduates to remain steadfast in adhering to the values derived from the Holy Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah, adopting a balanced approach in faith, conduct, and service to their communities while spreading noble values.\n\n\u201cThe Arabic language, chosen by Allah as the medium for His final revelation, is the language of the Holy Qur\u2019an, the Sunnah, prayer, pilgrimage, supplication, and the rich Islamic civilization that has flourished across centuries. For every Muslim, understanding Islam in its true essence cannot rely solely on translated works but must come directly from the original texts written in Arabic.\n\n\u201cDuring the medieval era, the Islamic kingdoms that thrived in East and West Africa played a significant role in rooting the Arabic language among local populations and transferring Islamic civilization and thought.\u201d\n\nCongratulating the graduates, Salama stated that the academic degrees are the fruit of hard work and dedication which will serve as keys to their next endeavours.\n\n\u201cI also encourage you to equip yourselves with Islamic knowledge while keeping pace with advancements in science and technology, particularly in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This revolution has introduced a new reality, demanding advanced skills in fields like artificial intelligence, automation, and big data.\n\n\u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution and AI technologies have significantly transformed the nature of jobs, creating an urgent need to balance applied sciences and humanities. This ensures that technological progress becomes a tool for building societies, not a threat to them.\n\n\u201cI must stress the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness. Societal progress is not solely contingent on advancements in natural sciences.\n\n\u201cThe unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity. Human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\u201d\n\nSalama argued that the youths are the primary drivers of development and its ultimate beneficiaries. \u201cTherefore, we must continue investing in young people through education, training, and skill development to ensure they remain innovative and distinguished in this era of rapid transformation.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Association of Arab Universities is to solidify the true image of Islam and its noble message to humanity. The association supports academic and scientific endeavours aimed at spreading the teachings of Islam based on its primary sources, the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah.\n\n\u201cNotably, the Association\u2019s Sharia Colleges Network plays a leading role in publishing research and studies in Islamic sciences across Arab universities.\n\n\u201cIn our discussions with leaders in Nigeria, the Association seeks to strengthen collaboration with Nigerian academic institutions, particularly in Arabic language education, Islamic studies, and historical research. The Association has also organised training programmess for students of the Research and Training Complex at Arab universities, reaffirming its commitment to supporting higher education and serving the issues of the Islamic nation.\u201d\n\nIn his presentation on the goals and aspirations of the institute, President, MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Professor Saheed Ahmed Rufai, highlighted the centre\u2019s area of focus to principally be around training in Islamic Revealed Studies (English, Arabic), Arabic Studies (Arabic, English), Educational Studies (English, Arabic), General Studies (English) and other possible areas of societal need.\n\nHe also said that the centre would be engaging in research and publications, counseling as well as speaking with the target audience being residents of Nigeria who want to learn Arabic and/or further their Islamic education though it would not be blind to interested persons from outside Nigeria if they are willing and able to sponsor the above persons.\n\nRufai said that the channel of engagement for its training, publications and public speaking will be through website, social media and conventional media along with in-person classes, online instruction, distance learning and directed self-study.\n\nAs the centre looks into the future including expanding its reach, Rufai said that it needs support to have its own building, computers, office furniture, office equipment, bus, library and broadband internet.\n\nOne of the special guests at the event, Pro-chancellor/ Chairman, Governing Council of Summit University, Offa, Kwara State, Alhaji Rafiu Adisa Ebiti, also tasked Muslims to learn and deeply understand Arabic language as a pathway to understanding the teachings of Qur\u2019an and the voice of Allah.\n\nAt the event, diploma, advanced diploma and post graduate diploma certificates in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah were presented to graduates trained through MAJMA Training and Research Centre, Lagos.\n\n"
