            "article_content": "A UFO expert has shared a chilling prediction about the possibility of an alien invasion after a series of mystery drone sightings over various military bases.\n\nThe ears of paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists and conspiracy theorists worldwide pricked up over the past couple of days amid reports of various unexplained drone sightings in the US, UK and Germany over the past couple of days.\n\nThe sightings, which have occurred at various US Air Force bases, have managed to cause so much panic that President Biden has been forced to intervene, with a joint statement from the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security also stating there was 'no evidence' the sightings in New Jersey 'pose a national security or public safety threat'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced.\n\nOne person who's keen to point to a more extraterrestrial explanation is Carl Nally, UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI) co-founder and. co-author of various paranormal books, who believes the sightings are a warning for what's about to come.\n\nAn alien invasion would certainly kick of 2025 with a bang (Getty Stock Images)\n\n\"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it,\" Nally explained in a recent interview with The Irish Mirror.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\"They call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\"\n\nAn official for the Department of Defence stated that while there is no suggestion 'malicious intent' in regards to the mysterious sightings, they 'don't know' the origin.\n\nNally has also shared his belief that aliens are able to quickly enter and exit Earth's atmosphere via a series of 'portals', with one of these being situation between the Irish towns of Athlone and Slane.\n\nAdvert\n\nCarl Natty claims the sightings are for another reason (The Morning Show)\n\nWhich certainly contradicts the widely held idea that aliens would make first contact with mankind by plonking themselves down on the White House lawn, but hey, the real world doesn't always revolve around the US.\n\nHowever before you start stockpiling tins of beans and multipacks of loo roll, Nally is keen to remind us that there are greater threats to humanity than aliens.\n\n\"f you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nAdvert\n\nGlad to see we've all got our priorities in order."

It warned the public \u201cagainst pointing lasers at manned aircraft\u201d or attempting to shoot down suspected drones.\n\nThe reason for the post was obvious \u2014 hysteria over alleged drone sightings in New Jersey was leading people to take matters into their own hands, including by shining lasers into the eyes of pilots. And now the F.B.I. was worried that the public response could escalate even to the point of citizens grabbing guns from their homes to address a perceived aerial threat.\n\nBut was the aerial threat even real? It\u2019s possible that the United States government or even foreign actors could be flying drones in a way that should trigger public suspicion, but it\u2019s also becoming quite clear that an immense percentage of the so-called drone sightings in New Jersey and elsewhere are actually commercial and private aircraft, or even stars and planets.\n\nThe drone story is just one in a seemingly endless parade of false or misleading narratives that inflame public anger and deepen American division. For example, we just watched a number \u2014 a huge number \u2014 of Americans actually revel in the coldblooded killing of Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare. Their celebrations were driven not just by a broken moral compass, but also by a fundamental misunderstanding of the medical system that places far too much blame on insurance companies for Americans\u2019 frustrations with the system as a whole."

            "article_content": "It started here. So why shouldn\u2019t we cash in on it?\n\nI\u2019m talking about the current kerfuffle over unidentified objects in our skies.\n\nThe idea of flying saucers began here in 1938 when actor/director Orson Welles picked the small Mercer County town of Grovers Mill as site of that flying-saucer landing in the famed \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d radio drama that panicked so many listeners.\n\nWe had a chance to become the national center for UFO studies, but we failed to capitalize on an effort by state Senator Raj Mukherji of Hudson County.\n\nIn 2022, Mukherji was co-sponsor of a bill that would have funded the study of what used to be called Unidentified Flying Objects \u2013 or UFOs.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we at least study it?\u201d Mukherji said yesterday when I got him on the phone.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the best in editorials, opinion columns and commentary from NJ.com writers. Add your email here:\n\n\n\n\u201cTo be clear, while I haven\u2019t seen any evidence as yet that there\u2019s any reason to be alarmed about the recent spate of sightings, I stand by my long-time position that we don\u2019t know enough about what we don\u2019t know when it comes to UAPs including drones.\u201d\n\nUAP stands for either \u201cUnidentified Aerial Phenomena\u201d or \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena,\u201d whichever you prefer.\n\nI prefer the term UFO because it brings to mind \u201cThe Thing,\u201d a 1950s horror movie. We kids used to watch it whenever it came on TV, usually in the afternoon.\n\nIt tells the story of an Air Force crew in the Arctic that comes across a crashed flying saucer. A humanoid looking creature is frozen into the ice. They dig it out and take it back to their base.\n\nBig mistake. When the ice melts, the creature comes back to life. It starts occupying the bodies of the humans and begins imitating them so that no one can be trusted.\n\nFinally the good guys devise a trap and electrocute the Thing.\n\nBut how do we know there aren\u2019t more UFOs out there carrying malevolent creatures?\n\nThat was the point of the bill being pushed by Mukherji, a Democrat who served as an intelligence officer in the Marine Corps.\n\nThe bill would have appropriated $250,000 to fund university research designed to \u201cobtain high-resolution images of UAP using multiple detectors to discover their nature.\u201d\n\nWe could sure use those images now, but Mukherji\u2019s bill never got out of committee.\n\nAt the time, the minority Republicans lampooned the bill, asking residents whether they wouldn\u2019t prefer to spend the money on \u201cteachers and mental health professionals.\u201d\n\nNot me. I\u2019m a Republican and I\u2019d rather use that money to find out what the hell\u2019s flying around my town.\n\nSo would an authority with the finest of Republican credentials. That\u2019s former Gov. Tom Kean.\n\nWhen I called him three years ago about that bill, the former chair of the 9/11 commission told me, \u201cLike a lot of Americans, I had an immense curiosity about U.F.O.s. The government hasn\u2019t come clean about what they have.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, the leading civilian authority on UFOs is Kean\u2019s niece Leslie. In 2010, Leslie Kean authored a book titled \u201cUFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record.\u201d\n\nIn it she tried to create a badly needed distinction between those of the \u201clittle green men\u201d school of thought and the idea pushed by skeptics that it was all nonsense.\n\n\u201cMost sightings can be explained,\u201d Kean said when I called her at the time. \u201cIf it ultimately can be identified, then it\u2019s no longer a UAP.\u201d\n\nKean\u2019s book was cited at length in a 2021 New Yorker article headlined \u201cHow the Pentagon Started Taking UFOs Seriously.\n\nThe article by Gideon Lewis-Kraus is loaded with reports of sightings that can\u2019t be explained. One such incident brings to mind the current reports of sightings. This one \u201coccurred in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, a rural hamlet southeast of Pittsburgh, on December 9, 1965, in which an object the size of a Volkswagen Beetle allegedly hurtled from the sky,\u201d the article stated.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many Volkswagen Beetles on the road these days, so onlookers often describe these UFOs as \u201cthe size of a small SUV.\u201d But then as now, it\u2019s hard to get a straight story from the police and the military. Kean couldn\u2019t in that Kecksburg case.\n\nThat gives commentators like podcaster Joe Rogan an opening to push conspiracy theories. Of one recent sighting he said that \u201cthis is something they are doing with us, what if they are trying to get us comfortable because they know some real UAPs are on the way?\u201d\n\nWhat if?\n\nIf we had a Center for Flying Saucer Studies at Rutgers, the T-shirt merchandising alone could bring in millions.\n\nThat\u2019s what if."

It\u2019s an incredibly gimmicky feature that will do more for OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT marketing department than for users.\n\nThe 1-800 number will give you 15 minutes of free chat with the AI per month in the US and Canada. It works from any kind of phone, including old flip phones and rotary home phones. OpenAI demoed both during the short livestream. But the more exciting feature is having ChatGPT support in WhatsApp.\n\nYou can use the same number to talk to ChatGPT in the popular chat app. There are no limits, and the phone works worldwide. That\u2019s less gimmicky than calling a phone number to talk to ChatGPT, and I think it\u2019s a big attack on Meta\u2019s Meta AI.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nMeta AI is a ChatGPT-like product from Meta. The company formerly known as Facebook bundled Meta AI with all its social platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. If you use any of these apps, you have access to Meta AI right now, or it\u2019s coming soon. Meta couldn\u2019t give Meta AI a worldwide release, as some markets require special attention. That\u2019s the EU, of course.\n\nOnce Meta AI becomes available, you can\u2019t disable it. You can avoid using it in any of those apps, but Meta AI is now built into all of Meta\u2019s social networks.\n\nBringing ChatGPT into WhatsApp via the 1-800-ChatGPT number is easily an attack on Meta AI, one that Meta can\u2019t really respond to. Suddenly, WhatsApp users can talk to the AI they might prefer right inside WhatsApp instead of the one available by default.\n\nJust look at the demo OpenAI offered. The user moves between a chat with a person to a chat with ChatGPT to ask a question. They could ask Meta AI the same question, as the Meta AI search/composer field is seen right at the top of chats in WhatsApp.\n\nYou can now talk to ChatGPT by calling 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) in the U.S. or by sending a WhatsApp message to the same number\u2014available everywhere ChatGPT is. pic.twitter.com/R0XOPut7Qw \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 18, 2024\n\nTo chat with ChatGPT in WhatsApp, save the 1-800 number in your contacts. Then, type your questions and prompts, and the AI will answer.\n\nAs a longtime ChatGPT user, I\u2019ll never chat with the chatbot via WhatsApp. I\u2019ll use the standalone ChatGPT apps or the website. However, plenty of smartphone owners are still new to the AI game. They might be aware of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Meta AI, but they might not use any of them. The WhatsApp integration gives OpenAI another way of promoting its AI services to consumers who aren\u2019t using AI chatbots.\n\nThe WhatsApp access might be the gateway drug that gets them to install the ChatGPT apps. From there, they might consider premium access for the AI. And it\u2019ll all happen in an app that comes with built-in Meta AI access.\n\nWill it actually work? We\u2019ll have to wait and see whether OpenAI shares any stats on 1-800 calls and WhatsApp engagement. At the very least, it\u2019s a great marketing tactic worth pursuing.\n\nAs for the actual WhatsApp chats with ChatGPT, the privacy implications aren\u2019t clear here. You\u2019d use the service without an account. Also, WhatsApp chats should be end-to-end encrypted so the chat content is only visible to the two parties.\n\nBut one party is an AI that might have instructions to export some of those chats to OpenAI for safety reasons or to improve the service. After all, the toll-free number warns you that the call might be recorded.\n\nAlso, the WhatsApp service can potentially give OpenAI access to plenty of phone numbers that can be targeted with ChatGPT promo texts. It might never happen; I\u2019m speculating here. But OpenAI will want to increase its customer base, so that\u2019s one way to do it.\n\nOpenAI could also match some of those numbers to existing ChatGPT accounts. But again, if you have a ChatGPT account, you wouldn\u2019t really want the WhatsApp experience."

Kentucky Coal Museum\n\n231 Main St. Benham, 40807; Tuesday-Saturday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. and Sunday 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nPerhaps no place is more qualified to portray the realities of life in a coal mine than Benham, Kentucky. Once a coal camp, this tiny eastern Kentucky town is now home to the Kentucky Coal Museum. The museum encapsulates what life as a coal miner would have been like. Given the significance of coal mining in the commonwealth's history, the preserved history of the industry that countless Kentuckians devoted their careers to may be of interest to Kentuckians from all over.\n\n2. Vent Haven Museum\n\n33 West Maple Ave., Fort Mitchell; Open by appointment only May 1 through Sept. 30.\n\nIn the northern Kentucky city of Fort Mitchell resides the \"world's only museum dedicated to ventriloquism,\" according to the Vent Haven Museum's website. While many people may balk at the idea of entering a building occupied by more than 1,200 dummies and related memorabilia dating back to the 19th century, the museum's founder, W.S. Berger, spent decades collecting the items. Berger died in 1972, and the museum opened in 1973 after he formed a charitable organization to ensure his collection stayed intact.\n\n3. Great American Dollhouse Museum\n\n344 Swope Drive, Danville; Wednesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWith more than 200 dollhouses, model buildings and box rooms that capture astonishing detail with their designs and furnishings, the Great American Dollhouse Museum is a window into worlds from several U.S. time periods and regions, including the Colonial period, the Old West, and modern eras, according to the museum's website. Other sections of the museum include a miniature scene mimicking a 1910s town, and a fantasy-inspired sections replete with mythical creatures like elves, witches and trolls.\n\n4. International Paranormal Museum and Research Center\n\nClosed until spring of 2025 for relocation.\n\nThe International Paranormal Museum and Research Center in Somerset is a hub for people interested in the inexplicable phenomena that grip the imagination of humankind \u2014 from ghosts to cryptids to aliens. The organization investigates these subjects and collects artifacts found along the way to display to the public.\n\nThe museum is in the process of moving out of its home of seven years and anticipates reopening in Spring 2025, though its new location has not yet been announced. Rest assured, if you've yet to experience this attraction, the museum's management is confident they'll come back better than ever.\n\n5. Dinosaur World Kentucky\n\n711 Mammoth Cave Road, Cave City; Open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nIf you're young or young at heart, you can help your imagination soar back to the time of the dinosaurs by heading to Cave City. Dinosaur World is an outdoor museum with hundreds of life-sized dinosaurs on display that also offers a host of educational activities that allow children to search for and examine fossils and minerals.\n\nContact reporter Killian Baarlaer at kbaarlaer@gannett.com or at @bkillian72 on X."

I'm going to do a video where they're going to let me explore anywhere I want to in the pyramids for a hundred hours,\" Donaldson said on the podcast, according to BFMTV.\n\nDonaldson, who boasts an impressive 337 million subscribers and over 67 billion views on his YouTube channel, expressed excitement about the upcoming expedition. \"I'm so excited because there are also all these secret corridors deep inside. I don't know what to expect,\" he said. The project, which encompasses all three major pyramids, is happening with special permission obtained from the Egyptian government.\n\nDuring his 100-hour exploration, MrBeast plans to delve into public-closed corridors, tombs, and secret rooms of the pyramids. He will record every moment of this experience to share it with the whole world, BFMTV reported. The YouTuber is even considering sleeping inside the pyramids during this extensive exploration. A tour guide will be present throughout the journey to explain the different areas of each pyramid and provide information about the history of the place, according to BFMTV.\n\nThe team intends to bring various devices to aid in their ghost-hunting quest, and even the tour guide will contribute gadgets to hunt ghosts, according to BFMTV. MrBeast's friends will be investigating paranormal activities in the dark corners of the pyramids and sharing their findings with viewers.\n\n\"During this period, only people whom MrBeast and his team allow will be able to enter the pyramids,\" Cumhuriyet reported.\n\nMrBeast has built an empire on YouTube with hyper-produced concepts and extravagant charitable projects, gaining fame for unusual challenges and viral videos with charitable actions. Previously, Donaldson made history on YouTube with \"Squid Game\"-themed competitions and massive projects.\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with generative AI company Alchemiq"

            "article_content": "A small, silver amulet found by a skeleton in a nearly 2000-year-old grave in Frankfurt, Germany may offer new insights into the early spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.\n\nGerman officials announced the discovery last week -- a small piece of silver foil less than 1.5 inches in size, found in a grave that dates to between 230-270 A.D., that is engraved with 18 lines of religious text. It represents the earliest known evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, predating other archaeological evidence of the spread of the religion throughout that region by decades.\n\n\"This extraordinary find touches on many research areas and will keep science busy for a long time to come,\" Dr. Ina Hartwig, Frankfurt's Head of Culture and Science, said in a translated statement released by the city. This concerns archaeology just like religious studies, philology or anthropology. Such an important find here in Frankfurt is really something extraordinary.\"\n\nBlast from the past:Researchers discover oldest US gun dating back almost 500 years\n\nSix years of discovery\n\nThe amulet was first discovered in 2018 during an excavation of what was once the ancient Roman city of Nida, located outside of what is today the city of Frankfurt.\n\n\"During the excavation, not only a grave, but a complete Roman cemetery was uncovered,\" Marcus Gwechenberger, Frankfurt's Head of the Department of Planning and Housing, said. \"These are finds of inestimable value.\"\n\nIn one particular grave, researchers found the skeleton of a person, who was buried along with an incense chalice and pottery. Under the chin was the amulet, also known as a phylactery, likely worn around the person's neck.\n\nArchaeologists examined the amulet and rolled up silver foil it contained through X-rays in 2019, but the item was too delicate and brittle to unfurl.\n\nIn May 2024, there was a breakthrough. Researchers were able to use a state-of-the-art computer tomograph at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology in Mainz, Germany to decipher the text.\n\n\"The challenge in the analysis was that although the silver sheet was rolled, it was of course also crumpled and pressed after about 1,800 years,\" said Dr. Ivan Calandra, Head of the Imaging Laboratory and the Leibniz Center.\n\nScanning the silver foil piece by piece, researchers were able to create a decipherable rendering of portions of the text.\n\n\"Sometimes it took weeks, even months, until I had the next idea. I consulted experts from the history of theology, among others, and bit by bit we approached the text together and finally deciphered it,\" Goethe University's Dr. Markus Scholz said.\n\nThe final translation reads as follows:\n\n(In the name?) of Saint Titus\n\nHoly, holy, holy!\n\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God!\n\nThe Lord of the world resists [to the best of his ability?] all seizures (?)/setbacks (?).\n\nThe God (?) grants entry to well-being\n\nThis means of salvation protects\n\nthe human being who surrenders himself to\n\nthe will\n\nof the Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son,\n\nsince all knees bow before Jesus Christ\n\nthe heavenly,\n\nthe earthly and\n\nthe subterranean, and every tongue\n\nconfesses (Jesus Christ).\n\nResearchers said that the text is unusual for the time in that it contains no references to Judaism or other pagan faiths, and is written entirely in Latin instead of Greek or Hebrew.\n\nThe amulet is also decades older than other known historical references to Christianity in that region, making the find perhaps the earliest known evidence of the spread of Christianity in what is today Germany in the third century.\n\nMax Hauptman is a Trending Reporter for USA TODAY.

            "article_content": "CHICAGO \u2013 A group of middle school-aged scientists have made a groundbreaking and possibly cancer-fighting discovery after collecting goose poop in an Illinois park.\n\nIt was all thanks to a unique partnership with the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The young learners from the Boys and Girls Club in Chicago collected and analyzed environmental samples to find new antibiotic candidates.\n\nHow To Watch Fox Weather\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle did they know, one seemingly ordinary sample of goose poop taken from Garfield Park Lagoon in Chicago held a hidden treasure. The mundane material contained a novel bacterium, Pseudomonas idahoensis, which produced a never-before-seen compound.\n\nThis compound, named orfamide N, has shown promising results in laboratory tests, inhibiting the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells.\n\nThe American Chemical Society (ACS) said the students' achievement showed the power of early science education and addressed STEM inequities.\n\n\"The researchers say that this work proves that it\u2019s possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research, and it emphasizes the importance of a strong relationship between universities and their local communities,\" the congressional nonprofit said in a written statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload The Free Fox Weather App\n\nThe 14-week applied science program was led by UIC associate professor Brian Murphy, whose lab is focused on discovering antibiotics from natural sources.\n\nHowever, the students didn't just collect samples. They got their hands dirty, becoming bonafide biomedical scientists.\n\n\"They stayed actively involved throughout the scientific discovery process by programming a specialized robot to scoop up bacterial colonies from growth plates and test them for antibiotic activity,\" the ACS said.\n\nWhile orfamide N may hold medical promise, the discovery highlights nature's untapped potential, the ACS said. Future research could uncover additional benefits of the molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Chicago middle schoolers discover cancer-fighting compound in goose poop"

Early testers found it's blowing OpenAI's Sora out of the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI made its Sora AI video generator available for general use earlier this month, while Google's is still in early preview. Still, people are sharing comparisons of the two models running the same prompts, and so far, Veo has proved more impressive.\n\nWhy is Google's Veo 2 doing better than Sora so far? The answer may be YouTube, which Google owns and has used to train these models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTED host and former Googler Bilawal Sidhu shared some comparisons of Google's Veo 2 and OpenAI's Sora on X.\n\nHe said he used the prompt, \"Eating soup like they do in Europe, the old fashioned way,\" which generated a terrifying result in Sora and something more impressive in Google's Veo 2.\n\nVeo 2 prompt: \"Eating soup like they do in Europe, the old fashioned way\" https://t.co/gX9gh1fFy6 pic.twitter.com/kgR7VP2URl \u2014 Bilawal Sidhu (@bilawalsidhu) December 18, 2024\n\nHere's another, which took a prompt that YouTube star Marques Brownlee had tried in a video reviewing Sora.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Veo 2 vs. OpenAI Sora\n\n\n\nTried MKBHD's prompt: \"A side scrolling shot of a rhinoceros walking through a dry field of low grass plants\"\n\n\n\nTook the 1st video I got out of Veo, and it's not even close. Prompt adherence & physics modeling? Leagues apart. Sora nails the look, but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mus9MdRsWo \u2014 Bilawal Sidhu (@bilawalsidhu) December 17, 2024\n\nThis one from EasyGen founder Ruben Hassid included a prompt for someone cutting a tomato with a knife. In the video he shared, we see how Google's Veo 2 had the knife going cleanly through the tomato and avoiding fingers, while the knife in Sora's video cut through the hand.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI tested Sora vs. the new Google Veo-2.\n\n\n\nI feel like comparing a bike vs. a starship: pic.twitter.com/YcHsVcUyn2 \u2014 Ruben Hassid (@RubenHssd) December 17, 2024\n\nGranted, these are cherry-picked examples, but the consensus among AI enthusiasts is that Google has outperformed.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz partner Justine Moore wrote on X that she had spent a few hours testing Veo against Sora and believed Sora's \"biases towards more motion\" while Veo focuses on accuracy and physics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSora vs. Veo 2:\n\n\n\nI spent a few hours running prompts on both models and wanted to share some comparisons \u2b07\ufe0f.\n\n\n\nIMO - Sora biases towards more motion, whereas Veo focuses more on accuracy / physics. And a larger % of clips from Veo are usable.\n\n\n\n\"man jumping over hurdles\" pic.twitter.com/WI9zIaJA64 \u2014 Justine Moore (@venturetwins) December 18, 2024\n\nGoogle has been open about tapping YouTube data for its AI, but it does not permit others to do the same. The New York Times previously reported that OpenAI had trained its models using some YouTube data anyway. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said OpenAI doing this would violate Google's policies.\n\nBI previously reported that Google's DeepMind also tapped YouTube's vast trove of content to build an impressive music generator that never saw the light of day.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

            "article_content": "As OpenAI and Google joust this December, with the former\u2019s 12 Days of Innovation challenge, and the latter countering it with its Gemini 2 AI model, I look beyond these skirmishes to predict my Twelve Trends for AI going into 2025 and beyond.\n\nI will describe them over three columns. Each of these has a theme, and today\u2019s four predictions are around how humans and AI will draw closer to each other\u2014in work, life and relationships.\n\nAlso read: Indian software majors need a clear strategy to ride the AI wave\n\nPrediction One of Twelve\u2014English is the new coding: As our generation was growing up, we were told that learning English was the passport to success. We did that and were arguably successful in our careers and businesses. Our children in turn are told that learning how to code is the passport to success, thus coding is the new English.\n\nThis led to 10-year-olds being dragged to code camps to learn Python and JavaScript. With Generative AI, this changes: Every time we write an English prompt for ChatGPT or any of its ilk, we are actually \u2018coding: i.e., giving it a set of instructions to perform some task for us, whether it\u2019s a summarization, video-creation or a write-up.\n\nExcept that now we are doing it in our natural human language rather than the language of the machine. This is profound, as it has the potential to democratize coding and make eight billion of us code. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella declaimed that instead of learning the machine\u2019s language, machines would have to learn ours.\n\nJensen Huang of Nvidia joined the chorus saying that the true potential of AI is that none of us would have to learn how to code. Thus, English, or any other natural language, becomes the new coding language.\n\nPrediction Two of Twelve\u2014AI is the new UI: AI will become the new user interface. Bill Gates presciently wrote in November 2023 (bit.ly/3tSMNkB): \u201c\u2026you won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do.\"\n\nA UI has been how humans and machines have interacted with each other, as the difficult UIs of machine language and DOS (disk operating system) gave way to a GUI (graphical user interface), search bars, browsers and apps. Simpler UI led to a faster, intuitive and more productive interaction with a machine.\n\nThe AI-driven shift will lead to voice UI as the spoken word becomes the new way to interact with machines, similar to our interactions with other humans. We will chat with ChatGPT or Gemini to work with them on our day-to-day tasks.\n\nOur devices will morph, with voice becoming the primary interface rather than a large screen. The first proto-devices are already out, though not terribly successful, like the Rabbit R1 and AI Pin. An AI assistant becomes the UI.\n\nPrediction Three of Twelve\u2014AI and humans are the new creators: GenAI is a cognitive technology and can do creative tasks like writing, creating art and composing poetry. This has left many human creators deeply worried about their jobs as creativity was supposed to be a uniquely human skill. I believe, however, that Generative AI will boost human creativity.\n\nTake OpenAI\u2019s Sora, for instance, released last week. When Sam Altman had teased it a year back, he had invited creative prompts on X to instantly generate videos with it. Indian entrepreneur Kunal Shah famously gave \u2018A bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view\u2019 and Sora produced a spectacular video (bit.ly/3ZgGnHD).\n\nHowever, it was not Sora that was being creative, but Kunal, who would not have imagined a creation like this unless he had a tool like Sora or Runway to manifest his innate human creativity. Thus, I believe that a combination of humans and AI will give rise to a new era of creativity.\n\nPrediction Four of Twelve\u2014AI creates a new customer: The Industrial revolution brought with it the transactional Industrial customer who rarely used technology, and the internet brought the digital comparison-driven and social customer who searched and clicked her way through brands.\n\nAlso read: These 4 AI stocks could see incredible growth in 2025\n\nA new kind of customer will emerge in this age of AI\u2014someone who lives in the era of infinite hyper-personalized choice and has immersive and conversational interaction with brands, AI that anticipates her needs and brand relationships that are collaborative rather than functional or emotional (bit.ly/4ffrueN).\n\nThis will mean a big change in business and marketing as they adjust to this reality.\n\nThe next set of predictions will be around what I consider the biggest trend of 2025\u2014Agentic AI. Here is a video (bit.ly/4fnaJ1h) that offers more."

Marts will also close next week for Christmas holidays.\n\nCows\n\nAs with prime cattle, there is plenty of demand for good-quality cull cows, especially younger animals.\n\nBase quotes have moved up 4p/kg to 400p/kg for O+3 grading animals, with deals of 410p to 430p/kg on offer for good-quality suckler types.\n\nNI sheep: deals at 700p/kg for lambs\n\nThe live trade for fat lamb remains strong, with exporters and agents for Irish factories very active for heavy lots, pushing prices well above \u00a3160 and topping \u00a3171.\n\nAt the plants, the best quote is 680p/kg, but deals are being reported at 700p/kg to match the live ring.\n\nIn Gortin, heavy lambs were a strong trade, with 25kg to 27kg making \u00a3163 to \u00a3170, 24kg to \u00a3155.50 and 23kg to \u00a3143.\n\nKilrea sold a big show of 1,850 lambs from 630p to 684p/kg, no change on last week. Light lambs at 19kg made \u00a3130, 18.5kg at \u00a3126.50, 24kg sold to \u00a3161.50 and 23kg to \u00a3154.50.\n\nIn Markethill, 1,160 lambs sold from 630p to 687p/kg, little change on last week. Saintfield sold 600 lambs from 620p to 700p/kg in a steady trade. Texels at 32kg made \u00a3171, with 25.5kg Charolais at \u00a3160. There was a big run from \u00a3147 to \u00a3160. Lighter sorts at 20kg made \u00a3124.\n\nIn Ballymena, store lambs were a strong trade. Mules hit \u00a3162 and \u00a3140, with a run of Texels from \u00a3125 to \u00a3137.\n\nA big sale of 1,800 fat lambs were also a steady trade. Lambs at 24.5kg made \u00a3162.50, 24kg at \u00a3159.50, 22kg made \u00a3148 and 21kg at \u00a3147.\n\nFat ewes\n\nThe trade for fat ewes is strong this week. In Gortin, ewes topped \u00a3248, with a run from \u00a3134 to \u00a322. In Kilrea, top was \u00a3250. In Saintfield, the best Texels made \u00a3270 and \u00a3260, with a big run from \u00a3168 to \u00a3238.\n\nRead more\n\nSuckler cows in freefall as 50,000 gone"

            "article_content": "The Global Dairy Trade (GDT) took a bit of a wallop this week, with the index dropping by 2.8%, which was higher than expected.\n\nThe main reductions was for powders, with whole milk powder (WMP) dropping by 2.9% and skim milk powder (SMP) dropping by the same.\n\nBoth anhydrous milk fat (AMF) and butter fell also by 3.8% and 0.6% respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s the first significant drop in the GDT for months, with the last time the index falling significantly being in July. Since then, it has been rising steadily, with just one or two small reductions.\n\nThe overall index remains in a very good place, with prices historically high relative to 2023 and the pre-pandemic years.\n\nIn Europe, prices seemed to settle this week, particularly for butter, with the market nudging up by \u20ac55/t. When considering the decline in prices in recent weeks this is a really good result.\n\nAverage butter prices are now \u20ac7,185/t and while significantly lower than they were three weeks ago, it\u2019s a good price if it extends into the new year and beyond.\n\nWMP and cheddar are much more stable in Europe, with WMP up \u20ac10/t and cheddar down \u20ac10/t. SMP has been under a bit more pressure in the European market and at the GDT, as it fell by \u20ac30/t this week in Europe and is currently trading at \u20ac76/t behind the GDT price, indicating limited appetite in Europe for skim.\n\nAs dairy markets wind down for Christmas, next year\u2019s outlook is less certain, but futures are predicting prices to come down for almost all categories."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of the bright, very early active galactic nucleus that was found by Ba\u00f1ados and his colleagues, which has fundamental implications for black hole growth in the earliest billion or so years of cosmic history. Credit: NSF/AUI/NSF NRAO/B. Saxton\n\nAstronomers have discovered an important piece of the puzzle of how supermassive black holes were able to grow so quickly in the early universe: a special kind of active galactic nucleus so distant that its light has taken more than 12.9 billion years to reach us. This so-called blazar serves as a statistical marker: its existence implies the presence of a large but hidden population of similar objects, all of which should emit powerful particle jets.\n\nThis is where the discovery becomes important for cosmic evolution: black holes with jets are thought to be able to grow considerably more quickly than without jets. The research appears in a paper published in Nature Astronomy and another in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nActive galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely bright centers of galaxies. The engines driving their enormous energy output are supermassive black holes. Matter falling onto such black holes (accretion) is the most efficient mechanism known to physics when it comes to setting free enormous amounts of energy. That unmatched efficiency is why AGN are able to produce more light than all the stars in hundreds, thousands\u2014or even more\u2014of galaxies put together and in a volume of space smaller than our own solar system.\n\nAt least 10% of all AGN are thought to emit focused high-energy beams of particles, known as jets. These jets shoot out from the direct vicinity of the black hole in two opposite directions, sustained and guided by magnetic fields in the \"accretion disk\" of material: the disk formed by gas swirling around, and falling into, the black hole. For us to see an AGN as a blazar, something very improbable needs to happen: Earth, our base of observations, must be in just the right location for the AGN jet to point directly toward us.\n\nThe result is the astronomical analog of someone shining the beam of a really bright flashlight directly into your eyes: a particularly bright object in the sky. Characteristically for a blazar, we also see quick changes in brightness on time scales of days, hours, or even less than that\u2014a consequence of random changes in the swirling accretion disk at the base of the jet and of instabilities in the jet's interplay between magnetic fields and charged particles.\n\nFinding active galactic nuclei in the very early universe\n\nThe new discovery was the result of a systematic search for active galactic nuclei in the early universe conducted by Eduardo Ba\u00f1ados, a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy who specializes in the first billion years of cosmic history, and an international team of astronomers.\n\nSince light takes time to reach us, we see distant objects as they were millions or even billions of years ago. For the more distant objects, the so-called cosmological redshift, due to cosmic expansion, shifts their light to far longer wavelengths than the wavelengths at which the light was emitted. Ba\u00f1ados and his team exploited this fact, searching systematically for objects that were redshifted so far that they did not even show up in the usual visible light (of the Dark Energy Legacy Survey, in this case) but that were bright sources in a radio survey (the 3 GHz VLASS survey).\n\nAmong 20 candidates that met both criteria, only one designated J0410\u20130139 met the additional criterion of showing significant brightness fluctuations in the radio regime\u2014raising the possibility that this was a blazar.\n\nThe researchers then dug deeper, employing an unusually large battery of telescopes, including near-infrared observations with ESO's New Technology Telescope (NTT), a spectrum with ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), additional near-infrared spectra with the LBT, one of the Keck telescopes and the Magellan telescope, X-ray images from both ESA's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra space telescopes, millimeter wave observations with the ALMA and NOEMA arrays, and more detailed radio observations with the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory's VLA telescopes to confirm the object's status as an AGN, and specifically a blazar.\n\nThe observations also yielded the distance of the AGN (via the redshift) and even found traces of the host galaxy in which the AGN is embedded. Light from that active galactic nucleus has taken 12.9 billion years to reach us (z=6.9964), carrying information about the universe as it was 12.9 billion years ago.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

As a real-life analogy, imagine that you read about someone who has won $100 million in a lottery. Given how rare such a win is, you can immediately deduce that there must have been many more people who participated in that lottery but have not won such an exorbitant amount.\n\n\"Similarly, finding one AGN with a jet pointing directly towards us implies that at that time, there must have been many AGN in that period of cosmic history with jets that did not point at us.\"\n\nLong story short, in the words of Silvia Belladitta, a post-doc at MPIA and co-author of the present publication, \"Where there is one, there's one hundred more.\"\n\nLight from the previous record-holder for the most distant blazar has taken about 100 million years less to reach us (z=6.1). The extra 100 million years might seem short in light of the fact we are looking back more than 12 billion years, but they make a crucial difference. This is a time when the universe is changing rapidly. In those 100 million years, a supermassive black hole can increase its mass by an order of magnitude.\n\nBased on current models, the number of AGN should have increased by a factor of five to ten during those 100 million years. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.8 billion years ago would not be unexpected. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.9 billion years ago, as in this case, is a different matter altogether.\n\nHelping black holes grow since 12.9 billion years ago\n\nThe presence of a whole population of AGN with jets at that particular early time has significant implications for cosmic history and the growth of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies in general. Black holes whose AGN have jets can potentially gain mass faster than black holes without jets.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is difficult for gas to fall into a black hole. The natural thing for gas to do is to orbit the black hole, similar to the way a planet orbits the sun, with increased speed as the gas gets closer to the black hole (\"angular momentum conservation\"). In order to fall in, the gas needs to slow down and lose energy. The magnetic fields associated with the particle jet, which interact with the swirling disk of gas, can provide such a \"braking mechanism\" and help the gas to fall in.\n\nThis means the consequences of the new discovery are likely to become a building block of any future model of black-hole growth in the early universe: they imply the existence of an abundance of active galactic nuclei 12.9 billion years ago that had jets, and thus had the associated magnetic fields that can help black holes grow at considerable speed."

Subscribe now!)\n\nUntil now, scientists believed that there was no binary star system near Sagittarius A*, which is a supermassive black hole located at the centre of our Milky Way. However, new research suggests that one such system with the gravitationally bound stars is present in the S cluster, which is a group of high-velocity stars around Sagittarius A*.\n\nThe findings were published in Nature Communications journal on Tuesday, December 17, 2024.\n\nScientists have named this system D9 and it has similarities to G objects, which are strange celestial objects that \u201clook like gas but behave like stars\u201d. The study also predicts a lifespan of around three million years, before the stars merge into each other, because of their ongoing interaction with Sagittarius A*.\n\nThe two stars in the D9 system complete an orbit in around 372 days. This orbit, given their sizes, is just stable enough so that the overwhelming gravity of the black hole does not tear them apart. They are also approximately 1.59 astronomical units (AU) apart, which is well below the tidal disruption radius of approximately 42.4 AU. Tidal disruption radius is the distance which allows a star to be torn away by the supermassive black hole, causing a tidal disruption event.\n\nThe two stars in the D9 system are a Herbig Ae/Be star, and a T-Tauri star.\n\nThe discovery suggests that even though this binary system was previously undetected, such stars can survive in S clusters in the vicinity of supermassive black holes for long periods of time \u2013 around a million years for Sagittarius A*.\n\nIt is also important because the presence of a binary system alongside G objects allows us to partly resolve the \u201cuncertain nature\u201d of G objects. As the D9 system is predicted to merge, it may be possible that these G objects were binary systems that merged.\n\nFrom the Science pages\n\nQuestion Corner\n\nDo giraffes really struggle with slopes?

            "article_content": "Erica Hobbs\n\nSpecial to The Detroit News\n\nA new limited-time exhibit at the Cranbrook Institute of Science invites visitors of all ages to exclaim 'Eureka!' as they learn new ideas in math, science, and history. \u201cThe Science of Archimedes\u201d \u2015 running through June 1 \u2015 is a largely hands-on exhibit that delves into the life and discoveries of the ancient Greek mathematician and physicist, highlighting the lasting impact of his work on modern science. It features more than100 items, including 60 replicas of historical artifacts and interactive reconstructions of ancient machines and technologies, accompanied by explanatory panels that provide context for Archimedes' work.\n\nMichael Stafford, Ph.D., the Susan Flint Cooper Director of Cranbrook Institute of Science, said Archimedes was one of history\u2019s most innovative mathematicians and engineers in history whose work formed the basis of future discoveries.\n\n\u201cHe probably was the very first of what we think of as \u2018Renaissance\u2019 people, even though he didn\u2019t live anywhere near the time window of the Renaissance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis exhibit is designed to help learners of all ages\u2026 to be able to explore some of these themes [in math and science] on their own.\u201d\n\nArchimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BCE) is known for his discoveries and inventions in geometry, mechanics and hydrostatics. He is arguably most famous for the legend that he exclaimed \u201cEureka!\u201d (\u201cI have found it!\u201d) and ran naked through the streets of Syracuse upon discovering the principle of buoyancy, now known as Archimedes' Principle.\n\nSome of the concepts and contraptions featured in the exhibit include Archimedes\u2019 Ballista, the Claw of Archimedes, Archimedes\u2019 Heat Ray and the Archimedes\u2019 Screw. The exhibit is divided into themes of Archimedes\u2019 life, including \u201cMachines of the Ancient World,\u201d \u201cEnergy Machines\u201d and \u201cThe Power of Shapes.\u201d Visitors can play on contraptions that feature compound pulleys, levers and inclined planes to learn about principles in equilibrium and energy, as well as do puzzles with shapes to better understand geometry. One of the most popular activities is a pair of sound parabolas that allow visitors to communicate from opposite sides of the room that teach about sound waves.\n\n\u201cArchimedes\u2019 Legacy\u201d focuses on how Archimedes\u2019 work impacted the discoveries of later scientists, including Galileo and Da Vinci, which Stafford said is particularly important.\n\n\u201cArchimedes provided the building blocks and the building concepts that our modern technological world is based upon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what I want people to know, that science isn't just a moment of time, it's a continuum.\u201d\n\nLathrup Village resident Richard Harrison is a frequent visitor to the museum and brought his teenage niece and nephew to the exhibit. Although he said he knows the history and science of Archimedes already, he enjoyed experiencing the machines up close and echoed Stafford\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get the kids involved in science, you\u2019ve got to see the fundamentals working and see what you can do with even just a little bit of science knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause everything\u2019s obviously a lot more complex now, and you need to [work on] these basics, and it\u2019s fun to see maybe how you can build.\u201d\n\nSeven-year-old Charlie Hager visited the museum on a school field trip and said he liked playing with the machines.\n\n\u201cI think the pulleys where you like pull it down is really fun, and [there\u2019s a] thing where you can sit down on it, and then you go down up, down up.\u201d\n\nHis mother Amy Hager said she liked that the kids not only got to learn about the things around them, but also who invented them and when. She also liked how interactive the exhibit is.\n\n\u201cI love that the very few things that they can\u2019t put their hands on, they have a video to explain everything that\u2019s happening and all of the materials that are used,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a feeling that I\u2019m about to go to Walmart and have some unusual science experiments at home.\u201d\n\n'The Science of Archimedes'\n\nnow through June 1\n\nCranbrook Institute of Science\n\n1 Institute Way, Bloomfield Hills\n\nTickets: $8 for adults; $6 for children (ages 2-12) and seniors (65+) on top of general museum admission ($14 for adults, $10.50 for children and seniors).\n\nHours: 10 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays; 10 a.m. \u2013 10 p.m. Fridays; 10 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m. Saturdays; and noon \u2013 4 p.m. Sundays.\n\nVisit https://science.cranbrook.edu."

            "article_content": "Rohan Doctor was a managing director at Goldman Sachs when he founded Louisa AI.\n\nThe startup uses AI to feed deal ideas and networking prompts to bankers and investors.\n\nHere's why he wants to bring the dealmaking playbook to startups.\n\nCold call after cold call, Rohan Doctor wasn't getting as far as he would've hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs managing director had emailed a list of digital strategy execs at banks and private equity firms to try to sell them on his startup, Louisa AI. But he only got a handful of replies back.\n\nTwo years since its launch, Louisa AI has secured about a dozen clients, including some of the biggest names in corporate America. They include Goldman Sachs, VC firm Insight Partners, and, more recently, one of the biggest AI chipmakers and a top consulting firm. But he didn't secure those contracts from cold outreach. He used his own startup's technology, which proactively prompts deal ideas based on people's personal and professional connections, to get in through the front door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Doctor wants to bring his dealmaking playbook to other startups ahead of an anticipated M&A boom.\n\n\"If we're able to close more deals through warm relationships this way, then other startups can, too,\" he said.\n\nThe near-term outlook for M&A activity has gotten brighter, with lower interest rates reducing the cost of borrowing. Wall Street execs are optimistic that Trump's return to the White House, and any business-friendly regulations that may come with it, will be a tailwind for dealmaking. Also, companies resetting their valuations could spur more transactions to close as price expectations align between buyers and sellers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in Silicon Valley, VCs and founders are hopeful about the anticipated looser environment, which could boost tech building and dealmaking. VCs, which rely on selling startups in M&A deals for many of their returns, have been dampened by the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust stance on M&A.\n\nLouisa AI was built to suggest potential deals based on the data it's exposed to. It ingests information about who and what employees know by plugging into company CRMs, messaging platforms like Slack and Symphony, and email providers. Since spinning out of Goldman Sachs in 2023, Louisa AI has raised $5 million in seed funding. It suggests about $1 billion in deal values per quarter, Doctor said.\n\nIt also highlights mutual connections to establish a warm introduction, which can make all the difference in the multi-billion investment banking industry built on relationships. While running the bank-solutions group at Goldman Sachs, Rohan Doctor used his network to close transactions worth tens of millions of dollars. As a startup founder, it's been a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've tried the cold outreach and just emailing,\" Doctor said, adding that the startup stopped doing that after it didn't yield good results. What has worked for Doctor is realizing he knows someone who knows someone.\n\nLouisa AI scored the chipmaker contract after the AI flagged that one of Doctor's staff used to work for someone who now worked at the chip manufacturer. With the consultancy, one of Louisa AI's investors connected Doctor with the consulting firm they used to work for. He declined to name these firms due to non-disclosure agreements.\n\n\"Everything needs to be warm when it comes to big companies doing big things with other people. It has to rely on trust,\" he said."

            "article_content": "As OpenAI and Google joust this December, with the former\u2019s 12 Days of Innovation challenge, and the latter countering it with its Gemini 2 AI model, I look beyond these skirmishes to predict my Twelve Trends for AI going into 2025 and beyond.\n\nI will describe them over three columns. Each of these has a theme, and today\u2019s four predictions are around how humans and AI will draw closer to each other\u2014in work, life and relationships.\n\nAlso read: Indian software majors need a clear strategy to ride the AI wave\n\nPrediction One of Twelve\u2014English is the new coding: As our generation was growing up, we were told that learning English was the passport to success. We did that and were arguably successful in our careers and businesses. Our children in turn are told that learning how to code is the passport to success, thus coding is the new English.\n\nThis led to 10-year-olds being dragged to code camps to learn Python and JavaScript. With Generative AI, this changes: Every time we write an English prompt for ChatGPT or any of its ilk, we are actually \u2018coding: i.e., giving it a set of instructions to perform some task for us, whether it\u2019s a summarization, video-creation or a write-up.\n\nExcept that now we are doing it in our natural human language rather than the language of the machine. This is profound, as it has the potential to democratize coding and make eight billion of us code. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella declaimed that instead of learning the machine\u2019s language, machines would have to learn ours.\n\nJensen Huang of Nvidia joined the chorus saying that the true potential of AI is that none of us would have to learn how to code. Thus, English, or any other natural language, becomes the new coding language.\n\nPrediction Two of Twelve\u2014AI is the new UI: AI will become the new user interface. Bill Gates presciently wrote in November 2023 (bit.ly/3tSMNkB): \u201c\u2026you won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do.\"\n\nA UI has been how humans and machines have interacted with each other, as the difficult UIs of machine language and DOS (disk operating system) gave way to a GUI (graphical user interface), search bars, browsers and apps. Simpler UI led to a faster, intuitive and more productive interaction with a machine.\n\nThe AI-driven shift will lead to voice UI as the spoken word becomes the new way to interact with machines, similar to our interactions with other humans. We will chat with ChatGPT or Gemini to work with them on our day-to-day tasks.\n\nOur devices will morph, with voice becoming the primary interface rather than a large screen. The first proto-devices are already out, though not terribly successful, like the Rabbit R1 and AI Pin. An AI assistant becomes the UI.\n\nPrediction Three of Twelve\u2014AI and humans are the new creators: GenAI is a cognitive technology and can do creative tasks like writing, creating art and composing poetry. This has left many human creators deeply worried about their jobs as creativity was supposed to be a uniquely human skill. I believe, however, that Generative AI will boost human creativity.\n\nTake OpenAI\u2019s Sora, for instance, released last week. When Sam Altman had teased it a year back, he had invited creative prompts on X to instantly generate videos with it. Indian entrepreneur Kunal Shah famously gave \u2018A bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view\u2019 and Sora produced a spectacular video (bit.ly/3ZgGnHD).\n\nHowever, it was not Sora that was being creative, but Kunal, who would not have imagined a creation like this unless he had a tool like Sora or Runway to manifest his innate human creativity. Thus, I believe that a combination of humans and AI will give rise to a new era of creativity.\n\nPrediction Four of Twelve\u2014AI creates a new customer: The Industrial revolution brought with it the transactional Industrial customer who rarely used technology, and the internet brought the digital comparison-driven and social customer who searched and clicked her way through brands.\n\nAlso read: These 4 AI stocks could see incredible growth in 2025\n\nA new kind of customer will emerge in this age of AI\u2014someone who lives in the era of infinite hyper-personalized choice and has immersive and conversational interaction with brands, AI that anticipates her needs and brand relationships that are collaborative rather than functional or emotional (bit.ly/4ffrueN).\n\nThis will mean a big change in business and marketing as they adjust to this reality.\n\nThe next set of predictions will be around what I consider the biggest trend of 2025\u2014Agentic AI. Here is a video (bit.ly/4fnaJ1h) that offers more."

            "article_content": "As the year draws to a close, Google has unveiled its new image and video generation models, Imagen 3 and Veo 2, the latter of which could be a serious competitor to OpenAI's Sora.\n\nGoogle claims to have developed the most powerful video generation model of the moment with Veo 2. It promises groundbreaking performances, including a better understanding of real-world physics, the movement of bodies and objects, and the nuances of human expression. According to Google, the model can adapt to a multitude of cinematographic effects (tight or wide shots, low-angle views, front or rear tracking, etc.) to create unprecedented sequences in ultra-high definition (4K) and up to several minutes long. On paper, this is even more impressive than what OpenAI offers with Sora, a tool that is certainly impressive, but which sometimes lacks fluidity and can also have difficulty coordinating certain movements. Moreover, Sora does not allow the creation of sequences longer than 20 seconds in high resolution (1080p). All videos generated by Veo 2 include a SynthID watermark that is invisible on screen, but which identifies the resulting videos as being generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nAlongside this, Google has unveiled Imagen 3, the latest version of its image generator. It guarantees brighter and generally better-composed images, in a wider variety of artistic styles, from photorealism to impressionism, abstract and animated.\n\nFinally, Google has released Whisk, an experimental tool capable of generating new images without prompts, but using other elements, photos or drawings, as sources of inspiration. By combining several visuals, such as a portrait and a landscape, for example, the tool creates new, unique and personalized images.\n\nVeo 2 and Imagen3 are currently reserved for YouTube creators and companies using Google Labs' VideoFX and ImageFX. Whisk is currently available as an experimental tool, also via Google Labs and only in the United States. \u2013 AFP Relaxnews"

            "article_content": "When Jeremiah and Laura Burke produced their documentary about Pastor David Platt, they never imagined it would reach a global audience. Released in fall 2023, the film has garnered more than 100,000 views on Conversations that Matter alone, with additional viewership across other platforms.\n\nAn earlier BNG article about the documentary \u2014 The Real David Platt: The Hijacking of McLean Bible Church \u2014 has drawn tens of thousands of readers.\n\nIt is unusual for a group of laypeople to lead such a public revolt against their own church and pastor as what has happened at McLean, a five-campus nondenominational megachurch in suburban Washington, D.C. It is more unusual for laity to take their own church to court. And it is unheard of to create a two-part documentary series outlining grievances against the pastor.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what has happened at McLean Bible Church, where the arrival of David Platt as pastor in 2017 set off a chain of events not unprecedented in American churches but absolutely unprecedented in the public nature of the dispute. The disaffected members have their own website to tell their story.\n\nOne reason for the public attention is that Platt came to the pastorate from the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention International Mission Board.\n\nSome longtime McLean members did not want anything to do with the SBC because they are proudly nondenominational.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Platt and other church leaders have denied any wrongdoing and have protrayed themselves as victims of a campaign by disgruntled church members.\n\nJeremiah and Laura Burke\n\nAmong those leading the charge against Platt are Jeremiah and Laura Burke. He is a self-described \u201ctypical layman\u201d who comes from a business background in wealth management.\n\n\u201cI was a member of McLean since 2005 \u2026 just a rank-and-file member. A Christian husband and father of four children, just a regular everyday guy, nothing unique,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who David Platt was until he started speaking at McLean and became the pastor of the church.\u201d\n\nHis awareness of church politics at McLean heightened only after Platt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cIt had come to my attention that he had written a couple of books because he spoke in the summer of 2015,\u201d Burke recalled. \u201cHe had come to the church and was a guest pastor for a weekend event, and that was my first exposure to David Platt. Then it wasn\u2019t again until 2016 or 2017, when the church started transitioning out of their prior senior pastor, that David\u2019s name started coming up as being the new pastor to replace long-time pastor Lon Solomon.\u201d\n\nWhile initially open to Platt\u2019s leadership despite his admiration for Solomon, Burke\u2019s perspective began to shift by 2020.\n\n\u201cThere was a series of issues that had come to light over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen David first came on, I guess there was a gloominess over the church in a sense, in that it didn\u2019t seem like everyone was aware of what was happening but you kind of just trust your leadership. It seemed like there were some things that were just not right in the whole transition process.\u201d\n\nBurke reflected on the sudden leadership change: \u201cFor the 10 years I was at McLean, you had a solid pastor. Lon Solomon was a stalwart leader and then all of a sudden, he was gone, David came in and Lon never came back. We had been in Israel on a trip with him, he does these tours to Israel. I remember him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die in the pulpit. I\u2019m not leaving this church.'\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by Baptist News Global, Solomon provided this statement: \u201cIf you have seen Part 2 of the video series, you will see that I was removed by the elders from all operational involvement at MBC early in 2017 as a part of my separation agreement. Also, as part of my separation agreement, I am not at liberty to comment on events at MBC or David Platt.\u201d\n\nThe summer of 2020\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked a turning point, as Platt addressed racial and social issues from the pulpit, following controversy from his 2019 prayer over former President Donald Trump. McLean historically had attracted political figures, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, but Burke perceived a shift in atmosphere: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to see famous political people there. David made a story out of it. I guess a lot of people interpreted it as an apology, and that kind of riled some people up.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further complicated matters.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when COVID came up, the shutting down the church was another huge exodus of people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was problematic because everybody started going to other churches. At McLean you had to register to attend, you had to let them know you were coming.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point for Burke came when he discovered the nondenominational church\u2019s connection to the SBC, which he believed violated church bylaws prohibiting denominational affiliation. His investigation revealed McLean\u2019s involvement with the SBC of Virginia and the North American Mission Board through church planting initiatives.\n\n\u201cI just started to research whether we were part of the SBC or not,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn December 2020, at the first congregational meeting they had in person, I remember a lady asking if we were part of the denomination and David said from the pulpit no. However, that\u2019s not what I discovered.\u201d\n\nSBC church planting partnerships\n\nNot only was Platt educated and ordained by Southern Baptists and served in Southern Baptist leadership, the Bible church got involved in church planting partnerships with the SBC North American Mission Board.\n\nChurch leaders contend this partnership with the SBC \u201cwas not a secret.\u201d The SBC connection predated Platt\u2019s tenure, coordinated primarily through Clint Clifton, who Burke identifies as \u201cseemingly the genesis of this SBC relationship.\u201d\n\nThe discovery left Burke feeling betrayed: \u201cI had no idea I was a Southern Baptist. I had no idea for years that I was a Southern Baptist.\u201d\n\nThe conflict escalated to the point where Burke and his family were charged with trespassing at their own church. Determined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nDetermined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nConflict remains, as does attention\n\n\u201cI feel like I have two jobs now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally grassroots, but the amount of people who have seen it is kind of mind boggling. It\u2019s all over the world at this point; people in Romania and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have seen it. There\u2019s a gentleman who reached out from Russia asking if he could have permission to translate it into Russian and distribute it through Russia. It\u2019s been overwhelming.\u201d\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nSeven years after Platt\u2019s arrival as pastor, the dispute is not resolved and Burke and other unhappy members and former members continue to press their case. Their next target is seeking to document where tens of thousands of dollars from NAMB went because they do not believe all the named church plants even exist.\n\nChurch leaders, meanwhile, released their own investigation that stated: \u201cAfter review of numerous financial transactions associated with this partnership, we are encouraged that no improper financial transactions were discovered either during annual external audits by an independent accounting firm or during the discovery process in the lawsuit. We can say, however, that the financial transactions for the church planting partnership were sometimes confusing.\u201d\n\nThat report also said: \u201cIt is unquestionably clear that MBC did not give up any independence or cede any authority over our local church to the SBC or any other denomination. We at MBC remain committed to maintaining our autonomy and independence as a local body of believers according to our understanding of what the Bible teaches about the authority of the local church, and we are grateful that we are moving closer and closer to a day when these kinds of legal updates will no longer be necessary.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nUnderstanding the David Platt story | Analysis by Maina Mwaura\n\nDavid Platt hopes for a biblical gospel instead of an American gospel\n\nFor now, David Platt has won the battle against internal critics at McLean Bible Church\n\nDavid Platt steps up schedule to step down at IMB"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of the bright, very early active galactic nucleus that was found by Ba\u00f1ados and his colleagues, which has fundamental implications for black hole growth in the earliest billion or so years of cosmic history. Credit: NSF/AUI/NSF NRAO/B. Saxton\n\nAstronomers have discovered an important piece of the puzzle of how supermassive black holes were able to grow so quickly in the early universe: a special kind of active galactic nucleus so distant that its light has taken more than 12.9 billion years to reach us. This so-called blazar serves as a statistical marker: its existence implies the presence of a large but hidden population of similar objects, all of which should emit powerful particle jets.\n\nThis is where the discovery becomes important for cosmic evolution: black holes with jets are thought to be able to grow considerably more quickly than without jets. The research appears in a paper published in Nature Astronomy and another in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nActive galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely bright centers of galaxies. The engines driving their enormous energy output are supermassive black holes. Matter falling onto such black holes (accretion) is the most efficient mechanism known to physics when it comes to setting free enormous amounts of energy. That unmatched efficiency is why AGN are able to produce more light than all the stars in hundreds, thousands\u2014or even more\u2014of galaxies put together and in a volume of space smaller than our own solar system.\n\nAt least 10% of all AGN are thought to emit focused high-energy beams of particles, known as jets. These jets shoot out from the direct vicinity of the black hole in two opposite directions, sustained and guided by magnetic fields in the \"accretion disk\" of material: the disk formed by gas swirling around, and falling into, the black hole. For us to see an AGN as a blazar, something very improbable needs to happen: Earth, our base of observations, must be in just the right location for the AGN jet to point directly toward us.\n\nThe result is the astronomical analog of someone shining the beam of a really bright flashlight directly into your eyes: a particularly bright object in the sky. Characteristically for a blazar, we also see quick changes in brightness on time scales of days, hours, or even less than that\u2014a consequence of random changes in the swirling accretion disk at the base of the jet and of instabilities in the jet's interplay between magnetic fields and charged particles.\n\nFinding active galactic nuclei in the very early universe\n\nThe new discovery was the result of a systematic search for active galactic nuclei in the early universe conducted by Eduardo Ba\u00f1ados, a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy who specializes in the first billion years of cosmic history, and an international team of astronomers.\n\nSince light takes time to reach us, we see distant objects as they were millions or even billions of years ago. For the more distant objects, the so-called cosmological redshift, due to cosmic expansion, shifts their light to far longer wavelengths than the wavelengths at which the light was emitted. Ba\u00f1ados and his team exploited this fact, searching systematically for objects that were redshifted so far that they did not even show up in the usual visible light (of the Dark Energy Legacy Survey, in this case) but that were bright sources in a radio survey (the 3 GHz VLASS survey).\n\nAmong 20 candidates that met both criteria, only one designated J0410\u20130139 met the additional criterion of showing significant brightness fluctuations in the radio regime\u2014raising the possibility that this was a blazar.\n\nThe researchers then dug deeper, employing an unusually large battery of telescopes, including near-infrared observations with ESO's New Technology Telescope (NTT), a spectrum with ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), additional near-infrared spectra with the LBT, one of the Keck telescopes and the Magellan telescope, X-ray images from both ESA's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra space telescopes, millimeter wave observations with the ALMA and NOEMA arrays, and more detailed radio observations with the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory's VLA telescopes to confirm the object's status as an AGN, and specifically a blazar.\n\nThe observations also yielded the distance of the AGN (via the redshift) and even found traces of the host galaxy in which the AGN is embedded. Light from that active galactic nucleus has taken 12.9 billion years to reach us (z=6.9964), carrying information about the universe as it was 12.9 billion years ago.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

As a real-life analogy, imagine that you read about someone who has won $100 million in a lottery. Given how rare such a win is, you can immediately deduce that there must have been many more people who participated in that lottery but have not won such an exorbitant amount.\n\n\"Similarly, finding one AGN with a jet pointing directly towards us implies that at that time, there must have been many AGN in that period of cosmic history with jets that did not point at us.\"\n\nLong story short, in the words of Silvia Belladitta, a post-doc at MPIA and co-author of the present publication, \"Where there is one, there's one hundred more.\"\n\nLight from the previous record-holder for the most distant blazar has taken about 100 million years less to reach us (z=6.1). The extra 100 million years might seem short in light of the fact we are looking back more than 12 billion years, but they make a crucial difference. This is a time when the universe is changing rapidly. In those 100 million years, a supermassive black hole can increase its mass by an order of magnitude.\n\nBased on current models, the number of AGN should have increased by a factor of five to ten during those 100 million years. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.8 billion years ago would not be unexpected. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.9 billion years ago, as in this case, is a different matter altogether.\n\nHelping black holes grow since 12.9 billion years ago\n\nThe presence of a whole population of AGN with jets at that particular early time has significant implications for cosmic history and the growth of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies in general. Black holes whose AGN have jets can potentially gain mass faster than black holes without jets.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is difficult for gas to fall into a black hole. The natural thing for gas to do is to orbit the black hole, similar to the way a planet orbits the sun, with increased speed as the gas gets closer to the black hole (\"angular momentum conservation\"). In order to fall in, the gas needs to slow down and lose energy. The magnetic fields associated with the particle jet, which interact with the swirling disk of gas, can provide such a \"braking mechanism\" and help the gas to fall in.\n\nThis means the consequences of the new discovery are likely to become a building block of any future model of black-hole growth in the early universe: they imply the existence of an abundance of active galactic nuclei 12.9 billion years ago that had jets, and thus had the associated magnetic fields that can help black holes grow at considerable speed."

Realizing the find might be something special, the homeowner called in experts, and soon a full excavation was underway.\n\n\u201cWhen I found the teeth and held them in my hands, I knew they were something special,\u201d said the homeowner. \u201cI\u2019m so excited that our yard had something so important for science.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers uncovered a well-preserved jaw belonging to an adult mastodon, an ancient relative of today\u2019s elephants. The jaw will now be studied to figure out how old it is, what the mastodon ate and what its life was like during the Ice Age.\n\n\u201cThis jaw is an amazing discovery,\u201d said Dr. Robert Feranec, an expert from the New York State Museum. \u201cFossils like this help us learn about ancient ecosystems and give us clues about how the world has changed over time.\u201d\n\nA backyard in Orange County, New York, became the site of an incredible discovery of a complete mastodon jaw -- the first find like it in New York in more than 11 years. New York State Museum\n\nOrange County has been a great place to find mastodon fossils. In fact, about one-third of the 150 mastodon fossils found in New York have come from this area.\n\nDr. Cory Harris from SUNY Orange said they hope to keep digging in the area to see if there are more bones waiting to be found.\n\n\u201cThe jaw is the most exciting part, but the toe and rib fragments might also help us learn more about this animal,\u201d Dr. Harris explained.\n\nThe jaw will eventually be displayed at the New York State Museum in 2025, after scientists finish their research, according to Michael Mastroianni, a leader at the museum."

            "article_content": "The official opening of the National Quantum Computing Centre\u2019s main facility highlighted the pivotal role it will play in fostering collaboration across the UK\u2019s burgeoning quantum ecosystem\n\nCollaboration counts The inauguration of the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) offered an opportunity for the team to showcase its diverse range of collaborative projects across the UK's wider quantum ecosystem. (Courtesy: NQCC)\n\nA building may be little more than bricks and mortar, but behind the fa\u00e7ade it can bring people together and catalyse change. That was the vision for the main facility of the UK\u2019s National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), located on the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire, which is designed to foster collaboration and accelerate innovation across all parts of the UK\u2019s quantum ecosystem.\n\nAt the official opening of the building, held at the end of October 2024, the NQCC team showed how that original vision had been turned into reality. In the new experimental labs on the ground floor, NQCC scientists who were previously working as individual teams in borrowed facilities around the Harwell site are now working in an environment where they can swap notes with colleagues working on other hardware platforms.\n\n\u201cIt is always useful to have other scientists around to share ideas and solve specific problems,\u201d said Klara Theophilo, an atomic physicist who is setting up trapped-ion systems based on chips originally developed at the University of Oxford and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). \u201cTrapped-ion systems share some of the same challenges as hardware platforms based on neutral atoms, while the cryogenic engineering we need is also being used for systems based on superconducting qubits.\u201d\n\nTheophilo and her scientific colleagues are benefiting from state-of-the-art experimental facilities purpose-designed for building and testing quantum computers. \u201cThis lab has the best environmental control I have ever worked in,\u201d she said. \u201cTo achieve high gate fidelities we need careful control of both the temperature and the humidity to ensure that our lasers can manipulate the qubits with high precision, and in our previous lab space there was a constant need to realign and recalibrate the lasers.\u201d\n\nJoining the NQCC technical teams will be scientists and engineers from commercial companies who are building their own systems for quantum computing. In the coming months, several firms are due to install prototype hardware platforms commissioned by the NQCC as part of its programme to establish seven experimental testbeds based on different qubit modalities.\n\nOthers will be hosted at the Innovation Hub, the NQCC\u2019s other facility on the Harwell Campus, while quantum networking company NuQuantum is also preparing to establish a team within the main building for a three-year co-development project with the NQCC. The aim of this programme, called Project IDRA, will be to build a distributed quantum computing system that will connect together multiple hardware nodes by entangling the qubits in different quantum processors.\n\nInto the labs Vivek Chidambaram of the NQCC introduces visitors to the superconducting technology being developed by his team for scalable quantum computers. (Courtesy: NQCC)\n\nfacility like the NQCC can act like an anchor for businesses to build around, creating a cluster of companies that form a supply chain for each other Mark Thomson, executive chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)\n\nFor the NQCC and its backers, the longer term hope is that bringing these hardware companies into the national lab will catalyse the formation of a quantum cluster in and around the Harwell Campus.\n\n\u201cWe have a unique ability on this site to connect academia and national infrastructure with start-up businesses and large enterprise,\u201d said Mark Thomson, currently the executive chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and soon to be the new director general of CERN. \u201cA facility like the NQCC can act like an anchor for businesses to build around, creating a cluster of companies that form a supply chain for each other. We have already seen that in the space sector, and I genuinely believe that we will now see the same clustering effect for quantum technologies.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many of the hardware providers who are installing their prototype systems within the NQCC are eager to find new ways to work with the national lab and its growing network of academic and commercial partners. \u201cEstablishing a presence in the NQCC is a great way for us to become more connected with the UK\u2019s wider quantum ecosystem,\u201d said Alice Voaden, project manager for Rigetti, one of the testbed providers. \u201cIt puts us in a better position to identify future opportunities for collaboration, which could help us to explore how emerging applications and software strategies can work with our technology.\u201d\n\nBeyond the technical work, the new facility brings together the NQCC\u2019s growing team of technical and innovation specialists under the same roof for the first time. Previously distributed among temporary office spaces across the Harwell Campus, around 80 people working across a diverse range of activities now have the chance to make new connections and forge a collective identity that will help to establish the NQCC as a focal point for quantum computing in the UK and beyond.\n\nIndeed, since the NQCC was established in 2020 it has put an increasing emphasis on building a community of hardware providers, software developers and end users who can work together to explore the value of quantum computing for the benefit of society and the economy.\n\n\u201cThe early vision for the NQCC was to address the issue of scaling in quantum computing, and originally we were primarily focused on technology development,\u201d commented NQCC director Michael Cuthbert. \u201cBut increasingly we\u2019ve been turning our attention to scaling the user community for quantum computing, and today is an opportunity for us to highlight our activities across the breadth of our programme.\u201d\n\nThose efforts include providing easy access to quantum computing resources, offering learning opportunities to boost the ranks of scientists and engineers with an understanding of quantum computers, and working directly with organizations in the public and private sectors to develop use cases where quantum computing can make a meaningful impact.\n\nIn one example highlighted at the inauguration, applications engineers from the NQCC are working with software company Unisys and the University of Newcastle to explore how today\u2019s quantum computers could be used to optimize the loading of cargo onto aircraft, which can cut fuel costs and reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cWhat happens here will create jobs and businesses, and it will benefit people across the UK and beyond,\u201d said Science Minister Lord Patrick Vallance, who officially opened the building. \u201cYou have created something that will bring academics and people from industry together to harness the power of quantum computing to solve problems that really matter.\u201d\n\nSure start Science Minister Lord Patrick Vallance officially opens the NQCC\u2019s new facility on the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire, UK. (Courtesy: NQCC)\n\nAnother element of the NQCC\u2019s remit is to provide clear, trusted and impartial guidance to government, businesses and the ublic. It is already working with NPL and other government and industry bodies on standards development, with the NQCC spearheading the global debate around responsible and ethical quantum computing. \u201cGaining public trust is vital to drive user adoption,\u201d said Cuthbert. \u201cThe NQCC is in a unique position to provide thought leadership on ethical considerations, which will ultimately benefit the whole community.\u201d\n\nWhile the inauguration of the UK\u2019s newest national lab was focused on the prospects for quantum computing, there were also reminders that the NQCC is a direct result of the country\u2019s established strength in quantum science and technology. Following decades of basic research across many contributing disciplines, the National Quantum Technologies Programme, which has seen more than \u00a31bn of investment since 2014, has been created a collaborative culture in which academics work in tandem with start-up companies to translate scientific insights into innovative technologies.\n\n\u201cWe know that quantum computing will be a long-haul journey that requires some patience, but the NQCC is already showing what can be achieved through collaboration and co-location,\u201d said Peter Knight, the architect of the NQTP and the instigator behind the NQCC. \u201cBringing companies and academics into the facility will enable dialogue, drive future collaboration, and accelerate progress towards our mission of delivering quantum computing at scale.\u201d"
