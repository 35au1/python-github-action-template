            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ), who posted to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account Friday a video he took of swarms of mysterious drones that have been spotted nightly during the past few weeks, said he was increasingly concerned about the unexplained phenomenon.\n\nKim, who joined local police in rural Clinton Township, New Jersey, 36 miles north of Trenton, said he spotted small clusters of two to four drones a number of times throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cWe often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app,\u201d Kim said, noting that the group used a flight tracker app to distinguish the drones from airplanes. \u201cSome hovered while others moved across the horizon.\u201d\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn \u2014 Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024\n\nKim said police have tried to get close to the drones using helicopters, but when approached, the drones would turn off their lights and go dark, echoing a statement by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for weeks,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin, and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eyewitnesses are pushing back against government claims that the drones pose no threat to communities or infrastructure. The growing story has spread to New York, Maryland, and Connecticut, where officials are demanding answers, while new reports of \u201ccar-sized\u201d UFOs were registered in California and parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy is no one talking about the incident that caused an evac helicopter to not be able to pick up a patient due to these drones being in the way of where the helicopter had to go, and made the helicopter turn around and not be able to get the patient?\u201d New Jersey resident Roseann Stanley said on X. \u201cYet they are saying these drones have not caused any problems. That is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOn November 26, a medical helicopter heading to an accident in Branchburg Township in Somerset County was unable to pick up an injured patient due to drones hovering near the landing zone, according to a report by New Jersey media outlet NJ.com.\n\nHundreds of drones were first spotted in mid-November flying over New Jersey; eyewitnesses have reported seeing convoys of drones almost every night since then and have described the crafts, in some cases, as being as big as the hood of a car, and performing in more sophisticated ways than off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented drones.\n\nThough the mysterious objects have been reported in the vicinity of a number of New Jersey-based military installations, with speculation about their provenance ranging from aliens from outer space to Iranian spycraft, Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday that no government facilities have been threatened by the drones.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said during a press conference on Thursday that \u201cwhile there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.\u201d\n\nKirby argued for new legislation that will better \u201cidentify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, many people believe the whole thing is much ado about nothing, and probably a stunt of some kind.\n\n\u201cI think these are just normal drones,\u201d Joseph Steinberg, a local resident, told Decrypt. \u201cMy daughter saw a large one, I went outside with her and we looked, but it was hard to judge the size.\u201d\n\n\"The first problem in situations like this is that beyond the initial drone sightings, you quickly get an overwhelming number of reports of things that aren\u2019t drones,\" Grant Jordan, the CEO of San Diego-based drone detection software company SkySafe, told Decrypt. \"When I look at these videos, the vast majority\u201499 out of 100\u2014aren't drones. They're aircraft, helicopters, satellites.\"\n\nAs Jordan explained, the flood of recent drone reports in New Jersey reveals two issues. First, people rarely observe the night sky, and mistake normal air traffic\u2014flashing lights, moving objects\u2014for something unusual. Second, judging the size and distance in the sky is difficult.\n\nWhile Jordan did not attribute these ongoing sightings to a growing hysteria, he did caution that copycats are likely at work, trying to capitalize on the public\u2019s fear and interest.\n\n\"When a story like this gets attention, it draws more people in\u2014some flying drones to look for others, and some just flying them to mess with people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are now seeing these drones in San Diego and the videos that were shown, it's just standard air traffic going into the San Diego Airport.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

While some believe the objects could be Iranian drones sent to spy on Americans, the truth might be far less thrilling.\n\nAccording to a post shared on X, the unidentified objects are most likely just one object, a drone developed by PteroDynamics. The XP-4 is one of the company\u2019s latest technological developments, and it\u2019s being developed for the U.S. Navy as a logistics and recon drone.\n\nThis matches the videos I've seen and certainly helps explain the government's odd response. pic.twitter.com/RiOVhspWEY \u2014 Samuel Hammond \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udfdb (@hamandcheese) December 13, 2024\n\nPart of the confusion surrounding New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFO reports, though, is the response from the U.S. government, which has continued to say that they aren\u2019t sure who the flying objects belong to. Based on the news shared on X, though, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all.\n\nHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that the U.S. government has been secretive about something like this. In fact, the government continues to hold the specifics of the various missions that its secret space plane are conducting close to the chest. And, since the XP-4 is a drone designed for the U.S. military, it makes sense it wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it too openly if it were behind sightings of New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHowever, not everyone will buy this explanation. Some will likely still continue to hold that New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs are drones spying for other countries. What makes the PteroDynamics angle so believable, though, is the fact that the drone is the same size as what has been reported.\n\nAdditionally, the XP-4\u2019s flight path matches with the reported sightings that have been coming in over the past several weeks in New Jersey. All of that tied together with the U.S. governments reluctance to say exactly who the drones belong to could very well point to this being the truth."

Learn More.\n\nGoogle is set to unleash the power of Gemini with upgraded capabilities when it launches Android 16 for the consumer market next year. In this version, the AI assistant becomes an agent that does things for the human user. A new API introduced to Google\u2019s Developers page allows the AI assistant to perform actions inside the phone\u2019s apps on behalf of the users, a huge improvement that can automate hundreds of daily phone activities.\n\nThe AI assistant will play a bigger role as it transitions to its next generation of becoming agentic, which uses reasoning and planning to solve complex problems on its own. When put in a smartphone, it could potentially revolutionize user experience.\n\nHeavy Speculation About Agentic AI\n\nGoogle released Android 16 for developers in November, sparking an air of mystery and speculation about the new feature for its AI assistant. The \u201capp function\u201d feature likely provides Gemini capabilities to automate daily phone activities with little to no human intervention.\n\nGoogle explains the \u201capp function\u201d as \u201ca specific piece of functionality that an app offers to the system,\u201d adding that \u201cthese functionalities can be integrated into various system features.\u201d It will let \u201capplications \u2026 execute functions they define.\u201d\n\nThis means Gemini can execute a specific function of an application when triggered or called upon by the system, as long as such a function is \u201cregistered and made available.\u201d In other words, Gemini can shop online using the phone\u2019s app with very little or no intervention from the user. For example, an \u201corderFood\u201d function lets the AI assistant do the job without the need for the user to open a food delivery service app to order pizza.\n\nGemini is currently the default AI assistant for most Android phones and devices. However, the upgraded Gemini would be more than just an AI assistant that interacts with phone apps and external services\u2014giving it the capacity to control the functions inside the applications on behalf of the phone\u2019s user adds a hefty measure of utility and power to smartphones."

But the historical roots of this time of year have always had a darker, spookier side. Long before Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol \u2014 an era when families of Victorian England gathered to share ghost stories by the fire on Christmas Eve \u2014 pre-Christian folklore told of a thin veil between worlds, where spirits (and goblins, beasts, and gods) lingered during the winter solstice.\n\nThose ancient beliefs blend with modern natural introspection of the holidays. Along with the (sometimes saccharine) jubilations, Christmas and the winter festivities encourage people to reflect on the past, lost loved ones, and the lingering \u201cghosts\u201d of memory. Add to that how this month is populated by magical home invaders, and a creepy surveillance imp on the shelf, and December is a rather fitting time for mystery, the macabre, and paranormal tales.\n\nCelebrating the scarier side of the holidays is not only a sort of subversive counter-programming by pairing cheer with fear, it allows us to acknowledge the dichotomy of light and dark, contrasting cozy, nostalgic evenings with long, eerily silent nights.\n\nAll of this is a very drawn out way of saying I love getting creepy, spooky, and downright scary gifts for the holidays, and I love shopping for loved ones who also appreciate a little splash of blood red with their Christmases so white. And so, we return with a Talking Strange Show \u201cSeason\u2019s Screamings Gift Guide\u201d for 2024. After the success of last year\u2019s guide, we are going bigger and bloodier with gift suggestions for the horror and paranormal fans in your life. Comic books, action figures, statues, graphic novels, swanky shirts and hats, paranormal investigation equipment, and even some vodka and cologne are all included, and all part of the theme."

With the government of India having tightened rules to rein in bureaucrats\u2019 post-retirement \u201ckiss and tell\u201d memoirs, Ganapathy has steered clear of making his literary foray with a first-person account in James Bond-style and dabbled instead in Ruskin Bond \u2019s much-loved art of narrating \u2018spooky events and paranormal encounters \u2019 set in the woods and quaint Indian towns.Taking a cue from the Uttarakhand-based celebrity author, Ganapathy in \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 (mind you, not \u2018Whispers in the Corridors\u2019, which would anyday be a more awaited offering from an ex-bureaucrat), puts together hair-raising and captivating tales set in UP/Uttarakhand, Ganapathy a.k.a. Avinash\u2019s cadre state; his native home in the coffee haven of Coorg set in the Western Ghats; his alma mater JNU (not named in the book) and even his Central postings in CISF and as head of Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security (BCAS).It could thus not be more apt that \u2018the\u2019 Ruskin Bond himself introduces \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 on the cover as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.Ganpathy stars in and as Avinash, a protagonist he has cleverly created to narrate his rather frequent brushes with the supernatural. There are enough giveaways: Avinash, like Ganapathy, is a native of Coorg, or Kodagu. The stories \u2018Shriek in the Woods\u2019 and \u2018Babu\u2019s Hurricane Lamp\u2019 may remind you or your own childhood \u2014 the fear of Maths, walks from the school through the haunted woods and spooky stories fed to wide-eyed children by the househelps \u2014 and have a flash of R K Narayan\u2019s \u2018Swami\u2019 from Malgudi Days.Each of the tales has Avinash narrating his weird, ghostly, time-travel and post-death experiences in a lucid but captivating, edge-of-the-seat style. The book is a window to the life of a senior police officer who is trained to be fearless and rely on scientific evidence but who is also human enough to marvel at and embrace the unexplained, supernatural experiences along the way. So much so, Ganapathy made it a point to chronicle these chilling life incidents and produce a novel soon after he retired.The stories may be intriguing, sometimes rather incredible (particularly The Curious Case of Class of 1986, which sees Avinash travel through different realms of time), but they also carry a message. The ghosts and supernatural entities, including dead dogs, seem to help in solving knotty murder cases (The Uncanny Experience in Behta Village and Little Khairi Still Roams the Wilds), save lives (Do Miracles Really Happen Anymore and The Small Boy Who Loved Airports) and ensure that the forests and wildlife are protected (Bote Aiyappa of the Sacred Grove)."

            "article_content": "Charming and ebullient, Ducotterd does not fit the stereotype of a research scientist. She grew up in Wigan, and her accent has survived long years abroad. Like many involved in dementia research, she has a personal connection to the disease. With a dentist father and social worker mother, Ducotterd initially planned to become a vet, but when she didn\u2019t get into veterinary school she studied biology at the University of Edinburgh instead. Around the same time, her grandmother\u2019s mental state began to decline.\n\n\u201cI was watching my granny start to buy food for people who didn\u2019t live with her anymore and forget big details about her life,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving that personal connection to the story made me so motivated by what I was doing in the lab. I thought: this is exactly what I want to do. Make medicines.\u201d She went on to a PhD at Newcastle. In the face of diminished neuroscience investment in the UK, she moved to Japan for a postdoctoral position studying Parkinson\u2019s disease. Later she worked at GSK in China and later at Eisai Pharmaceuticals in the USA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazingly global experience of drug discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be innovative you have to think differently. And the more different ways of thinking you have in your group, the more you\u2019re going to challenge each other.\u201d\n\nShe ended up staying in America for nine years, before moving back to the UK at the end of 2022, by which time she had acquired a husband and a daughter. While she had been away, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK had taken the lead in establishing new Drug Discovery Institutes at Oxford, Cambridge and in London, enabling them to function like biotech startups in a university setting, adding free-market pep to academic excellence.\n\nSince Ducotterd was an undergraduate, there has been revolutionary progress in neurodegenerative diseases, mostly driven by advances in computing.\n\n\u201cI went to university just after they\u2019d cloned Dolly the sheep,\u201d she says. \u201cThe molecular technologies have transformed the field \u2013 being able to sequence genomes in minutes rather than years; methods that let us do more rapid analysis of big data; artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe success of lecanemab, a drug that has been shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s progression by 30 per cent in early-stage patients (but which has yet to be approved on the NHS) has also energised the field by showing that progress is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never seen a trial that has shown we can slow the disease at all. It gives massive amounts of hope and investment because everyone now knows it is possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects she is particularly excited about involves leveraging human genetics to mimic natural resilience against dementia. \u201cThere is a really interesting study in a group in Holland where they\u2019re looking at people who live healthily into their hundreds cognitively,\u201d she says."

Photo courtesy of OpenAI\n\nDec. 14 (UPI) -- OpenAI on Monday launched a new video tool powered by artificial intelligence and that has generated controversy in recent months. The company's Sora Turbo product makes it much easier and faster for users to generate high-definition videos lasting up to 20 seconds and has been available since Monday. Advertisement\n\n\"We're introducing our video generation technology now to give society time to explore its possibilities and co-develop norms and safeguards that ensure it's used responsibly as the field advances,\" OpenAI said in an online announcement.\n\n\"We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories and push the boundaries of what's possible with video storytelling.\"\n\nUsers can use the A.I.-powered technology to incorporate existing digital information and extend, remix, blend or generate new content from text.\n\nA storyboard tool enables users to control the outcomes for every frame while adding text, images or video, and two community feeds provide new and continually updated content.\n\nOpenAI said it is blocking content that is illegal or otherwise highly controversial, such as child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes.\n\nStill, the app has faced criticism long before it was released to the public with some experts alarmed about how A.I.-generated video could be used and others concerned with legal issues regarding things like copyright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty artists who had early access to the Sora app in November opposed the Sora app in an open letter to OpenAI and accused the tech firm of using artists as a way to make the app appear more accepted among the global artist community.\n\n\"Artists are not your unpaid R&D,\" they said. \"We are not your free bug-testers, PR puppets, training data, validation tokens.\"\n\nThe artists addressed the open letter to \"A.I. corporate overlords\" and included a leaked code for Sora. Just weeks later, the company rolled out the product to the masses, possibly influenced by that leak.\n\n\"We are being lured into art-washing to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists,\" the artists had said.\n\nOpenAI in February announced the roll-out of the text-to-video Sora app as a follow-up to its ChatGPT chatbot tool for generating textual content.\n\nSora said artists would be part of its development team for the Sora app that is intended to compete with Meta's Make-a-Video tool, which was previewed by Facebook's parent in a 2022 white paper but has seemingly not been released to the public.\n\nAt the time, UPI reported that the success of Meta's model would be likely to spur an increase in investments by other companies into videos generated by A.I.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI in March also rolled out its A.I. tool called Voice Engine, which can clone someone's voice after hearing several seconds of audio. The company has said Voice Engine can help people who have lost their voices and be used in other beneficial ways."

However, the platform is also home to a sea of content that isn\u2019t safe for children, which is why a dedicated kids\u2019 experience has been there for a while.\n\nNow, YouTube is adding a password protocol that will keep young users from accessing any other profile apart from their designated kid\u2019s profile on a TV. In a community update, the company introduced the new Parent Code feature that will block kids from accessing user profiles for adults in their household.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt is an opt-in feature that needs to be enabled manually. Once activated, this code will be required if kids want to access a profile meant for other members of their family. Moreover, they will also be prompted to enter the code if they want to access the video platform without any Google account signed in.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nGoing a step further, the team will also require the parent code if an individual attempts to remove an account from the shared TV. YouTube has also clarified that enabling the new feature won\u2019t affect other devices on which the same account is being used.\n\nIn order to enable the Parent code feature, follow this path:\n\nIn the YouTube app installed on your TV, navigate to the Settings page. You will see a dedicated Parent Code tab in the Settings dashboard. Go through the on-screen prompts and set up the four-digit Parent Code. In order to disable the safety feature, you need to enter the same code in the future.\n\nDo keep in mind that once you remove the parent code, anyone can enjoy YouTube sans any age restrictions for content and without having to sign up with a Google account. Moreover, all user profiles belonging to adult members will be openly accessible.\n\nThe latest safety-focused feature update from YouTube is actually a corrective measure on the company\u2019s end. Earlier this year, Google pulled away the separate YouTube Kids app icon in the YouTube experience for TVs and smart devices.\n\nInstead, the profiles for kids and adults were all clubbed together under the \u201cWho\u2019s watching\u201d launch banner. \u201cNow, you can easily select your child\u2019s profile from within the YouTube app, and you\u2019ll be brought right into the new YouTube Kids experience on TV,\u201d the company reasoned back then.\n\nHowever, it seems that not all parents and guardians were happy with the move, apparently because it makes it far easier for kids to access other user profiles that show content without any age restrictions. Locking non-kids profiles behind a passcode is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Parent Code feature on YouTube is now rolling out and will start appearing for all users within the next few days."

Here\u2019s how to submit a claim.\n\nVERIFY often fact-checks settlement notices so our readers know whether they are legitimate or fraudulent.\n\nSome people, including a VERIFY journalist, received emails in December notifying them about a ParkMobile class action settlement due to a data breach. ParkMobile is a mobile parking payment app that is used in many U.S. states.\n\nGoogle Trends data show many people online are wondering if the ParkMobile data breach settlement is legitimate.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the ParkMobile data breach settlement real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nYes, the ParkMobile data breach settlement is real.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nParkMobile customers who were notified about the parking app\u2019s 2021 data breach could receive up to $25 as part of a proposed class action settlement.\n\nThe parking payment app company agreed to a $32.8 million settlement following a 2021 lawsuit alleging it failed to protect people\u2019s personal information, court records show. ParkMobile denied any wrongdoing or liability, an official settlement website says.\n\nParkMobile also acknowledged the settlement and linked out to the official website on Dec. 5.\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Georgia about two months after ParkMobile confirmed a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d linked to a third-party software in March 2021. The lawsuit alleges that about 21 million users\u2019 personal information was compromised in the data breach.\n\nAccording to ParkMobile, the leaked information included license plate numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, as well as encrypted passwords but not the encryption keys required to read them. Users\u2019 credit card numbers were not leaked, the company said.\n\nWho qualifies for the settlement\n\nAnyone who received a notice from ParkMobile about the 2021 data security incident is eligible to submit a claim, according to the official website. People who are eligible also should have received an emailed notice about the class action settlement.\n\nIf you are still unsure about whether you\u2019re eligible for the settlement, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-866-944-4062.\n\nAccording to the official website, $9 million of the proposed settlement has been set aside for cash payments to people affected by the data breach. The amount of money each person can receive is capped at $25, the website says.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t submit claims for cash payments will receive $1 credits from ParkMobile via email.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nPeople who are eligible for the settlement must submit a claim by Wednesday, March 5, 2025, the settlement website says.\n\nYou can submit a claim online using the ID and confirmation code on your mailed or emailed notice. If you don\u2019t have the notice ID and confirmation code, you can look up your login by entering your name and email address.\n\nYou can also print out a claim form here and mail it postmarked no later than March 5 to this address: ParkMobile Data Security Incident, Attn: Claim Forms, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when people who are eligible for the settlement could receive their payments."

Another team believes it could be down to a close encounter, where a star passed by our own Sun several billion years ago in our history.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe team ran 3,000 simulations of scenarios where stars of various masses passed by our own at different distances. Though we have only discovered an estimated 1-10 percent of TNOs, making further observations and study of their orbits necessary for a full explanation, the researchers found that a close flyby of a slightly smaller star than our own could produce a Solar System that looks remarkably similar to how it looks today.\n\n\"The best match for today's outer Solar System that we found with our simulations is a star that was slightly lighter than our Sun \u2013 about 0.8 solar masses,\u201d Amith Govind, co-author of the \u201cclose encounter\u201d hypothesis paper, explained in a statement. \"This star flew past our sun at a distance of around 16.5 billion kilometres [10.3 billion miles]. That's about 110 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, a little less than four times the distance of the outermost planet Neptune.\u201d\n\nThankfully, we might not have too long to wait for either hypothesis to be further tested.\n\n\"Excitingly, the dynamics described here, along with all other lines of evidence for Planet 9, will soon face a rigorous test with the operational commencement of the Vera Rubin Observatory,\" the authors of the Planet Nine paper concluded. \"This upcoming phase of exploration promises to provide critical insights into the mysteries of our solar system\u2019s outer reaches.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d study is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and the \u201cclose encounter\u201d study in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in April 2024."

            "article_content": "Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) stock has likely impressed its shareholders with a nearly 60% gain over the last year. Such gains might even make investors forget that its current price is still 35% below the stock's peak in November 2021.\n\nNonetheless, a greater focus on its software business and the continuing growth of e-commerce have got the company back on track. Hence, the stock could continue to benefit investors amid its recovery.\n\nThe state of Shopify's stock\n\nThroughout its history, Shopify has stood out among e-commerce platforms. Its ability for no-code site development and the flexibility to customize websites drew entrepreneurs to Shopify, and the company's emphasis on website speeds reduced the possibility that website issues would hamper sales for its customers.\n\nMoreover, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 19% for the e-commerce industry through 2030. This should mean more merchants turn to Shopify as more retail sales businesses move online.\n\nShopify has further emphasized its competitive advantage with ancillary services such as managing payments, monitoring inventory, or supporting email marketing campaigns. This part of the business, called merchant services, accounts for the majority of Shopify's revenue.\n\nHowever, an effort to expand merchant services into logistics brought about high expenses and ongoing losses, which contributed to a massive stock price decline in 2022. That led to Shopify reversing course and selling that business. After selling the logistics enterprise and suffering through some impairment charges, Shopify has again become profitable and stock price growth has returned.\n\nShopify's financials\n\nAdmittedly, Shopify has not grown as fast as it did before or during the pandemic when revenue growth either closely matched or, at times, exceeded the 50% level. Furthermore, Shopify increased the prices for its services in 2023, so its not clear how that affected customer churn.\n\nNonetheless, the company's revenue for the first nine months of 2024 of $6.1 billion increased 23% yearly. This closely matches the 25% growth forecast for this year and the 22% predicted in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Shopify has reduced its operating expenses slightly in 2024. Investors might also remember that the $1.3 billion impairment from the sale of the logistics business in 2023 led to losses in that year despite a $1 billion gain from its equity investments. Amid those developments, its $726 million net income for the first three quarters of 2024 represents a vast improvement from the $525 million loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nStory Continues"

I reviewed F-Secure Total, an affordable antivirus solution that let me build a plan that covers all my devices with just the features I need.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile we all like to keep an eye on the budget, computer security isn\u2019t the right place to cut corners. The best antivirus software provides excellent protection against online and offline malware at an affordable price.\n\nF-Secure has flexible pricing that you can customize to precisely match your needs. The most affordable plan starts at $50 annually, covering one device with real-time antivirus, scam, and ransomware protection in the browser and offline.\n\nYou probably use a computer, phone, and possibly several other devices. If one gets hacked, all of your social and financial accounts are at risk, as is the personal data stored on that device.\n\nIt makes sense to protect them all and F-Secure plans can cover 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, or more devices. A three-device plan starts at $65, five devices cost $70, and 10 computers, phones, and tablets is $85.\n\nThe options don\u2019t stop there. You can add a VPN with unlimited data for $10 more per year. A password manager and identity monitoring also adds $10 annually. With F-Secure, you pay only for what you need.\n\nStill, you can find better deals on antivirus software, at least for the first year of service. I do like that F-Secure doesn\u2019t have shocking price increases when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a free solution, F-Secure has a free malware scan and removal tool. The website describes it as an online scanner, but it\u2019s actually a Windows app that installs on your PC before running.\n\nThe free scanner detects and clears malicious apps that are already active on your computer, but doesn\u2019t protect you from future threats. The best free antivirus software offers good browser protection without requiring a subscription.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nF-Secure Total Platforms Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Devices Customizable (1-26) Support 24/7 Live Chat Free version? Windows malware scan and removal\n\nDesign\n\nI tested F-Secure Total, the version that includes antivirus, a VPN, identity monitoring, and more. After installing the app, the dashboard showed that real-time protection was active, but there were several other features to set up to maximize my cybersecurity.\n\nI installed the browser extension for online protection, the password manager extension to help secure account logins, and a VPN to prevent activity tracking, then added my email address for monitoring.\n\nWith setup complete, I explored the user interface. The dashboard shows all the active features at a glance and lets me select one to make adjustments. A button at the top left opens a menu with more options, including account details, settings, support, and quick access to all the features.\n\nI opened settings and found there are plenty of options to fine-tune each security feature, such as choosing which folders are locked to protect against ransomware.\n\nOverall, F-Secure Total was easy to get started with and the design is clear and simple, with advanced features accessible via settings.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe number one job of an antivirus is to protect my computer from malware. It should offer real-time detection and blocking to prevent infection. As a second line of defense, it should regularly scan for malicious apps and quarantine them so no harm is done.\n\nTo test how well F-Secure Total performed, I checked its score at full-time cybersecurity labs that continuously monitor the threat landscape and rate the effectiveness of leading antivirus software. F-Secure shows excellent AV-Test scores, falling below perfect only once with a minor miss in June 2023.\n\nF-Secure didn\u2019t fare well in AV-Comparatives scoring system, but a deeper dive into the real-time report reveals it blocked as many threats as antivirus leaders Norton, Avira, and McAfee, which have good protection track records.\n\nF-Secure\u2019s score dropped because it had a high false-positive rate, which includes incorrect app and website blocking. An overprotective antivirus can be annoying, but it isn\u2019t dangerous. In my tests, I didn\u2019t get any false alerts.\n\nI always do spot-checks by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. F-Secure Total\u2019s browser extension successfully identified and blocked all 13 malware downloads and browser exploits.\n\nI tested the password manager and it autofilled logins as expected. It\u2019s not as sophisticated as the best password managers that allow organization and password sharing, but it handles the basics well and syncs across devices.\n\nF-Secure Total\u2019s VPN defaults to OpenVPN protocol, which isn\u2019t the fastest. I tried the only other option, IKEv2, which helped. Still, the best speed I measured was 20% as fast as my usual 900 Mbps. With the best dedicated VPN services, I enjoy over 700 Mbps downloads.\n\nSupport\n\nF-Secure claims it offers 24/7 support via live chat, so I tested that out by asking about login sharing. A live agent answered immediately and continued to respond quickly as I clarified my question.\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed several antivirus services and found that live chat support varies. Solutions like ESET have good support, but during limited hours. Others use chat services that start off quickly, then slow dramatically after the first response. I also verified that live chat with a human is available for F-Secure customers all day, every day.\n\nAs I mentioned above, there\u2019s no password sharing option in F-Secure, but the agent suggested I could copy and send the password via a message, email, or written on paper. I liked the inclusion of an offline solution from tech support.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nF-Secure\u2019s privacy policy is very clear and states that it won\u2019t sell or share your personal data to third-party advertisers. It will comply with legal requests, but it doesn\u2019t allow backdoors in its software. The company is based in Finland, which isn\u2019t part of any intelligence alliances for information sharing.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of customer data breaches or cybersecurity incidents, so your personal and financial information should be secure when using F-Secure Total antivirus protection.\n\nIs F-Secure right for you?\n\nThe least inexpensive option, F-Secure Internet Security, offers good protection, but doesn\u2019t beat the best antivirus software. While the VPN and password manager are nice additions to F-Secure Total, dedicated services offer more advanced features.\n\nThe best password managers aren\u2019t that expensive, and you can even find excellent free password managers. The same is true of VPNs. Proton offers a great free VPN], and you can often find VPN deals that minimize your cost without sacrificing speed.\n\nWhile F-Secure Total\u2019s high false positive score is a drawback, I didn\u2019t have any problems with apps or websites being blocked. Also, a false positive is better than allowing malware to run wild on your computer.\n\nThat said, antivirus software like Bitdefender and Norton provide solid protection without the annoyance of overzealous blocking. However, I liked F-Secure Total\u2019s customizable subscription plans and consistent pricing on renewal and still recommend it as a good solution if you want to fine-tune your subscription to exactly what you need."

            "article_content": "If you\u2019ve ever had a doctor order a blood test for you, chances are that they ran a complete blood count or CBC. One of the most common blood tests in the world, CBC tests are run billions of times each year to diagnose conditions and monitor patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut despite the test\u2019s ubiquity, the way clinicians interpret and use it in the clinic is often less precise than ideal. Currently, blood test readings are based on one-size-fits-all reference intervals that don\u2019t account for individual differences.\n\nI am a mathematician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and my team studies ways to use computational tools to improve clinical blood testing. To develop better ways to capture individual patient definitions of \u201cnormal\u201d lab values, my colleagues and I in the Higgins Lab at Harvard Medical School examined 20 years of blood count tests from tens of thousands of patients from both the East and West coasts.\n\nIn our newly published research, we used machine learning to identify healthy blood count ranges for individual patients and predict their risk of future disease.\n\nClinical tests and complete blood counts\n\nMany people commonly think of clinical tests as purely diagnostic. For example, a COVID-19 or a pregnancy test comes back as either positive or negative, telling you whether you have a particular condition. However, most tests don\u2019t work this way. Instead, they measure a biological trait that your body continuously regulates up and down to stay within certain bounds.\n\nYour complete blood count is also a continuum. The CBC test creates a detailed profile of your blood cells \u2013 such as how many red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells are in your blood. These markers are used every day in nearly all areas of medicine.\n\nYou probably had a CBC test run for your annual physical. peepo/E+ via Getty Images\n\nFor example, hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that allows your red blood cells to carry oxygen. If your hemoglobin levels are low, it might mean you are iron deficient.\n\nPlatelets are cells that help form blood clots and stop bleeding. If your platelet count is low, it may mean you have some internal bleeding and your body is using platelets to help form blood clots to plug the wound.\n\nWhite blood cells are part of your immune system. If your white cell count is high, it might mean you have an infection and your body is producing more of these cells to fight it off.\n\nWhat\u2019s Normal\n\nBut this all raises the question: What actually counts as too high or too low on a blood test?\n\nTraditionally, clinicians determine what are called reference intervals by measuring a blood test in a range of healthy people. They usually take the middle 95% of these healthy values and call that \u201cnormal,\u201d with anything above or below being too low or high. These normal ranges are used nearly everywhere in medicine.\n\nBut reference intervals face a big challenge: What\u2019s normal for you may not be normal for someone else.\n\nNearly all blood count markers are heritable, meaning your genetics and environment determine much of what the healthy value for each marker would be for you.\n\nAt the population level, for example, a normal platelet count is approximately between 150 and 400 billion cells per liter of blood. But your body may want to maintain a platelet count of 200 \u2013 a value called your set point. This means your normal range might only be 150 to 250.\n\nDifferences between a patient\u2019s true normal range and the population-based reference interval can create problems for doctors. They may be less likely to diagnose a disease if your set point is far from a cutoff. Conversely, they may run unnecessary tests if your set point is too close to a cutoff.\n\nFinding The Range\n\nLuckily, many patients get blood counts each year as part of routine checkups. Using machine learning models, my team and I were able to estimate blood count set points for over 50,000 patients based on their history of visits to the clinic. This allowed us to study how the body regulates these set points and to test whether we can build better ways of personalizing lab test readings.\n\nOver multiple decades, we found that individual normal ranges were about three times smaller than at the population level. For example, while the \u201cnormal\u201d range for the white blood cell count is around 4.0 to 11.0 billion cells per liter of blood, we found that most people\u2019s individual ranges were much narrower, more like 4.5 to 7, or 7.5 to 10. When we used these set points to interpret new test results, they helped improve the diagnosis of diseases such as iron deficiency, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism. We could note when someone\u2019s result was outside their smaller personal range, potentially indicating an issue, even if the result was within the normal range for the population overall.\n\nThe set points themselves were strong indicators for future risk of developing a disease. For example, patients with high white blood cell set points were more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes in the future. They were also nearly twice as likely to die of any cause compared with similar patients with low white cell counts. Other blood count markers were also strong predictors of future disease and mortality risk.\n\nIn the future, doctors could potentially use set points to improve disease screening and how they interpret new test results. This is an exciting avenue for personalized medicine: to use your own medical history to define what exactly healthy means for you.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation by Brody H.

Additionally, as of September 6, 2024, approximately 161 UNRWA school buildings\u2014representing 86.1% of all such facilities in Gaza\u2014had suffered direct hits or damage.\n\nThe United Nations and various human rights organisations have condemned attacks on UN facilities, stressing their protected status under international law.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have stated that their operations target militant infrastructure and personnel, asserting that groups like Hamas use civilian areas, including UN facilities, for military purposes.\n\nWar death toll mounts\n\nThe conflict in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a large-scale offensive on Gaza, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed at least 44,930 people, the majority of them civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United Nations has deemed the casualty figures provided by Gaza\u2019s health ministry reliable, underscoring the devastating toll the conflict has taken on the densely populated territory.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

The black one has a Steam button.\n\nWhile the low resolution images don\u2019t immediately scream SteamOS, if you look closely you\u2019ll notice a Steam logo is visible on a button to the left of the display. Interestingly, the white model doesn\u2019t have the same Steam button \u2014 which could indicate Lenovo is preparing Windows- and SteamOS-powered models of its Legion Go S.\n\nYou can clearly see a Steam logo on the button to the left of the display. Image: Evan Blass (X)\n\nPC makers like Lenovo, Asus, and MSI have all opted for Windows-based handhelds so far, but as consumer patience with Windows on tiny screens wears thin and Microsoft\u2019s progress in improving the experience is slow, it seems like OEMs are looking for a better alternative.\n\nLenovo\u2019s potential entry into a SteamOS handheld comes just days after Valve quietly updated a document with new branding guidelines that include \u201cPowered by SteamOS\u201d hardware. It\u2019s the surest sign yet that Valve is working with more third-party hardware manufacturers, beyond Asus, to certify devices with SteamOS. With CES 2025 just a few weeks away, we could be about to witness a lot more SteamOS-powered hardware."

            "article_content": "If you've ever wondered what the world looks like from a polar bear's perspective, this incredible footage can give you a good insight.\n\nScientists said they were left 'amazed' after examining the 115 hours of video they captured while strapping cameras to the animals as they roamed around Canada.\n\nAs well as giving us a deeper understanding of what it's like to move around on all fours, the clips also highlighted how clever these creatures really are.\n\nThe thing is, this species have been hit hard by the effects of climate change over the last few years and are now considered as 'vulnerable' by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group.\n\nAdvert\n\nVast amounts of sea ice are melting due to global warming, which poses quite the problem to polar bears, as they use the frozen sheets as stepping stones to score some lunch.\n\nDue to the fact the animals' primary food source is seals, the lack of sea ice really throws a spanner in the works when it comes to their survival.\n\nAccording to the WWF, polar bears also use sea ice to 'rest, breed, and store energy for the summer and autumn, when food can be scarce'.\n\nIt's now melting earlier in the spring and forming later in the autumn in the bears' southern range, the organisation warned, in spots such as Hudson Bay and James Bay in Canada.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd the impact of this is worrying, to say the least.\n\nThe incredible footage gave us an insight into the life of a polar bear from their perspective (USGS/Washington State University)\n\n\"For every week earlier that the ice breaks up in Hudson Bay, bears come ashore roughly 22 pounds lighter and in poorer condition,\" the WWF said.\n\nPolar bears are being forced to spend more time on land as a result of the melting sea ice, but food high in calories is hard to come by for the animals - hence their dramatic weight loss.\n\nAdvert\n\nSo, to get to the bottom of how the polar bears were dealing with this life-and-death dilemma, scientists strapped cameras to 20 of them who were wandering around Hudson Bay.\n\nThe team scoured through more than 100 hours of footage captured over a three-year period, which showed the creatures eating, sleeping, hunting and having fun.\n\nThey were seen feeding on bird carcasses, chowing down on berries and grass, feasting on marine animals, as well as play-fighting with each other in the water and chewing on antlers.\n\nAnthony Pagano, wildlife biologist at the US Geological Survey (USGS) and leader of the study, previously told Vox about the findings: \"We were amazed by the video footage.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"The video footage really highlighted how intelligent these animals are by using different behaviour strategies to survive their time on land while without access to their primary prey.\"\n\nBefore the study, scientists presumed that polar bears might be coping with prolonged periods on land by resting to save energy, or filling up on other prey such as plants and seabirds.\n\nThe animals are being forced to forage for food on land due to the melting sea ice (OLIVIER MORIN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe footage and other data collected by boffins - such as the amount of energy burned and measurements of movement - suggests that the predators actually did both, with some heading out in search for food and others opting to have a little lie down instead.\n\nAdvert\n\nDespite the split in approaches among the polar bears, sadly neither was successful - and all but one of the 20 subjects lost weight.\n\nAlarmingly, one even lost nearly 80 pounds.\n\nScientists also found that polar bears were taking longer swims in search of food, which is 'unexpected for this time of year', according to polar expert at the University of Alberta Andrew Derocher.\n\nDerocher further explained: \"These are possibly acts of desperation. Hungry and skinny bears take more risks than fat bears.\"\n\nEssentially, eating berries and smaller prey isn't enough to tide a polar bear over.\n\n\"This study really brings home the message that there\u2019s no salvation from terrestrial feeding to help polar bears through the ice-free period,\" Derocher added.\n\nThe polar bear population in this area is estimated to have fallen 30 percent since 1987, and this study appears to prove that global warming will continue to make it even harder for the species to survive."

            "article_content": "While left-wing governments hold power across most of Latin America, ultraright social forces remain a threat. In Bolivia, powerful left-indigenous social movements have managed to keep an insurgent right wing at bay since the devastating coup of 2019. But a growing political crisis for the plurinational state highlights the urgent need to maintain unity in the face of an ever-powerful right. The coup of 2019 was a catastrophic attack on Bolivian democracy. It saw the rapid ascent of ultraright conservatives from the lowland city of Santa Cruz \u2014 the axis of regional-class antagonism to the then President Evo Morales and his party, the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS \u2014 directed by businessman Luis Fernando Camacho, the leader of the business group Comit\u00e9 Pro Santa Cruz and former leader of the Nazi youth group Uni\u00f3n Juvenil Cruce\u00f1ista (UJC). The coup unfolded when middle-class protesters took to the streets to dispute Evo\u2019s victory in that year\u2019s elections. As the protests escalated, the head of the armed forces \u201csuggested\u201d Morales resign, forcing him into exile in Mexico. In the resulting power vacuum, the right-wing evangelical Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez seized the presidency, and as social movements resisted, she presided over two mass killings \u2014 of nine protesters in Sacaba, Cochabamba, and of ten protesters blockading the Senkata gas plant in El Alto who were shot dead by a military exempted from criminal liability by a sudden presidential decree. \u00c1\u00f1ez swiftly reestablished diplomatic ties with the United States and Israel, with whom Morales had had strained relations. Clutching a giant Bible, \u00c1\u00f1ez declared, \u201cThe Bible has returned to the government,\u201d as she paraded through the government headquarters. Soldiers were filmed burning the Wiphala flag, representing highland indigenous peoples, signifying a new turn against the decolonizing policies of the state. A frenzied crackdown on leftists ensued as the coup government issued arrest warrants against journalists and MAS-supporting politicians. A year later, Bolivia\u2019s left-wing party, the MAS, staged a stunning political comeback. It came after campesinos, indigenous groups, and the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), Bolivia\u2019s major trade union federation, brought the country to a standstill by forming roadblocks to demand that the dictatorship government hold elections. Faced with the insurgent popular forces, the government buckled. In the elections that followed, the MAS swept to power in a landslide, repudiating the neoliberal and racist policies initiated by Bolivia\u2019s elites. Those elites remain, nonetheless, active and powerful.\n\nDissecting the Right In a recent article in Nueva Sociedad , Crist\u00f3bal Rovira argues that as in Europe, far-right political projects are on the rise everywhere in Latin America. In the 2019 coup in Bolivia, two key strands of right-wing mobilization emerged, the newest being the self-styled pititas \u2014 urban, young, middle-class protesters. Some were students at the universities in La Paz, such as the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s (UMSA), whose then rector, Waldo Albarrac\u00edn, was a longtime critic of the MAS. Their modus operandi was the formation of makeshift string barricades in the streets. They shared memes likening Bolivia to a dictatorship, and their protest chants decried Morales\u2019s \u201ccommunism\u201d and compared Bolivia to that old bogeyman, Venezuela. The pititas were joined by a more dangerous element: the ultraright concentrated in the wealthy eastern region of Santa Cruz with ties to Brazilian fascists and Washington, DC. This faction coalesced around Camacho, who went on to become governor of Santa Cruz in the 2021 regional elections. His old organization, the UJC, launched a campaign of terror in Santa Cruz in the wake of the coup, setting off bombs outside the headquarters of the local peasant union. The coup of 2019 was a catastrophic attack on Bolivian democracy. The formation of the UJC in 1957 is linked to the arrival in Bolivia of German Nazis who fled Europe after World War II. In recent decades, it has functioned as a kind of paramilitary group protecting the interests of loggers and agribusinesses. It seeks to establish an autonomous Santa Cruz state, and it uses racist rhetoric to castigate the highland indigenous \u201csavages\u201d associated with the national government. The far right also exploits the long-standing cultural divisions between the eastern and western regions, the Andean highlands and the lowlands, respectively. Until the mid-twentieth century, the city of Santa Cruz was an isolated backwater, presided over by white elites who viciously exploited the small and dispersed indigenous populations who lived in the wider region. The discovery of oil and gas deposits in the 1960s generated huge economic growth. Today Santa Cruz is the powerhouse of Bolivia, fueled in the past two decades by the expansion of the agricultural frontier for soy production, logging, and livestock, which are devastating the biodiverse landscapes and usurping indigenous territory. In these eastern territories, vast tracts of land are still owned by a small wealthy elite, many of them having acquired the land during the dictatorships of the 1970s and \u201980s. One of these landowners is Branko Marinkovic, the openly fascist descendant of wealthy Croatian immigrants, who, as minister of economy and public finance under \u00c1\u00f1ez, was rewarded with 34,000 hectares of land. In 2008, Marinkovic was arrested and went into exile in the United States and, subsequently, Brazil after orchestrating an assassination attempt against President Evo Morales. Cruce\u00f1o elites \u2014 those associated with the Comit\u00e9 Pro Santa Cruz \u2014 have fashioned an identity as cambas to refer to their lowland identity, which they juxtapose with the racialized and often pejorative term collas, meaning highland indigenous peoples. They are well integrated with the far right regionally. Marinkovic, for example, is a close associate of Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president; earlier this year, he was detained at Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires, where he was on his way to meet Argentina\u2019s libertarian president, Javier Milei, for dinner. Unlike the right-wing supporters of Milei and Bolsonaro, who were able to win national power at the ballot box, the ultraright in Bolivia remains heavily concentrated in the east of the country and has not yet been able to court wider support translating into electoral success nationally. In June 2022, \u00c1\u00f1ez was sentenced to ten years in prison for her role in the coup, and that December, Camacho was kept in preventive detention on charges of terrorism and embezzlement of funds. Despite their imprisonment and relative marginality, however, the forces that brought these two figures to prominence remain significant.\n\nDefending Democracy The ill-fated coup attempt of June 26, 2024, showcased the commitment of Bolivian movements to resisting threats to democracy. Troops led by an aggrieved army general sent a tank into the presidential palace in La Paz in what many feared was an effort by the military to seize power in the context of an ongoing internal conflict within the MAS. General Juan Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga demanded the release of A\u00f1ez and Camacho. Although the \u201ccoup\u201d fizzled out of its own accord within a few hours, Bolivia\u2019s social movements immediately rushed to take a stand. \u201cWe will take to the streets. We will defend democracy!\u201d declared Guillermina Kuno, an Aymara leader of the Bartolina Sisas, Bolivia\u2019s national union of indigenous peasant women, at a press conference. Social movements flooded Plaza Murillo in a show of strength against military interference. Unlike the right-wing supporters of Milei and Bolsonaro, who were able to win power at the ballot box, the ultraright in Bolivia has not yet been able to court wider support translating into electoral success nationally. The incident nonetheless bodes ill for a country still reeling from the 2019 coup. It certainly would not be the first time that military leaders had subverted democratic rule in Bolivia. Amid a litany of military coups, one of the most tragic in recent history was the putsch led by Luis Garc\u00eda Meza in 1980. Troops entered the headquarters of the trade union federation and kidnapped socialist party leader Marcelo Quiroga, who was tortured and killed. As a result, almost the entirety of the labor movement leadership was forced into exile. In the late 1970s and \u201980s, the peasant movement was a fierce defender of democracy in Bolivia in the face of authoritarian regimes. The MAS has its early origins in the mobilizing strategy of that peasant movement. It first came to power in 2005 under Morales, on the back of a cycle of uprisings between 2000 and 2004 led by peasants, miners, workers, and indigenous groups against the privatization of the country\u2019s resources and other neoliberal policies. With revenues from the newly nationalized oil and gas industries in the late 2000s, the economy boomed, and inequality reduced drastically. Social spending transformed the lives of the poor people, workers, indigenous communities, and women. In a country marked by deep racial discrimination against indigenous peoples, the state newly proclaimed the importance of indigenous languages and ways of living."

You know how it goes, we will absolutely bring up some conspiracies in our conversations and online as we already tend to be pretty wary of things. And now, even one of the biggest Black politicians in the country is stating his concern about drones, which makes matters even more worrisome. Naturally, the conversation has taken to social media with their ideas regarding the origin and meaning of these large, mysterious drones that are reportedly 6 feet in size, per AP News.\n\nOne user on X, formerly known as Twitter, echoes what many are feeling, writing that in their opinion there are two options when it comes to these drones, that \u201cthey really don\u2019t know what they are and, therefore, our air defense is extraordinarily weak,\u201d or \u201cthey know what they are but can\u2019t say.\u201d They added, \u201cNot sure which is crazier.\u201d\n\nThe same user also gave \u201ctin foil\u201d takes, that either the drones are aliens (classic) or that they are our government themselves.\n\nThe mysterious drones over Jersey.\n\n\n\n1. They really don\u2019t know what they are and, therefore, our air defense is extraordinarily weak; or\n\n\n\n2. They know what they are but can\u2019t say.\n\n\n\nNot sure which is crazier. \u2014 kyle alex brett (@kyalbr) December 13, 2024\n\nMy tin foil take.\n\n\n\n1. The drones belong to aliens who live under the ocean and they\u2019re intimidating our top secret government to stop the government from doing something; or\n\n\n\n2. It\u2019s our top secret government looking for something that has been stolen and emits a faint trace. \u2014 kyle alex brett (@kyalbr) December 14, 2024\n\nThe fact that the government seems to be just as much in the dark as we are certainly doesn\u2019t help matters either! We have gotten little confirmation from federal government officials in the days since the sightings increased. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said that they have \u201cno evidence\u201d that the drones are from an adversary or a foreign entity. She also said that the drones are \u201cnot U.S. military drones.\u201d Again, still not making any of us feel better!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\ntiktok-7447530870233222442\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee also addressed concerns over the drones with the FBI in a now-viral TikTok from CBS News, with a representative confirming that they are \u201cactively\u201d investigating but they \u201cdon\u2019t have an answer\u201d for who is responsible. Again, the lack of answers has only led to more speculation, as seen in the comments of the Tiktok alone.\n\ntiktok-7447237219506474282\n\nAs ABC News has reported, the rise in conspiracy theories surrounding drones has even led to a massive Facebook page. Titled New Jersey Mystery Drones \u2014 let\u2019s solve it, the page has nearly 44,000 members as of Friday. On the page, theories are able to run wild as residents share their video footage, photos and sightings, while also offering their own suggestions for how to handle the situation, with some even suggesting shooting them down themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Senator Booker shared when shooting them down was suggested, he explained, \u201cSafety first. You\u2019re over populous neighborhoods and areas,\u201d while adding that Jersey is the most densely populated state in America.\u201d He added, \u201cThe most important thing right now is the safety and security of our communities.\u201d\n\nOf course, along with the conspiracy theories, has come some levity on the internet as well, with some just marveling over the situation in general. One user on X took a little jab at the state of Jersey, writing, \u201cAlien 1: You know where we should go next? Alien 2: Where? Alien 1: New Jersey.\u201d Another shared the same sentiment, writing, \u201cOf course the alien invasion would start in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nAlien 1: You know where we should go next?\n\n\n\nAlien 2: Where?\n\n\n\nAlien 1: New Jersey. \u2014 Alex Cole (@acnewsitics) December 14, 2024\n\nOf course the alien invasion would start in New Jersey \u2014 Cydel (@cydelmg) December 14, 2024\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

            "article_content": "Dark matter, an enigmatic and invisible substance that constitutes approximately 85% of the mass in the universe, remains one of the most compelling mysteries in modern physics.\n\nDespite its widespread presence in the cosmos, dark matter has never been directly detected by traditional methods such as electromagnetic radiation. Instead, it is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nSingularities, on the other hand, are points in spacetime where gravitational forces become infinitely strong, and our current understanding of physics breaks down.\n\nThis essay will explore the potential connection between dark matter and singularities, analyzing how dark matter might behave in such extreme environments.\n\nSingularities are predicted to exist at the centers of black holes, where gravity becomes so intense that spacetime curves infinitely. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, a singularity is a region where matter is compressed to a point of zero volume, causing infinite density. This concept is tied to the formation of black holes, which are born when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles. While general relativity predicts the existence of singularities, it also signals a breakdown in the laws of physics at such points. The classical equations cannot account for the extreme conditions near a singularity, which is why quantum mechanics is thought to be crucial for understanding what happens there.\n\nThe study of dark matter is a parallel mystery. While the gravitational effects of dark matter have been observed on galactic scales, its composition remains unknown. Dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic forces, making it invisible and undetectable by conventional means. However, scientists have theorized that it might consist of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or other exotic particles. These particles, despite their elusive nature, are thought to contribute to the formation of galaxies and the overall structure of the universe by exerting gravitational influence on ordinary matter. At the interface of dark matter and black holes, particularly within the singularities of black holes, the behavior of dark matter becomes a subject of intense speculation.\n\nSingularities are regions of infinite density, where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape. The extreme conditions near a black hole's event horizon could alter the way dark matter behaves. One possibility is that dark matter may be trapped within black holes, contributing to their mass. While conventional matter is thought to collapse to a singularity within a black hole, dark matter may not behave in exactly the same way due to its weak interactions with other forces. Its interactions with the intense gravitational field near a black hole could be governed by entirely different physical laws than those that apply to regular matter.\n\nRecent research into the behavior of dark matter in strong gravitational fields has led to theories suggesting that dark matter may cluster in the vicinity of black holes, forming what are called \"dark matter halos.\" These halos could influence the dynamics of black hole formation, growth and even the eventual structure of singularities.\n\nSome physicists propose that dark matter could form a dense, non-collapsing region at the core of a black hole, potentially preventing the full collapse to a singularity. This would imply that black holes might have a core made of dark matter, which could affect the properties of the black hole, such as its spin and charge.\n\nAnother area of interest is the potential for dark matter to affect the behavior of singularities in the context of quantum gravity. Quantum gravity seeks to reconcile the principles of general relativity with quantum mechanics, and it has been suggested that dark matter could play a crucial role in this unification. In particular, dark matter\u2019s weak interactions with electromagnetic forces and its potential quantum properties could lead to phenomena that are not predictable by classical general relativity.\n\nSome hypotheses suggest that the presence of dark matter within a singularity could alter the formation of spacetime singularities themselves, potentially eliminating them or replacing them with quantum objects such as Planck stars, which are thought to be quantum gravitational remnants of collapsed stars.\n\nFurther investigation into the behavior of dark matter in singularities could also provide insights into the so-called information paradox, which arises from the fact that information about matter that falls into a black hole seems to be lost forever, violating the principles of quantum mechanics. Some theorists speculate that dark matter might offer a clue to solving this paradox. If dark matter behaves differently inside a black hole, it could have a unique relationship with the information that falls into a black hole, possibly preserving it in a form that escapes the current understanding of physics. Moreover, the interaction of dark matter with black hole event horizons is a critical factor in our understanding of both. The event horizon marks the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape a black hole's gravitational pull.\n\nRecent studies suggest that dark matter may play a role in the formation or modification of this boundary. As dark matter accumulates around a black hole, it could influence the accretion disk's properties and potentially alter the dynamics of the event horizon. The interaction between dark matter and the event horizon might also lead to new models of black hole thermodynamics and quantum effects near the horizon.\n\nIn conclusion, while much remains unknown, the intersection of dark matter and black hole singularities presents an exciting frontier in modern physics. The extreme conditions near singularities challenge our current understanding of the laws of nature, and the potential role of dark matter in these environments could offer insights into both the nature of dark matter itself and the future of quantum gravity.\n\nContinued research into the behavior of dark matter in these regions may help unlock the mysteries of black holes, singularities and the fundamental structure of the universe. As our understanding of both dark matter and singularities evolves, so too will our ability to answer some of the most profound questions in cosmology and fundamental and theoretical physics. According to Linkedin, \u201cDespite their elusiveness, dark matter particles could significantly impact our bodies. They might influence cell division, blood circulation, even our brain functioning.\u201d\n\nAll in all, while dark matter remains strange and elusive, it remains tremendously important to our understanding of nature, from the most fundamental particles to origins and evolution of the universe.\n\n***\n\nReferences: Science-101' Astronomy & Astrophysics; NASA Science.gov; Home CERN; Space.com; Center for Astrophysics| Harvard & Smithsonian; Astronomy Magazine\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMichael Tucker is a sixth grader at River City Middle School.

Addressing the teachers at his official residence, Mann lauded their successful training in Finland and emphasized the critical role they play in building a strong foundation for the nation\u2019s future.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day for Punjab as our teachers return equipped with world-class expertise,\u201d said the Chief Minister, urging the teachers to serve as role models, imparting skills and knowledge that would allow students to compete with their peers from private schools. The Chief Minister highlighted that the state\u2019s initiative to send 72 primary teachers for advanced training in Finland was not just a trip but a mission to overhaul the education system.\n\n\n\nMann elaborated on why Finland was chosen for this program, citing its globally acclaimed education system. \u201cThe training has provided our teachers with innovative techniques and best practices that will not only enhance their teaching abilities but also bring a much-needed boost to our education sector,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nThe program is aimed at broadening the professional skills of teachers, fostering leadership qualities, and equipping them with advanced pedagogical tools.\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister emphasized that the enriched expertise of these educators would empower government school students to excel academically and socially. \u201cThis initiative will enable the creation of an education system that nurtures every child's potential,\u201d Mann asserted.\n\n\n\nMann called the Finland training program a \u201cred-letter day\u201d in Punjab\u2019s history. He expressed confidence that such initiatives would help Punjab become a frontrunner in education. \u201cThis training will act as a seed, growing into a tree of knowledge that benefits not just individuals but entire communities,\u201d he envisioned.\n\n\n\nTo further support these efforts, Mann announced plans for creating platforms where Finland-trained teachers could share their experiences and expertise with colleagues, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. He encouraged teachers to take pride in their transformative role, adding, \u201cEducation is the most powerful tool for progress, and you hold the keys to unlocking our state\u2019s potential.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister also underscored the importance of aligning students\u2019 academic paths with their interests rather than societal pressures. He urged parents and teachers to nurture children\u2019s individual strengths, allowing them to achieve their aspirations.\n\n\n\nAdding an exciting dimension to the occasion, Education Minister Harjot Singh Bains announced upcoming student visits to premier institutions like the Indian Institute of Science and Google\u2019s headquarters. \u201cThis will provide students with valuable exposure to cutting-edge technologies and inspire them to dream big,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nTeachers Laud Initiative, Share Experiences\n\nEquipped with innovative methodologies, the delegation of 72 educators \u2014 including BPEOs, CHTs, HTs, and primary teachers \u2014 shared their transformative experiences.\n\n\n\nManmeet Singh, a teacher from Ludhiana, reflected on how Finland\u2019s playful learning techniques replaced their reliance on traditional methods. \u201cWe\u2019ve started sharing these techniques with fellow educators, and the results are promising,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBathinda\u2019s Daljit Singh recalled praise from Finnish trainer Cristina, who applauded Punjab\u2019s initiative. \u201cHer encouragement inspired us to share our experiences with local communities, bringing renewed energy to our teaching,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Talwara\u2019s Amrinderpal Singh Dhillon emphasized how the training instilled a profound sense of responsibility among the participants. \u201cThis visionary program will drive grassroots change in education,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBaljit Kaur Parmar, a primary teacher from Fatehgarh Sahib, expressed how the experience boosted her confidence. \u201cI feel equipped to contribute more effectively, both inside and outside the classroom,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nEducators were especially impressed by Finland\u2019s emphasis on practical education. Anoop Singh Maini from Tarn Taran highlighted, \u201cThe Finnish system focuses on practical learning alongside academics, a model we aspire to replicate in Punjab.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCERT director Amaninder Kaur Brar emphasized the need for integrating practical tools into classrooms, such as carpentry workshops, to provide hands-on learning experiences. \u201cThis approach will ensure students apply theoretical knowledge effectively,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nSeveral teachers acknowledged the psychological benefits of the training. Hoshiarpur\u2019s Vandana Heen said: \u201cIt was a joyful learning experience that encouraged us to rethink our teaching practices.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers, like Nirmaljeet Kaur of Tarn Taran, highlighted Finland\u2019s unique approach to time management and moral education. \u201cThese lessons will prove invaluable as we apply them in our schools,\u201d she shared.\n\n"
