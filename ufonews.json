        "article_content": "For decades, the question of whether UFOs were \"real\" was considered the province of tinfoil-hat nutters and TV shows like Unsolved Mysteries. In recent years, we've seen the topic taken far more seriously, even at the highest levels of our government. So, we're rounding up some evidence to examine whether UFOs are real and what it might mean if they are.\n\nWe'll start with an overview of how we investigate UFO reports and then touch on the significant formative events that shaped American thought on UFOs. We'll also consider reports that turned out not to be aliens or UFOs and look back at modern American war history for insight into why UFOs are so hard to identify. Finally, we'll discuss an unsolved modern UAP* mystery.\n\n*Many professionals in the field have switched from calling them \"UFOs\" to \"UAPs\": Unexplained Aerial Phenomena. In this article, we'll use the more common term UFO.\n\nHow Do We Investigate UFOs?\n\nWe have a vast array of techniques to examine the evidence from UFO reports.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThroughout the 20th century, folks have used the newest technology available, trying to substantiate\u2014or dismiss\u2014reports of visitors from beyond. Scientists can use mass spectrometers and X-ray crystallography to explore exactly what a piece of debris is made of, right down to the isotope. High-powered microscopes can find and identify tool marks on things tampered with. We can use multi-spectral imaging to take snapshots of electromagnetic fields and radiation, from the radio band to X-rays. Sophisticated imaging programs can find the faintest traces in terrain and even on solid stone, like how we've discovered petroglyphs nearly undetectable to the naked eye. And with the growing global constellation of satellites, more and more of the Earth's surface is constantly under observation.\n\nAs our equipment improves, more UFO reports roll in\u2014along with the data we'll need to understand what's happening.\n\nIn another sense, our government takes UFO reports seriously enough that Congress funds an office to investigate them. From 1947-1969, the US Air Force monitored UFO reports under its Project Blue Book. In 2022, the Pentagon established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to nail down explanations for the \"weird shit,\" including UFOs or other strange phenomena reported by the military. Under that aegis are objects in the sea and sky and \"transmedium\" objects and phenomena.\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, director of the AARO, told NPR, \"We are structuring our analysis to be very thorough and rigorous. We will go through it all. And as a physicist, I have to adhere to the scientific method, and I will follow that data and science wherever it goes.\"\n\nAmazing Stories: A Brief History of UFO Reports\n\nAmericans report more UFOs than any other country, by orders of magnitude. This suggests that there's something unique to American culture, something that draws our attention to the idea of visitors from another world.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSci-fi luminaries like Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Hugo Gernsback, Robert Heinlein, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells cast a long and beautiful shadow across the American imagination. Gernsback founded Amazing Stories, the first magazine devoted to publishing science fiction, in 1926 and coined the term \"science fiction\" itself in 1929. And once the Golden Age of science fiction had begun, tropes from the genre spread throughout our culture and took on a life of their own.\n\nSince then, ideas from science fiction have become science facts. A real-life astronaut can play a Starfleet ensign on TV. The International Space Station has Wi-Fi. Wireless information transfer via invisible light waves has been powering this brave new world all along.\n\n'War of the Worlds' Radio Broadcast\n\nWhen Orson Welles signed up to do a radio reprise of H. G. Wells's War of the Worlds, he wasn't expecting to set off a nationwide wave of media hysteria, much less to spark an entire UFO enthusiast counterculture. Welles' CBS radio show, Mercury Theatre on the Air, was on a shoestring budget, so much that the show mainly broadcast readings of literary classics. But for Halloween 1938, Welles and his producers intended to air a two-segment, two-hour reading of War of the Worlds, dramatized to give listeners a bit of a spook. As written, the first part was fake news bulletins from Mars, and the second was to be a monologue delivered by Welles himself, in the persona of a survivor of the Mars attacks.\n\n\u201cI had conceived the idea of doing a radio broadcast in such a manner that a crisis would actually seem to be happening,\u201d Welles explained in a 1964 deposition, \u201cand would be broadcast in such a dramatized form as to appear to be a real event taking place at that time, rather than a mere radio play.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo compensate for their lack of funding, Welles' voice actors and sound effect artists injected emotion, trying to make their fear believable. The studio even cast Kenneth Delmar, who could do a perfect impression of Franklin D. Roosevelt. But by the end of October, deadlines and budget constraints had forced Welles to mostly abandon the monologue segment. Welles and the radio station were scrambling to get the program broadcasting correctly and on time, right up to the moment the ON AIR sign blinked on\u2014and in their haste, they neglected to run the station's usual call-sign break on the half-hour. The show was an \"unmitigated disaster,\" and Welles later commented, \"If I'd planned to wreck my career, I couldn't have gone about it better.\" His studio called the show insufferably dull, saying it would put listeners to sleep. After the show, Welles just walked home and went to bed.\n\nInstead of putting the audience to sleep, though, the radio show was believably spooky enough that police and emergency services began to receive calls from listeners who thought the invasion was real. Journalists caught wind of the calls, \"boosted the signal,\" and by the next morning, Welles found his face and name splashed across the front page of newspapers from coast to coast. Eventually, he ended up having to explain himself in front of Congress.\n\nRoswell and the 1947 Flying Disc Craze\n\nIn the summer of '47, less than ten years after the War of the Worlds debacle, debris from what appeared to be a \"flying saucer\" fell out of the sky onto the land of an unassuming rancher from New Mexico. As news of the incident spread, theories emerged about the debris's origin. It appeared to be of intelligent manufacture, but on a technological level far superior to anything we had at the time\u2014giving rise to the idea that it was the wreckage of a starship piloted by intelligent extraterrestrials.\n\nThe US military eventually explained that the \"bright wreckage, made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks\" came from a crashed surveillance device meant to listen in on Soviet atomic tests\u2014disguised as a weather balloon. Far from a visiting extraterrestrial, the Roswell incident exposed America's covert surveillance of the USSR during the Cold War. Little wonder military spokespeople and spin doctors were slow to respond and not forthcoming with details.\n\nMajor Jesse Marcel posing with debris, July 8, 1947.\n\nMajor Jesse Marcel posing with debris from Roswell, July 8, 1947.

In the following weeks, hundreds to thousands of \"copycat\" reports flooded newspaper offices and police stations, describing crashed spaceships, flying saucers, and alien abductions. An actual invasion would scarcely have produced more of a reaction. Naturally, tabloids like the Weekly World News had a field day. Eager to get in on the new gold rush, news outlets published ads for \"relics\" supposedly of aliens or crashed spaceships, and descriptions of alien abductions that the abductee could only remember during dodgy hypnosis treatments. The Roswell incident has been described as \"the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim.\"\n\nRoswell being debunked, however, didn't stop generations of entrepreneurs from using UFO reports and imagery to make a buck. For example, the Alien Autopsy film was initially broadcast in a Fox special hosted by none other than Star Trek: The Next Generation's Jonathan Frakes. (He also hosted Ripley's Believe it or Not.) Star power and a layer of post-processing polish lent the film an air of credibility. The 17-minute fauxtopsy was supposedly recovered in the aftermath of the 1947 Roswell alien crash, but the film's owner, Ray Santilli, eventually acknowledged that the work was a fraud. Santilli claimed that he had personally seen the real footage in 1992 but that it had decayed due to heat and humidity by 1996, when he actually bought it. The footage aired by Fox was a \"recreation\" of what Santilli initially saw. The mystery cameraman who supposedly filmed the footage during the original autopsy was an unknown homeless person.\n\nIf you remember anything about the original broadcast, this will probably come as no surprise. Even at the time, the alien on the table looked less like a being from another world and more like a dollar-store version of the little gray men first popularized by the Barney and Betty Hill abduction reports of the early 1960s. This type of hoax has a long history; a \"mermaid\" skeleton that startled and awed many sailors in the 1800s was a clever construction of clay, leather, and the skeleton of what appears to be a small primate.\n\n20th Century Stealth Tech\n\nSo why are UFOs so tough to identify or explain? One reason they might confound both the human eye and sophisticated radar imaging is that they're literally designed to baffle observers. In 2023, American pilots shot down several flying objects that turned out to be Chinese passive surveillance devices\u2014disguised as weather balloons. After some uncomfortable coughing and shuffling from Washington, military brass admitted that American intelligence does the same type of surveillance via cleverly designed flying objects.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEven before Roswell, this type of surveillance obfuscation had precedent. During World War I, the UK and the US adopted \"dazzle camouflage\" to confuse German U-boats. The goal was not to hide\u2014painting something with giant high-contrast stripes is generally a poor way of doing that\u2014but to make it more difficult for the Germans to accurately gauge an Allied vessel's heading, range, and speed. Dazzle camouflage was also used in a limited fashion during WW2, though improvements in rangefinding and the advent of radar made it less effective than it may have been 25 years earlier.\n\nAn artistic impression of dazzle camouflage, showing how it could confuse the viewer.\n\nAn artistic impression of dazzle camouflage, showing how it could confuse the viewer. Credit: Encyclopedia Britannica, 1922.\n\nSo-called \"stealth\" technology has replaced dazzle paint schemes in the modern era, but the emphasis on making it difficult for an enemy to tell precisely what they're looking at has never gone away. The Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyers use a tumblehome hull and a deckhouse made from composite materials to reduce the vessel's radar return. According to the US Navy, the Zumwalt class is 50x harder to spot via radar return than an older Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, with a signature more akin to a fishing boat than a 15,000+-ton warship.\n\nWhile most UFO reports rely on visual phenomena, there have been a handful of incidents in which radar returns corroborated the existence of something. Picking up an unknown signal on radar supports the idea of a \"real\" event, but it doesn't preclude a terrestrial origin. Stealth aircraft designs don't typically try to make an aircraft invisible to radar; instead, they try to drastically minimize what ground-based radar does detect. For example, the B-2 reportedly has the radar cross-section of a goose.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHumans can be remarkably ingenious when making one thing look like something else. One of the problems with trying to pin the tail on a particular alien donkey is that we can't be sure we aren't looking at a clever strategy from a known adversary. However, as in the case of HAARP and that infamous sky spiral, sometimes it turns out that we're unknowingly confusing ourselves.\n\nHAARP, SpaceX, and Spirals in the Sky\n\nEarly in the morning of December 10, 2009, observers in Norway were astonished to see a brilliant, spreading spiral in the night sky. Eventually, the spiral began to disappear from the inside out.\n\n2009 Norway spiral anomaly\n\nCredit: Jan Petter J\u00f8rgensen via Vaeret\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, Russian space agency Roscosmos explained that the expanding spiral resulted from a failed Bulava ICBM test. A malfunctioning third-stage nozzle left the rocket body spinning out of control, spraying a fuel cloud into the sky as it went.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen seen head-on, the fuel cloud looks like a gigantic spiral, slowly expanding in the sky. The blue streak is caused by the damaged nozzle, which was pointing out to the side of the rocket body, and the viewer's perspective.\n\nAs we launch more and more rockets, this phenomenon of spirals in the sky has become much better understood. SpaceX launches, in particular, often result in a plume of fuel ejected in a spiraling pattern as the rocket moves through the air. But the company conducts so many launches that sightings of these aerial spirals are becoming commonplace.\n\nAfter that spiral appeared in the Norwegian sky in 2009, a frisson of commentary spread across the Web, blaming HAARP for the spiral and an enormous list of other problems\u2014some much more plausible than others. HAARP (the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program) is a former US Air Force atmospheric research program in Alaska that catches a lot of conspiracy-theorist flak. Among other things, it has been suggested that HAARP can influence the weather, even at a distance\u2014so when the 2009 spiral showed up above the Arctic circle, questions started to fly. It wasn't responsible for the spiral, but HAARP can use \"spooky action at a distance\" to create aurorae and other effects in the atmosphere, which can be visible to the naked eye. Here, the truth is easily as cool as the conspiracy theory.\n\nHAARP uses a powerful radio antenna to bounce radio waves off the ionosphere. For comparison, the FCC requires a broadcasting license to use antennas greater than five watts. HAARP dumps a cool 3.6 megawatts off the end of its antenna. That much energy can drive a radio signal to the bottom of the sea, enough to enable communication with submarines at depth. It's also sufficient to light up the sky with \"optical bullseye patterns,\" scintillating points of light, or the same otherworldly glow we see during a solar storm that causes the aurora borealis. And all of this comes from just one or two percent of the energy released by a flash of positive lightning.\n\nUSS Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe phenomena we've discussed here all unravel under scrutiny. And it's easy to dismiss a sighting as a \"trick of the light,\" especially when it's just one camera, person, and observer. But in 2017, the New York Times published reports by American military personnel of UFOs in progress that defied explanation so far.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt started in 2004 when two pilots from the USS Nimitz investigated a \"possible target\" off the coast of southern California. One captured a video with the plane's infrared camera, termed \"Tic Tac\" or \"FLIR.\"\n\nTen years later, fighter pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group recorded two more videos, later called \"GIMBAL\" and \"GOFAST.\" In late 2014, a Super Hornet squadron from the Theodore Roosevelt filed an official incident report after a \"near collision\" with an object of some kind while flying in formation. Investigation revealed that Navy pilots from the carrier group had reported seeing strange flying objects almost every day for months while operating off the US East Coast. Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot, and Lt. Danny Acoin of the same squadron told reporters that they and others of their squadron had seen strange flying objects on their instruments for months before picking them up on visual.\n\nGraves and four other Navy pilots, including Lt. Accoin, spoke to the New York Times, and Graves testified before Congress. \"These things would be out there all day,\" said Lt. Graves. \"Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we'd expect.\"\n\nNavy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told the New York Times in 2019 that pilots now operate under new, classified guidance on reporting UFOs. A few months later, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. None of the pilots from the Theodore Roosevelt are willing to speculate about what they might have seen. Lt. Accoin commented, \"We're here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2021, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a preliminary report on UFOs. Now, the ODNI releases a new UFO report each year. You can find a declassified version of the 2022 report here.\n\nWe've found rocks great and small of extraterrestrial, interplanetary, and even interstellar origins. Rocks from Mars found their way to Antarctica. And in 2017, the same year The New York Times first published the videos from the USS Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt, 'Oumuamua appeared in the sky at a speed and angle so far out of the ecliptic that it must have come from somewhere beyond our solar system. So it's clear Earth can receive visitors from beyond the tiny, quivering bubble of our unremarkable star's solar wind. Despite decades and decades of committed and invested research, there still exists no coherent or credible evidence available to mere mortals that any UFO sighting has documented a visit from actual little green men\u2014or in the parlance of Roswell aficionados, a close encounter of any kind.\n\nWhat we do have is an abundance of evidence for two things. First, the US government and military do engage in covert, classified research and surveillance while also being righteously shitty at cover-ups. Like, reprehensibly bad. Naturally, some folks don't buy the official explanations: once deceived, twice skeptical.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that frauds, hoaxsters, and charlatans are scavenger predator species that flourish (only at others' expense) in most terrestrial and rhetorical environments. They rely on the innate sense of wonder and curiosity to ensnare their prey. No less than L. Ron Hubbard himself used the promise of redemption via sci-fi concepts like flying saucers and intelligent life on other planets to attract the credulous and enrich the few.\n\nSo, Are UFO Sightings Real, Or Not?\n\nWhere does this leave us, with respect to the Big Question of whether UFOs are real?\n\nAs of 2023, the ODNI UFO summary states that out of a total of 510 cases on its radar, it can confidently attribute 191\u2014less than 40% of reported sightings. In 2021 alone, 366 new reports came in.\n\nThese reports are \"real\" in that they were observed; the people reporting them were telling the unvarnished truth; multiple lines of evidence, such as video from multiple angles, substantiate the reports. That seems to be the case for many such reports. The sighting is often unequivocally real, not a story or fabrication. But the sighting, in and of itself, isn't enough evidence to prove that a UFO is of extraterrestrial origin. That doesn't mean UFOs aren't real; it just means the jury's still out.\n\nThe universe is a very big place. In its incomprehensible vastness, the odds of our existence round to zero. And yet, we are here, which makes the probability of our existence 100%. It seems like the height of arrogance to imagine we're the only intelligent life in the universe.\n\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\u2014and as of this writing, despite tens of thousands of UFO reports, there simply is no conclusive evidence that Earth has ever received visitors from an intelligent extraterrestrial species. But if you accept the idea that all things have an explanation, even if we don't have it yet, the study of UFOs and UAPs starts to look more like a problem for better imaging and AI, and less like the province of fools. Throw more and more photons and pixels at the issue, and eventually, we can shove outward the perimeter of human understanding. It's only a matter of time."

        "article_content": "Over the last two years, Congressional hearings on UFOs have introduced new terms to the popular vernacular. From hearings on Navy pilots who spotted a \u201cTic-Tac\u201d UFO in 2004, we got the term \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d (UAP). Then reports of strange objects hovering above the ocean gave us \u201cUnidentified Submerged Objects\u201d (USOs).\n\nNow, believers and skeptics alike can add another new bit of vocabulary to the debate around these bizarre happenings, which may tie them all together: \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nDuring last week\u2019s UAP hearings on Capitol Hill, multiple witnesses described the elaborately named program as an alleged information-gathering and evidence-retrieval program conducted by the Pentagon without Congressional oversight. The Immaculate Constellation program, they say, has been withholding a treasure trove of high-resolution images and other data about UAP sightings from the public for decades.\n\nThe November 13 hearings followed up on the June 2023 Congressional event in which retired Navy Comm. David Fravor and fellow pilot Lt. Comm. Alex Dietrich described how their F/A-18 Hornets spotted and chased a white \u201cTic-Tac\u201d-shaped UAP for several minutes. According to analysis of radar tracks and grainy infrared video shot by the F/A-18s, the object displayed speeds of more than 45,000 miles per hour and pulled more than 2,000 Gs.\n\nJump ahead to 2024, and a new crop of believers have come forward about the function of Immaculate Constellation\u2014gathering reports of major UAP sightings and possible encounters; investigating possible crash or landing sites; and gathering physical UAP evidence, biological material, or technology.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information\u2014still photos, video photos, other sensor information\u2014and they have for a very long time,\u201d said journalist Michael Shellenberger, one of the witnesses at the November 13 hearing. Meanwhile, the public has only ever seen fuzzy photos of some of those incidents.\n\nShellenberger delivered an 11-page report to Congress during the hearing, detailing claims about Immaculate Constellation; he says a current or former official and UAP whistleblower authored the report.\n\nThe November testimony lineup also included one-time Air Force Intelligence officer David Grusch\u2014who claimed during a prior hearing last summer that crashed UAPs had not only been recovered and studied for reverse-engineering, but that \u201cnon-human biologics\u201d had also been discovered inside\u2014and Lue Elizondo, who formerly headed the Pentagon\u2019s secretive UFO unit.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: UAP are real,\u201d Elizondo said in his opening testimony. \u201cAdvanced technologies not made by our government\u2014or any other government\u2014are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. Furthermore, the U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries.\u201d Elizondo says it all adds up to a \u201cmultidecade, secretive arms race.\u201d\n\nHowever, skeptics point to the fact that none of the assembled witnesses presented anything by way of physical evidence or direct testimony from the witnesses or whistleblowers referenced. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough stated the Pentagon denies the existence of such a program, while representatives of the U.S. Government agency AARO (All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office) continue to claim there is no evidence that UAPs are alien in nature.\n\nAvi Loeb, Ph.D.\u2014a physicist and professor at Harvard University who heads the Galileo Project, which seeks out alien intelligence or artifacts\u2014acknowledges the possibility of Immaculate Constellation, but highlighted the lack of any real proof. \u201cAll we have seen is written text,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cNo credible scientific evidence was made public.\u201d\n\nLoeb says his firm belief is that all major nations have programs to \u201cimage or retrieve relics from crash sites.\u201d However, he insists the purpose of such programs is to learn about technologies developed by adversarial nations and manage reverse-engineering efforts to reproduce such technologies.\n\n\u201cThere might also be biologics in such crash sites if the equipment carried pilots,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fundamental question is whether some of the data collected by these programs indicates an extraterrestrial technological origin. If such data exists, I would love to see it and help the Department of Defense or the Intelligence agencies figure out what it means.\u201d\n\nLoeb generally questions the usefulness of the ongoing series of congressional hearings, stressing that it is unlikely any meaningful admissions will come from the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe Galileo Project Observatory at Harvard University released its first commissioning data on half a million objects that it monitored in the sky over five months,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cWe also retrieved materials from the crash site of the first interstellar meteor in the Pacific Ocean.\u201d\n\nLoeb promises his team will openly share with the public any data they collect and any discoveries they make.\n\n\u201cThis standard scientific practice is far more informative than political maneuvers aimed to disclose classified information from stubborn government agencies,\u201d he says. \u201cA robust answer to Enrico Fermi\u2019s old question of \u2018where is everybody?\u2019 will originate from scientists\u2014not from politicians or journalists.\u201d"

It\u2019s a loaded question, to be sure, and one that elicits a strong response in certain people.\n\nSome people couldn\u2019t care less. Others gobble up any Area 51 factoid they can find.

It\u2019s often referred to as the Kinross Incident, and it happened here in Michigan.\n\nWATCHING THE SKIES\n\nSome of the remains of the Kincheloe Air Force Base still stand in Kinross Charter Township, about 25 miles south of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nIt was first built during World War II as a refueling stop and to maintain a presence to protect the nearby Soo Locks. After serving as a civilian airport, the Air Force reclaimed the property during the Cold War, operating the base from 1952 until it was decommissioned in 1977.\n\nThe now-defunct base served as the backdrop to the story, starting in the early evening hours of Nov. 23, 1953.\n\nAn old ammunition bunker located on the former Kincheloe Air Force Base in Chippewa County, Michigan. The base was decommissioned in 1977. (Courtesy U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)\n\nRadar technicians on base detected something flying in restricted airspace above the Soo Locks, traveling at more than 500 mph. Commanders ordered a crew into the air to investigate, a job that fell to Lts. Felix Moncla Jr. and Robert Wilson.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO report \u2018vindication\u2019 for man who tracked 1994 sightings on radar\n\nMoncla piloted the F-89C Scorpion jet while Wilson served as his navigator. The jet flew to 30,000 feet and set a path to intercept the unidentified object that showed up on radar, which was by then over Lake Superior.\n\nHistorical reports of the incident say Wilson was struggling to keep track of the object because it kept changing directions and heavy snow was causing issues with the jet\u2019s radar. The solution was to feed the jet coordinates from the base\u2019s radar team.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes, Moncla and Wilson had caught up with the object and were nearing the intercept point about 70 miles off of the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula. The base\u2019s radar crew guided them down to 7,000 feet.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLake Michigan Triangle: The might of the Great Lakes is more powerful than any myth\n\nSuddenly, silence. The crew watched as the two signals merged into one on the radar. The blip of the unidentified object \u201cveered in another direction and vanished.\u201d Moncla and Wilson\u2019s jet was never seen again.\n\nThe Air Force searched more than 29,000 square miles over the course of five days, finding no signs of plane wreckage, Moncla or Wilson.\n\nPhotos of Lt. Felix Moncla and Lt. Robert Wilson from a newspaper report in the Nov. 24, 1953, issue of The Capital Times in Madison, Wisconsin. The two airmen disappeared while investigating an unidentified flying object over Lake Superior the previous day. (Courtesy The Capital Times)\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nThat\u2019s the story that Air Force officials told, at least initially. Days later, that statement was retracted and a new one was issued. In it, USAF officials said a ground control radar operator had misread the scope and that Moncla and Wilson had actually completed their mission, identifying the object as a C-47 from the Royal Canadian Air Force that had somehow gotten 30 miles off course. Then, the USAF said, Moncla was most likely stricken with vertigo and crashed into Lake Superior while returning to the base.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere are several problems with that explanation. For one, Canadian military officials said they had no aircraft that flew over Lake Superior that night. Second, it appears it was not the only explanation provided by the Air Force.\n\nAccording to Donald Keyhoe, a former Marine Corps aviator and UFO researcher, Moncla\u2019s widow was given two different stories, both of which were different than the official statement given to the press. According to Keyhoe, Moncla\u2019s widow was told the plane crashed while flying too low. Later, she was then told that the jet had exploded at a high altitude.\n\nUFO sightings are more common in Michigan than you may think\n\nKeyhoe\u2019s organization, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, drew even more skeptics when it claimed that any mention of the mission had been expunged from all official records held by Project Blue Book, the Air Force\u2019s UFO investigative team.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe story resurfaced again 15 years later in 1968 when some prospectors more than 200 miles away from the search area came across some aircraft wreckage. Police investigators in Ontario recovered a stabilizer from the wreckage made with a heavy metal that suggested to experts that it came from a military plane \u2014 one designed to withstand heat generated by faster speeds. Air Force officials agreed with that assessments that it was likely a military part but did not believe the stabilizer belonged to an F-89C Scorpion, meaning it wouldn\u2019t have come from Moncla\u2019s downed plane.\n\nIt has been 71 years since that jet took off from Kincheloe Air Force Base and there does not appear to be any single satisfying answer to what happened. But Moncla and Wilson are remembered for their fateful flight and their brush with the unknown.\n\nOn a memorial erected near Moncla\u2019s hometown of Mansura, Louisiana, a plaque reads that he \u201cdisappeared (while) intercepting a UFO over the Canadian border as a pilot of an F-89 jet plane.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

This is excellent news for anyone looking to pick up a cheap option among the best smart rings, especially right now, as it's on sale for Black Friday.\n\nStarting with the obvious style change, the layout remains similar, but the various charts and graphs have been tweaked visually. For example, the wellness balance chart on the app\u2019s main page has morphed from its diamond-like design to a much more readable flower-like design.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe corresponding petal is filled in as you improve your Activity, Sleep, Relax Status, and Vitals Status scores. It\u2019s very similar to the previous graph, except that it\u2019s significantly more understandable at a quick glance.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nRingConn Gen 2\n\nBefore...\n\nImage 2 of 2\n\nRingConn Gen 2 app screenshots showing Hamish hector's fitness stats\n\n... and after\n\nThose improvements to glanceability extend to other aspects of the home page and stats pages but let\u2019s talk about new features. AI has come to the RingConn app in a big way with the introduction of Health Plans.\n\nThe first of these plans to launch is a Body and Mind Balance plan \u2013 a Sleep improvement plan is apparently on the way, according to the app \u2013 and after answering a quick survey about your activity patterns, the software will provide specific daily targets for you to achieve so you can steadily morph from your current routine to your new healthier normal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also an AI chatbot you can converse with, but as the app notes, it can only respond to fixed questions. Because of this limitation, it\u2019s not the most useful as it repackages the insights the app already gives you. Still, as it develops, I could see the AI becoming a useful fitness companion.\n\nA reason to use the app\n\nRingConn Gen 2 on a colorful mousemat\n\nSince testing the RingConn Gen 2 for our review, I\u2019ve kept using the ring pretty much all the time \u2013 save for the week or two I had lost it (it fell behind my bedside table) \u2013 but I\u2019ve realized I increasingly relied on the app a lot less because the stats I cared most about were easily viewable in the Android app widget. I could easily check my sleep, activity score, and ring battery with just a brief look at my home screen.\n\nThe in-depth insights were useful, but I often just wanted a quick recap of my stats and a brief guide to improving. The app's facelift and health plan tool is perfect and gives me a reason to open it up more frequently, as I can now get that extra detail and daily targets in a condensed, quick-to-read fashion.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the Ai doesn\u2019t feel entirely helpful, but overall, this RingConn app overhaul looks to be a massive boost instead of a downgrade, and I\u2019m excited to see what improvements we get next."

        "article_content": "Every time generative artificial intelligence drafts an e-mail or conjures up an image, the planet pays for it. Making two images can consume as much energy as charging a smartphone; a single exchange with ChatGPT can heat up a server so much that it requires a bottle's worth of water to cool. At scale, these costs soar. By 2027, the global AI sector could annually consume as much electricity as the Netherlands, according to one recent estimate . And a new study in Nature Computational Science identifies another concern : AI's outsize contribution to the world's mounting heap of electronic waste. The study found that generative AI applications alone could add 1.2 million to five million metric tons of this hazardous trash to the planet by 2030, depending on how quickly the industry grows.\n\nSuch a contribution would add to the tens of millions of tons of electronic products the globe discards annually. Cell phones, microwave ovens, computers and other ubiquitous digital products often contain mercury, lead or other toxins. When improperly discarded, they can contaminate air, water and soil. The United Nations found that in 2022 about 78 percent of the world's e-waste wound up in landfills or at unofficial recycling sites, where laborers risk their health to scavenge rare metals.\n\nThe worldwide AI boom rapidly churns through physical data storage devices, plus the graphics processing units and other high-performance components needed to process thousands of simultaneous calculations. This hardware lasts anywhere from two to five years \u2014 but it's often replaced as soon as newer versions become available. Asaf Tzachor, a sustainability researcher at Israel's Reichman University, who co-authored the new study, says its findings emphasize the need to monitor and reduce this technology's environmental impacts.\n\nTo calculate just how much generative AI contributes to this problem, Tzachor and his colleagues examined the type and volume of hardware used to run large language models, the length of time that these components last and the growth rate of the generative AI sector. The researchers caution that their prediction is a gross estimate that could change based on a few additional factors. More people might adopt generative AI than the authors' models anticipate, for example. Hardware design innovations, meanwhile, could reduce e-waste in a given AI system \u2014 but other technological advances can make systems cheaper and more accessible to the public, increasing the number in use.\n\nRelated: New memory chip controlled by light and magnets could one day make AI computing less power-hungry\n\nThis study's biggest value comes from its attention to AI's broad environmental impacts, says Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside, who studies responsible AI and was not involved in the new research. \"We might want these [generative AI] companies to slow down a bit,\" he says.\n\nFew countries mandate the proper disposal of e-waste, and those that do often fail to enforce their existing laws on it. Twenty-five U.S. states have e-waste management policies, but there is no federal law that requires electronics recycling. In February Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced a bill that would require federal agencies to study and develop standards for AI's environmental impacts, including e-waste. But that bill, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024 (which has not passed the Senate), would not force AI developers to cooperate with its voluntary reporting system. Some companies, however, claim to be taking independent action. Microsoft and Google have pledged to reach net zero waste and net zero emissions respectively by 2030; this would likely involve reducing or recycling AI-related e-waste.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nCompanies that use AI have numerous options to limit e-waste. It's possible to squeeze more life out of servers, for instance, through regular maintenance and updates or by shifting worn-out devices to less-intensive applications. Refurbishing and reusing obsolete hardware components can also cut waste by 42 percent, Tzachor and his co-authors note in the new study. And more efficient chip and algorithm design could reduce generative AI's demand for hardware and electricity. Combining all these strategies would reduce e-waste by 86 percent, the study authors estimate.\n\nThere's another wrinkle as well: AI products tend to be trickier to recycle than standard electronics because the former often contain a lot of sensitive customer data, says Kees Bald\u00e9, an e-waste researcher at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, who wasn't involved with the new study. But big tech companies can afford to both erase that data and properly dispose of their electronics, he points out. \"Yes, it costs something,\" he says of broader e-waste recycling, \"but the gains for society are much larger.\""

It was mostly a recap of the features I've tried already, but two tools were surprisingly useful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demo was quick, less than 15 minutes, and I was helped by two store employees who said they usually show shoppers features based on which apps they frequently use. For me, that meant a recap of the \"clean up\" tool in the Photos app, but I got new details on Math Notes and a \"hide\" feature on Safari.\n\nApple launched its AI software in beta with the iOS 18.1 update in October \u2014 the first of a rollout happening over the next several months. Although flashier features, like the Image Playground and Genmojis, aren't included yet, many new AI-powered tools exist on iPhone 15 Pro models or later.\n\nWhen I played with Apple Intelligence on my own, I was impressed, but I couldn't fully explore it since my iPhone 14 Pro Max isn't compatible with the software. If you've recently upgraded to an iPhone 15 Pro or later, an AI walkthrough might be beneficial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's what you might've missed if you haven't gotten a tutorial.\n\nI thought Math Notes would come out later\n\nMath Notes is a feature that solves complex math equations. Jordan Hart/BI\n\nI was impressed by Math Notes when Apple first demonstrated it at WWDC, but it was unclear which phase of Apple Intelligence it would be included in.\n\nThe AI-powered math helper was rolled out with iOS 18 in September, before the official Apple Intelligence launch. Unlike other AI tools, Math Notes is available on any iPhone compatible with iOS 18.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Calculator app, you can type complex math equations, and your phone will use AI to solve them. On iPads, you can use a pencil to write out the problems. I can't help but wonder where this was when I was in high school.\n\nI could see myself using \"hide\" on Safari a lot\n\nThe hide tool would be useful to eliminate distracting ads or elements of a webpage. Jordan Hart/BI\n\nAlthough I've read about and reported on Apple Intelligence's uses in the Safari app, I didn't have the chance to see how they could be applied to my daily life.\n\nOne store employee demonstrated how the \"hide\" tool removes distracting elements from a webpage. He used the shopping site Temu as an example. When he clicked the hide button and selected which parts he didn't want to see \u2014 mostly ads \u2014 the page transformed to become an efficient showing of items to shop from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tool would definitely come in handy for an online shopper like myself who wants to get straight to the goods.\n\nThere's also the Tips app\n\nIf you can't make it to an Apple store for a rundown, there's always the Tips app with a section on Apple Intelligence. It provides some guidance on how to use the AI available on iOS 18.1 so far.\n\nI went through it while first exploring Apple Intelligence, but the hands-on demo in a store gave me some more details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple has said that there's more to come in December with the release of iOS 18.2, and there's more Apple Intelligence on the horizon in 2025."

        "article_content": "Deliverance minister Jason Bray deals with hauntings, ghosts, demonic possession and poltergeists(Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\nJason Bray may seem like your normal Anglican priest.\n\nAt Cardiff\u2019s Llandaff Cathedral where he is now the Dean, he starts each morning with a brisk walk down a set of stone steps which lead from his home to his workplace.\n\nIt\u2019s a picture of peaceful contentment, but the priest\u2019s work also has an unpredictable side.\n\nJason is a deliverance minister, which is essentially the role director William Friedkin portrayed in the 1973 horror film \u2018The Exorcist.\u2019 Terrified audience members were said to have fainted or fled during screenings of the film, which tells the story of a girl possessed by an ancient demon.\n\nThe Exorcist spawned a whole genre of movies about demonic possession (Picture: THA/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nJason has been specialising in deliverance ministry for the last 27 years (Picture: Jason Bray)\n\nWhile he says the film paints an unrealistic picture of exorcisms, Jason admits he has had several experiences which made his \u2018skin crawl.\u2019 There was the family plagued by a \u2018ghostly monk\u2019, a woman terrified rats were \u2018eating her insides\u2019 and a man who had spotted his dead boyfriend stark-naked in his shower.\n\n\u2018You never know what you\u2019re going to be presented with,\u2019 Jason, 55, tells Metro, as he sits in a meeting room in Llandaff Cathedral, where ancient gravestones and tall trees border the nearby window.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no walking in going \u201chello, I\u2019m the exorcist\u201d in a scary low voice, though. People are usually quite frightened to begin with. I try to be as pleasantly disarming as I can be, so they don\u2019t feel the need to be nervous.\u2019\n\nJason sips a cup of strong black coffee as he discusses his work. Today he\u2019s in a trim black suit and red waistcoat; the type of outfit he\u2019d attend a call-out in. A copy of The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behaviour Disorders sits on his desk as a constant reminder that mental health, not mysterious spirits, could be the cause of a case.\n\nWhat is the deliverance ministry? In Christianity, deliverance ministry refers to groups that perform practices to cleanse people of demons and evil spirits. These groups attribute certain people\u2019s physical, psychological, spiritual, and emotional problems to the activities of these evil spirits in their lives. Every diocese has at least one deliverance minister. Exorcisms are extremely rare and a rite only administered with authorisation from a bishop. Therefore, the term \u2018deliverance minister\u2019 over \u2018exorcist\u2019 is used.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had some really creepy experiences,\u2019 the dad-of-two says. \u2018There have only been a couple occasions where I\u2019ve turned to a colleague and said \u201cRUN.\u201d\u2018\n\nThere are three types of call-outs which a deliverance minister deals with, he explains.\n\nFirst, poltergeist activity, which can cause lights to flicker or shoes to vanish. This is a negative spirit energy caused by \u2018someone who is struggling to communicate their distress\u2019. A teenager bottling up stress about a parent\u2019s divorce could cause the behaviour; as could an older person suffering with the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn one poltergeist case, a woman rang up Jason and blurted out: \u2018It\u2019s these rats, they\u2019re eating my mother alive. She woke up and felt like her insides were being eaten away by something, but when she turned the lights on there wasn\u2019t anything there at all.\u2019\n\nJason will bless a house in a bid to rid it of unwanted spirits (Picture: Stock image/Getty Images)\n\nJason will often uses a holy water sprinkler to bless a house (Picture: Jason Bray)\n\nJason raced to the home and proceeded to walk from room to room and speak the Lord\u2019s Prayer while he held a wooden cross. The woman\u2019s rat-based problem thankfully vanished and it later emerged she was awaiting results from a bowel cancer screening. Jason thinks this pent-up anxiety caused the experience.\n\nThe second type of call-out deliverance ministers respond to is \u2018place memories\u2019. This is where a building \u2018relives\u2019 something dramatic which took place years before. An example of place memory can be found at Treasurer\u2019s House in York, where heating engineer Harry Martindale saw \u2018Roman soldiers\u2019 march through a basement wall in 1953. Excavation work later found that the building was located on top of a former major road which led to the Roman city of Eboracum.\n\nJason points to one notable \u2018place memory\u2019 experience he had, with a family who felt the need to take a large step at the bottom of their staircase. It turned out a previous resident had fallen down the basement stairs and had broken his neck at the bottom.\n\nThe third type of call-out is \u2018true hauntings\u2019, which see a dead person try to communicate with loved ones. If you catch a whiff of your late grandmother\u2019s perfume; or see a shadow of a dead relative \u2013 this could be a true haunting, Jason explains. He will often carry out a \u2018requiem mass\u2019, also known as a Mass for the Dead, to encourage these spirit to move on.\n\nJason met King Charles and Camilla when they visited Wales in 2022 (Picture: Jason Bray)\n\nThe priest has met other famous faces such as Ryan Reynolds and Pudsey Bear (Pictures: Jason Bray)\n\nThis was the case when Jason was called to the home of his friend Pete; who had been left terrified after the ghost of his dead Australian boyfriend Craig appeared in his shower. After gentle questioning from Jason, Londoner Pete explained how he struggled to let his ex-partner go. This could have led to the spirit struggling to \u2018move on\u2019.\n\nBut isn\u2019t there a fourth category \u2013 what about exorcisms? Does Jason ever pin a possessed person to a bed and shout the Lord\u2019s Prayer while thunder and lightning crashes outside? No, is the swift answer.\n\n\u2018The movie [the Exorcist] has ruined the word \u201cexorcist\u201d,\u2019 Jason says. \u2018A major exorcism would mean someone is possessed and the deliverance minister is casting the demon out. But we do that on vanishingly rare occasions. It\u2019s a last resort.\u2019\n\nJason adds that he has never conducted an exorcism in his 12 years as a deliverance minister and dislikes the term \u2018exorcist\u2019 due to the negative connotations it brings up.\n\nFilms like the Pope\u2019s Exorcist (2023) impact people\u2019s perceptions of demons (Picture: Screen Gems/Everett/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHe continues: \u2018What people see in the films influences their opinions quite strongly. People we come across talk about \u201corbs\u201d a lot, I think Most Haunted has inspired a large part of that. I\u2019m convinced these \u201corbs\u201d are dust specs which get picked up on night vision cameras.\u2019\n\nWhen Jason does attend a call-out his \u2018ghostbusting\u2019 bag includes candles, prayer books, holy water, hand gel and a crucifix. Some deliverance ministers bring a radiator key he adds, in case trapped air is the cause of strange sounds.\n\nLike a doctor, Jason listens to symptoms and provides treatment in the form of house blessings and prayers. Then, like a therapist, he asks questions to help the homeowner find a deeper reason behind negative energy in their home. Finally, like a detective, he works out if his services are even required \u2013 if it\u2019s a mental health matter he will signpost accordingly.\n\n\u2018If you were possessed you wouldn\u2019t know it,\u2019 Jason, originally from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, insists.\n\n\u2018You definitely wouldn\u2019t go looking for help. Hearing demonic voices, something I have been called out to, isn\u2019t a symptom of being possessed \u2013 it\u2019s a sign of schizophrenia. I usually ask people if they are on medication or have a diagnosis. Sometimes, I tell them they need to see a doctor as soon as they can \u2013 not me.\u2019\n\nToday, deliverance ministers go out in pairs for safety. But that wasn\u2019t always the case, and Jason recalls one incident during the Covid pandemic when he felt at risk.\n\nJason says he dislikes the term \u2018exorcist\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe prefers the title \u2018deliverance minister\u2019 (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\n\u2018I was called to a guy who was really into his conspiracy theories and essentially had gone stir crazy,\u2019 he explains. \u2018Like many people at that time, he hadn\u2019t seen anybody for months and was cut off from the world. He had worked himself up into a complete state worrying his house was bugged. When I walked in, I could almost feel nervous energy pour out of him as he paced his tiny living room. I blessed the house and he said he was better afterwards, but I admit I did not feel safe there at all.\u2019\n\nJason\u2019s personal journey into deliverance was spurred by a strange encounter in 1997. After studying theology at Durham and a PhD in the Old Testament at Cambridge, he got ordained and moved with wife Laura into a three-bedroom house in South Wales. They welcomed a son, Tom, the same year and soon realised something was very wrong.\n\n\u2018I was away for a couple days on a training course,\u2019 Jason recalls. \u2018I came back to Laura \u2013 who is a very level-headed person \u2013 hugely concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut Tom\u2019s bedroom is like a freezer. Something is not right.\u201d We bled the radiator as you do, but it was still so cold.\n\n\u2018A few nights later I got up to go to the toilet. As I made to leave the bathroom and touch the handle, there was a sudden feeling that someone was standing on the other side of the door. I somehow knew, despite not seeing him, that he was my height, had grey eyes and wore a round wooden mask. I eventually opened the bathroom door and there was no-one there, so I ran into bed and dived under the covers. Laura saw my face and said \u201cyou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d\u2019\n\nJason is currently based at Llandaff Cathedral in Wales (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\nWith Laura\u2019s encouragement, Jason approached the local vicar \u2013 his boss \u2013 at a cheese and wine event and nervously explained what he had experienced.\n\nA visit was arranged to bless the Bray home. After the vicar splashed holy water in each room and gathered Jason and Laura to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer, everything changed. Almost instantly, the sun streamed in and Tom\u2019s room became warmer. Inspired, Jason embarked on a training course to become a deliverance minister.\n\nIn his very first house visit, Jason came across a \u2018very bored\u2019 family who seemed ambivalent as he walked around their house and blessed it. He later learned that they\u2019d told the council the flat was haunted in an attempt to get moved to a better home.\n\n\u2018You know it\u2019s real when they\u2019re frightened,\u2019 Jason adds knowingly.\n\nEager to put the work of a deliverance minister out into the world in his own words, in 2021 Jason published his book Deliverance, which brings together his various encounters with the supernatural. Since then, the film rights have been purchased, and Jason suggests with a smile that Welsh actor Michael Sheen would be a shoo-in to fill his boots.\n\nJason encourages anyone with haunted happenings to contact their local church (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\n\u2018Deliverance\u2019 recalls his memorable experiences with the supernatural (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\nJason\u2019s work as a deliverance minister has also led him to act as a consultant on ITV\u2019s Midwinter of the Spirit, which tells the story of a country vicar played by Anna Maxwell Martin who is called to a strange murder with supernatural undertones. He\u2019s also explained his job to actors Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds in an episode of their TV show Welcome to Wrexham.\n\nFor now though, the priest has no plans to hang up his crucifix anytime soon.\n\n\u2018I suspect there will always be a role for the deliverance ministry,\u2019 Jason says. \u2018Interestingly, there are now more atheists than people who believe in God, but a surprising number of atheists who believe in ghosts. There\u2019s a bit of a lack of logic in the whole thing there.\u2019\n\nTo buy Deliverance, click here. An Audible version is also available.\n\nDo you have a story you\u2019d like to share?

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road in Barrie earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium, which is located inside the building, said the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford said, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, saying he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going. This thing would not stop with the motion-sensored cat balls and there were noises going on all in the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was standing there asking questions and we heard a little girl call out. We looked at each other like \u2018what the (heck) was that!?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoric said they went to explore where the sound came from, which is when he heard Maryk yelling from where she was in the building.\n\n\u201cWe started running back and she was where the doll was \u2026 and asked what all the banging was about,\u201d he said, adding neither he nor the employee\u2019s wife knew what his partner was talking about. \"We\u2019d just heard the kid\u2019s voice, which is where Shirley had heard disembodied voices in the area previously.\u201d\n\nBoric said it felt like a game of cat and mouse trying to track down the spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve encountered that a lot, and it sometimes gets a little annoying because you go thinking you\u2019re going to experience something and it just leads you around the building,\" he said. \u201cIt was a good experience and there was a plethora of (paranormal) activity.\"\n\nBoric ended up bringing the \u201chaunted doll\u201d home to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cI have her in the room with the other ones,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure her arm moved the other night, so I am setting up a security camera in the haunted room.\u201d\n\nSanford says she found the entire experience \u201cfascinating,\u201d adding she \"absolutely\" believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get scared over any of this stuff that happens. I am all for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen these guys came in, I saw it for myself. The white orbs and the one gentleman at the very end had forgotten something upstairs \u2026 When we got up there, one of the revolving showcases was on and (it) hadn\u2019t been on 15 minutes early when we\u2019d been up there.\u201d\n\nThe episode is expected to air on the Walking Among Us YouTube channel in January 2025."

It's important to be selective with the companies that you add to your portfolio and ensure that you only put cash into investments that align with your overall investment priorities, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.\n\nYou should also only put cash to work that you can leave in your portfolio for a few years, not funds that you might soon need for bills or other financial obligations. On that note, if you're looking for top-notch growth stocks to buy right now and have $1,000 available to invest, here are two names to consider.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter!

Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has been the darling of pharmaceutical stocks in the last 12 to 18 months, with shares rocketing upward as the popularity of its GLP-1 drugs has propelled revenue and earnings. Bear in mind, this is one of the oldest healthcare companies in the world, with a lineup of top-selling drugs across a range of disease categories that target everything from various cancers and cardiovascular ailments to endocrine disorders and neurological conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024 alone, shares roared upward to the tune of about 62%. After the company reported its earnings for the third quarter of 2024, shares took a double-digit nosedive as investors responded negatively to a few key points, including a slight pullback in full-year guidance. The company also reported financial figures that were slightly below what Wall Street had expected.\n\nIn terms of its full-year guidance, where Eli Lilly was targeting revenue for the 12-month period in the $45.4 billion to $46.6 billion range, the company is now projecting that it will deliver in the ballpark of $45.4 billion to $46 billion. Its Q3 revenue was around $800 million below what analysts had aimed for.\n\nThat being said, a closer look is warranted, and the long-term outlook for this business is anything but dismal. Revenue in Q3 2024 rose 20% year over year to $11.4 billion. The company sold rights for its olanzapine portfolio in Q3, featuring products used to treat ailments such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. If you exclude revenue from this portfolio, Eli Lilly's top line actually jumped 42% on a year-over-year basis, which is a bit more than the 36% growth it reported in the second quarter. The company also reported net income of approximately $970 million in Q3.\n\nTirzepatide, which is the main active ingredient in its top-selling drugs Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), is being studied by Eli Lilly across multiple other disease areas. For example, positive phase 3 trial data from a 176-week study of tirzepatide demonstrated a 94% reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults with pre-diabetes who are obese or overweight.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnother first-of-its-kind study initiated by Eli Lilly has been studying tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity. In this phase 3 trial, tirzepatide reduced heart failure symptoms and physical limitations while lowering the risk of worsening heart failure events by 38%. Risk of hospitalization for heart failure was also reduced by 56% in trial patients taking tirzepatide. In short, the future revenue and profit opportunities from tirzepatide may be in the very early innings.\n\nIn Q3, sales of Mounjaro rose more than 121% year over year to $3.1 billion, while Zepbound (which was just approved last November) raked in $1.3 billion in sales. This was despite negative effects for both drugs cited by Eli Lilly that were caused by inventory decreases in the wholesaler channel. Blockbuster cancer drug Verzenio generated $1.37 billion in sales in the quarter, up 32% from one year ago, while sales of autoimmune disease drug Taltz jumped 18% to $879.6 million.\n\nWhile investors appear to be particularly reactionary in the current environment, that can present an opportunity for those with a sufficient buy-and-hold horizon to take a slice of the action. While Eli Lilly doesn't trade at a cheap valuation by any means, its annual dividend of $5.20 and steady increase to its payout can augment total investor returns. Investors who want to become part-owner in a top healthcare business with a steady global footprint may be remiss to overlook this quality stock.\n\n2. Monday.com\n\nMonday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY) is a low-code and no-code platform that helps organizations build the work management tools and software applications they need to ensure business operations run smoothly. The company derives its revenue from monthly or annual subscription agreements that it enters into with customers who use its cloud-based platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMonday.com's software enables everything from project management and collaboration to helping keep tools and files in a single location for easy access. Clients with little to no coding experience can leverage its platform to develop customized workflow apps featuring boards, charts, and other important automation solutions.\n\nCompanies like Canva, Lionsgate, and Coca-Cola are just a handful of the big names on Monday.com's client roster. Investors have been particularly optimistic about Monday.com's performance recently, with shares skyrocketing to the tune of about 50% over the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAs always, share price is never a reason to buy (or sell) a stock. You need to look at the underlying business, its drivers and detractors of growth, its financial performance, its industry, and its long-term growth runway to gain a clear picture of whether it's a wise fit for your portfolio. In the case of Monday.com, the company has only been in business since 2012, so it's still in the relatively early stages of its potential growth story.\n\nManagement estimates that the company operates in a large and growing total addressable market, which could hit a valuation of $150 billion by the year 2026. The diverse range of solutions that Monday.com's platform offers allows it to target various segments of its overall market opportunity, including the $30 billion customer relationship management (CRM) software market.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Monday.com is doing quite well. Its third-quarter revenue rose 33% from the year-ago period to $251 million, and the company officially surpassed the $1 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) mark. Its overall net dollar retention rate (NRR) increased to 111%, while NRR for customers with more than $100,000 in ARR was 115%.\n\nThe number of paid customers with more than $100,000 in ARR jumped 44% from one year ago. Meanwhile, the company's second-largest customer, which is an unnamed international technology company, more than doubled its seat count to 60,000 from 25,000. Although Monday.com is not profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), cash flow is another core profitability metric to consider.\n\nFrom a free cash flow perspective, the company raked in $82.4 million of free cash flow, while net cash provided by operating activities was $86.6 million in Q3. While investors may need a certain level of risk tolerance to invest in software stocks, this resilient business looks like a compelling addition to a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

Wade, the landmark abortion ruling.\n\nIn just four years, Trump was able to put three justices on the court.\n\nBiden has nominated only one person to the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the nation\u2019s female first Black Supreme Court justice.\n\nSotomayor, the senior member of the court\u2019s liberal minority, has given no indication that she would go along with the plan, one that would do nothing to change the court\u2019s balance of power.\n\nBiden, who showed his own reluctance to step aside, doesn\u2019t appear likely to ask Sotomayor to give up her lifetime appointment.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to those types of decisions, those are personal decisions, regardless of if it\u2019s Justice Sotomayor or any other justice on the bench,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in March, when the idea of targeting Sotomayor\u2019s seat was first floated.\n\nThis is backwards thinking.\n\nIf the Democrats, Biden included, were so determined to keep Trump from having another opportunity to put someone on the court, they should have come up with a better strategy \u2014 and message \u2014 to keep him out of the White House again.\n\nBut the damage has been done, and no amount of resignation roulette is going to fix it.\n\nThese aren\u2019t real ideas. They\u2019re internet memes. They\u2019re intricate plots for streaming political dramas on Hulu or Netflix. They are page-turning fiction novels.\n\nThey\u2019re candy.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is appointing his cabinet. Next on his list of nominees is probably the My Pillow guy.\n\nWhat the Democrats have needed to do, from the moment the electoral votes were counted, was start looking and planning ahead.\n\nNo more wound licking. No more finger pointing.\n\nNo more kooky ideas.\n\nKamala Harris fought a great fight. But she lost. It\u2019s over.\n\nIt\u2019s time to let it go.\n\nLeonard Greene is a columnist with the New York Daily News."

        "article_content": "In today\u2019s fast-paced world of online shopping, e-commerce platforms experience swift and unpredictable changes. Sellers face the challenge of staying competitive amid intense competition and shifting market conditions, making strategic pricing essential for maintaining an edge. Repricing tools have become invaluable for Amazon sellers, enabling them to respond dynamically to market trends and competitors. This article explores the functionality of repricing software and how it helps sellers maintain a competitive advantage.\n\nUnderstanding Repricing Software\n\nThe best repricing software for Amazon adjusts product prices based on predefined rules, analyzing competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, market demand trends, and sales history. This automation saves time and effort while enhancing profitability. Sellers can customize parameters to respond effectively to changing market conditions, ensuring their pricing remains competitive.\n\nAdapting to Market Trends\n\nThe market evolves continuously due to factors like consumer behavior, seasonal patterns, and economic shifts. Repricing tools monitor these variables and adjust prices to align with current trends. This adaptability allows sellers to respond quickly to opportunities or risks. By staying aligned with market movements, sellers can attract customers and increase sales.\n\nCompetitive Pricing Strategies\n\nCompetition on Amazon is intense as sellers vie for visibility and sales. Repricing software aids sellers in crafting competitive pricing strategies by analyzing competitor listings. Sellers can set rules that automatically adjust prices in response to competitor pricing\u2014either above or below. This strategic pricing approach helps keep products appealing to buyers while ensuring profitability.\n\nResponding to Demand Fluctuations\n\nDemand for products can vary due to factors like seasonality, consumer preferences, and marketing campaigns. Repricing tools enable merchants to adjust prices based on demand fluctuations. During high demand, prices can increase to maximize profits. Conversely, when demand slows, prices can be lowered to encourage purchases. This flexibility allows sellers to make the most of demand changes efficiently.\n\nManaging Inventory Levels\n\nEffective inventory management is vital for online businesses to thrive and avoid setbacks caused by overstocking or understocking. Repricing software helps sellers optimize inventory levels and maximize profits by adjusting prices based on stock availability, preventing losses due to inventory mismanagement.\n\nEnhancing Customer Experience\n\nCustomer satisfaction is key to success in online retail. Advanced repricing tools allow sellers to offer competitive prices, enhancing the shopping experience for consumers. Attractive price points help draw in buyers and build loyalty. Automated pricing also ensures that customers consistently find competitive deals, promoting repeat purchases and supporting business growth.\n\nIntegration with Amazon\u2019s Marketplace\n\nSellers can seamlessly integrate repricing software with Amazon\u2019s platform to manage pricing strategies effectively. This integration enables automated data analysis and price adjustments without manual intervention. By tracking market fluctuations and making price changes as needed, the software ensures that prices remain competitive. Integration improves efficiency, allowing sellers to focus on other critical business areas.\n\nMaintaining Profit Margins\n\nBalancing competitive pricing with healthy profit margins is essential for business sustainability. Repricing tools help sellers avoid compromising profitability when adjusting prices. By setting price limits, sellers can protect profit margins while staying competitive. This strategic approach enables sellers to strike a balance between attracting customers and maximizing profits.\n\nThe Future of Repricing Software\n\nAs technology advances, repricing software is expected to become even more sophisticated. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence will enhance its capabilities, enabling software to anticipate market shifts and adjust prices proactively. These developments promise greater efficiency, empowering sellers to remain competitive in an evolving market landscape.\n\nLeveraging Data-Driven Insights for Strategic Planning\n\nIn addition to its core functionalities, repricing software provides valuable data-driven insights that help sellers refine their broader business strategies. By analyzing pricing trends, sales performance, and customer behavior, repricing tools allow sellers to make informed decisions beyond pricing adjustments. These insights can guide inventory planning, marketing strategies, and even product development, helping sellers respond to customer preferences and market demands more effectively. Leveraging these analytics enables sellers to create comprehensive strategies that align with market conditions and foster sustainable growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon repricing tools are essential for sellers facing the challenges of a competitive e-commerce environment. By adapting to market changes, repricing software helps sellers stay competitive, manage inventory effectively, and enhance customer satisfaction. As technology evolves, repricing tools will play a crucial role in shaping the future of commerce, empowering sellers to succeed in an ever-changing market."
