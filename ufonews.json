            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nConnecticut police officer Robert Klein, a 25-year law enforcement veteran, says he had a UFO encounter that was like something straight out of a movie. He told his wild story to Ashleigh Banfield on her show last week.\n\nKlein explained to Banfield that in April 2022 an intense, glowing light filled his police car, changed colors, and flew through the air at speeds that defied the laws of physics as we know them. He says he got a good look at the UFO, and it was a \u201cperfect sphere\u201d about the size of a Mini Cooper as it hovered just 30 feet from his vehicle.\n\nThe UFO encounter occurred on a dark stretch of road near a local reservoir in Fairfield County, Connecticut about 40 minutes into his shift.\n\nKlein claims the UFO had a \u201cplasma-like\u201d look to it and its color changed between red, green, white, and orange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen my fair share of drones and meteors,\u201d Klein told Banfield. \u201cThis was something I\u2019ve never come across before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a really strong light. It lit up the entire cab of my cruiser to the point where I was having a hard time driving because I really couldn\u2019t see,\u201d Klein continued. \u201cI was blinded by it.\n\n\u201cSo I immediately put [his car] into park, rolled down the window and blocked the light with my hand because it was very intense to see where it was coming from and what exactly it was. At that point the lights started to move along the left side of the cruiser. So it stopped right in front, off to the left. As I looked up, that\u2019s when I saw this object.\u201d\n\nHe says the UFO emitted \u201ca low hum, which was very distinct.\u201d When he trained his car\u2019s spotlight on the UFO it made an \u201cinstantaneous\u201d movement and flew across the water at an extremely high rate of speed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I sort of snapped out of it and took out my camera and started recording and taking pictures,\u201d Klein explained. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see it go from A to B, that\u2019s how fast it moved.\u201d\n\nRoss Coulthart, an Australian investigative journalist and author who believes governments are covering up their knowledge of UFOs, was later asked to address Officer Klein\u2019s claims on another show which aired on NewsNation.\n\n\u201cIn this case we have a very senior police officer, a man of high credit who\u2019s worked for his community for 25 years,\u201d Coulthart very validly pointed out. \u201cWhy would he expose himself to public vilification and ridicule, or at least the risk thereof, by speaking about UFOs?\u201d"

Who knows. But we do know that the truth is out there.\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster. com/wordplay/words-were- watching-uap\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/ newsround/57344606\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/ what-are-uaps-unexplained- aerial-phenomenon-ufos-new- name/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ caileygleeson/2024/03/08/ pentagon-probe-finds-no- evidence-of-extraterrestrial- visits-technology/"

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered when you\u2019ll die? Well, a new app called Death Clock aims to help you answer that question. The app uses trained death prediction AI, which looks at various answers provided by the app\u2019s users. The AI then predicts when you\u2019ll die, as well as offers some additional ways to improve your health and live longer.\n\nConsidering how important the quest to slow human aging has become for many scientists, the actual want for an app like this is pretty high. Additionally, the information could help elderly people who are worried about outliving their money, the folks behind it told Bloomberg. Being able to more accurately determine when they might reach the end of the road is important.\n\nThe big thing with this new death prediction AI is that the app it powers is supposedly a \u201cpretty significant\u201d improvement on the current standard life tables that we utilize to determine mortality estimates.\n\nThe app\u2019s questionnaire asks many questions about the user, including things like age, gender, family history, mental health, and even information about chronic conditions. The studies it was trained on also included more than 50 million participants, so it should have a nice baseline to build off of.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHowever, the real meat of the app is locked behind a $40 subscription fee\u2014which could be a turnoff for many, especially as this is where it hides the various suggestions for improving your habits. Subscribing will also show you a clock that counts down to your estimated death, in case you want to let the death prediction AI make things even more morbid than they already might be.\n\nWhether or not this kind of app is for you is up to you to decide. While I can definitely see the appeal of knowing how your health conditions and all might affect your mortality, I\u2019m also of the mind that I\u2019d rather not have a clock counting down to the day I\u2019m going to die\u2014even if it is just a rough estimate. That\u2019s a bit too morbid for me to think about consistently. But, if you do want to know when you\u2019re going to die, Death Clock can tell you."

Villagers had heard strange cries coming from a nearby forest, but mistook them for ghostly sounds, according to Thai media reports. It wasn't until police dispatched rescue personnel to the forest that they heard a voice responding to their calls. The crew located the source of the voice and found 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi at the bottom of a 12-metre-deep well, Independent reported. The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.\n\nMr Chuanyi was found in a weakened state and had sustained serious injuries, including a fractured wrist, cerebral concussion, and bruises, after being trapped without food or water for three days and nights. He was rescued and taken to the hospital for medical attention.\n\nAccording to Mr Chuanyi, he strategically shouted for help once every hour, conserving his energy during his three-day ordeal. Meanwhile, nearby villagers reported hearing strange cries, which they attributed to paranormal activity. As a result, they avoided venturing outside after dark and didn't investigate the noise further.\n\nAuthorities believe that Mr. Liu accidentally fell into the well while attempting to navigate his way out of the forest. The circumstances surrounding Mr Liu's presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border remain a mystery, and authorities have reached out to the immigration department to investigate how he ended up in the area. In the meantime, local authorities are taking proactive measures to prevent similar incidents by sealing the well with a cover, ensuring the area is safer for everyone.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread attention on Chinese social media, with many users sharing and discussing the harrowing story.\n\nOne user wrote, \"A Chinese man shouting for help in the middle of nowhere? Of course, the locals can't understand the language and might think it was a wizard uttering spells.\"\n\nAnother commented, \"Kudos to his strength and stamina. Struggling for three days and nights but still yelling; this guy is truly impressive.\""

And the weird thing about them? They were arranged in thin, uniform layers.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it hints at what Mars was once like before being a desolate rock with very little atmosphere.\n\nInstead, it shows us that hot water was once present on the planet.\n\n\"We wondered, where else do you find elements like this,\" Carvosie explained.\n\nAdvert\n\nHot water on Mars was once a thing, the research suggests (Getty Stock Image)\n\n\"These kinds of zircons are only known to form where hydrothermal processes, hot water systems, are active during magmatism.\n\n\"The hot water facilitates transportation of the iron, aluminium and sodium into the crystal as it grows, layer by layer.\"\n\nBack on Earth, these elemental layers are present in places such as gold ore deposits - with the comparison almost identical to the Martian object.\n\nAdvert\n\nEva Scheller, of Stanford University, added that it indicated a time in Martian history where water vapour had been released into Mars' atmosphere before the formation of rivers and lakes on the planet.\n\n\u201cAt such an ancient age of 4.5 billion years, we are placed at the timing of when Mars formed,\u201d Scheller said.\n\n\u201cSo this would mark evidence of some of the earliest behaviour of water on Mars.\u201d"

            "article_content": "For one of the most affordable laptop deals around, look no further than the Dell Inspiron 15. Usually a respectable price of $380, it\u2019s even less expensive right now, dropping to $270 for a limited time only. Perfect for simply typing up documents on the move, studying, or relaxing on the couch with a laptop, here\u2019s all you need to know about it. Besides being good for adults, we also think it would make a great gift for a child seeking their first laptop.\n\nWhy you should buy the Dell Inspiron 15\n\nAt this price, you might worry you\u2019re not buying quality, but Dell is one of the best laptop brands so you\u2019re in good hands here. With the Dell Inspiron 15, you get a basic but highly functional laptop. It has a 12th-generation Intel Core i3-1215U processor along with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. None of that is particularly impressive, but it\u2019s a strong mix with no obvious weak points in this price range. You simply wouldn\u2019t expect more RAM at this price, for instance.\n\nFor the screen, there\u2019s a 15.6-inch full HD display, which is fairly good for this price. It has a full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 with 250 nits of brightness. It\u2019s LED-backlit, has anti-glare properties, and it has narrow borders to keep it looking sleek. Adding to the attention to detail, the Dell Inspiron 15 also has roomy keycaps and a spacious touchpad. It\u2019s designed well for work purposes, right down to its ComfortView software that reduces harmful blue light emissions.\n\nAt this price, you\u2019ll never get one of the best laptops, but that doesn\u2019t have to stop you entirely from missing out on quality. The Dell Inspiron 15 prides itself on nice additions like tiny rubber feet and bumpers on the hinge to keep it stable as you work.\n\nThe Dell Inspiron 15 is a great starter laptop or one for students on a budget. It normally costs $380, but today you can buy it from Amazon for $270. The $110 saving won\u2019t be around forever, so if it sounds like a good buy to you, buy it now before you miss out."
