The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

            "article_content": "NEW YORK, Dec. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumary, an innovator in smart lighting and smart home technology, will make its in-person debut at CES 2025, showcasing its creative products: the Permanent Outdoor Light Max, UFO High Bay Light, and the Next-Generation 4-Zone Solar Watering Timer. These industry-first products, developed based on market demand forecasts, mark Lumary's entry into various segments of the smart home industry. During the event, Lumary will exhibit at the Lumary CES Experience Center, located at Booth #40548 in the South Hall 3.\n\nLumary CES 2025\n\nThe Redesigned Permanent Outdoor Light Max Simplifies Installation and Enhances Nighttime Illumination.\n\nFollowing the success of Lumary's first-generation permanent outdoor light on Amazon in 2023, Lumary developed the new permanent outdoor light max based on user feedback. The latest model features a split design, innovatively separating the base from the light body. Installation is as simple as securing the base under the eaves and sliding the light body into place. Additionally, the LED beads have been upgraded, with reduced spacing between them, resulting in significantly increased brightness and a more vibrant decorative ambiance at night.\n\nIndustry-First Smart UFO High Bay Light: Simplifying Complex Wiring and Enabling Group Control for Workspaces\n\nLumary introduces the concept of smart lighting to traditional UFO high bay light, addressing the challenges of complex wiring and lack of centralized control in workspaces like garages, workshops, warehouses, and barns. With the Lumary App and remote control, users can easily configure and flexibly group lights, allowing groupings to be customized, split, or reorganized based on different task requirements.\n\nEquipped with a three-level motion sensor, the product enhances workspace safety while optimizing energy and time savings. The sensor detects motion up to 60 feet away, eliminating the need for manual switches, and offers adjustable illumination times ranging from 5 seconds to 60 minutes.\n\nIndustry-First Four-Zone Solar-Powered Smart Watering Timer: Revolutionizing Home Garden Watering\n\nFollowing the launch of its first battery-powered smart irrigation system in April 2024, Lumary has further enhanced the user experience with the introduction of a Wi-Fi direct connection version, eliminating the need for a Bluetooth gateway. The new Wi-Fi module features low-power design, with energy consumption as low as 400\u03bcA/h.\n\nThe system is equipped with an adjustable solar panel and two 4V 550F super capacitors, significantly extending its battery life (with a lifespan of up to 50,000 hours). Additionally, a highly requested water usage monitoring feature has been added, offering more intelligent management for home garden irrigation.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "WhatsApp has nearly 3 billion users so it\u2019s the perfect place for marketers to target their potential customers. Small businesses can leverage the SKEDit AI Message scheduler to schedule WhatsApp messages and reach out to potential customers. Furthermore, busy individuals can use SKEDit to schedule and auto-respond to WhatsApp messages when busy with other tasks. The best part about SKEDit is that it supports all popular messaging apps including WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, email, and even SMS. On that note, let\u2019s learn about SKEDit in detail.\n\nSchedule Messages on WhatsApp\n\nThe headline feature of SKEDit is message scheduling. It supports message scheduling on apps, including, WhatsApp, WhatsApp Business, Telegram, Messenger, email, and standard texts as well. In case you are wondering, how SKEDit works, well, it uses Android\u2019s Accessibility API to automate message sending at a time and date of your choice.\n\nSince WhatsApp has close to 3 billion users, you can use it to schedule WhatsApp messages to reach your target customers effectively. Apart from marketers and businesses, general users can also use SKEDit to schedule messages on WhatsApp and save crucial time for other productive tasks.\n\nAs we enter the holiday season, busy individuals can schedule WhatsApp messages to wish \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d or send birthday greetings to their family and friends. Basically, they can use SKEDit to schedule thoughtful messages for special occasions, even when they are occupied with other tasks.\n\nSKEDit offers five different types of scheduling on WhatsApp. You can schedule messages for WhatsApp contacts, channels, communities, and WhatsApp broadcast lists.\n\nApart from that, you can schedule WhatsApp Status, run WhatsApp Polls on your chosen time and date, and finally, even execute a Drip Marketing campaign on WhatsApp to send a series of pre-scheduled, automated messages to your potential customers. This way, you can build relationships and create leads with your prospective customers.\n\nSKEDit lets you select unlimited contacts on WhatsApp and allows you to upload your own phonebook. Not to mention, you can upload a CSV file containing contacts and create a custom SKEDit list as well.\n\nOnce you have done that, you can add the message or use the new \u201cAI Assistant\u201d feature (more on this below) to generate personalized text for your customers. SKEDit also has the option to add attachments, including images, documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, audio, and more, to your message, which is fantastic. Finally, you can set the date and time, and you are good to go.\n\nOn the specified time and date, SKEDit will send your message on WhatsApp or other supported messaging apps. It\u2019s really that simple to schedule WhatsApp messages using SKEDit. So, business customers and marketers can use SKEDit to push promotional messages on WhatsApp, run targeted campaigns, remind customers, do follow-ups, and much more.\n\nAuto Respond to WhatsApp Messages While You\u2019re Busy\n\nApart from message scheduling, SKEDit also brings support for WhatsApp Auto Responder. Picture this, you are busy with other tasks or focusing on a crucial project. In such a scenario, SKEDit Auto Responder can engage with your customers with custom replies. Using this tool, you can set auto-reply rules for incoming messages based on keywords, phrases, and contacts.\n\nYou can create several rules for different kinds of customers based on the type of incoming message. SKEDit will detect the message from the notification and send a custom reply in no time, allowing you to focus on other important tasks.\n\nI think business customers and power users can immensely benefit from using SKEDit. It can help automate a lot of interaction on WhatsApp, even in your absence.\n\nSKEDit AI Assistant\n\nFor effective communication with customers, SKEDit has integrated AI into the app. You can use the AI Assistant to enhance your text. You can use it to summarize text, make it more formal, fix spelling, paraphrase the text, and do much more. Next, you can produce custom AI images and videos, and translate texts from one language to another.\n\nNot only that, you can also use the SKEDit AI Assistant to convert text to speech and speech to text seamlessly. I tried the AI feature on SKEDit and it worked really well. If you are catering to a global audience, this kind of AI feature can enhance communication with customers, without having to worry about the language barrier.\n\nAuto Unlock Device\n\nSince SKEDit uses Android\u2019s Accessibility API, the device must be in an unlocked state to run scheduled tasks. To solve this problem, SKEDit has developed a novel solution that automatically unlocks your Android phone, sends the scheduled message, and then locks your device again.\n\nFor this to work, you will have to enter your lock screen PIN or password on the SKEDit app. In case, you are uncomfortable sharing your device PIN/ password, you can keep your phone in an unlocked state for the app to work seamlessly.\n\nSKEDit AI Message Scheduler: Plans and Pricing\n\nWhile SKEDit offers a free plan, I would recommend small businesses and power users to get the Pro or Max subscription for unlimited access to crucial features. With the paid plan, you can send messages to as many contacts as you want. You can also add several attachments, access promising AI features, schedule WhatsApp Status updates, and more.\n\nTalking about the paid plans, the SKEDit Pro plan starts at $3.99 per month and the Max plan starts at $8.99 per month. If you choose to get the annual plan, you will get over 30% discount which is pretty great.\n\nAdditionally, Beebom readers get an extra 20% discount, which is the icing on the cake. You can use the promo code \u201cBeebom\u201d to avail the discount in the SKEDit app.\n\nBesides WhatsApp scheduling, you can use the SKEDit tool for email scheduling. Not to mention, the company is working to add more messaging channels and launch a one-stop web platform for proper communication management. Its use case is also expanding as customers are using SKEDit to effectively manage teams through task reminders and work updates. Some users are leveraging the Auto Responder feature to build chatbots and interactive flows.\n\nThe SKEDit: AI Message Scheduler app is available on Android and Huawei smartphones. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and reach out to your potential customers on WhatsApp with SKEDit."

            "article_content": "India will see a rise in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and cost reductions in 2025, with increasing adoption across sectors like healthcare, finance, energy, and governance, Sanjeev Malhotra, CEO of the Centre of Excellence for IoT and AI at Nasscom, told FE.\n\n\u201cWe will see more applications of AI across the board\u2026 most of the cost is computing and manpower, and as knowledge becomes more pervasive, more people get trained on this, I think the rate of application development will increase, so will the rate of adoption across the board,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said enterprises will derive more efficiencies and the fault rates will reduce. \u201cI think the rest of the world will also start using more and more solutions from India,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Read AI drives surge in India\u2019s digital ad spending: Report 60% APAC firms see AI benefits in 2-5 years: IBM survey How skilling will change in five years \u2018We use technology as a force for good\u2019\n\nThe adoption of AI among Indian enterprises is progressing from proof-of-concept stages to full-scale production, particularly in the fintech and healthcare sectors, according to Malhotra.\n\nAutomated loan processing, fraud detection, and citizen grievance redressal are some of the leading use cases. \u201cGovernments are also beginning to use chatbots for grievance redressal, as it is not possible to deploy large numbers of call centre agents,\u201d he said.\n\nThe availability of public LLMs from global tech giants is also fostering innovation among Indian startups. \u201cWhen these [LLMs] are made public, it makes it easier for startups to use those products in creating applications,\u201d Malhotra said. Startups are building domain-specific solutions by customising LLMs with additional features.\n\nAI is also playing a growing role in critical areas like energy transition and healthcare. \u201cIn energy, applications optimise usage and extend battery life through software interventions. This has a cumulative impact, especially with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles,\u201d he said. Malhotra also highlighted its use in predictive maintenance for power plants and grid optimisation.\n\nHealthcare has seen similar progress, with chatbots providing initial diagnoses in multiple Indian languages. \u201cPatients can talk to machines regarding their problems and receive good guidance\u2026these chatbots now come in different languages, making them more open to adoption by the larger population,\u201d Malhotra said.\n\nTo support startups and enterprises, the Nasscom Centre of Excellence has launched initiatives to accelerate AI adoption. Malhotra said co-creation between them helps enterprises discover existing solutions rather than building new ones from scratch, making it a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation.\n\n\u201cThis programme connects startups with industries and funding organisations, making it easier for startups to access large enterprises,\u201d he said.\n\nNasscom\u2019s Future Skills platform is also addressing the skill gap in the AI sector. The programme, developed in partnership with the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), offers online learning resources to upskill professionals at nominal costs."

            "article_content": "In a recent chat with YouTube channel RichardMetalFan (posted on Dec. 13), Shadows Fall drummer Jason Bittner revealed why he \u201chated\u201d both Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them (and what led to him changing his mind).\n\nBittner\u2019s Discovery of Heavy Metal\n\nAt the start of their conversation, Bittner is asked, \u201cGrowing up, what were the first band that got you into metal and made you want to start playing drums?\u201d\n\nBittner responds:\n\nThe band that got me into \u201cheavy metal,\u201d technically, is Iron Maiden. Maiden\u2019s my favorite metal band of all time as well. That was the first band I saw of that genre in 1980, the day that MTV came on the air. I was 10 years old, and I was, like, \u201cWhat in God's name is this?\u201d And that just sent me on my trajectory [with] Maiden and Judas Priest.\n\nAside from Bittner\u2019s minor timeline mistake (MTV debuted in 1981), his love for Iron Maiden and Judas Priest isn\u2019t surprising. What is more shocking, however, is that he follows by confessing that he was far less impressed by Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them.\n\n\u201cI wanna say, I think [in] \u201984, a friend of mine let me borrow a record [Ride the Lightning],\u201d Bittner reflects. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you gotta check out this band.' And I'm, like, 'Who's Metal-licka?' And he goes, 'No, it's pronounced Metallica, man!' I'm, like, 'All right, cool. Metallica.\u2019 And I took it home and I hated it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Shadows Fall Vs. Haunted Prison\n\nWhy Bittner Originally Didn\u2019t Like Metallica or Slayer\n\nInterestingly, it\u2019s related to his love for Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford. Bittner explains:\n\nI was like, \u201cGod, what the hell is this?\u201d 'Cause I was used to Bruce Dickinson and Halford, and all of a sudden, you have James Hetfield, and I'm, like, \u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d Maybe, like, a week later, I taped the album just in case I might like it one day, and I gave the record back to my friend. And, like, a week later, I'm doing my paper route and I was humming [a guitar riff]. And I'm, like, \u201cWhat is this that I'm singing to myself?\u201d And it was the riff from \u201cFight Fire With Fire.\u201d And I'm, like, \u201cOh, that's that Metallica band. I didn't think I liked that.\u201d\n\nHe continues:\n\nA lot of the heavier bands \u2013 even bands I've been in \u2013 when I've heard [them] the first time, I didn't care for [them]. Like Slayer. I hated Slayer at first. I'm, like, \u201cNo way I'm gonna like this.\u201d [Now] Slayer\u2019s my favorite thrash band of all time. Anthrax and Megadeth were the only two that, when I first listened, I wasn't, like, \u201cAargh!\u201d Like, with Anthrax, I was just, like, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d That was, like, the \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 the \u201cbe all, end all\u201d for me right there, because [drummer] Charlie [Benante] was . . . one step beyond [Slayer drummer Dave] Lombardo for me at that point, because, like, Lombardo was feet, but Charlie was the whole fucking package.\n\nWhat Made Him Change His Mind on Metallica and Slayer\n\nBittner add that he was introduced to Metallica first (followed by Megadeth) because a classmate mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s this dude [Dave Mustaine] that was in Metallica before Kirk Hammett.\u201d\n\nHe explains:\n\nI didn't know about anything pre-'Kill \u2018Em All' . . . [and] he was, like, \u201cNah, this dude [Mustaine] was in the band before [Hammett], and he's got this other band and it's called Megadeth. . . And the first thing I heard was 'Killing Is My Business,' but that was so raw at the time. I was, like, \u201cAll right . . . it's kind of cool. It's fast and stuff.\u201d But, once 'Peace Sells' came out, I was, like, \u201cOh, all right. Now I get it.\u201d . . . Maybe a year after that or within that year, I got into Slayer. A friend of mine had Show No Mercy and he had let me hear that. And I wasn't really that impressed, but then Reign in Blood came out . . . and I bought that . . . went on a spring break vacation my sophomore year of high school to Florida with my mom, and all I did was just I had Reign In Blood . . . I listened to that record just incessantly for a week straight.\n\nFrom there, Bittner came to appreciate \u201chow hard thrash metal drumming was\u201d as he tried to play certain parts himself. \u201cSo, it was Slayer, then Anthrax, and it was basically through the \u201cBig 4\u201d and then everything else under the sun,\u201d he remarks.\n\nInterestingly, he admits that he\u2019s \u201calways been . . . a thrash metal drummer,\u201d adding:\n\nI\u2019m not an extreme metal drummer. I like that stuff, but . . . it's out of my wheelhouse. It's not what I do. But I like a lot of those drummers and went through that whole phase in the mid-'90s. [I was] immersed into Death and Morbid Angel and that stuff. Listening to Pete Sandoval and Sean Reinert and Gene Hoglan. So, my influences go across the board, really. And let's not forget Van Halen, either.\n\nThat\u2019s quite the musical journey, right?\n\nOf course, Shadows Fall recently released a new single and music video, \u201cIn the Grey,\u201d which marks their first piece of new music in over a decade. It also signifies their new partnership with MNRK Music Group.\n\nAs for Metallica, they were ranked no. 9 in Pollstar\u2019s recent tally of the Top 10 Worldwide Top Touring Artists of 2024. Likewise, they remain one of the top ten most popular choices for tattoos, and Kyuss\u2019 Brant Bjork acknowledged that he didn\u2019t like having the band labeled as \u201cthe next Metallica.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Slayer\u2019s Kerry King cited Sabotage as his favorite Black Sabbath LP.\n\nAlso, you can watch the full interview with Bittner below:\n\nShadows Fall\u2019s Jason Bittner Discusses His Musical History With RichardMetalFan"

Ideally they give you something to talk about, but they don't give you nightmares.\n\nHere's what Aotearoa's top bookworms recommend adding to your reading list over the hot summer months.\n\nFiction\n\nTell Me Everything, by Elizabeth Strout\n\nCarole Beu from The Women's Bookshop has recommended the latest release from American novelist Elizabeth Stout.\n\n\"In Tell Me Everything, Elizabeth Strout brings together many of the delightfully eccentric characters from her previous books.\n\n\"Olive Kitteridge, Lucy Barton, Bob Burgess - they're all here with their wisdom and foibles, along with the townsfolk of Crosby, Maine.\n\n\"There's murder, suicide, love and empathy, and all the messiness of people's lives. Brilliantly witty, wise and tender.\"\n\nAt the Grand Glacier Hotel, by Laurence Fearnley\n\nNew Zealand author Laurence Fearnley's latest novel comes highly recommended by Kete Books' Erica Stretton.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll to continue reading\n\n\"There's this idea that summer reads should be light, and refreshing, and easy to put down and pick up,\" Stretton says.\n\n\"I can see the appeal after a long work year but I like to delve deep into books that take me away somewhere else, in summer - not necessarily a different location, but a world that teaches me something, looks at a situation from a different perspective.\n\n\"At the Grand Glacier Hotel is Laurence Fearnley's third novel responding to and exploring the five senses. The interiority of it all reminds the reader we don't always know what others are going through, and the questions it pulls to the surface about how we deal with disability, temporary or otherwise, are relevant and pertinent.\"\n\nThe End of the Beginning, by Jenna Heller\n\nAlso recommended by Stretton, The End of the Beginning is a collection of short stories from award-winning \u014ctautahi Christchurch writer Jenna Heller.\n\n\"The small stories within are visceral, with a strong narrative that makes the reader feel right at home,\" Stretton says.\n\n\"There's no shying away from tough topics but also no holding back from beauty, and each tiny story has its own kick.\"\n\nWhaea Blue, by Talia Marshall\n\nAnother collection of short stories from an acclaimed New Zealand novelist, recommended by Afternoons book reviewer Anna Rankin.\n\n\"The debut collection from acclaimed writer Talia Marshall comprises a range of essays that fuse memoir, myth, historical account and whakapapa into an immersive, dazzling fable of a protracted road trip across Aotearoa.\n\n\"To read this collection while travelling the island or staying elsewhere from one's known home is not only to reckon with our dark, complicated and often submerged histories and therefore see these lands anew, but to do so with a master storyteller and woman on the edge; a woman who takes the hard road and survives, blessed with rare, valiant and unforgettable insight that enlarges the reader's heart.\"\n\nNon-fiction\n\nUnreel: A Life in Review, by Diana Wichtel\n\nAnother must-read recommend from Beu at The Women's Book Shop.\n\n\"The former revered and reviled TV critic for The Listener has lost none of her unique, acerbic wit that gained her such esteemed status among discerning Kiwi TV viewers,\" she says.\n\n\"Part autobiography, part survey of our historical relationship with 'the box', her incredibly funny book illuminates real life as much as the imitations of it on TV.\"\n\nBecoming Aotearoa, by Michael Belgrave\n\nThe latest major work of New Zealand history is out now from Massey University's newly titled professor emeritus Michael Belgrave, and is another of Rankin's top picks for summer.\n\n\"Not since Michael King's Penguin History of New Zealand has a historian tackled a definitive account of Aotearoa, and Belgrave's provision to the canon 20 years later is a destined classic vast in scope that traverses early M\u0101ori histories across generations into the contemporary moment.\n\n\"A hefty tome, the book clocks in at 600-odd pages which makes it the ideal accompaniment to the languid afternoons of summer, where readers can peruse each chapter at their leisure and wander through various M\u0101ori, settler and migrant narratives not only fascinating on their own merits but which illuminate where we are today.\"\n\nGraphic novels and comics\n\nStu and Sue from the always reliable Heroes For Sale sent through some tips for those of us who enjoy art as well as words.\n\n\"There have been some incredible New Zealand creators coming through in the graphic novels,\" Sue told us.\n\nRecommended books include:\n\nOur Bones Dust, by Ben Stenbeck\n\n\"We may be slightly biased on this one because we think Ben is already a superstar!\" Sue says.\n\n\"He has worked with Mike Mignola in the Hellboy universe for many years, but this is his first big independent comic. Our Bones Dust is a sci-fi adventure wrapped up in some high-concept ideas and smothered with gorgeous, detailed art that explodes the world-building on an epic level.\"\n\nMachines of Mana -The Aberrant Spark by Joshua Caccamo, Greig Roulston, Jordan Taylor and Colton Organ\n\n\"Machines of Mana is a sci-fi mash with fantasy and dystopian themes. It is the first in a saga that spans time travel, exploring ideas around AI and survival. It takes you on a trip into a future that in some predictions seems inevitable!\n\n\"A gorgeous exploration of sentience vs programs in robots and the evolution that might occur.\"\n\nThe Writing Desk, by Di Morris\n\n\"An incredible historical peek into pioneering New Zealanders and what global forces 'exert' on our little country.\n\n\"This story highlights the pressures faced by colonial women and the changes allowing education and voting rights for everyone.\n\n\"We follow generations in one family from the 1850s, and their navigation of society's evolution is fascinating. Di uses birth certificates and death certificates along with other memorabilia to weave this generational story.\"\n\nScience fiction and fantasy\n\nAlso courtesy of Heroes for Sale, these latest works of wonder are perfect for taking your summer reading into realms far beyond the barbie.\n\nLuda, by Grant Morrison\n\n\"Morrison is a writer who embeds himself in the story and the writing takes on an interdimensional feel.\n\n\"It is a lived, very real space. Luda is the story of a drag performer, a femme fatale, a monster and one of the most mesmerising characters I have ever read!\" Sue says.\n\n\"The layers will have you tangled, and the language is delicious! Descriptive moments drip onto your skin, and you can feel the smear of the makeup as the fa\u00e7ade is applied.\"\n\nThe Serpent and the Moon, by Alan Moore\n\n\"This is a workbook of exceptional beauty and wonderful exposition.\n\n\"If you have ever wondered about the layers of existence and the magical elements of the unexplained this might be for you.\n\n\"After all, if magic is just the left-over debris from the Big Bang, and therefore just unexplained yet, who is to say it doesn't exist?\n\n\"A deep dive into the moments we should pay more attention to and have some fun in the celebration of that. This is Alan Moore's explanation of magical connection as lived in his world.\"\n\nRomance, hubba hubba, and smut\n\nFinally, there's nothing like a summer fling to turn up the heat.

During an episode, the boundaries of sleep and wakefulness \u2013 usually defined and distinct \u2013 are temporarily blurred, leading to a mixed state of consciousness wherein individuals maintain some degree of awareness, however distorted, of the world around them, while being unable to move.\n\nOrdinarily, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep combines vivid dreaming with atonia (the brief loss of muscle control), which works in our favour to prevent us acting out our dreams in real life. Sleep paralysis, on the other hand, seems to occur when the atonia and mental imagery of REM sleep persists even into a state of being aware and awake.\n\nMedical experts have grouped sleep paralysis into two categories. Isolated sleep paralysis, or one-off paralysis episodes that are not connected to an underlying diagnosis of narcolepsy (a neurological disorder that disrupts the ability of the brain to properly control wakefulness).\n\nRecurrent sleep paralysis, or multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time that are usually associated with narcolepsy.\n\nAround 75% of sleep paralysis episodes involve hallucinations. These can include intruder hallucinations, where the individual perceives a dangerous person or presence in the room; chest pressure hallucinations (also known as incubus hallucinations), which involve feelings of suffocation and often occur alongside intruder hallucinations; and vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations, which involve feelings of movement or out-of-body sensations.\n\nThe cause of sleep paralysis is not fully understood, but it has been associated with insomnia, disrupted sleep patterns, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and a family history of sleep paralysis. .\n\nTo prevent sleep paralysis, there are no quick-fixes or guaranteed cures, but some suggestions include: regularly getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep every day; maintaining a consistent bedtime and wake-up time; engaging in regular exercise, but avoiding it in the four hours leading up to bedtime; and sleeping on your front or side, as sleeping on your back can increase the likelihood of sleep paralysis episodes. .\n\nThose who are struggling with recurrent sleep paralysis may be referred to their GP, who could identify an underlying condition such as insomnia or PTSD. They may also be referred to a clinician who specialises in sleep disorders."

A study in Science Advances reveals 6.2 trillion tons of hydrogen trapped underground. This discovery could meet energy demands for 200 years.\n\nThe study, titled \"Model Predictions of Global Geologic Hydrogen Resources,\" was published on December 13. It estimates the hydrogen reserve to be 26 times larger than known oil deposits. Despite this, the exact locations of these reserves remain unknown.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHydrogen, a light and abundant element, shows immense energy potential. Governments are exploring it as a cleaner alternative to oil and gas. According to the study, hydrogen may meet 30 per cent of energy needs by 2050. Demand is projected to grow fivefold within three decades.\n\nRead Also: Asteroid alert for Christmas Eve: 120-foot asteroid to zoom past Earth at alarming speed, confirms NASA\n\n\"The global hydrogen demand could hit 500 Mt yearly by 2050,\" the study noted. \"Extracting just 2% of this reserve would satisfy demands for 200 years.\"\n\nPrevious Assumptions Challenged\n\nFor years, experts believed hydrogen escaped through rock pores. The study challenges this notion with evidence of underground reservoirs. Examples include discoveries in Albanian chromium mines and West Africa.\n\nGeoffrey Ellis, lead author and a US Geological Survey geochemist, told Live Science, \"The findings surprised us. There\u2019s more hydrogen than we imagined.\" He added, \"We don\u2019t need external energy sources; it\u2019s stored underground.\"\n\nA Promising Energy Shift\n\nHydrogen is gaining traction for its potential to replace fossil fuels. Unlike blue or green hydrogen, natural hydrogen doesn\u2019t require additional energy or storage solutions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRead Also: New study reveals Moon's actual age, saying it is 100 million years older than previously thought\n\nEllis emphasised, \"Storage isn\u2019t an issue with natural hydrogen reservoirs.\" However, the primary challenge remains economic feasibility. Developing cost-effective extraction methods is vital to attract investment.\n\nThe discovery brings optimism but requires further exploration. Scientists must locate reserves and address technical challenges. This development could mark a pivotal step in global energy evolution."

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

            "article_content": "The New York Times made headlines by suing OpenAI this year, but the case against AI isn't so black and white\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Rael Hornby\n\nOn April 30, 2024, eight of the nation's largest daily newspapers, including the New York Times, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming both companies used news articles without permission to train their AI models.\n\nIt's among the most significant cases launched against AI developers to date and follows a separate, ongoing lawsuit filed on December 27, 2023, in which the New York Times claimed OpenAI committed copyright infringement through ChatGPT.\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT about these cases, it dutifully gave me a summary of the 2023 case, including three main points: copyright infringement, a lack of compensation for using copyrighted content, and the ongoing nature of the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIronically, in explaining this case to me, ChatGPT may have pulled from New York Times articles, highlighting the exact issue at hand \u2014 or, at the very least, the issue that the newspaper has.\n\nBut is this case as black and white as The Times' own masthead? Given that its outcome could determine how companies handle the training of future models for potentially decades to come, it's worth taking a closer look.\n\n#9 in Laptop Mag's Biggest AI Moments of 2024\n\nThis article ranks at #9 in our round-up of the year's 24 most impactful moments in artificial intelligence. For the full rankings and more articles like this, check out the Biggest AI Moments of 2024 \u2014 a Laptop Mag Special Issue.\n\nA pressing matter: The case for The New York Times\n\nAt the time of writing, OpenAI is just one of several AI companies facing dozens of lawsuits. These cases often focus on some form of copyright infringement, with plaintiffs ranging from individual YouTube creators to media conglomerates and music studios.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen hearing about claims of copyright infringement by AI, musicians, actors, and writers may first come to mind. Hollywood has been at the center of tensions with the AI industry for years now, but the press and news outlets also play an important role in the battle against the misuse of AI.\n\nCases like the 2023 and 2024 New York Times lawsuits aren't just about protecting journalists from losing their jobs to AI. Unlike AI-related cases in Hollywood, these cases focus more on the exploitation of news articles by AI chatbots and the risks of those chatbots spreading misinformation under the guise of legitimate news sources.\n\nThe possibility of generative AI fabricating news isn't hypothetical, either. It's already happening. For example, in 2023, The Guardian blocked ChatGPT from scraping its website for training data after readers reported that the chatbot was generating news articles under Guardian reporters' bylines... that those reporters never actually wrote.\n\nSimilarly, the 2024 New York Times lawsuit against AI cited multiple examples of ChatGPT generating false product recommendations attributed to news outlets.\n\nThis completely fabricated information isn't just an inconvenient AI blunder. It may cause serious harm to readers who believe they're getting information from a trustworthy source. As the lawsuits claim, this can also damage newspapers' reputations if unsuspecting readers don't realize they're getting a recommendation or story that's completely made up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, these lawsuits also raise the issue of lost revenue. It's no secret that newspapers rely on paid subscriptions to stay in business. AI models can give readers access to text from copyrighted news articles without paying for access to that content. So, the New York Times and the other news outlets joining it in the 2024 lawsuit claim they are owed compensation for OpenAI's use of their content.\n\nWhat all of this amounts to is a question of accountability. Can AI companies profit off of content they weren't authorized to use? Are they responsible for the damage done when their algorithms generate false or misleading content?\n\nGenerating headlines: The case for OpenAI\n\nThe Times' argument is sound enough, but as with any lawsuit, there are two sides to every story.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response to the lawsuit filing, OpenAI would accuse The Times of incomplete reporting in a post titled OpenAI and Journalism published on their website in January 2024, stating \"We support journalism, partner with news organizations, and believe the New York Times lawsuit is without merit.\"\n\nOn the topic of copyrighted works appearing within ChatGPT, OpenAI offered insight claiming, \"[The New York Times] had mentioned seeing some regurgitation of their content but repeatedly refused to share any examples, despite our commitment to investigate and fix any issues.\"\n\nExploring these \"regurgitations,\" the name given to a bug encountered by OpenAI's models when it offers up training data as part of an answer, further, Open AI states \"Interestingly, the regurgitations The New York Times induced appear to be from years-old articles that have proliferated on multiple third-party websites.\n\n\"It seems they intentionally manipulated prompts, often including lengthy excerpts of articles, in order to get our model to regurgitate.\"\n\nFrom OpenAI's perspective, The Times' claims result from attempted \"jailbreaking\" efforts to force ChatGPT to reveal training data. As the company puts it, \"this misuse is not typical or allowed user activity ... we are continually making our systems more resistant to adversarial attacks to regurgitate training data, and have already made much progress in our recent models.\"\n\nReinforcing his company's stance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the lawsuit at the recent Dealbook Summit 2024 in December, stating \"I think the New York Times is on the wrong side of history in many ways.\"\n\nA case that's not so black and white\n\nIt's not just copyright infringement on the table in these landmark AI lawsuits \u2014 in cases of copyright infringement in particular, the outcomes could completely reshape the way AI models are trained in the future.\n\nTo some, LLMs like ChatGPT are simply spewing out pieces of pre-learned information to users, scraped from the training materials it was initially fed, raising alarm bells over how much of this \"new\" information contains another's work.\n\nHowever, AI developers claim that models such as ChatGPT don't work that way. To them, even if a model is trained on copyright-protected data, it's no different than somebody learning to play guitar by playing riffs from their favorite bands. If this person were to go on to create music of their own, they wouldn't be breaking copyright simply by having learned to do so by listening and learning to others who already could.\n\nThe jury is still out on which side of the argument will prevail in court, with both sides making strong cases.\n\nHowever, perhaps ChatGPT's excellence in delivering content that is so human-like will be its downfall, similar to the misunderstanding of the widely attributed Pablo Picasso quote (which, ironically, is also possibly misattributed): \"Good artists copy, great artists steal.\"\n\nIf you're anything from an AI enthusiast to the average AI tinkerer (or simply seeking out some of the additional features offered through Windows Copilot+ PCs or Apple Intelligence on Macs), then you'll need a powerful and performative laptop to keep up to speed with your needs.\n\nAt Laptop Mag, we review laptops year-round to ensure we're giving you expert-backed and up-to-date recommendations on which notebook is right for you. When it comes to the best AI PC category, our top picks are the excellent Asus Zenbook S 14 (UX5406) for Windows users and the impressive Apple Macbook Air M3 for those running macOS.\n\nSo, if you're shopping for a new laptop and looking to invest in an AI PC (or just a great laptop in general), check out our current top-tier picks below.\n\nMacbook Air M3\n\nWe love the MacBook Air 13 M3.

            "article_content": "Trend: Sustainability\n\nThe South Korean government announced plans to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over two years.\n\nSouth Korea has committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThe past few years have seen the Ministry of Environment (MoE) roll out a range of regulatory policies to this end, including the banning of hard-to-recycle plastics such as coloured PET from the recycling system as well as approving recycled PET plastic as material for new food packaging.\n\nThe ministry calling for public comment on another initiative earlier this year to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nThe Vietnamese government drafted regulations earlier this year proposing a phased increase on excise taxes for alcoholic beverages to 100% by 2030 as well as 10% for sugar-sweetened beverages, in attempts to curb overconsumption as well as boosting national income.\n\nVietnam is well-known for having very affordable alcoholic beverage prices, with beers in particular costing well below US$1 at most supermarkets and eateries.\n\nThe local government believes that such affordable prices have contributed to high consumption amongst consumers, and that it is now necessary to increase taxation on these drinks to ensure public health is not compromised.\n\n\u201cHigher taxation is necessary in order to reduce the consumption of alcohol in Vietnam,\u201d the local Ministry of Finance said via a formal statement outlining the draft regulations.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to gradually increase taxes to 100%, 70% and 100% eventually by 2030 \u2013 all of these are in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations to increase retail prices for alcohol by 10%.\u201d\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe general public and experts in Singapore raised several concerns over the consumption of cultivated meat, while also acknowledging it can play a crucial role in the City State\u2019s food security efforts.\n\nThese views were detailed in a study that aimed to investigate how both the public and experts perceive the risks and benefits of cultured meat on individual and societal levels.\n\nResearchers undertook four distinct online focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted between February and April 2022. Three FGDs involved participants from the general public, while the fourth included cultured meat experts. Each session, lasting approximately two hours, comprised nine to eleven participants.\n\nGiven Singapore\u2019s heavy reliance on imported food and its active promotion of novel food technology industries, including cultured meat, the market for such innovative foods is expanding, attracting more companies to the field.\n\nTrend: Viral trending product - Dubai Chocolate\n\nThe meteoric rise of FIX Dessert Chocolatier\u2019s chunky chocolate bars can be attributed to the growing influence of social media on purchasing decisions, exclusivity, and unique regional flavours, an analyst said earlier this year.\n\nFounded by Sarah Hamouda, the brand was launched in 2021 but only became viral this year \u2014 thanks to food influencer Maria Vehera, who filmed herself eating the chocolate bar and posted the video on TikTok, which garnered over 70 million views as of time of writing.\n\nSince then, people from all over the world shared their own reactions or tried to replicate the recipe at home, with the \u201cDubai chocolate fever\u201d spreading beyond the UAE to the US, Europe, and Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore.\n\nAccording to senior research analyst Monique Naval from Euromonitor International, this is the first time in recent years that a product from the Middle East has gained such global attention.\n\n\u201cWhile the Middle East has other unique chocolate offerings, such as chocolate-covered dates and camel chocolate, these have mostly been bought as souvenirs and their popularity have been rising organically over the years. In contrast, FIX\u2019s instant growth has been supported by social media and its limited production indicates exclusivity.\n\n\u201cThe increasing number of chocolatiers on social media has been driving consumer interest. With FIX\u2019s variety of filled chocolates going viral online, it showcases the growing influence of digital platforms in shaping modern confectionery trends,\u201d Naval told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based dairy brands in India are continuing to steer away from using conventional dairy terms on their product labels until regulators issue greater clarity on what is permitted.\n\nBack in 2020 and 2021, the Food Safety and Standards Authority India (FSSAI) announced a ban on the use of conventional dairy terms such as \u2018milk\u2019 and \u2018cheese\u2019 for plant-based products. It also directed plant-based manufacturers to modify the product labels of all such products and e-commerce platforms to delist these as well.\n\nThis order was successfully stayed by the Delhi High Court later in 2021 after five companies took action. Despite this, industry uncertainty remains today.\n\n\u201cThe ban is essentially still a motion in hearing at the court level at this time,\u201d Rohit Jain, Co-Founder and CEO of Drums Food International which was one of the five companies that contributed to the initial ban being stayed, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Healthier innovations\n\nGlobal food and beverage giant Nestle had its eye on expanding its premium and healthy ageing product portfolios in search of a return to \u2018normalised\u2019 growth.\n\nNestle announced its FY2023 full year financial results, reporting a -1.5% year-on-year decrease in sales to CHF93bn (US$) but an increase of 17.3% in underlying trade operating profits to CHF16.1bn (US$).\n\nIn the firm\u2019s financial results press conference which FoodNavigator-Asia attended, Nestle CFO Francois-Xavier Roger highlighted that overall organic growth for the company has been estimated at a 7.2% growth year-on-year \u2013 but that this was made up of 7.5% pricing growth and -0.3% of what the company calls Real Internal Growth (RIG), which is a measurement of growth generated by volume and mix/innovation.\n\nAcknowledging this as an unsustainable means to long-term growth, Nestle CEO Mark Schneider told the floor that the firm was committed to move back to RIG-led growth in 2024, laying out several strategies towards this.\n\n\u201cThe food sector softness that has been seen over past two years globally has come from a food price increase spike that is the highest we have seen in some 50 years since 1973 to 1974, coming in at a 14.7% spike which is the highest since the 16.3% we saw back then,\u201d Schneider told us.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based beverages may be considered suitable alternatives to their dairy counterparts but must overcome challenges related to flavour, consumer health, stability and nutrient dissolution, said researchers in Singapore, the UK and China.\n\nIn recent years, plant-based drinks have emerged as a diverse and popular choice, offering a range of nutritional benefits and catering to lactose-intolerant individuals, as well as vegans and vegetarians.\n\nNutrition-wise, plant-based drinks are said be a rich source of essential nutrients, including proteins, dietary fibre, fats, vitamins and minerals \u2014 beyond the calcium and protein associated with dairy milk.\n\nThese alternatives are typically derived from plant sources such as nuts, grains, legumes and seeds; examples include almond, soy, oat, rice and coconut drinks. Each variety usually has a unique flavour, texture, and nutritional composition, providing consumers with a broad array of choices to suit individual preferences and dietary needs.\n\nHowever, considerations such as amino acid profiles, digestibility and the presence of anti-nutritional factors should be taken into account.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nMembers of the Philippines government called for regulations that would officially ban manufacturers from using added sugar as an ingredient in foods for young children aged three and below.\n\nSweetness and sugar features strongly in many Filipino foods and can be exemplified by one of the country\u2019s most popular desserts halo-halo, which is an amalgamation of various sweetened ingredients including pudding, ice cream, multiple sweetened beans and tubers, sweetened purple yam paste, jellies, cheese and more over crushed ice \u2013 and then commonly topped off with coconut milk, evaporated milk, syrups or sometimes even table sugar.\n\nThis culminated in the rapid rise of obesity and overweight individuals in the Philippines over the past two decades, according to the national science agency Department of Science and Technology (DOST)\n\nAs of 2022 some 27 million Filipinos were either overweight or obese, with the percentage of this having nearly doubled from 20.2% in 1998 to 36.6% in 2019. Even more alarmingly, similar findings were observed in the younger generation where adolescent obesity and overweight rates also nearly doubled from 4.9% in 2003 to 11.6% in 2018.\n\n\u201cRecent data has found that young Filipinos are at a greater risk of obesity, due to the consumption of food that is energy-dense and nutrient-poor, exacerbated by growing urbanisation and increased incomes,\u201d Senator Imee R. Marcos highlighted to the Senate earlier this year when tabling the bill calling for a ban on using added sugar in food products for young children.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill seeks to ensure good nutrition, optimal child growth and development, and better health outcomes for children.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nSingapore cultivated seafood firm Umami Bioworks has highlighted its belief that strategic mergers are crucial to overcome doubts about the sector and achieve buy-in from major brands which can help the category scale-up.\n\nUmami Bioworks hit the news earlier this year for its merger with Shiok Meats, especially with both firms well-known for being cultivated seafood industry leaders and pioneers in their own right.\n\n\u201cThe M&A really came about when we saw that the market was unfortunately turning sour and sentiment was down during this trough of disillusionment period,\u201d Umami Bioworks CEO Mihir Pershad told FoodNavigator-Asia in an episode of our Food and Beverage Trailblazers podcast.\n\n\u201cWe know the market will come back once past this trough and that we will see recovery on the backside, but how good that recovery is and how long it will take is still to be seen so we needed to think about how to position the company to be in the best possible state to be the obvious choice for seafood industry incumbents to partner with both during this window and post-recovery.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe Thai government has published draft regulations on governance over the alternative proteins industry starting with the plant-based sector, and has suggested banning certain animal-related terms but allowing others.\n\nThis announcement was made by the Thailand Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Division earlier this year, which also established a special project research team to analyse types of standards and criteria that the regulations need to cover for the greatest efficiency.\n\n\u201cAt present, alternative protein products are seeing popularity amongst consumers and there are many such items on the market, but the control and supervision of the safety aspect of these in Thailand still has no clear direction,\u201d the Thai FDA stated via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe are embarking on a study of the current production and imports of alternative protein products in the country, and studying the related regulations [to apply this knowledge] in the development of regulations and standards in Thailand.\n\n\u201cThis will start with analysis of the plant-based protein sector in Thailand [before moving to] other alternative proteins such as insect-based, cultivated meat or fermentation.\u201d"

            "article_content": "It may be an overused statistic, but it\u2019s true: We know less about what lives and lurks in our oceans than we do about outer space. This year proved no exception to the rule, either. In the last year, researchers discovered long-lost shipwrecks, odd animals, and even a phenomenon known as \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d among many other finds.\n\n\u2018Ghost Ship of the Pacific\u2019 found using underwater drones\n\nThe USS Stewart rests about 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nIt only took a few hours for a team of 20-foot-long autonomous submersible drones to relocate the USS Stewart after 78 years spent at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The \u201cfour-piper\u201d destroyer ship was the only vessel captured by Japanese forces during World War II, and earned its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker after numerous Allied troops sighted it deep behind enemy lines. Although eventually returned to the US Navy and scuttled, its exact location remained a mystery for years. Now, however, we know the extremely well-preserved remains lay off the California coast in the Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary.\n\nShipwreck hunters find WWII-era merchant ship that sunk in Lake Superior\n\nThe wheel of the Arlington, about 600 feet underwater. Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society\n\nAlthough also dating back to the WWII era, the Arlington wasn\u2019t involved in combat when it sank. The 244-foot bulk carrier was instead a merchant vessel sailing Lake Superior en route to Owen Sound, Ontario. Inclement weather, however, caused the ship to take on water in the early hours of May 1. While Captain Frederick \u201cTatey Bug\u201d Burke insisted his crew stay the course, the sailors had other plans, and soon abandoned Burke to his\u2014and his ship\u2019s\u2014ultimate fate. Like the USS Stewart, the Arlington was located using remote operating submersibles and sonar scans.\n\nNew, colorful starfish species found off the coast of Japan\n\nThe newly discovered Paragonaster hoeimaruae. There are many types of starfish and this one is particularly adapted to living in sandy, muddy waters, a feature the researchers want to learn more about. Credit: \u00a9 I. Kobayashi\n\nThere are around 2,000 cataloged starfish species in the world, but that list grew by at least one new variety in 2024. Discovered by researchers off the coast of Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula, Paragonaster hoeimaruae, is only the second starfish known to belong to the Pseudarchasteridae family. The strikingly orange sea creatures are especially adapted to live in muddy, sandy waters\u2014an evolutionary trait researchers hope to learn more about in the coming years.\n\nGrumpy-faced fish species found in Red Sea\n\nThe grumpy dwarfgoby is endemic to the Red Sea and lives in small holes and crevices in coral reefs. Viktor Nunes Peinemann\n\nWhile similarly as orange as Paragonaster hoeimaruae, Sueviota aethon arguably features a much more noticeable physical trait: the diminutive fish possesses a downturned mouth that makes it look permanently displeased. Its face seems so irritated that it even earned it the common name of the grumpy dwarfgoby. The roughly one inch long fish live among the coral reefs of the Red Sea\u2019s Farasan Banks near Saudi Arabia. Even at that size, however, discoverers describe the grumpy dwarfgoby as a \u201cfearsome predator\u201d given its comparatively large canines used to capture and devour small invertebrates.\n\nWWII submarine discovered 81 years after disappearing during secret mission\n\nThe HMS Trooper disappeared in 1943 with all 64 of its crew. Credit: YouTube / Planet Blue\n\nIt took at least as many as 14 attempts over nearly 25 years, but researchers finally located the wreckage of the HMS Trooper in 2024. The WWII Allied submarine and its 64 crew members deployed on a secret mission near Greece in early October 1943, but never arrived in Beirut as originally scheduled. Researchers used both sonar and an ROV called \u201cSuper Achille\u201d to identify Trooper\u2019s whereabouts, as well as confirm its fatal run-in with a German mine. Trooper lays in three separate parts an estimated 830-feet-deep at the bottom of the Icarian Sea, near the Greek island of Donoussa.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest coral formation is longer than a blue whale\n\nA diver from National Geographic Pristine Seas measures the world\u2019s largest coral colony in the Solomon Islands. Photograph by Manu San F\u00e9lix, National Geographic Pristine Seas\n\nThe biggest animal in the world may be the blue whale, but researchers in 2024 determined that the biggest intertwined community of animals is undoubtedly the recently discovered Pavona clavus coral colony. Measuring in at 111 feet wide, 104 feet long, 18 feet high, and 600 feet around, the standalone coral system formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean over the last 300 years, and can even be seen from space.\n\nNew ghost shark species found in New Zealand\n\nThe newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish, Harriotta avia. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)\n\nGhost sharks, also known as \u201cspookfish,\u201d technically aren\u2019t sharks, but instead are a group of fish that are closely related to the ocean predators. One of the newest additions to the family this year was Harriotta avia, described as having an \u201celongated, narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes; and very long, broad pectoral fins\u201d as well as possessing \u201clovely chocolate brown color.\u201d But don\u2019t expect to encounter one in the open waters\u2014Harriotta avia lives near New Zealand at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 8,350 feet below surface waters.\n\n\u2018Dark oxygen\u2019 on ocean floor may rewrite the origins of life\n\nThe formations can be found as deep as 20,000 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Wikipedia Commons\n\nOne of the wildest underwater discoveries of 2024 wasn\u2019t a new species of life, but chemical processes that might rewrite our understanding of the origins of life itself. Earlier this year, researchers published findings related to polymetallic nodules\u2014natural mineral deposits located on the pitch-black ocean floor. Despite lacking sunlight, however, evidence suggests these formations appear to function as \u201cgeobatteries\u201d capable of generating trace amounts of oxygen that help sustain deep-sea life. If true, then the planet\u2019s very first living organisms may have gotten their start in a place no one once thought could support life at all.\n\nNew jellyfish discovered near Japan may contain multitudes of venom\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross medusa is about four inches wide, three inches long, and has about 240 tentacles. Dhugal John Lindsay/JAMSTEC\n\nLike many other similar species, the newly found St. George\u2019s cross medusa lives around 2,300 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, and hunts bioluminescent prey with its many tentacles. Unlike its relatives, however, Santjordia pagesi packs an \u201carsenal of venoms\u201d that differs from other known jellyfish. Unfortunately, it might take a little while before researchers start gleaning more information on the creature\u2014it\u2019s difficult to gather more specimens given the jellyfish lives in a deep-sea volcanic caldera about 285 miles south of Tokyo.\n\nResearchers discover neurological mechanism controlling anglerfish lures\n\nFrogfish belong to the larger anglerfish family, and use their front fin as a lure. Credit: Deposit Photos\n\nAnglerfish aren\u2019t a new find for researchers, but biologists did confirm a surprising evolutionary feature in the odd-looking animals this year. Using tracer analysis, a team discovered the exact motor neurons that control one of the subspecies\u2019 front dorsal fin lure. It appears the location of these motoneurons shifted during their evolution compared to their relatives, pointing to evolutionary implications that reach all the way to landwalking vertebrates.\n\nOver 100 possible new ocean species found near Chile\n\nDuring an expedition off the coasts of Chile and Rapa Nui, scientists spotted a bony Chaunacops fish swimming in the waters of Chile\u2019s Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe 1,800-mile-long Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge near Chile is home to some wild creatures that look like they just arrived from an alien planet. Earlier this year, researchers used a remote operated submersible to survey the region and documented over 100 candidates for never-before-seen species. These included crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and even marine mammals. Biologists also glimpsed extremely rare animals, such as the whiplash squid."

A study in Science Advances reveals 6.2 trillion tons of hydrogen trapped underground. This discovery could meet energy demands for 200 years.\n\nThe study, titled \"Model Predictions of Global Geologic Hydrogen Resources,\" was published on December 13. It estimates the hydrogen reserve to be 26 times larger than known oil deposits. Despite this, the exact locations of these reserves remain unknown.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHydrogen, a light and abundant element, shows immense energy potential. Governments are exploring it as a cleaner alternative to oil and gas. According to the study, hydrogen may meet 30 per cent of energy needs by 2050. Demand is projected to grow fivefold within three decades.\n\nRead Also: Asteroid alert for Christmas Eve: 120-foot asteroid to zoom past Earth at alarming speed, confirms NASA\n\n\"The global hydrogen demand could hit 500 Mt yearly by 2050,\" the study noted. \"Extracting just 2% of this reserve would satisfy demands for 200 years.\"\n\nPrevious Assumptions Challenged\n\nFor years, experts believed hydrogen escaped through rock pores. The study challenges this notion with evidence of underground reservoirs. Examples include discoveries in Albanian chromium mines and West Africa.\n\nGeoffrey Ellis, lead author and a US Geological Survey geochemist, told Live Science, \"The findings surprised us. There\u2019s more hydrogen than we imagined.\" He added, \"We don\u2019t need external energy sources; it\u2019s stored underground.\"\n\nA Promising Energy Shift\n\nHydrogen is gaining traction for its potential to replace fossil fuels. Unlike blue or green hydrogen, natural hydrogen doesn\u2019t require additional energy or storage solutions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRead Also: New study reveals Moon's actual age, saying it is 100 million years older than previously thought\n\nEllis emphasised, \"Storage isn\u2019t an issue with natural hydrogen reservoirs.\" However, the primary challenge remains economic feasibility. Developing cost-effective extraction methods is vital to attract investment.\n\nThe discovery brings optimism but requires further exploration. Scientists must locate reserves and address technical challenges. This development could mark a pivotal step in global energy evolution."

            "article_content": "Today, the push for efficiency is more than just a goal- it's a necessity. Organizations are accelerating efforts to streamline processes, empower teams, and boost productivity to stay ahead of the curve. When workflows are streamlined, productivity increases, enabling organizations to scale effectively and adapt to the demands of an evolving market. AI is fundamentally centered on data\u2014training on the right data, ensuring secure access, and continuously refining this data is critical to meaningful AI-driven insights and automation success. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 30% of enterprises will automate over half of their network activities, reflecting a shift toward automation-driven efficiency. This trend not only enhances daily operations but also fosters a culture of growth and innovation, essential for staying competitive in a data-centric landscape.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nData services are an essential part of this transformation. They are persistent data storage services that bring powerful no-code data modeling and storage capabilities to your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects. Whether it\u2019s managing large data sets, automating data analysis, or simplifying access across departments, data services streamline the flow of information throughout an organization. They fit seamlessly into automation strategies, helping to reduce the manual effort needed for data handling and providing a foundation for predictive analytics, personalized customer experiences, and process improvements.\n\nThe Role of No-Code Data Services in Modern Automation\n\nTraditionally, handling data required technical expertise and complex configurations, which became even more challenging amid a talent shortage in automation-ready skills. No-code data services address this gap by offering a user-friendly approach that empowers business users, or citizen developers, to drive automation projects independently. Through simple, drag-and-drop functionality, data sets, files, and resources can be seamlessly incorporated into workflows without coding, while security and data consistency are maintained automatically.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAs organizations increasingly adopt automation, a no-code approach in data services becomes pivotal. It enables seamless integration with existing automation tools, allowing teams to manage, analyze, and access data across departments without relying heavily on IT support. By simplifying data handling, no-code data services make information more accessible and actionable, equipping organizations to provide real-time insights and solutions.\n\nA Practical Example: Monthly Financial Reporting\n\nIn monthly financial reporting, data from multiple systems, including bookings, invoices, billings, and payments, must be gathered. Without a centralized solution, both attended and unattended workflows retrieve data individually, requiring users to access all backend systems, leading to delays and potential inconsistencies. By setting up an unattended workflow to gather data in Data Service, other workflows can access this information consistently and efficiently. This eliminates the need for multiple data pulls, streamlines the reporting process, and mitigates issues related to data changes during the reporting cycle. Moreover, it removes the need to store aggregated data locally, enhancing data security and consistency across systems.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHow Enterprises Benefit from No-Code Data Services\n\nUnified Data Integration for Seamless Access: These services simplify the process of integrating data from disparate sources. By consolidating data from legacy platforms, enterprise systems, and custom applications into a single, secure repository, businesses can maintain data consistency and reliability across automations.\n\nStreamlined Data Reusability Across Automations: No-code data services offer a centralized data hub that makes information accessible and reusable across multiple automation projects. This eliminates the need for building separate connections for each workflow, enabling consistent data schemas and shareable variables through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.\n\nScaling with Growth: As automation initiatives expand, the demand for scalable data solutions grows. No-code data services provide limitless capacity through secure platforms like Automation Cloud, allowing businesses to confidently scale their automation projects without sacrificing performance or security.\n\nEnhanced Security and Governance: Security remains a priority in a data-driven world. No-code data services help mitigate risks by transitioning sensitive information from local systems to a secure, centralized platform. With role-based access controls, organizations can manage data access and usage, ensuring that data governance remains intact.\n\nNo-Code as a Launchpad for Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nCitizen developers are crucial players in the digital transformation journey. Through no-code data services, employees in finance, marketing, HR, and customer service can independently create automated solutions, significantly enhancing productivity for themselves and their teams. With their deep understanding of daily operations and the potential impact of automation, they drive efficiency from the ground up, fostering continuous innovation and improvement.\n\nBy 2025, Gartner anticipates that 70% of new enterprise applications will harness low-code or no-code technologies\u2014a significant move reshaping the future of software development. This shift isn\u2019t just about innovation; it's a game-changer, empowering teams to drive transformation at pace, with greater flexibility and responsiveness. As organizations embrace these dynamic solutions, they\u2019re not only streamlining operations but also paving the way for transformative breakthroughs that redefine their impact.\n\nAttributed to Prashant Momaya, Senior Director of Sales Engineering, UiPath India"

            "article_content": "ETtech\n\nVenture capital investors are bullish on application-layer artificial intelligence (AI) startups in India despite an overall fall in funding amount for companies in the sector this year. According to data from Venture Intelligence, Indian AI startups raised $747 million in 2024, down 26% from last year but the number of deals in the space increased to 121 from 78 in 2023.\u201cThis year, we saw many companies building vertical AI applications by leveraging more mature platforms to build on top of that,\u201d said Ravi Srivastava, partner at early-stage investment firm Leo Capital.There are broadly three layers in the AI stack\u2014the foundational models, horizontal layers called enablers, and vertical AI applications. Leo Capital closed multiple deals in the AI and enterprise space this year, including Zeplyn, an AI copilot platform for financial advisors, Arch0, a cloud infrastructure security startup, and DecoverAI--a platform built for the legal community.Notably, several AI startups being backed by investors in India are building in the US. Peak XV Partners managing director Harshjit Sethi, who focuses on AI investments for the VC firm, said that AI startups are expected to follow the trend set by enterprise software companies, which mostly build for US customers.\u201cWhat we should expect to see, and my hope for next year, is that there will be many more interesting application layer opportunities,\u201d said Sethi. \u201cTaking the capabilities of AI and translating them into what it means for each of our roles, I think that gap will be something companies will look to address, particularly those in India.\u201dAccording to Tracxn, Peak XV Partners, through its various programmes and the main fund, backed 13 startups building in AI space this year, including Enterpret, RapidCanvas, OrbitShift and Brainfish. Peak XV also participated in the $105 million round for SaaS startup Atlan, which is aiming to capitalise on the opportunity from large corporations looking to make their databases suitable for artificial intelligence.In addition to a series of small-cheque deals in the AI space this year, some of the larger deals included Mukesh Bansal-founded enterprise AI assistant platform Nurix AI, AI cloud and platform-as-a-service startup Neysa, and Bhavish Aggarwal-led Krutrim AI, which became a unicorn, a privately-held company valued at $1 billion or more.Industry executives said in addition to the application layer, the opportunity for India is in the infrastructure layer, having missed the chance to compete on foundational models that are largely being developed in the US by large companies such as OpenAI, Meta, Google and Anthropic, which have raised billions of dollars in funding.Neysa, which operates in the infrastructure layer, offers generative AI platforms and services to assist clients in managing AI projects. It raised $50 million this year across two rounds . Founder Sharad Sanghi pointed out that while the process was easier for them due to his experience with data centre services provider Netmagic, building the infrastructure layer is challenging for new startups. As a result, most new AI startups are focusing on consumer and enterprise applications.\u201cBecause of our relationship with NTT and my experience founding Netmagic, I had access to data center space and power, which not everyone has. Access to capital is also crucial, as well as access to the right talent. You need highly skilled engineers on both the infrastructure and platform side. This talent is available, but it's expensive and hard to attract,\u201d he told ET.The Indian government took a major step by approving a Rs 10,372-crore allocation for the India AI Mission for the next five years, focusing on building computing infrastructure through public-private partnerships.However, VCs are of the view that the hype over AI has created a glut at the inception stage with regard to the applications layer.\u201cTechnology is changing so rapidly that the notion of \u2018problem\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 is getting redefined every quarter,\u201d said Alok Goyal, partner, Stellaris Venture Partners. \u201cIt is not clear if what is differentiated today will remain so in just a few months. Secondly, entry barriers have become much lower, and hence in every space, there is a clutter at the inception stage of the category itself. This is particularly so for AI applications.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In the wake of canceling its hyped car project, a hard setback with an iPhone subscription service, and delays with AI feature rollout, it seems Apple has found a new sweet spot for product development in the smart home segment. According to Bloomberg, the company is working on a smart doorbell with Face ID authentication support.\n\nApple is already rumored to be working on an iPad-like smart home device that will serve as a home hub for other connected devices as well. Now, the folks over at Cupertino are eyeing a niche that will integrate well within the HomeKit portfolio.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBloomberg\u2019s report describes it as a \u201csmart doorbell with advanced facial recognition that wirelessly connects to a deadbolt lock.\u201d The concept is pretty straightforward. Apple aims to bring its fast and reliable biometric authentication convenience to a doorbell.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nAt the moment, the segment is dominated by the likes of Amazon, Google, Eufy, and Logitech. The Nest Doorbell and Amazon Blink, in particular, often find their way to the top of the recommendation list for buyers. It\u2019s, therefore, no surprise why Apple would want to flex its way into the fray, especially when it has the tech stack, talent, and supply chain at its disposal.\n\nNow, the Face ID-ready doorbell project is in the early stages of development, which means its market arrival is neither close nor certain. According to a report that cites internal sources, enthusiasts should not expect to see anything on the market by the end of the year \u2014 at the earliest.\n\nThere is another probability. Instead of developing a hardware product of its own, Apple could very well outsource it to a third-party partner like Logitech or Belkin. That wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Take, for example, the Vision Pro, which sells a head strap for the headset straight from Apple\u2019s online store.\n\nThe upcoming device could be yet another host for the company\u2019s in-house combined chip for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which is reportedly making a debut in 2025 with the refreshed HomePod Mini and Apple TV models. The chip is apparently code-named Proxima and will reportedly be made by longtime partner TSMC.\n\nNow, a smart doorbell sounds like an obvious step in the right direction and could stand out with its facial recognition perk. Notably, the company already has the infrastructure ready (and is rapidly developing it with upcoming products) with a software stack in HomeKit that has already been embraced by various brands.\n\nIn addition, the upcoming home hub device that borrows from the iPad aesthetics will also run software that will connect with a whole bunch of other devices. It will also tap into the FaceTime system for videoconferencing. It won\u2019t be surprising to see it play nice with the upcoming smart doorbell camera via its video relay lane.\n\nThere are, however, a handful of concerns with the doorbell endeavor. Chief among them are chances of failure, especially when it comes to the possibility of an intruder somehow making it past the guardrails. The recent cases of abuse involving the AirTag tracker by bad actors is an example of one such scenario.\n\nApple has traditionally played it safe when it comes to user privacy and safety and has tried to skirt past such controversies to the best of its capabilities. So, there is a high chance that the company takes its own sweet time bringing the smart doorbell to the market or simply decides to offload the whole premise to other brands while milking royalty."

            "article_content": "Palantir and Anduril, two of the largest US defence technology companies, are in talks with about a dozen competitors to form a consortium that will jointly bid for US government work in an effort to disrupt the country\u2019s oligopoly of \u201cprime\u201d contractors.\n\nThe consortium is planning to announce as early as January that it has reached agreements with a number of tech groups. Companies in talks to join include Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, ChatGPT maker OpenAI, autonomous-ship builder Saronic and artificial intelligence data group Scale AI, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n\u201cWe are working together to provide a new generation of defence contractors,\u201d said one person involved in developing the group.\n\nPalantir\u2019s share price has skyrocketed by 300 per cent in the past year, giving the company a market capitalisation of $169bn \u2013 larger than Lockheed Martin. The company\u2019s artificial intelligence tools have reportedly been used in Gaza to identify lists of targets for Israeli drones and air strikes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe data intelligence group was cofounded by tech investor Peter Thiel, who also provided the initial backing for Anduril, which launched in 2017 and was this year valued at $14bn.\n\nPalantir came to prominence earlier this month in Ireland when it emerged that Social Democrats TD Eoin Hayes, who previously worked for the company, sold Palantir shares worth \u20ac199,000 after he became a councillor in July, later than he had previously claimed. The TD was subsequently suspended by the Social Democrats.\n\n[ Palantir, company at centre of row surrounding TD Eoin Hayes, is no stranger to controversy at home or abroadOpens in new window ]\n\nThe emergence of the consortium comes as tech companies seek to grab a bigger slice of the US government\u2019s huge $850bn defence budget from traditional prime contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing. The consortium will bring together the heft of some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most valuable companies and will leverage their products to provide a more efficient way of supplying the US government with cutting-edge defence and weapons capabilities, according to a second person involved.\n\nIt comes as defence tech start-ups have attracted record amounts of funding this year, as investors bet they will be among the winners of higher federal spending on national security, immigration and space exploration under Donald Trump\u2019s incoming government.\n\nWars in Ukraine and the Middle East and geopolitical tensions between the US and China have heightened the government\u2019s reliance on tech companies developing advanced AI products that can be used for military purposes, and encouraged investors to the sector.\n\nSpaceX was valued at $350bn this month, making it the world\u2019s largest private start-up, and OpenAI has soared to a valuation of $157bn since it was founded in 2015. Each of the companies has attempted to grab a slice of the US defence budget. While SpaceX and Palantir have won large public contracts going back two decades, some are newer to government procurement.\n\nOpenAI recently updated its terms of service this year to no longer explicitly prohibit the use of its AI tools for military purposes.\n\nUS defence procurement has long been criticised as slow and anticompetitive, favouring a small number of decades-old primes, such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing. These vast conglomerates typically produce ships, tanks and aircraft that are costly and take years to design and manufacture.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s burgeoning defence industry has prioritised producing smaller, cheaper, autonomous weapons that they claim will better protect the US and its allies in a modern conflict. One person involved in developing the consortium described it as \u201caligning industry\u201d in order to \u201cexecute the technical priorities of the Department of Defense\u201d and \u201csolve critical software capability problems\u201d. Some tie-ups between the tech groups expected to be in the consortium have already been agreed and integration work will begin immediately.\n\nPalantir\u2019s \u201cAI Platform\u201d, which delivers cloud-based data processing, was this month integrated with Anduril\u2019s autonomous software, \u201cLattice\u201d, to deliver AI for national security purposes. Similarly, Anduril combined its counter-drone defence systems with OpenAI\u2019s advanced AI models to jointly work on US government contracts related to \u201caerial threats\u201d.\n\nA joint statement from Anduril and OpenAI about that partnership said it \u201caims to ensure that the US Department of Defense and intelligence community have access to the most advanced, effective, and safe AI-driven technologies available in the world\u201d.\n\nAnduril, OpenAI and Scale AI declined to comment on the development of the consortium. Palantir, SpaceX and Saronic did not respond to requests for comment. \u2013 Financial Times"

Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 3 \u2013 The Conflict kicked off its highly anticipated return with the Fall 2024 anime schedule, and fans have gotten to see the first half of the final fights between the Soul Reapers and the Quincies. Now this batch of episodes is finally coming to an end, and it\u2019s setting up the real final slate of what\u2019s to come.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 3 \u2013 The Conflict will be airing a special double episode finale event to bring this newest part to an end, and the anime is helping fans get ready with a special new trailer showing off some of the biggest moments from Part 3 so far. The anime not only showcases everything big that has happened so far, but the new trailer also sneaks in the first look at what to expect from the final episode. You can check out the new Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 3 trailer in the video above.\n\nViz Media / Pierrot Films\n\nHow Will Bleach: TYBW Part 3 End?\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 3 \u2013 The Conflict will be officially coming to an end on Saturday, December 28th. This will be a double airing of the final two episodes of the season with Episodes 39 and 40 packed together in a special hour long event. This final episode of the season teases more of Jugram Haschwalt, and it will be digging into his shared past with Bazz B. This final episode is teasing some moments that weren\u2019t seen in Tite Kubo\u2019s original manga, and that\u2019s been par for the course for the new anime\u2019s run as a whole.\n\nJoining the voice cast for these final episodes are Marina Inoue as the young Jugram, and Chiaki Kobayashi as the young Bazz-B. The new finale will be streaming exclusively with Hulu in the United States when it hits and on Disney+ in international territories. But as the special teaser shows, it\u2019s not just a look into Jugram\u2019s past either. Uryu Ishida\u2019s turning to the Quincies\u2019 side has been a major part of the titular \u201cconflict\u201d in this wave of episodes, and it seems like that\u2019s finally coming to a head with the finale.\n\nViz Media / Pierrot Films\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Bleach: TYBW?\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War was originally announced to be a four cour long series with breaks in between, and with the end of the third wave of episodes, it means that there is really only one part left before it all comes to an end. This new anime has been the long in the works and highly requested adaptation from fans as it\u2019s been bringing the final arc from Tite Kubo\u2019s original Bleach manga to life at last. There are still some big moments that we\u2019ve been waiting to see, and they all hit in the last batch of episodes.\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War has yet to confirm a potential release window or date for Part 4 of the anime as of the time of this publication, but an announcement will likely come after the finale. It\u2019s been the case with the previous Part finales in the past, so a Part 4 confirmation is highly likely to follow in that pattern. Either way, we\u2019re one big step to bringing it all to an end decades after the original Bleach anime came to its truncated end."

            "article_content": "LONDON: A US$93bil plunge in Novo Nordisk A/S shares has provided the latest blow to Europe\u2019s largest listed companies, which have spent another year struggling in vain to match the returns of Wall Street\u2019s biggest stocks.\n\nWhile the top 10 US stocks have notched double-digit returns in 2024, powered by the so-called Magnificent Seven, six of Europe\u2019s biggest names are in the red.\n\nThey include Ozempic maker Novo, whose gains for the year were fully erased in last Friday\u2019s selloff, as well as Nestle SA and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA.\n\nAll that has put the Stoxx Europe 600 index on course for its worst performance relative to the S&P 500 in almost a quarter century.\n\nAnd a basket of sector-dominant European stocks compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc has fared even worse, lagging the Stoxx for the first time since 2017.\n\n\u201cTo a large degree, the Magnificent Seven carried the S&P 500,\u201d Morningstar strategist Michael Field said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have big companies in Europe, but the scale difference is so huge.\u201d\n\nEuropean heavyweights suffer two disadvantages.\n\nOne, as Field points out, is size.\n\nGoldman\u2019s large-cap basket \u2013 dubbed the Granolas \u2013 is cumulatively worth some US$2.5 trillion, while the Magnificent Seven have added about US$5 trillion this year alone, taking their combined value past US$16 trillion.\n\nSecond, so-called old economy stocks dominate European large-cap ranks.\n\nThe 11-member Granolas basket contains only two tech-related names, SAP SE and ASML Holding NV.\n\nSectors such as autos, industrials and miners are usually heavily exposed to the ebb and flow of economic cycles.\n\nLuxury stocks, for instance, have been hit hard by China\u2019s consumer slowdown, while at Nestle, faltering sales growth has put shares on track for their worst year on record.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental structural issue in Europe in that it doesn\u2019t have global champions really, and it certainly doesn\u2019t have global champions in the hottest part of the market \u2013 technology and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Co.\n\nThere are some signs of unease over the Magnificent Seven\u2019s blistering rally \u2013 and their dominance of benchmarks.\n\nFor instance, Matthew Cioppa, portfolio manager of the Franklin Technology Fund, said he is happy to own some Magnificent Seven stocks, but also has significant exposure to smaller, software names.\n\nMany also expect green shoots in Europe, citing cheap valuations, the likelihood of a Chinese stimulus bazooka and a possible spending pick-up in Germany.\n\nSo could things change next year? Strategists polled by Bloomberg reckon not, forecasting Wall Street to triumph again in 2025.\n\nWhile some see President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies as a plus for the Magnificent Seven, their consistent profit growth is likely a bigger draw.\n\nEarnings are forecast to rise about 15.7% next year, versus the 9.9% expected for the Granalos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn a period of time when macroeconomic growth has been pretty unexciting and other sectors have had their challenges, that reliability of earnings delivery has given the market confidence in US tech,\u201d said Iain Barnes, chief investment officer at Netwealth Investments Ltd.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t see that from other markets,\u201d he added. \u2014 Bloomberg"

            "article_content": "Most people invest in stocks online, through a brokerage account. You can also purchase funds, which hold many different stocks within one investment.\n\nIf a stock you own becomes more valuable, you could earn a profit if you decide to sell it to another investor.\n\nInvesting in stocks means buying shares of ownership in a public company. Those shares are called stock.\n\nWhen you invest in a stock, you\u2019re hoping the company grows and performs well over time. That's how you end up making money.\n\nOne of the best ways for beginners to learn how to invest in stocks is to put money in an online investment account and purchase stocks from there.\n\nYou don't have to have a lot of money to start investing. Many brokerages allow you to open an investing account with $0, and then you just have to purchase stock. Some brokers also offer paper trading, which lets you learn how to buy and sell with stock market simulators before you invest any real money.\n\n\u00bb Don't have a brokerage account? Learn what it is and how to open one.\n\nHow to invest in stocks in 7 steps\n\nTo invest in stocks, open an online brokerage account, add money to the account, and purchase stocks or stock-based funds from there. You can also invest in stocks through a robo-advisor or a financial advisor.\n\n\u00bb Ready to invest? Check out the best online brokers for stock trading\n\nIf you're ready to invest in stocks yourself, this process may help you get started.\n\n1. Decide if you want to invest on your own or with help\n\nThere are several ways to approach stock investing. Choose the option below that best describes how hands-on you'd like to be.\n\nA. \"I want to practice investing before I use real money.\"\n\nWe get it, investing can be nerve-wracking! If you want to practice before you put your hard-earned cash on the line you can open a paper trading account and invest with fake money until you get the hang of it.\n\n\u00bb Check out our roundup of the best paper trading accounts\n\nB. \"I'd like to choose stocks and stock funds on my own.\"\n\nKeep reading. This article breaks down how to choose the right account for your needs and how to pick and manage particular investments.\n\nC. \"I don't care about picking investments and I could use some help.\"\n\nYou may be a good candidate for a robo-advisor, a service that invests your money for you for a small fee. Virtually all of the major brokerage firms and many independent advisors offer these services. We'll cover investing through a robo-advisor in the next section.\n\nC. \u201cI\u2019d like to start investing in my workplace 401(k).\u201d\n\nThis is one of the most common ways for beginners to start investing.\n\nThis may be a great option for most people who have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k) because many plans offer a match. Employer matches are basically free money: If your employer offers a 4% match and you make $100,000 a year, if you contribute $4,000 to your 401(k) so will your employer. That means you get $4,000 for free.\n\n\u00bb Learn more about 401(k) plans\n\n2. Choose a broker or robo-advisor\n\nOnce you know how you want to invest, you're ready to choose your broker or robo-advisor.\n\nA. You're investing on your own\n\nIf you're investing on your own, you'll need to figure out what broker you want to open that account with. Some brokers, like Fidelity, are famous for their many years in business and 24/7 customer support. Others, like Robinhood, are known for their easy-to-use platforms. You'll want to evaluate brokers based on factors such as costs, investment selection, investor research, tools and customer service access. Maybe you'll want to open a brokerage account where you already have a bank account, which can help you see all your finances in one place.\n\n\u00bb Ready to invest? Here's the best online brokers\n\nB. You're investing through a robo-advisor\n\nIf you're investing through a robo-advisor, you'll have to figure out which one to work with. Similar to shopping for a broker, there are pros and cons to each. Some robo-advisors have very low fees, while others let you talk with a financial advisor for free. It's a good idea to compare robo-advisors to see which ones offer the services you need. Most robo-advisors charge about 0.25% of your account balance.\n\n\u00bb View our picks for the best robo-advisors\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Keep in mind, an investment account is just an account, it's not an investment. You have to add money to it and then purchase investments from there in order to have your money grow in value.\n\n3. Pick a type of investment account\n\nWhether you're investing on your own or through a robo-advisor, you'll have to choose the type of investment account you want to open. There are several types of investment accounts, and it's a good idea to figure out which account is right for you. For example, a Roth IRA comes with significant tax benefits while a standard brokerage account does not.\n\nYou'll have to have some personal information available, including your social security number, and it will probably take around 20 minutes to open the account. With some brokerages and robo-advisors, it can take a few days to connect your bank account, so you may have to wait before you can start buying investments.\n\nIf you choose to open an account at a robo-advisor, you probably don't need to read further in this article \u2014 the rest is just for those DIY types.\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Pro Public NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

For most people, stock market investing means choosing among these two investment types:\n\nStock mutual funds or exchange-traded funds\n\nMutual funds let you purchase small pieces of many different stocks in a single transaction. Index funds and ETFs are a kind of mutual fund that track an index; for example, a S&P 500 fund replicates that index by buying the stock of the companies in it.\n\nWhen you invest in a fund, you also own small pieces of each of those companies. You can put several funds together to build a diversified portfolio. Note that stock mutual funds are also sometimes called equity mutual funds.\n\nIndividual stocks\n\nIf you\u2019re after a specific company, you can buy a single share or a few shares as a way to dip your toe into the stock-trading waters. Building a diversified portfolio out of many individual stocks is possible, but it takes a significant investment and research.\n\nIf you go this route, remember that individual stocks will have ups and downs. If you research a company and choose to invest in it, think about why you picked that company in the first place if jitters start to set in on a down day.\n\n\u00bb Learn how to research stocks\n\nThe upside of stock mutual funds is that they are inherently diversified, which reduces your risk. For the vast majority of investors \u2014 particularly those who are investing their retirement savings \u2014 a portfolio made up of mostly mutual funds is the clear choice.\n\nBut mutual funds are unlikely to rise in meteoric fashion as some individual stocks might. The upside of individual stocks is that a wise pick can pay off handsomely, but the odds that any individual stock will make you rich are exceedingly slim.\n\n5. Set a budget for your stock market investment\n\nNew investors often have two questions in this step of the process:\n\nHow much money do I need to start investing in stocks?\n\nThe amount of money you need to buy an individual stock depends on how expensive the shares are. (Share prices can range from just a few dollars to a few thousand dollars.) Some brokerages allow you to invest with fractional shares. Simply put, you can choose a dollar amount and invest that despite the fact that the share price might be greater than what you have (which means you can owe a fraction of a stock).\n\nIf you want mutual funds and have a small budget, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be your best bet. Mutual funds often have minimums of $1,000 or more, but ETFs trade like a stock, which means you purchase them for a share price \u2014 in some cases, less than $100).\n\nHow much money should I invest in stocks?\n\nIf you\u2019re investing through funds \u2014 have we mentioned this is the preference of most financial advisors? \u2014 you can allocate a fairly large portion of your portfolio toward stock funds, especially if you have a long time horizon.\n\nA 30-year-old investing for retirement might have 80% of their portfolio in stock funds; the rest would be in bond funds. Individual stocks are another story. A general rule of thumb is to keep these to a small portion of your investment portfolio.\n\n6. Focus on investing for the long-term\n\nStock market investments have proven to be one of the best ways to grow long-term wealth. Over several decades, the average stock market return is about 10% per year. However, remember that\u2019s just an average across the entire market \u2014 some years will be up, some down and individual stocks will vary in their returns.\n\nFor long-term investors, the stock market is a good investment no matter what\u2019s happening day-to-day or year-to-year; it\u2019s that long-term average they\u2019re looking for.\n\nThe best thing to do after you start investing in stocks or mutual funds may be the hardest: Don\u2019t look at them. Unless you\u2019re trying to beat the odds and succeed at day trading, it\u2019s good to avoid the habit of compulsively checking how your stocks are doing several times a day, every day.\n\n7. Manage your stock portfolio\n\nWhile fretting over daily fluctuations won\u2019t do much for your portfolio\u2019s health \u2014 or your own \u2014 there will of course be times when you\u2019ll need to check in on your stocks or other investments.\n\nIf you follow the steps above to buy mutual funds and individual stocks over time, you\u2019ll want to revisit your portfolio a few times a year to make sure it\u2019s still in line with your investment goals.\n\nA few things to consider: If you\u2019re approaching retirement, you may want to move some of your stock investments over to more conservative fixed-income investments. If your portfolio is too heavily weighted in one sector or industry, consider buying stocks or funds in a different sector to build more diversification.\n\nFinally, pay attention to geographic diversification, too. Vanguard recommends international stocks make up as much as 40% of the stocks in your portfolio. You can purchase international stock mutual funds to get this exposure.\n\nBest stocks for beginners\n\nThe process of picking stocks can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. After all, there are thousands of stocks listed on the major U.S. exchanges.\n\nStock investing is filled with intricate strategies and approaches, yet some of the most successful investors have done little more than stick with stock market basics.\n\nThat generally means using funds for the bulk of your portfolio \u2014 Warren Buffett has famously said a low-cost S&P 500 ETF is the best investment most Americans can make \u2014 and choosing individual stocks only if you believe in the company\u2019s potential for long-term growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 is an index consisting of about 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. Over the last 50 years, its average annual return has been more or less the same as that of the market as a whole \u2014 about 10%.\n\nThe bottom line on investing in stocks\n\nLearning how to invest in stocks can be daunting for beginners, but it\u2019s really just a matter of figuring out which investment approach you want to use, what kind of account makes sense for you, and how much money you should put into stocks.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip If you're tempted to open a brokerage account but need more advice on choosing the right one, see our latest roundup of the best brokers for stock investors.

            "article_content": "The \u20b9179-crore initial public offering (IPO) of packaging machinery manufacturer Mamata Machinery Ltd. was subscribed nearly 85 times so far on its final day of bidding on Monday, December 23.Subscriptions from retail investors stood at 89.84 times, while non-institutional investors had subscribed 159.59 times on the final day. Meanwhile, qualified institutional buyers subscribed to 17.84 times the allotted portion.The grey market premium (GMP) of Mamata Machinery is trading in the price range of \u20b9250 to \u20b9260 in the unlisted market. It implies a massive premium of nearly 110% when compared to the issue price of \u20b9243.However, it is important to note that grey market premiums are just an indicator of how the company's shares are stacked up in the unlisted market and are subject to change rapidly.Analysts mostly advised investors to subscribe to the issue, considering the IPO is fairly priced and that the company enjoys a niche place in innovative plastic bags and pouch making machines, packaging machines, and extrusion equipment.The Gujarat-based company is selling its shares in the price range of \u20b9230-243 apiece, where investors can place bids for 61 equity shares in one lot and in multiples thereafter.The IPO is entirely an offer-for-sale (OFS) of 73.82 lakh equity shares, by promoters, worth \u20b9179.38 crore at the upper end of the price band.Since it\u2019s an OFS, the company will not receive any proceeds from the public issue, and the entire fund will go to the selling shareholders.The company said that the objective of the initial share sale is to gain the advantages of listing the equity shares on the stock exchanges.Additionally, the company anticipates that listing the equity shares will boost its visibility and brand image, provide liquidity to its shareholders, and establish a public market for the equity shares.At the upper end of the price band, the company\u2019s market capitalisation has been pegged at close to \u20b9600 crore.Mamata Machinery has already raised over \u20b953 crore from anchor investors ahead of its issue opening. 3P India Equity Fund, Authum Investment and Infrastructure, Winro Commercial (India) Ltd, Subhkam Ventures, Chartered Finance and Leasing, Belgrave Investment Fund and Aarth AIF are the funds that have been allocated shares.Incorporated in 1979, Mamata Machinery manufactures and exports plastic bags and pouch making machines, packaging machines and extrusion equipment. It provides end-to-end manufacturing solutions for the packaging industry. Products manufactured using its machines are used across several industries as packaging applications, such as the packing of food and FMCG products.It primarily sells packaging machinery to direct consumer brands catering to the FMCG, Food, & Beverage Industry and bag and pouch making machines to convertors and service providers who, in turn, mainly catering the FMCG and consumer industry. MML\u2019s machineries are also utilized in non-packaging applications, such as e-commerce bags and garment packaging bags.In FY24, Mamata's revenue from operations surged to \u20b9237 crore from \u20b9201 crore a year ago. The profit after tax in the same period rose to \u20b936.1 crore.Beeline Capital Advisors is the sole book-running lead manager to the issue, while Link Intime India Private Ltd is the registrar. The equity shares are expected to be listed on December 27 on the BSE and NSE."

            "article_content": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a global leader in IT services, consulting, and business solutions, has announced its 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook, a list of technology trends and focus areas curated by TCS experts.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI), cloud security, and supply chain resilience will be key for organizations to effectively navigate the threat landscape in the coming year.\n\nAs next-gen technologies continue to gain momentum across industries, they give rise to new and complex threats. Experts and leaders at TCS have identified seven focus areas that will influence cybersecurity and help organizations prioritize their security investments to prepare for increasing cyberattacks.\n\nIn the face of emerging cyberthreats, enterprises are looking for ways to leverage GenAI to secure their businesses, according to TCS\u2019 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook. The cybersecurity trends to look out for in 2025 are:\n\nInfluence of GenAI in cybersecurity on the rise: GenAI is transforming organizational operations but is also being exploited by cybercriminals for advanced attacks like deepfakes, phishing, data manipulation, and new malware. In response, organizations must fight fire with fire by deploying GenAI-powered threat detection and response systems.\n\nCloud security remains crucial: As cloud computing adoption continues to accelerate, organizations need to implement strong security protocols like encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring. Maintaining proper cloud configurations is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and breaches, and those moving to multi-cloud or hybrid environments will need to adapt their security measures accordingly.\n\nElastic supply chains will be relevant for operational integrity: In 2025, organizations will need flexible, resilient supply chains due to changing geopolitics and partner ecosystems. Leaders must develop proactive strategies to adjust their supply networks, while protecting sensitive data and maintaining regulatory compliance. Enhancing supply chain resilience will be increasingly vital for preserving operational integrity in the face of uncertainty.\n\nEmerging business models will underscore the need to be secure by design: At a time when digital technologies, IoT capabilities, and advanced connectivity are driving new business models in EV charging, DERMS, autonomous vehicles, and other connected factories, organizations must secure their value chains to ensure these businesses are safe by design. By 2025, the growth of IoT devices will require stronger device hardening, secure communication channels, and ongoing vulnerability assessments to maintain momentum in business growth.\n\nCybersecurity Mesh Architecture will pave the way for Zero Trust security: Organizations are moving from traditional security models to zero-trust architecture, which requires continuous authentication and limited access to minimize threats. By 2026, most large enterprises will adopt zero-trust methods, consolidating security tools to be more efficient. In order to adapt, organizations must use integrated platforms for orchestrating and automating cybersecurity while working towards Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture (CSMA) for dynamic, collaborative, and secure environments.\n\nCSOs will adopt an \u2018automation-first\u2019 approach to Managed Detection and Response: Modern Managed Detection and Response (MDR) combines Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Operation Centers (SOCs), Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), threat hunting, threat intelligence, and various attack simulations. These components must integrate seamlessly under an \u201cautomation-first\u201d approach for strong cyber defense against new technologies like Gen AI, quantum computing, and 5G expansion. By 2025, organizations are likely to seek more industry-specific and integrated cyber-physical security solutions.\n\nBack to basics: Cyber resilience will be essential for business security: Now more than ever, a robust cyber resilience strategy is crucial for organizations to handle unexpected cyber incidents and will require taking a fresh look at the basics: regular backups, detailed incident response plans, and business continuity measures. Something as simple as regular drills can enhance organizational preparedness and response capabilities. Promoting a culture of resilience will help minimize downtime and disruptions from cyberattacks.\n\nA leader in cybersecurity globally, TCS\u2019 offerings range from consulting, implementation, to managed security services across \u2013 detection and response, identity and access management, attack surface management, governance, risk and compliance, data privacy and protection, digital forensics and incident response, cloud security, and cyber physical security. These offerings are tailored to address industry-specific challenges. With over 16,000 cybersecurity professionals on its roster, TCS helps over 600 enterprises across the globe protect their entire digital estate and improve their security posture. TCS's network of 15+ cybersecurity delivery centres worldwide enable secure businesses across geographies."

            "article_content": "Generative AI is at the forefront of India\u2019s tech evolution, delivering great performance without the steep price tag. This has been possible thanks to some big players who continue to up their game. With resilient infrastructure, cutting-edge technology, and strategic investments, cloud giant AWS is helping Indian businesses scale AI while redefining price-performance benchmarks.\n\nSatinder Pal Singh, head of solution architecture for AWS India and South Asia, leads a team of architects tasked with helping customers design scalable, efficient solutions using AWS services. During an in-depth conversation with AIM at AWS re:Invent 2024 held in Las Vegas recently, Singh shared insights into AWS\u2019s strategic focus on India, customer needs, and groundbreaking launches that promise to redefine cloud technology in the region.\n\n\u201cIndia is a significant country for us,\u201d Singh began, emphasising AWS\u2019s extensive infrastructure in the country. With two operational regions\u2014Mumbai and Hyderabad\u2014spanning three availability zones, 33 points of presence, and nine direct connect locations, Singh noted, \u201cWe provide extensive capabilities to our customers, enabling them to leverage more than 240 services\u2014from infrastructure to analytics, IoT, and machine learning\u2014while keeping their data within India.\u201d\n\nCustom Chips: Redefining Price-Performance\n\nAWS\u2019s investments in custom-built chips\u2014Graviton, Trainium, and Inferentia\u2014have been a game-changer for its customers. Graviton chips, designed for general workloads, have already delivered significant benefits. Companies like Zomato and Paytm reported reduced costs by up to 30% and improved performance by 20-35%, a testament to the efficiency of these chips.\n\nTrainium and Inferentia, on the other hand, cater specifically to AI workloads. Trainium delivers a 64% performance boost compared to previous offerings, while Inferentia is optimised for inference, helping global clients save up to 40% on costs. Singh acknowledged that these advancements were critical for Indian enterprises navigating the challenges of scaling AI while managing budgets.\n\nUpskilling India: AWS AI-Ready Program\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges for Indian organisations is the AI talent gap. Singh cited a startling statistic\u2014while 99% of employers envision their companies becoming AI-driven organisations by 2028, nearly 79% struggle to find skilled professionals. To address this, AWS launched the AI-Ready Program, a comprehensive initiative to upskill over 2 million individuals globally by 2025.\n\nIn India alone, over 5.9 million individuals have been trained in cloud services since 2017. AWS\u2019s investment in India\u2019s local cloud infrastructure is projected to reach $16.4 billion by 2030, supporting 131,700 jobs annually and contributing $23.3 billion to India\u2019s GDP by 2030.\n\nWhy Mumbai and Hyderabad?\n\nThe decision to establish data centres in Mumbai and Hyderabad was driven by performance and reliability considerations while providing multi-region availability. AWS\u2019s infrastructure is built with resilience at its core, comprising multiple availability zones, which are essentially isolated data centres capable of functioning independently.\n\nThis design has helped AWS customers achieve exceptional reliability. For instance, ANI Technologies, a leading financial service provider, utilised this setup to create a robust failover mechanism, ensuring uninterrupted services even during system failures.\n\nSingh explained that such resilience is crucial for mission-critical applications, especially in industries like finance and healthcare.\n\nHe elaborated on the layered design of AWS\u2019s infrastructure: \u201cEach region consists of multiple availability zones. Think of one availability zone as one or more isolated data centres. If one zone fails, workloads can shift seamlessly to another.\u201d This architecture ensures resilience even in extreme scenarios like natural disasters.\n\nGenerative AI, a key area of focus for AWS, has witnessed increasing interest from Indian enterprises. Singh highlighted two major innovations announced at re:Invent: model distillation and advancements in automated reasoning.\n\nThe model distillation technique, offered via Amazon Bedrock, allows smarter, cost-efficient models to inherit the learnings of larger, more accurate ones, significantly lowering operational costs without compromising on precision.\n\nAnother critical advancement is AWS\u2019s approach to minimising hallucination in AI models using automated reasoning. Singh emphasised that this enhancement ensures model reliability, making it an ideal solution for industries like insurance and healthcare, where accuracy is non-negotiable.\n\nThese innovations are a direct response to the needs of Indian customers, who often demand high performance at lower costs. Singh detailed AWS\u2019s use of automated reasoning to enhance model reliability. \u201cWith this, businesses like insurance companies can rest assured that their models provide accurate responses, eliminating the risk of incorrect outputs,\u201d he said.\n\nDriving Innovation Across Industries\n\nAWS\u2019s democratisation of technology has empowered organisations across diverse industries. For instance, manufacturing firms like Apollo Tyres are leveraging AWS services and reported a 9% increase in productivity, while banks like Axis and HDFC enhanced customer experiences with data-driven insights.\n\nSingh emphasised AWS\u2019s commitment to innovation while ensuring inclusivity. \u201cWe democratise technology so that SMBs have the same access to cutting-edge capabilities as large enterprises,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of AWS\u2019s partner ecosystem cannot be overstated. Globally, AWS collaborates with over 140,000 partners, with a significant presence in India. Companies like HCLTech and Persistent Systems are leveraging AWS\u2019s capabilities to deliver innovative solutions to their clients."

While there's no direct connection to Jesus, it represents the type of vessel he and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, would have used.

The Madaba Map: While dating to several centuries after Jesus's life (6th century AD), the Madaba Map, a mosaic discovered in Jordan, provides the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It offers a valuable visual representation of the region's geography during the Byzantine period and helps us understand the landscape and urban layout of cities like Jerusalem during the Roman and Byzantine eras."

The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office.

In the last year, researchers discovered long-lost shipwrecks, odd animals, and even a phenomenon known as \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d among many other finds.\n\n\u2018Ghost Ship of the Pacific\u2019 found using underwater drones\n\nThe USS Stewart rests about 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nIt only took a few hours for a team of 20-foot-long autonomous submersible drones to relocate the USS Stewart after 78 years spent at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The \u201cfour-piper\u201d destroyer ship was the only vessel captured by Japanese forces during World War II, and earned its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker after numerous Allied troops sighted it deep behind enemy lines. Although eventually returned to the US Navy and scuttled, its exact location remained a mystery for years. Now, however, we know the extremely well-preserved remains lay off the California coast in the Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary.\n\nShipwreck hunters find WWII-era merchant ship that sunk in Lake Superior\n\nThe wheel of the Arlington, about 600 feet underwater. Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society\n\nAlthough also dating back to the WWII era, the Arlington wasn\u2019t involved in combat when it sank. The 244-foot bulk carrier was instead a merchant vessel sailing Lake Superior en route to Owen Sound, Ontario. Inclement weather, however, caused the ship to take on water in the early hours of May 1. While Captain Frederick \u201cTatey Bug\u201d Burke insisted his crew stay the course, the sailors had other plans, and soon abandoned Burke to his\u2014and his ship\u2019s\u2014ultimate fate. Like the USS Stewart, the Arlington was located using remote operating submersibles and sonar scans.\n\nNew, colorful starfish species found off the coast of Japan\n\nThe newly discovered Paragonaster hoeimaruae. There are many types of starfish and this one is particularly adapted to living in sandy, muddy waters, a feature the researchers want to learn more about. Credit: \u00a9 I. Kobayashi\n\nThere are around 2,000 cataloged starfish species in the world, but that list grew by at least one new variety in 2024. Discovered by researchers off the coast of Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula, Paragonaster hoeimaruae, is only the second starfish known to belong to the Pseudarchasteridae family. The strikingly orange sea creatures are especially adapted to live in muddy, sandy waters\u2014an evolutionary trait researchers hope to learn more about in the coming years.\n\nGrumpy-faced fish species found in Red Sea\n\nThe grumpy dwarfgoby is endemic to the Red Sea and lives in small holes and crevices in coral reefs. Viktor Nunes Peinemann\n\nWhile similarly as orange as Paragonaster hoeimaruae, Sueviota aethon arguably features a much more noticeable physical trait: the diminutive fish possesses a downturned mouth that makes it look permanently displeased. Its face seems so irritated that it even earned it the common name of the grumpy dwarfgoby. The roughly one inch long fish live among the coral reefs of the Red Sea\u2019s Farasan Banks near Saudi Arabia. Even at that size, however, discoverers describe the grumpy dwarfgoby as a \u201cfearsome predator\u201d given its comparatively large canines used to capture and devour small invertebrates.\n\nWWII submarine discovered 81 years after disappearing during secret mission\n\nThe HMS Trooper disappeared in 1943 with all 64 of its crew. Credit: YouTube / Planet Blue\n\nIt took at least as many as 14 attempts over nearly 25 years, but researchers finally located the wreckage of the HMS Trooper in 2024. The WWII Allied submarine and its 64 crew members deployed on a secret mission near Greece in early October 1943, but never arrived in Beirut as originally scheduled. Researchers used both sonar and an ROV called \u201cSuper Achille\u201d to identify Trooper\u2019s whereabouts, as well as confirm its fatal run-in with a German mine. Trooper lays in three separate parts an estimated 830-feet-deep at the bottom of the Icarian Sea, near the Greek island of Donoussa.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest coral formation is longer than a blue whale\n\nA diver from National Geographic Pristine Seas measures the world\u2019s largest coral colony in the Solomon Islands. Photograph by Manu San F\u00e9lix, National Geographic Pristine Seas\n\nThe biggest animal in the world may be the blue whale, but researchers in 2024 determined that the biggest intertwined community of animals is undoubtedly the recently discovered Pavona clavus coral colony. Measuring in at 111 feet wide, 104 feet long, 18 feet high, and 600 feet around, the standalone coral system formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean over the last 300 years, and can even be seen from space.\n\nNew ghost shark species found in New Zealand\n\nThe newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish, Harriotta avia. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)\n\nGhost sharks, also known as \u201cspookfish,\u201d technically aren\u2019t sharks, but instead are a group of fish that are closely related to the ocean predators. One of the newest additions to the family this year was Harriotta avia, described as having an \u201celongated, narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes; and very long, broad pectoral fins\u201d as well as possessing \u201clovely chocolate brown color.\u201d But don\u2019t expect to encounter one in the open waters\u2014Harriotta avia lives near New Zealand at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 8,350 feet below surface waters.\n\n\u2018Dark oxygen\u2019 on ocean floor may rewrite the origins of life\n\nThe formations can be found as deep as 20,000 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Wikipedia Commons\n\nOne of the wildest underwater discoveries of 2024 wasn\u2019t a new species of life, but chemical processes that might rewrite our understanding of the origins of life itself. Earlier this year, researchers published findings related to polymetallic nodules\u2014natural mineral deposits located on the pitch-black ocean floor. Despite lacking sunlight, however, evidence suggests these formations appear to function as \u201cgeobatteries\u201d capable of generating trace amounts of oxygen that help sustain deep-sea life. If true, then the planet\u2019s very first living organisms may have gotten their start in a place no one once thought could support life at all.\n\nNew jellyfish discovered near Japan may contain multitudes of venom\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross medusa is about four inches wide, three inches long, and has about 240 tentacles. Dhugal John Lindsay/JAMSTEC\n\nLike many other similar species, the newly found St. George\u2019s cross medusa lives around 2,300 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, and hunts bioluminescent prey with its many tentacles. Unlike its relatives, however, Santjordia pagesi packs an \u201carsenal of venoms\u201d that differs from other known jellyfish. Unfortunately, it might take a little while before researchers start gleaning more information on the creature\u2014it\u2019s difficult to gather more specimens given the jellyfish lives in a deep-sea volcanic caldera about 285 miles south of Tokyo.\n\nResearchers discover neurological mechanism controlling anglerfish lures\n\nFrogfish belong to the larger anglerfish family, and use their front fin as a lure. Credit: Deposit Photos\n\nAnglerfish aren\u2019t a new find for researchers, but biologists did confirm a surprising evolutionary feature in the odd-looking animals this year. Using tracer analysis, a team discovered the exact motor neurons that control one of the subspecies\u2019 front dorsal fin lure. It appears the location of these motoneurons shifted during their evolution compared to their relatives, pointing to evolutionary implications that reach all the way to landwalking vertebrates.\n\nOver 100 possible new ocean species found near Chile\n\nDuring an expedition off the coasts of Chile and Rapa Nui, scientists spotted a bony Chaunacops fish swimming in the waters of Chile\u2019s Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe 1,800-mile-long Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge near Chile is home to some wild creatures that look like they just arrived from an alien planet. Earlier this year, researchers used a remote operated submersible to survey the region and documented over 100 candidates for never-before-seen species. These included crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and even marine mammals. Biologists also glimpsed extremely rare animals, such as the whiplash squid."

            "article_content": "Scientists have long known that light can sometimes appear to exit a material before entering it \u2013 an effect dismissed as an illusion caused by how waves are distorted by matter.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Toronto, through innovative quantum experiments, say they have demonstrated that \"negative time\" isn't just a theoretical idea \u2013 it exists in a tangible, physical sense, deserving closer scrutiny.\n\nThe findings, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, have attracted both global attention and skepticism.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these perplexing results highlight a peculiar quirk of quantum mechanics rather than a radical shift in our understanding of time.\n\n\"This is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor specializing in experimental quantum physics.\n\nWhile the term \"negative time\" might sound like a concept lifted from science fiction, Steinberg defends its use, hoping it will spark deeper discussions about the mysteries of quantum physics.\n\nLaser experiments\n\nYears ago, the team began exploring interactions between light and matter.\n\nWhen light particles, or photons, pass through atoms, some are absorbed by the atoms and later re-emitted. This interaction changes the atoms, temporarily putting them in a higher-energy or \"excited\" state before they return to normal.\n\nIn research led by Daniela Angulo, the team set out to measure how long these atoms stayed in their excited state. \"That time turned out to be negative,\" Steinberg explained \u2013 meaning a duration less than zero.\n\nTo visualize this concept, imagine cars entering a tunnel: before the experiment, physicists recognized that while the average entry time for a thousand cars might be, for example, noon, the first cars could exit a little sooner, say 11:59 am. This result was previously dismissed as meaningless.\n\nWhat Angulo and colleagues demonstrated was akin to measuring carbon monoxide levels in the tunnel after the first few cars emerged and finding that the readings had a minus sign in front of them.\n\nRelativity intact\n\nThe experiments, conducted in a cluttered basement laboratory bristling with wires and aluminum-wrapped devices, took over two years to optimize. The lasers used had to be carefully calibrated to avoid distorting the results.\n\nStill, Steinberg and Angulo are quick to clarify: no one is claiming time travel is a possibility. \"We don't want to say anything traveled backward in time,\" Steinberg said. \"That's a misinterpretation.\"\n\nThe explanation lies in quantum mechanics, where particles like photons behave in fuzzy, probabilistic ways rather than following strict rules.\n\nInstead of adhering to a fixed timeline for absorption and re-emission, these interactions occur across a spectrum of possible durations \u2013 some of which defy everyday intuition.\n\nCritically, the researchers say, this doesn't violate Einstein's theory of special relativity, which dictates that nothing can travel faster than light. These photons carried no information, sidestepping any cosmic speed limits.\n\nA divisive discovery\n\nThe concept of \"negative time\" has drawn both fascination and skepticism, particularly from prominent voices in the scientific community.\n\nGerman theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, for one, criticized the work in a YouTube video viewed by over 250,000 people, noting, \"The negative time in this experiment has nothing to do with the passage of time \u2013 it's just a way to describe how photons travel through a medium and how their phases shift.\"\n\nAngulo and Steinberg pushed back, arguing that their research addresses crucial gaps in understanding why light doesn't always travel at a constant speed.\n\nSteinberg acknowledged the controversy surrounding their paper's provocative headline but pointed out that no serious scientist has challenged the experimental results.\n\n\"We've made our choice about what we think is a fruitful way to describe the results,\" he said, adding that while practical applications remain elusive, the findings open new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena.\n\n\"I'll be honest, I don't currently have a path from what we've been looking at toward applications,\" he admitted. \"We're going to keep thinking about it, but I don't want to get people's hopes up.\"\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse"
