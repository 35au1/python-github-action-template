        "article_content": "Watch live! 2nd UFO hearing held by US congress, witnesses include fmr. miltary - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs this week, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You'll be able to watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

        "article_content": "Gemini is Google\u2019s most important product right now, with Google baking its genAI chatbot into as many products as it can. The Pixel 9 served as the key piece of hardware to showcase several new Gemini capabilities, including Gemini Live functionality. That\u2019s the equivalent of OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, which makes the AI sound like a real human.\n\nBut Google isn\u2019t happy rolling out Gemini to as many Android devices as possible. It\u2019s also targeting the iPhone, a potentially lucrative market for Google when it comes to its AI ambitions.\n\nRumors already say that Apple will soon offer chatbot choices to iPhone users by integrating Google Gemini into Apple Intelligence alongside ChatGPT. The latter will get a period of exclusivity since it\u2019s Apple\u2019s preferred partner for the launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhether or not Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, Google is testing another way to make Gemini available to iPhone users. The company rolled out a standalone Google Gemini app in some test markets, complete with Gemini Live functionality.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAn iPhone user posted screenshots on Reddit that prove the Google Gemini app for iPhone is legitimate. According to 9to5Google, the app is available in the Philippines, but you can\u2019t download it from the App Store in the US. I could not find a version of the app in the EU, but then again, the European block is never among the first regions to receive any new AI app.\n\nApp Store listing for the Google Gemini app. Image source: Reddit\n\nThe advantage of having a standalone Gemini app for iPhone is that you can talk to the chatbot directly without going through the iPhone\u2019s Google app. That\u2019s currenty the only way to access Google Gemini on iPhone without loading the chatbot in a browser. Gemini Live is not available in the Google app.\n\nHaving Gemini Live baked into a standalone Gemini app is even better. I got access to Advanced Voice Mode recently inside the ChatGPT app for iPhone, and it was an interesting experience. The smartphone is probably the place to talk to AI via voice rather than text prompts.\n\nGoogle Gemini app installed on an iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nGoogle will take advantage of the iPhone\u2019s Live Activity feature to let you talk to Gemini Live even when the screen is off or when you\u2019re using the iPhone for something else. ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode works similarly on the iPhone.\n\nAlso, if Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, it won\u2019t be available on most current iPhones. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series support Apple Intelligence. A standalone Google Gemini app would help fix that potential problem.\n\nGemini Live functionality in the Google Gemini app for iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Google will launch the Gemini app on iPhone, but it\u2019s probably only a matter of time until it happens. Apparently, Google started testing the standalone app only about a week ago."

        "article_content": "In a nutshell: Google is reportedly testing a standalone Gemini app for iPhones. While the company already offers a Gemini app on Android, iPhone users can only access the AI feature within the main Google app. The standalone app is expected to include additional features not available in the integrated Google app.\n\nAccording to 9to5Google, at least one Reddit user claims to have downloaded the Gemini app from the App Store. Once installed, the app places an icon on the home screen, allowing users to summon the AI assistant with a tap. It also offers a customizable shortcut for quick access. The App Store listing promotes the app as a way to \"Unlock the power of Google AI on your iPhone.\"\n\nCurrently, the Gemini app for iOS is unavailable in most regions, including the US. Users in Canada, Australia, and India have also reported being unable to access the app, indicating that Google may be testing it in select areas before a wider release.\n\nSo far, only one user in the Philippines has reportedly managed to download the app, with screenshots suggesting it has been available in that country's App Store for about a week.\n\nThe new app introduces a feature called Gemini Live, which isn't available in the main Google app. According to the Reddit user, Gemini Live operates in the background with iOS's Live Activity while users multitask, providing a more seamless and convenient experience than the current setup.\n\nAt present, iOS users can only access Gemini by switching to the Gemini tab at the top of the Google search app, a process similar to that on the Gemini website. This method is less seamless and engaging compared to the experience Google offers on its Pixel devices.\n\nGoogle has yet to officially confirm development of a standalone Gemini app for iOS, so a global release date is uncertain. However, with testing seemingly underway, broader availability may come in the next few months.\n\nGemini is Google's AI chatbot powered by its namesake language model, introduced in late 2023 after unifying Bard and Duet AI to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The Gemini app launched on Android earlier this year, enabling users to process documents, summarize emails, and more."

        "article_content": "One of the most gorgeous, uniquely animated paranormal series from 2020 has finally returned after nearly five years with a second season. Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, based on the original manga by creative duo Aidaro has finally returned to continue Hanako and Nene\u2019s misadventures dealing with iconic school ghost\u2019s from Japanese urban legends after leaving audiences holding their collective breath when Season 1 ended. The new trailer shows what appears to be a significant improvement in animation quality, and hints at some of the major events that take place in the manga\u2019s Clock Keepers and Picture Perfect story arcs. The new season could also finally adapt the Young Exorcist story arc, which, in the timeline of the series, should have been in the anime\u2019s first season.\n\nStudio Lerche will be returning to animate Season 2, with Youhei Fukui (My Hero Academia Season 2, Bakugan: Evolutions) set to direct the series. The main cast will remain the same as it was in the first season, with Masayoshi Oishi (Overlord) providing vocals for the series\u2019 new opening song while ANCHOR composes the main theme.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nLerche\n\nToilet-Bound Hanako-kun Offers Anime Fans Everything They Could Want From the Supernatural\n\nMuch like the action-packed supernatural anime Dandadan, Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun puts a unique spin on classic Japanese folk stories by spinning them to fit the story\u2019s specific world-building and situation. The series primarily follows Nene Yashiro, a first-year high school student who wants nothing more than for her crush to return her feelings. To try and win his heart, Nene unwittingly participates in an occult ritual that causes her to become afflicted by the Mermaid Curse. Not wanting to be turned into a literal fish, Nene makes a deal with the ghostly spirit Hanako to prevent her from turning into a fish \u2013 given that she doesn\u2019t become submerged in water. To repay him, Nene is forced to become Hanako\u2019s assistant and help him spread rumors and stories about different supernatural beings residing within the school.\n\nToilet-Bound Hanako-Kun has something for everyone. In addition to an intriguing supernatural mystery that effortlessly builds itself up over time, the series has a visually unique and striking art style that makes it easy to get drawn into each paranormal entity Nene and Hanako investigate. Plus, just beneath the surface of the series core narrative, there\u2019s loads of character development and angst that gets explored in a staunch, brutally human way. The series truly has something for anime fans from every corner of the community, and with the new season dropping in January 2025, there\u2019s no better time to get caught up with Season 1 to prepare for the paranormal ride of a lifetime."

The investigation centers on FSD\u2019s ability to perform in \u201crelatively common\u201d reduced visibility conditions, such as sun glare, fog, and airborne dust.\n\nIn these instances, it appears that \u201cthe driver may not be aware that he or she is responsible\u201d to make appropriate operational selections, or \u201cfully understand\u201d the nuances of the system, NHTSA said.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTesla\u2019s X (Twitter) account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Gregory Magno, the NHTSA\u2019s vehicle defects chief investigator, wrote to Tesla in an email.\n\nThe postings, which included reposted YouTube videos, may encourage viewers to see FSD-supervised as a \u201cRobotaxi\u201d instead of a partially automated, driver-assist system that requires \u201cpersistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno said.\n\nIn one of a number of Tesla posts on X, the social media platform owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a driver was seen using FSD to reach a hospital while undergoing a heart attack. In another post, a driver said he had used FSD for a 50-minute ride home. Meanwhile, third-party comments on the posts promoted the advantages of using FSD while under the influence of alcohol or when tired, NHTSA said.\n\nTesla\u2019s official website also promotes conflicting messaging on the capabilities of the FSD software, the regulator said.\n\nNHTSA has requested that Tesla revisit its communications to ensure its messaging remains consistent with FSD\u2019s approved instructions, namely that the software provides only a driver assist/support system requiring drivers to remain vigilant and maintain constant readiness to intervene in driving.\n\nTesla last month unveiled the Cybercab, an autonomous-driving EV with no steering wheel or pedals. The vehicle has been promoted as a robotaxi, a self-driving vehicle operated as part of a ride-paying service, such as the one already offered by Alphabet-owned Waymo.\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology has remained under the scrutiny of regulators. FSD relies on multiple onboard cameras to feed machine-learning models that, in turn, help the car make decisions based on what it sees.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo\u2019s technology relies on premapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar (a laser-light radar), which might be very costly, but has met the approval of safety regulators."
