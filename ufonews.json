We may get a commission if you buy through our links.\n\nMicrosoft introduced its new CoreAI platform and tools designed to develop AI-powered applications. CEO Satya Nadella announced the news in a communication to Microsoft employees, stating that the shift towards AI-powered applications is set to define 2025 and beyond.\n\nAccording to Nadella, the next three years will see \u201cthirty years of change\u201d as AI models become a fundamental part of every software application category, from CRM and ERP systems to industry-specific platforms.\n\nHowever, while the capabilities of these AI-powered applications are set to increase significantly \u2013 with the introduction of \u201cagents\u201d that can remember past interactions and carry out a range of tasks \u2013 the way software is built is also changing.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO said the shift towards AI-first applications is \u201cleading to a new AI-first app stack \u2014 one with new UI/UX patterns, runtimes to build with agents, orchestrate multiple agents, and a reimagined management and observability layer.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Redmond-based tech giant is creating a new engineering organization focused on building the tools and platforms needed for this new era of software.\n\nCoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools will bring together various existing teams at Microsoft, including Dev Div, the company\u2019s AI platform team, and several groups at the Office of the CTO, including those working on AI Supercomputer, AI Agentic Runtimes, and Engineering Thrive.\n\nThe new group will be led by Jay Parikh, who previously served as Facebook\u2019s head of infrastructure. Parikh will report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft\u2019s Cloud + AI chief, and will work closely with Rajesh Jha, Microsoft\u2019s EVP of Experiences and Devices, and Charlie Bell, the company\u2019s CTO, to help Microsoft\u2019s entire tech stack become AI-savvy. Parikh will also be in charge of GitHub Copilot, Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered code-writing tool.\n\nIn a memo to employees, Nadella said that Microsoft has been working on the technology to enable the next generation of software for over two years.\n\nBut to truly accelerate our progress and take full advantage of the opportunity in front of us, we need to operate as one company from our tech stack to products to customer engagement to go-to-market.\n\nMicrosoft has made several moves in recent months to accelerate its AI ambitions. For example, last November, the company unveiled the Azure AI Foundry, a unified platform that gathers all the tools developers need to build AI-powered apps.\n\nIn September, Microsoft unveiled a new series of AI accelerators for Azure, which include chips that the company says will enable more powerful and efficient AI model training.\n\nYou can read Satya Nadella\u2019s announcement here."

            "article_content": "Quick, what do you think of when you hear the word \u201cThunderbird?\u201d\n\nThe (very snazzy) car? The plane? Or perhaps even the email software?\n\nBut how many of you would conjure up images of a gigantic creature that flaps its wings and unleashes tempests? And how many more of you are privy to rumors of sightings of such a creature coming out of Pennsylvania?\n\nA Kiowa shield cover decorated with a turtle, a Thunderbird, stars and the milky way. Sightings of the Thunderbird have been reported in Pennsylvania as recently as 2021. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)Universal Images Group via Getty\n\nAccording to \u201cEncyclopedia of Beasts and Monsters in Myth, Legend and Folklore (2016),\u201d Thunderbirds are gigantic spirits from Native American lore that take the form of birds. They\u2019re particularly known for controlling the weather.\n\n\u201cBy [the Thunderbird\u2019s] work, the earth was watered and vegetation grew,\u201d reads Encyclopedia Britannica. \u201cLightning was believed to flash from its beak, and the beating of its wings was thought to represent the rolling of thunder.\u201d\n\nTales vary depending on which tribe tells the story, adds \u201cNative American Myths: Stories & Folklore from the Apache to the Zuni (2018)\u201d: Some believe it\u2019s a god. Others describe it as being more human in shape. The Lakota Sioux even had more than one type of Thunderbird.\n\nNow, it could be argued the Thunderbird myth is among those that can be easily explained: North America is full of incredibly large birds that \u2014 back in the day \u2014 could have been mistaken for some godlike creature. California condors \u2014 North America\u2019s largest wild bird \u2014 has a wingspan of 109 inches, or a little over 9 feet, far exceeding the height of your average Joe.\n\nThat would make it unlikely for anyone to believe they saw a Thunderbird in this day and age, right?\n\nWell.\n\nPeople do, in fact, still claim to see Thunderbirds, vast zoological knowledge out there and all. According to a 2018 Juneau Empire report, a woman proclaimed on Facebook how she spotted a \u201cHUGE\u201d bird \u201calmost the size of a small airplane\u201d in Mendenhall Valley, Alaska. Reddit threads detailing accounts from all over the country \u2014 mainly in the West \u2014 eagerly discuss the potential existence of the being.\n\nAnd, of course, there have been plenty of purported sightings in the Keystone State.\n\nKwakiutl dancers in masks and costumes representing (left to right) Wasp, Thunderbird, and Grizzly-bear, arrive in canoes during the winter ceremony. The myth of the Thunderbird differs from tribe to tribe. (Photo by Buyenlarge/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Wilds website, sightings of the Thunderbird have popped up in places such as Pine Creek Valley and the I-80 Frontier over the last 100 years or so: A man in Cameron County claimed to have seen a flock of them in 1892. An early pioneer of Potter County swore he saw the same.\n\nThere\u2019s even a legend known as the \u201cLost Thunderbird Photo,\u201d which is said to be evidence of the creature, although it was supposedly lost in a house fire. Researcher Ivan Sanderson \u2014 who states he was the one to have left the photo with the owner of the house that burnt down \u2014 has dedicated a whole website to this lost photo, as well as other paranormal encounters from Bigfoot to the Jersey Devil.\n\n\u201cThis was like a mammoth hawk, or a mammoth eagle or a mammoth raptor of some kind,\u201d describes one witness to an alleged sighting in 1970. \u201cIt was not a condor. It had no resemblance to any prehistoric animal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was an aberration. There are creatures that, for whatever reason, they grow bigger than the average bear.\u201d\n\nThunderbirds have continued to be spotted in Pennsylvania in recent years: Head over to cryptid and alien tracking sites like the one run by Pennsylvania-based researcher Stan Gordon and you\u2019ll find accounts of run-ins with Thunderbirds that have occurred way passed the 1970s.\n\nA Thunderbird as drawn by a Dakota near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, around 1883. (Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons)Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u201cIn early April of 2021, [a] woman was just pulling into a parking lot for a scheduled appointment at a location in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\u201d one such account reads. \u201cShe was a few minutes early, so she was talking with a friend on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, something flew over her vehicle that shadowed the entire car. Even though she was in her car she ducked her head, thinking it was a small plane about to crash. She commented to her friend about what had just happened. Seconds later, she saw the biggest bird she had ever seen flying in front of her car.\u201d\n\nNow, the biggest question is, if these birds are so big, why aren\u2019t more people seeing them?\n\nWell, if you adopt the same line of thinking that some other paranormal researchers apply to other cryptids such as Bigfoot\u2014 as highlighted in \u201cThe Sasquatch People and Their Interdimensional Connection (2011)\u201d \u2014 the Thunderbird can be viewed as a creature that moves among dimensions. In other words, one minute it\u2019s in our dimension where we can spot it, and then, boom, it zips into the unseeable unknown.\n\nSo, are all these sightings just really, really big birds, or creatures from beyond our realm of understanding? You decide.\n\nAnd next time you\u2019re caught in a storm, be sure to take a closer look at the sky."

            "article_content": "The open sky with its innumerable stars and constellations have long been used as a natural tool for navigation long before the GPS became a reality.\n\nNot just astronomers, but also sailors, and navies across the world use these celestial bodies for navigating the vast oceans. Among these bodies are quasars \u2014 distant galaxies that host supermassive black holes surrounded by hot disks of gas capable of emitting powerful jets.\n\nadvertisement\n\nQuasar looks like a star when seen through a telescope, but it is actually a region surrounding a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy.\n\nAn aspiring naval officer Olivia Achenbach from the United States Naval Academy has unveiled surprising characteristics of one such quasar, J0742+2704, using NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble captured intriguing hints of interaction, if not full merging, between galaxies including quasar J0742+2704. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nAchenbach's discovery, made during a four-week internship, revealed a distinct spiral shape in the images captured by Hubble.\n\n\"The biggest surprise was seeing the distinct spiral shape in the Hubble Space Telescope images. At first, I was worried I had made an error,\" she stated.\n\nThis finding is particularly significant as quasars are typically associated with older, massive galaxies that have undergone chaotic mergers and exhibit elliptical shapes.\n\nAstronomer Kristina Nyland, Achenbach\u2019s research advisor at the Naval Research Laboratory, emphasised the rarity of finding a quasar-hosting galaxy with spiral arms and a black hole more than 400 million times the mass of the Sun. \"It's extremely rare and exciting to find such a quasar with young jets that weren't detectable 20 years ago,\" Nyland noted.\n\nThe quasar J0742+2704 contributes to ongoing debates within the astronomy community regarding the origins of quasar jets, which play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by suppressing star formation.\n\nWhile some scientists believe these jets are triggered by major galaxy mergers, the spiral structure of J0742+2704 suggests alternative pathways for jet formation. The Hubble Telescope. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nInterestingly, Hubble\u2019s images show signs of potential interaction with nearby galaxies. One arm of J0742+2704 appears distorted, hinting at gravitational influences from another galaxy.\n\nNyland remarked, \"While the quasar has not experienced a major disruptive merger, it may be interacting with another galaxy, which is gravitationally tugging at its spiral arm.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nA nearby galaxy visible in Hubble's image features a ring structure, indicative of interactions where smaller galaxies pass through larger ones. Nyland speculates that this could provide clues about the processes triggering J0742+2704's young jets.\n\nBoth Achenbach and Nyland view this discovery as just the beginning, with plans for further analysis using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and ALMA in Chile.\n\nAchenbach encourages ongoing observation: \"If we looked at this galaxy 20 years ago, we would have seen a fairly average quasar. It shows that continued exploration can lead to remarkable discoveries.\""

            "article_content": "Even for an industry that depends on relentless innovation to thrive, life sciences have seen remarkable advancements in recent decades. From the Human Genome Project paving the way for precision medicine, to monoclonal antibodies, mRNA, CRISPR gene editing, and other major breakthroughs \u2013 our industry continuously proves its ability to serve humanity by consistently one-upping itself.\n\nAnd yet, data science is now poised to usher in a level and acceleration of progress that even life sciences have never before seen.\n\nWhy AI Is now hitting its full stride\n\nAlthough data science and AI have been applied in life sciences for decades, their application has often fallen short of expectations, yielding incremental, rather than transformative, gains. But today\u2019s advances in algorithm sophistication, large-scale data integration, and cloud computing have helped them overcome the fragmented data, slower processing, and other limitations that have been stunting their full power. Regulatory agencies, meanwhile, are providing clearer guidance on the use of models, giving organisations the guardrails needed to innovate faster, with confidence.\n\nTogether, these developments, combined with the global urgency to address humanity\u2019s most pressing health challenges, create a perfect storm for data science and AI to take life sciences to new heights.\n\nWhat makes AI so transformative\n\nWith its ability to process massive and complex datasets, identify hidden patterns, and continuously evolve as it learns from new data, AI brings a depth of understanding and speed of decision-making and discovery that takes it to a level far beyond human capabilities. With predictive modelling, AI doesn\u2019t just analyse existing data it anticipates future outcomes. This allows researchers to solve problems at scale with unprecedented precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the time and cost of bringing new therapies to market.\n\nAI is at a critical juncture, and 2025 promises to be a transformative year. Here\u2019s how I believe models will reshape life sciences in the year ahead:\n\nAI graduates from trials to tangible real-world solutions\n\nThe integration of data science in drug discovery is evolving beyond mere trial phases to practical uses \u2013 especially in the creation and testing of molecular compounds in silico. With algorithms getting better at simulating biological interaction, we can significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery. Not only will this improve initial testing efficiency, it will open doors to novel therapies that revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry and, more importantly, profoundly impact world health.\n\nData science will take diagnostic accuracy to new heights\n\nMachine learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency over the past year in detecting irregularities in medical images, often exceeding the level of accuracy seasoned professionals can provide. In the year 2025, AI-powered imaging tools will greatly enhance diagnostic precision in radiology and pathology, enabling healthcare providers to deliver more precise determinations. Machine learning-assisted medical imaging of tumours, for instance, will dramatically improve their pairing with the right targeted treatments. Such advancements will play a crucial role in allowing patients to live longer and higher quality lives.\n\nLLMs will transform documentation\n\nFrom scientific manuscripts to clinical trial records and regulatory filings, large language models (LLM) will revolutionise documentation. LLMs are already proving effective in managing specialised medical language, compliance checks, and simplifying complex terms, with providers like IBM and Microsoft integrating them into healthcare documentation. Organisations are also increasingly turning to automation for authorship of Clinical Study Reports using data from clinical systems and statistical computing environments to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. This change will speed up the process of finding new cures and lead to better results for patients, while also boosting the pace and accuracy of advancements.\n\nData science will accelerate clinical trial recruiting\n\nOver the next 12 months, AI will streamline the recruitment process for trials by utilising electronic health records and real-time patient data. This will enable more precise and faster identification of suitable candidates for more successful trials. We are already seeing signs of this transformation with AI-powered platforms significantly reducing recruitment timelines by more accurately matching patients to trial criteria. Such improvements will enhance trial effectiveness and accelerate the pace of medical innovation.\n\nAI compliance platforms will see wide adoption\n\n2025 will see the rise of AI-powered compliance platforms that provide for the real-time monitoring of regulatory adherence across clinical trials, drug manufacturing, and elsewhere. As regulatory requirements grow increasingly complex, such AI solutions will be extremely helpful in managing compliance data in real-time, allowing organisations to maintain operational integrity.\n\n2025 will mark a turning point for data science and AI in life sciences, redefining what\u2019s achievable across the industry. From revolutionising drug discovery and diagnostics to streamlining documentation and compliance, models are accelerating the pace of innovation and enabling breakthroughs that were once unimaginable.\n\nWhile the opportunities are immense, challenges remain. Ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks will require careful attention to ensure AI\u2019s potential is realised responsibly. But data science will undoubtedly prove itself as a transformative force reshaping the way we develop therapies, conduct trials, and deliver care. As the industry continues to embrace these capabilities, 2025 is destined to be the year where life sciences once again pushes the boundaries of innovation \u2013 enhancing lives and advancing healthcare on a global scale."

These job postings include an EE Sensing Engineer, Robotics Mechanical Design Engineer, and TPM Manager.\n\nClicking links to the roles yields a description of a Robotics team that is \"focused on unlocking general-purpose robotics and pushing towards AGI-level intelligence in dynamic, real-world setting.\" The description also describes the team's aim to bring robotic systems from prototype to full-scale production.\n\nMany users are expressing unease about OpenAI delving into the robotics space. However, when one user commented, \"The thought of OpenAI with hardware\ud83d\ude2c\", Kalinowski attempted to diffuse concerns, citing the benefits instead.\n\n\"Yeah, I cannot wait!\" replied Kalinowski. \"Imagine being able to send a robot to do a job that's really dangerous for a human.\"\n\nUntil now, OpenAI has developed its AI models to streamline workflows, with the next logical step being integration into physical devices to enhance user assistance. However, following examples like Elon Musk's Tesla, which announced the Optimus humanoid robot in 2021 but has yet to release it, a market-ready robot may still be years away.\n\nRobotics can also mean things outside of humanoid robots, including less flashy robots -- such as robot vacuums -- that help accomplish everyday functions. Moreover, when asked in the comments if the focus would be humanoid robots, Kalinowski said that is yet to be determined, with the initial team defining and building the roadmap."

            "article_content": "Some researchers think AI systems will reach human-level intelligence soon; others think it\u2019s far away.Credit: Getty\n\nThe technology firm OpenAI made headlines last month when its latest experimental chatbot model, o3, achieved a high score on a test that marks progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI\u2019s o3 scored 87.5%, trouncing the previous best score for an artificial intelligence (AI) system of 55.5%.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nThis is \u201ca genuine breakthrough\u201d, says AI researcher Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, who created the test, called Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI)1, in 2019 while working at Google, based in Mountain View, California. A high score on the test doesn\u2019t mean that AGI \u2014 broadly defined as a computing system that can reason, plan and learn skills as well as humans can \u2014 has been achieved, Chollet says, but o3 is \u201cabsolutely\u201d capable of reasoning and \u201chas quite substantial generalization power\u201d.\n\nResearchers are bowled over by o3\u2019s performance across a variety of tests, or benchmarks, including the extremely difficult FrontierMath test, announced in November by the virtual research institute Epoch AI. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely impressive,\u201d says David Rein, an AI-benchmarking researcher at the Model Evaluation & Threat Research group, which is based in Berkeley, California.\n\nChatGPT broke the Turing test \u2014 the race is on for new ways to assess AI\n\nBut many, including Rein, caution that it\u2019s hard to tell whether the ARC-AGI test really measures AI\u2019s capacity to reason and generalize. \u201cThere have been a lot of benchmarks that purport to measure something fundamental for intelligence, and it turns out they didn\u2019t,\u201d Rein says. The hunt continues, he says, for ever-better tests.\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, has not revealed how o3 works, but the system arrived on the scene soon after the firm\u2019s o1 model, which uses \u2018chain of thought\u2019 logic to solve problems by talking itself through a series of reasoning steps. Some specialists think that o3 might be producing a series of different chains of thought to help whittle down the best answer from a range of options.\n\nSpending more time refining an answer at test time makes a huge difference to the results, says Chollet, who is now based in Seattle, Washington. But o3 comes at a massive expense: to tackle each task in the ARC-AGI test, its high-scoring mode took an average of 14 minutes and probably cost thousands of dollars. (Computing costs are estimated, Chollet says, on the basis of how much OpenAI charges customers per token or word, which depends on factors including electricity usage and hardware costs.) This \u201craises sustainability concerns\u201d, says Xiang Yue at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who studies large language models (LLMs) that power chatbots.\n\nGenerally smart\n\nAlthough the term AGI is often used to describe a computing system that meets or surpasses human cognitive abilities across a broad range of tasks, no technical definition for it exists. As a result, there is no consensus on when AI tools might achieve AGI. Some say the moment has already arrived; others say it is still far away.\n\nMany tests are being developed to track progress towards AGI. Some, including Rein\u2019s 2023 Google-Proof Q&A2, are intended to assess an AI system\u2019s performance on PhD-level science problems. OpenAI\u2019s 2024 MLE-bench pits an AI system against 75 challenges hosted on Kaggle, an online data-science competition platform. The challenges include real-world problems such as translating ancient scrolls and developing vaccines3.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nGood benchmarks need to sidestep a host of issues. For instance, it is essential that the AI hasn\u2019t seen the same questions while being trained, and the questions should be designed in such a way that the AI can\u2019t cheat by taking shortcuts. \u201cLLMs are adept at leveraging subtle textual hints to derive answers without engaging in true reasoning,\u201d Yue says. The tests should ideally be as messy and noisy as real-world conditions while also setting targets for energy efficiency, he adds.\n\nYue led the development of a test called the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI (MMMU), which asks chatbots to do university-level, visual-based tasks such as interpreting sheet music, graphs and circuit diagrams4. Yue says that OpenAI\u2019s o1 holds the current MMMU record of 78.2% (o3\u2019s score is unknown), compared with a top-tier human performance of 88.6%.\n\nThe ARC-AGI, by contrast, relies on basic skills in mathematics and pattern recognition that humans typically develop in early childhood. It provides test-takers with a demonstration set of before and after designs, and asks them to infer the \u2018after\u2019 state for a novel \u2018before\u2019 design (see \u2018Before and after\u2019). \u201cI like the ARC-AGI test for its complementary perspective,\u201d Yue says."

            "article_content": "A lot of your personal information is stored online n one place or another. Or, as the case may be, in data conglomerates (aka \u201cdata brokers\u201d) that specialize in collecting financial, health, relationship, and other types of data about you and others. One of the best ways to defend against this data collection is to take a proactive stance, opting out whenever possible and asking to be removed as much as possible. An easy way to do this is to use Incogni, a service dedicated to removing your personal info from the internet. Right now you can get this service for 55% off of an annual plan if you use the code DIGITALDEAL when you check out. That brings the cost to $81 from $180, and saves you $99 for the year. Tap the button below to check it out yourself, or keep reading to see what makes Incogni special.\n\nUse Incogni to keep your private info private\n\nAccess to your private info is like an onion, it has layers. (Speaking of onions, check out the best VPNs for more ways to stay secure online.) The first layer is those so-called \u201cpeople search sites\u201d that give out your address and phone number, like a sort of digital phone book. When you sign up for Incogni these are the first sites you\u2019ll see lose your info. This can do everything from reducing spam calls to keeping your home\u2019s location a bit more private.\n\nAnd this outer layer is where many services stop. However, Incogni goes for the deeper stuff, too. The next layer targets other types of data brokers, including the ones that you can\u2019t easily access from a name search. We\u2019re talking about the ones that hold onto health information, relationship status, and your private interests. In other words, stuff that you might not want put out into the world via a data leak. Incogni will also go the extra mile by repeatedly contacting these sites for you so you don\u2019t reappear, negotiate with the sites on your behalf, and just generally automate the process for you.\n\nThis means that the most proactive you have to be about your digital data with Incogni is upon startup. Remember, if you start using Incogni now you can get it for a year at 55% off with code DIGITALDEAL. This drops the price from $180 to just $81, saving you $99. Just tap the button below and follow the sign up instructions to get started. Then, go check out the top tech of CES this year, that you\u2019ll be able to put in your now more private home."

They lost the first meeting of the season to the 10-win Rams, 30-20 in Week 8.\n\nBoth teams should be able to put an ample amount of points on the board, so the top recommended bet is to take the Over at 47.5 (-118). Minnesota finished the regular season with the 28th-ranked pass defense in the NFL, and Los Angeles ranked 20th.\n\nExpect Kyren Williams to tote a heavy load on offense as the Rams look to control the clock as much as possible while trying to stave off the Minnesota blitz. The Minnesota pass defense will have its hands full trying to contain Puka Nacua. When the Vikings have the ball, though, they have the ability to strike quickly with Sam Darnold\u2019s top targets, Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison.\n\nBut Darnold does show a tendency to make an untimely error, and an interception could cost Minnesota the game. Also consider the Rams to cover the spread."

If the consensus of the economists interviewed by Bloomberg has it right, then the December number will mean yet more frustration, with core CPI (excluding food and fuel) remaining unchanged at 3.3%, too high to permit more rate cuts:"

            "article_content": "Over the past decades, open source software (OSS) has transformed from being merely a cheaper option into the superior choice for enterprise infrastructure. Now it often provides higher quality, stronger security, better privacy, unparalleled extensibility, and access to innovation compared to proprietary rivals. It is no coincidence that 96% of all software today relies on open source, and large enterprises are increasingly inclined to invest in OSS-based solutions to capitalize on these advantages.\n\nFor venture investors like myself, this shift in market preferences represents a significant opportunity to fund the next generation of OSS-based category leaders in enterprise software. And a few notable trends will likely shape how this market area will likely evolve in 2025 and beyond.\n\nRise of open source AI\n\nThe rapid development of foundational large language models, related AI infrastructure, and their applications has ignited debates around the crucial AI challenges. Many of these issues \u2014 such as transparency, adaptability, and security \u2014 can be addressed through openness. After the initial wave led by closed-source pioneers like OpenAI and Anthropic, a new cohort of open source AI models, including Meta\u2019s Llama and Mistral AI, is now raising the tide and boosting the global AI ecosystem."

First, the company recommends creating nationwide \"rules of the road\" for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach. Image Credit: Reuters\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, unveiled a comprehensive \u201ceconomic blueprint\u201d outlining its vision for AI competition and regulation. This strategic plan is designed to guide tech policy in the US as a new administration takes power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s recommendations come at a time when Elon Musk, a vocal critic of the company, is expected to play a prominent role in Washington. The company is keen to solidify its position and ensure that the US stays ahead in the global race for AI development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFocus on US-made AI and equitable access\n\nAt the heart of OpenAI\u2019s recommendations is the desire to promote AI made in the US, ensuring that emerging technologies are not shaped by authoritarian governments like China. The company argues that AI should be developed in a way that benefits all regions of the country, not just the tech-heavy coastal cities.\n\nOpenAI stresses the need for equitable access to AI, aiming to ensure that its advantages are available to everyone from the very start. According to OpenAI\u2019s VP for global affairs, Chris Lehane, AI is now as essential as electricity, and there\u2019s an urgent need to \u201cget it right\u201d to prevent other nations from taking the lead.\n\nKey recommendations for a competitive AI ecosystem\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint outlines several key steps to position the US as a global AI leader. First, the company recommends creating nationwide \u201crules of the road\u201d for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach.\n\nIt also proposes easing restrictions on the export of advanced AI models to allies and partners, enabling them to build their own ecosystems based on US technology rather than relying on Chinese models. Additionally, OpenAI suggests the formation of a consortium of AI developers to identify best practices for working with national security issues and advancing AI responsibly.\n\nBuilding AI hubs across the US\n\nAnother important recommendation is to use states as \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d to create AI hubs that focus on regional needs. For example, Kansas could develop AI applications tailored to agriculture. This approach would spread AI job opportunities and expertise across the entire country, rather than concentrating them in just a few areas.\n\nOpenAI also calls for increased federal investment in infrastructure, including energy sources and power grids, to support new data centres and AI advancements. Other suggestions include requiring AI companies to provide substantial computational resources to public universities and ensuring that AI can learn from universal, publicly available information, while still protecting creators\u2019 intellectual property.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s strategic positioning amid competition\n\nWhile Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants face significant regulatory scrutiny, OpenAI remains a young company with a focused mission: to build advanced AI. As it prepares for the incoming administration, OpenAI is eager to make the case for how its vision could benefit communities across the US, from job creation to economic investment.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint seeks to reinforce the US\u2019s ability to \u201cthink big, act big, build big,\u201d ensuring that the country maintains an edge in the global AI race. Lehane highlighted that there is currently $175 billion in global investments for AI infrastructure, and the US needs to act quickly to attract that funding before it ends up supporting Chinese-led infrastructure instead.\n\nAdvertisement"

Bias and Discrimination: Black-box models often reflect the biases present in the data from which they learn. Because these models lack adequate transparency, biases can emerge, leading to over- or underrepresentation of certain groups in the population, ultimately favoring one group over another.\n\n2. Lack of Accountability: In high-stakes sectors such as criminal justice and healthcare, AI systems make critical decisions without being able to explain their reasoning. This lack of accountability can be problematic when a wrong decision results in negative consequences, as it becomes difficult to attribute responsibility.\n\n3. Trust Breakdown: As AI technology becomes more widespread, establishing trust is essential for its acceptance. If users do not understand or trust the decisions made by AI, it could lead to resistance against the technology, limiting its potential benefits.\n\n4. Regulatory Compliance: When governments implement regulations concerning AI transparency, organizations that utilize black-box models may face challenges in meeting legal standards, putting them at risk of fines or restrictions."

Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the reports.\n\nIn the Russian city of Engels, home to an air base where Russia\u2019s nuclear bombers are based, Saratov Governor Roman Busargin said an industrial enterprise had been damaged by a drone but gave no more details.\n\nBusargin said that classes in schools in Saratov and Engels would be held remotely. Flight restrictions were imposed in Kazan, Saratov, Penza, Ulyanovsk and Nizhnekamsk, Russia\u2019s aviation watchdog said.\n\nNizhnekamsk, in Russia\u2019s republic of Tatarstan, is home to the major Taneco refinery.

Quantum Computing, meanwhile, saw its shares fall by around 23%, and IonQ (IONQ) shares were down by more than 12%.\n\nThe quantum computing stocks also tanked the previous week after Nvidia\u2019s Huang said useful quantum computers are decades away during the chipmaker\u2019s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\n\n\u201cIf you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIf you said 30, it\u2019s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.\u201d\n\nHuang said he thinks the artificial intelligence chipmaker will play \u201ca significant part\u201d in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting \u201cthere as fast as possible.\u201d\n\nD-Wave chief executive Alan Baratz said in a statement shared with Quartz that Huang \u201chas a misunderstanding of quantum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile he might be right about other quantum companies, he is dead wrong about D-Wave,\u201d Baratz said. \u201cThere is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. D-Wave took a different approach, which has allowed us to become commercial today and likely many years ahead of other quantum computing companies.\u201d\n\nIn December, Alphabet stock climbed more than 4% after it unveiled its latest quantum chip, Willow. Google Quantum AI (GOOGL) announced that its state-of-the-art quantum chip demonstrated \u201ctwo major achievements\u201d in quantum computing, including \u201cexponentially\u201d reducing the rate of errors when adding more qubits \u2014 a challenge that has existed for almost 30 years.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most \"Magnificent Seven\" tech megacaps fell during the session.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points.\n\nStocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure.\n\nAs of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025.\n\nThat has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82.\n\nElsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines.\n\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER\n\n15 updates"

            "article_content": "The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard is partnering with Manifold to bring a unique life science research and development platform to investigators around the world.\n\nHealthcare data have become increasingly available in larger quantities and are stored across a multitude of cloud service providers. The Broad Institute will begin to use Manifold\u2019s AI platform to address this problem through Manifold\u2019s cloud agnostic architecture. Together, Manifold and Broad will adapt the existing platform to advance genomic research inside and outside of the institute.\n\nThe Broad Institute is a pioneering research lab that began when Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers came together in 2004 with the goal of advancing genomic research through collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe recognized that there were certain types of research projects that were going to be really important to catalyze advances in biomedical research across the entire ecosystem, and yet it would be difficult to accomplish them in a typical academic lab,\u201d Todd Golub, director of the Broad Institute, said in an interview.\n\nManifold was founded by Vinay Seth Mohta, now CEO, in 2016 as a consulting company for using AI in healthcare research. In 2021, Manifold began building its R&D platform to bring no-code software to research institutions.\n\n\u201cWe started in cancer research with a focus there, because we saw that cancer consistently pushed science and technology the hardest, and also, as a result, pushed data the hardest, and where we were seeing a lot of pain,\u201d Mohta said.\n\nManifold has deployed its research and development platform with the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cWith the Broad Institute, we're really excited about some of the novel genomics-related capabilities that will bring, based on learning about their use cases, which, by the way, are going to be the use cases everybody's going to have in about three years,\u201d Mohta said. \u201cBecause that's what the Broad does. They're leading the world in science.\u201d\n\nThe lessons from the Broad over its two-decade history will be incorporated into the Manifold platform. One of the key turning points from the Broad's existing software is that researchers will be able to use it without having to know how to code. The organization specifically has plans to do so with its bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nMohta said they plan to add new capabilities every quarter to allow more researchers to come onto the platform, along with collaborations the Broad Institute itself has with other institutions, like companies or other research institutions.\n\n\u201cWith a more modern technical architecture, it really opens up the ability to enable AI more natively, which will again, fuel the future of discovery when we think about what we can do with the data,\u201d Heather Jankins, co-lead of the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute, said.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting feature of the new platform, Golub said, is its \u201cbring your own cloud\u201d capability.\n\nAccording to Manifold, \"bring your own cloud\" means that users of the platform can seamlessly use their existing cloud service provider to power the Manifold research platform.\n\n\u201cScience happens on all clouds, and so we want to make sure that we're enabling science to the maximum,\u201d Jankins said. \u201cFrom that perspective, having a platform that has natively made some cloud agnostic choices is very exciting for us to make sure that we can really leverage using the data, where the data lives.\u201d\n\nResearch institutions use all manner of different cloud providers such as Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. Without the \"bring your own cloud\" capability, researchers may have to consider migrating their data to another cloud to be compatible with a certain research platform or opt out of using it.\n\n\u201cYou have this convergence of two things happening right now, which is an explosion of the amount of data that's possible to generate, and the power of AI making it possible for everybody to ask complex questions of large data sets, regardless of where they're generated,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThat's a very different world than the way research used to work, which is that you do experiments in your own lab and you analyze those results.\u201d\n\nGolub continued: \u201cThis is still very early days of data generation, data aggregation, data and complex data analysis. And so we need to think about the future of this activity and what's going to be needed for the next phase, given that continued explosion of data and need, and that was a motivation for the Broad-Manifold collaboration.\u201d\n\nAlso important to the Broad Institute was Manifold\u2019s ability to create a trusted research environment where access to patient\u2019s genomic data is only allowed by authorized users for a finite period of time.\n\nOne of Manifold\u2019s current customers is the ACS, which has several ongoing cancer studies with 1.5 million participants. With Manifold, the ACS is allowing outside research institutions to use its data while ensuring the data is safely accessed.\n\n\u201cThe point of this exercise is to accelerate the pace at which the world can make important discoveries that will help patients, and without a really scalable, durable, powerful data platform, that's not going to go as quickly as possible, and so we're excited to make that possible,\u201d Golub said."

However, this natural marvel owes its unique shape to erosion rather than human or alien intervention.\n\nA Natural Pyramid Among Antarctic Peaks\n\nThe unnamed mountain, standing about 4,150 feet tall, lies in the southern Ellsworth Mountains. Its striking pyramid-like form first gained attention in 2016 when images went viral online. Located near the Patriot Hills, where climate scientists often work, this mountain has likely been known to researchers for years, according to Mauri Pelto, an environmental science professor at Nichols College.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDiscovered during a 1935 flight by American aviator Lincoln Ellsworth, the Ellsworth Mountains are home to jagged peaks and ancient geological history. This region contains fossils of Cambrian-era creatures dating back over 500 million years, adding to its allure.\n\nRead Also: Scientists reveal secrets of sharks' sex lives by examining their bloody mating bite marks\n\nHow Nature Shaped the Pyramid\n\nScientists attribute the mountain\u2019s unique form to freeze-thaw erosion, a natural process where water enters rock cracks during the day, freezes at night, and expands. Over millions of years, this process widened cracks and broke off large rock sections, sculpting the mountain into its current shape.\n\nWhile three sides eroded uniformly, the fourth side \u2014 the eastern ridge \u2014 developed separately. This process has also shaped other pyramidal peaks, like the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, said Pelto.\n\nRead Also: '1.27 million light-years long': Astronomers spot a new ultra-diffuse galaxy forming in Leo constellation; see image\n\nDebunking Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe mountain's striking appearance has fueled conspiracy theories about ancient civilizations or extraterrestrial influence. However, experts, including Eric Rignot, an Earth system science professor at the University of California, Irvine, dismiss such claims. \"Pyramid shapes are not unusual; many peaks resemble pyramids,\" Rignot explained.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nUltimately, this Antarctic wonder remains a testament to the power of nature and the intrigue of our planet\u2019s hidden corners."

Initially claiming to help the scavengers trapped aboard the Romulus, he eventually becomes an impediment to their escape.\n\nFor the recreation, which was made with the consent of Holm\u2019s estate, a combination of CGI and puppetry was used to achieve the likeness of the actor, who passed away in 2020.\n\nSpeaking to Empire recently, Alvarez agreed with criticisms of the scene, saying: \u201cI wasn\u2019t 100 per cent happy with some of the shots, where you could feel a bit more the CG intervention. So, for people that react negatively, I don\u2019t blame them\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlvarez continued: \u201cWe fixed it. We made it better for the release right now. I convinced the studio we need to spend the money and make sure we give the companies that were involved in making it the proper time to finish it and do it right. It\u2019s so much better\u201d. This was done, explains, by lessening the influence of CGI on the character \u201cWhat we did (for the streaming version) was revert a lot more to the puppet\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better.\u201d\n\nFascinating\u2026 streaming versions of Alien: Romulus have apparently made some tweaks to certain shots of Rook VFX (via Reddit) pic.twitter.com/XMEY6iT7QG \u2014 Alien Theory (@Alien_Theory) January 10, 2025\n\nAlien: Romulus was a box office hit and critically well-received.

            "article_content": "Quantum simulators are a completely new tool for research: quantum physics is studied by other kinds of quantum physics. Research teams from Innsbruck and Vienna are developing a new method that will allow this new technology to be reliably verified.\n\nQuantum physics is a very diverse field: it describes particle collisions shortly after the Big Bang as well as electrons in solid materials or atoms far out in space. But not all quantum objects are equally easy to study. For some \u2013 such as the early universe \u2013 direct experiments are not possible at all. However, in many cases quantum simulators can be used instead: One quantum system (for example, a cloud of ultracold atoms) is studied in order to learn something about another system that looks physically very different, but still follows the same laws, i.e. adheres to the same mathematical equations.\n\nIt is often difficult to find out which equations determine a particular quantum system. Normally, one first has to make theoretical assumptions and then conduct experiments to check whether these assumptions prove correct. Strikingly, researchers at the University of Innsbruck, the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) and TU Wien (Vienna) have now jointly achieved an important step in this field: they have developed a method that allows them to read directly from the experiment which physical theory effectively describes the behaviour of the quantum system. This now allows for a new kind of quality control: it is possible to directly check whether the quantum simulator actually does what it is supposed to simulate. This should enable quantitative statements to be made about quantum systems that cannot be investigated directly.\n\nMeasurements with analogue experiments\n\n\u201cIn quantum physics, you often come across very complicated equations. When a large number of particles are involved, even the world's largest supercomputers are hopelessly overwhelmed,\u201d says Robert Ott, postdoctoral researcher in Hannes Pichler's group at the University of Innsbruck. A different approach is therefore often more helpful: \u201cIf you have a system of quantum particles that you can control and measure very precisely, then in some cases other quantum systems can be modelled with it. This allows you to carry out a kind of \u2018analogue experiment\u2019. You can imagine this as being similar to experimenting with water waves, for example, in order to learn something about sound waves,\u201d explains Maximilian Pr\u00fcfer from TU Wien.\n\nClouds of ultracold atoms are a particularly interesting variant of such quantum simulators. At TU Wien, Prof J\u00f6rg Schmiedmayer's working group uses so-called atom chips to hold, manipulate and investigate these atom clouds in a highly controlled manner. \u201cIn these atom clouds, excitations occur on large scales that obey the same mathematical equations as other quantum physical phenomena that appear in completely different situations,\u201d says Maximilian Pr\u00fcfer, who is leading an experiment in the working group with funding from an Esprit Fellowship from the FWF. \u201cSo we want to know: What exactly do these equations that our system of ultracold atoms obey look like? Do they match the fundamental laws that a certain other quantum system obeys?\u201d\n\nTheory and experiment\n\nComparing theory and experiment is, in a sense, the core of natural science: \u201cNormally you consider which theory might be the right one for a particular situation and then you compare the resulting findings with the experiment,\u201d says Robert Ott. \u201cIf they match, that's an indication that the theoretical description is correct. If not, you have to come up with a new description.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the quantum simulator, however, things are a little different: the team has developed a way of reading the mathematical laws that the system adheres to in a particular situation directly from the experiment. Deriving these laws theoretically from basic physical laws would be extremely difficult. The large number of atoms involved, which interact with each other in complex ways, makes it almost impossible to derive these equations.\n\nA building block method for finding equations\n\n\u201cThe so-called Hamilton operator is crucial in quantum theory,\u201d says Robert Ott. \u201cThis is a mathematical object that describes how a quantum system will behave.\u201d This Hamiltonian operator can take on different mathematical forms: Different types of interactions between the particles can occur in it, various parameters are contained in it that describe how big a role these interactions play in each case. To a certain extent, there is a known set of \u2018building blocks\u2019 from which this Hamiltonian operator can be assembled.\n\n\u201cWe have now been able to show If you measure the atomic clouds in a suitable way, then you can read directly from certain correlations of these measurement results which relevant interaction terms make up the Hamilton operator, and which parameters occur in them,\u201d says Maximilian Pr\u00fcfer. \u201cWe don't have to carry out complex computer simulations first and then compare them with the measurement results; instead, with our new method, we can read directly from the experimental data what the crucial formula looks like.\u201d\n\nThis is an important step for the verification of such quantum simulators. \u201cUsing our method, we can show that the quantum simulator actually does what it is supposed to - and can therefore be translated to another quantum system that cannot be investigated directly in an experiment,\u201d says Robert Ott.\n\nThese questions are also an important part of research in the QuantA Cluster of Excellence, which is working on quantum simulators both experimentally and theoretically. The research team is confident that quantum simulators will make it possible to derive statements about complicated quantum systems in the future that would never have been possible using other methods, such as computer simulations.\n\nPublication: R.
