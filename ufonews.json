        "article_content": "King Charles is known as a man of discerning tastes and strong opinions. He has a long-held interest in alternative beliefs and mystical therapies, and we all know his thoughts on leaky pens.\n\nBut who would have thought His Majesty may also have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO?\n\nThat is the bizarre claim being made in a new TV documentary which examines the royals' interest in UFOs and other paranormal mysteries.\n\nKing Of UFOs, made by British musician and UFO buff Mark Christopher Lee and now available on Amazon Prime, asks the question: does the Royal Family know what's really out there?\n\nIn it, he speaks to a diver, Dan Costello, who says he witnessed Charles, then Prince of Wales, at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975.\n\nKing Charles may have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO\n\nThe then dashing 27-year-old prince was one of three pilots spotted steering the 'odd-looking' object, while serving as a qualified helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy, he claims.\n\nDescribing the aircraft, he says: 'It would sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on [rotating] with no sound of propulsion, just a faint crackle of electromagnetism.'\n\nWhile, sadly, Costello goes on to admit that the aircraft Charles was allegedly flying was most probably not of alien origin, but part of a secret military operation, involving the British and Canadian governments \u2013 plus it hasn't been confirmed that Charles was anywhere near Canada at the time \u2013 it does bring into focus a royal fascination with all things 'other worldly', that goes back generations.\n\nIndeed, as I can exclusively reveal, the King may well have inherited a keen interest in the subject from his late father, Prince Philip, and his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, both of whom were avid enthusiasts.\n\nPhilip had a lifelong interest and curiosity in a range of fringe subjects, including UFOs, crop circles and the Loch Ness monster.\n\nMountbatten's fascination, meanwhile, reached its zenith between 1950 and 1959, shortly before his appointment as Chief of Defence Staff, the highest position in the British military. And it prompts Lee, in the documentary, to ask of our new King: 'Does he know the truth? If so, he should release this truth to the public.'\n\nAs an investigative journalist, university lecturer and committed ufologist, I first heard of the active role the royals had played in seeking the answer to the ultimate question \u2013 Are we alone? \u2013 as part of my research back in the early 2000s.\n\nI was able to examine Mountbatten's private papers at the Broadlands Archive, which prove he had a thing for space travel and avidly consumed the early literature on flying saucers, as UFOs were known at that time.\n\nPrince Charles, then Prince of Wales, was seen at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975\n\nLord Mountbatten and his nephew Prince Philip at the Royal Marines barracks in October 1965\n\nThe term 'flying saucer' was first used in 1947 after pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a chain of nine objects in the sky while flying over Washington State, describing them as flying at great speed and skipping like a 'saucer on water'.\n\nThe world was gripped and, before long, saucers were being spotted everywhere.\n\nIn 1950, Mountbatten encouraged newspaper editor Charles Eade, who had served as his press secretary during the war in the Far East, to publish 'all the available evidence' in his paper, the Sunday Dispatch.\n\nEade wanted Mountbatten to allow his name to be used in his series as it would add to its credibility \u2013 but Mountbatten refused.\n\nInstead, Eade's front-page splash, under the headline 'Flying saucers... the story that may be bigger than atom bomb wars', was credited to a source whom he described as 'one of the most famous men alive today' who 'commands universal respect and admiration'.\n\nMountbatten's theory was that they were craft from other planets, as his letters to Eade reveal: 'The available evidence shows they are not of human agency, that is to say they do not come from our Earth.\n\n'If that is so, then presumably they must come from some heavenly body, probably a planet. Maybe it is the Shackletons and Scotts of Venus or Mars who are making their first exploration of our Earth.' This interest was shared by Charles and by Prince Philip, who was among the first subscribers to the magazine Flying Saucer Review, launched in London during 1955 and edited by retired RAF pilot Derek Dempster.\n\nAccording to one of its later editors, Gordon Creighton, every copy was sent to Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn 2002 I was invited to tea by Mountbatten's youngest daughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, now 95, at her stately home in Oxfordshire to discuss the subject.\n\nShe told me how her father was fond of asking, 'Do you believe in flying saucers?' as a conversation opener during visits to royal courts and capitals across Europe.\n\nShe described a lunch with the then King Idris of Libya, when her father was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean. 'After the usual pleasantries there was quite a long silence and my father decided to break it by asking [through an interpreter] what for him was the burning question, 'Will you ask his majesty if he believes in flying saucers?'\n\n'There was this frightful pause, as the king thought his leg was being pulled. But when it was established that it was a genuine question, he said that of course he believed in them.\n\n'He said he had seen two of them himself and added that the Prophet recorded how a close companion of his had seen one of the fiery sphere types \u2013 as had his camel.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh's voracious appetite for information on flying saucers was confirmed to me by RAF Air Marshal Sir Peter Horsley, who served as his equerry from 1952 to 1955.\n\nLord Mountbatten with Prince Philip and Charles at a polo match in 1977\n\nWhen I spoke to him in 2001, the year he died, he revealed he'd been tasked by his employer with finding out as much as he could on the subject and was given carte blanche to read any reports and to interview fighter pilots who had reported seeing unusual phenomena in the sky.\n\nHe told me he had arranged, with the duke's personal approval, for RAF Fighter Command to send copies of the latest sightings made by aircrew for examination at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPerhaps the strangest outcome of this inquiry was Peter Horsley's role in inviting several UFO witnesses to discuss their experiences at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThese included the captain of a BOAC airliner, James Howard, who witnessed, along with other crew members and passengers, a strange formation of UFOs while flying over the North Atlantic in June 1954.\n\nAnother visitor to the palace was schoolboy Stephen Darbishire who obtained two photographs of a 'saucer' hovering above the slopes of the Old Man of Coniston in the Lake District, in February of that year.\n\nHorsley explained his reason for inviting UFO witnesses to the palace was partly to 'put them on the spot' and to test their honesty in the presence of royalty \u2013 a method as effective as any truth serum.\n\nThey both passed the test with flying colours, convincing their esteemed hosts \u2013 and Horsley himself \u2013 that Earth had indeed had visitations from outer space.\n\nHorsley was scathing about a growing movement of cranks and fantasists, however, who he thought were making a mockery \u2013 and quite a bit of money \u2013 out of the flying saucer craze.\n\nAmong those Horsley accused of making a joke out of a very serious subject was the notorious Polish-American writer George Adamski, who co-authored the 1953 best-seller Flying Saucers Have Landed with Desmond Leslie, a former Second World War Spitfire pilot who had his own contacts in the British establishment.\n\nLeslie was friends with General Sir Frederick 'Boy' Browning, the husband of author Daphne du Maurier. After retiring from the military, Browning had become head of Princess Elizabeth's staff and, following her accession, worked for Prince Philip.\n\nBrowning was another member of what Horsley described as 'the flying saucer club' at the palace.\n\nAdamski's book contained his personal account of an alleged meeting with the Venusian pilot of a flying saucer 'scout-ship' that landed in the Mojave Desert of California, communicating with its angelic occupant by telepathy.\n\nIn April 1959, Adamski embarked on a European lecture tour that included an audience with the Dutch royal family \u2013 proving they too had caught the alien bug \u2013 and, shortly before he arrived in London, Leslie wrote to the Duke of Edinburgh, enclosing a personal invitation for them to meet Adamski, in secret if necessary.\n\nPrince Philip clearly realised the public relations danger this could place him in as he annotated Leslie's letter \u2013 now preserved in the Imperial War Museum archives \u2013 with the words, 'Not on your Nellie!', adding in a later note: 'He may not be a crank but he's a bit too fanciful for me!'\n\nHowever, despite the royal disapproval, both General Browning and Peter Horsley met Leslie and Adamski during their visit at a private address in London.\n\nHorsley told me he was not impressed by either. He felt that Desmond Leslie was 'probably sincere but gullible, sucked into the saucer cult by people who hoped to profit from it, such as Adamski' and he warned Browning against having any further contact with them.\n\nPeter Horsley's direct knowledge of the duke's interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena ended when he left the palace in 1955 to return to RAF duties. Yet the royal fascination remained.\n\nIn 1978, Lord Mountbatten joined Prince Philip and the Queen at the star-spangled royal premiere of Steven Spielberg's Hollywood blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Odeon in Leicester Square. The film tells the story of government conspiracy to hide the first arrival of UFOs and their friendly alien crews on Earth.\n\nOver the decades the duke had maintained an active interest in a range of esoteric subjects.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he became involved in plans for a full-scale investigation in search of the Loch Ness monster.\n\nA Conservative MP, David James, persuaded him to use his connections with the Royal Navy to push for a publicly funded expedition to Loch Ness. The MoD's Chief of Defence Staff, Sir Solly Zuckerman, raised the idea with the navy's Chief Scientist, Sir John Caroll, arguing that 'if a sonar investigation were to reveal something extraordinary in the loch, it would be of considerable scientific interest'. But Caroll blocked the idea, saying it would be too costly.\n\nRoyal interest in the arcane also extended to the crop circle phenomenon which, some argue, are created by extra-terrestrial life. One of the leading promoters of the mystery, Colin Andrews, sent a copy of his book Circular Evidence, co-written with Pat Delgado, to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn August of that year, The Times revealed that the book had been added to the Royal Family's 'holiday reading list'. Shortly afterwards, Andrews received a note from Buckingham Palace asking if he would provide updates 'on the latest developments on the Circles Phenomenon' for the Duke of Edinburgh, who had become a paid subscriber to his Crop Circles newsletter.\n\nBut the royals turned down Andrews' offer to provide a personal briefing on the subject, perhaps having learned lessons from the duke's earlier flirtation with George Adamski and his friends.\n\nNo one has been able to establish the full extent of the Duke of Edinburgh's personal interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena as he never mentioned the subject in media interviews.\n\nHowever, several contributors to the documentary, King Of UFOs, say that the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle include sealed files that are not to be opened until 90 years after his death \u2013 so more may yet be revealed.\n\nIn 2017, I wrote to Prince Philip to ask if correspondence on UFOs and crop circles had been preserved. I said there was considerable public interest in its contents, in particular the private study of the subject, completed on his behalf by Peter Horsley in 1955.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, Prince Philip's private secretary, Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, responded: 'I am afraid that extensive searches have not yielded any papers that would be of help to your research. This letter comes with His Royal Highness's best wishes.'\n\nIf he did know the truth, the duke \u2013 private, discreet and careful to the end \u2013 took it with him. But what about King Charles?"

        "article_content": "Fears of an alien invasion in the US took hold in the 1960s and 70s after reports of UFOs hovering over military bases flooded the nation.\n\nNow, decades later, a UFO expert has claimed that the extraterrestrial spaceships did visit 'every major nuclear missile base' and continue to do so to this day.\n\nRobert Hastings, who has interviewed many Army personnel about the bizarre sightings, said: 'The ones that are currently operational, have been visited repeatedly year after year according to the sources that I have interviewed.'\n\nHastings recently made waves when he revealed more than 120 former service members had come forward about their encounters with flying objects near nuclear weapon storage and testing grounds.\n\n'A public, grassroots effort must be made in the interim to understand \u2013 as best as possible, using the data gathered thus far \u2013 the nature and intentions of those who pilot the UFOs,' Hastings penned in his recent book recounting the interviews.\n\n'Or perhaps they have a use for our planet, let's say for scientific purposes, and know that global nuclear warfare will disrupt their data-gathering and/or experiments.'\n\nIn his book, UFOs and Nukes, he revealed that investigators are prevented from properly probing the cases because of dubious layers of classification.\n\nOne thing is for sure, however, it is 'obvious' that if there are extraterrestrial visitors, they are 'greatly interested in our nuclear weapons.'\n\nA UFO expert claimed that UFOs have long visited nuclear bases and continue to do so. For at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of small 'drones' were seen penetrating the highly restricted airspace above Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\n\nHastings' comments echo a study released in June that analyzed over 500 of the best-supported UFO cases from the heights of the Cold War, which concluded that 'this intelligence understands atomics, and they understand atomic weaponry.'\n\nUFO reports over America's nuclear arsenal appeared to shift from sites where the bombs were made to missile silos and US air bases as the Cold War arms race grew.\n\nThe study was conducted by a retired US Air Force staff sergeant, data analyst affiliated with Harvard's UFO-hunting Galileo Project Ian Porrit and a research team.\n\nThe group focused on official military and police reports of UFOs from 1945 to 1975, avoiding poorly supported accounts and ambiguous newspaper stories, to focus on cases with multiple witnesses and signal evidence, like radar.\n\nTheir study, which only covered US cases, also used reports of UFOs spotted above non-nuclear army bases and nearby civilian centers to act as control groups to test against their findings of any UFO trends at America's sensitive nuclear installations.\n\nThe team found that data from 1948 through 1975, showed support to the idea that extraterrestrials, or some other intelligence, has methodically surveilled America's rise to a nuclear power.\n\n'This intelligence understands the developmental cycle. They have some contextual knowledge of what they're looking at and what they're looking for,' Hancock told DailyMail.com, given these shifts in reported UFO sightings over time.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1952, as America's production of atomic weapons first ramped up, waves of UFO sightings began cropping up over Washington state's Hanford nuclear production complex, as well as Los Alamos and other sites for the Manhattan Project.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis (pictured)\n\n'What we know now is that inside the Air Force for the first seven to 10 years they sincerely believed it was the Russians,' Hancock told DailyMail.com.\n\n'And when they couldn't prove that,' he said, 'it became very political.'\n\nFrom 1952 onward, their study found cases of UFOs probing near active nuclear weapons took precedence, with a wave of sightings around America's new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) starting in the 1960s.\n\n'When you get to those ICBM bases, from about 1965 to 1975, these things are occurring at night,' Hancock pointed out.\n\n'And they are they are much more intrusive. They're very low altitude, they penetrate the security perimeters of the base,' he added.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including 17 nights in December 2023 when swarms of UFOs were tracked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\n\nThese brazen penetrations over Langley \u2014 home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighters \u2014 led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.\n\nTo date, Langley's mystery UFOs have eluded identification by the Pentagon, police and even NASA's high-altitude research plane, the WB-57F, called in to investigate.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck, the commander with North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD), who led the mission to take down the infamous Chinese spy balloon in February 2023, described that Langley wave as unlike any other known case.\n\n'If there are unknown objects within North America,' General VanHerck told the Wall Street Journal, 'go out and identify them.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last week that the UFOs were 'swarms of smaller craft' released by 'motherships.'\n\nHe explained that was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\nMellon told DailyMail.com: 'I make no claims regarding their origin, perhaps many are Chinese drones.'\n\n'[But] in some instances,' Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

        "article_content": "Claude has a new \u201capp\u201d for Windows 11/10, and I tried it out. And guess what? It simply loads https://claude.ai/ in an Electron Chromium container. For those who are unaware, Chromium powers most of the browsers you use today, such as Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and Arc.\n\nThere used to be a time when companies and developers tried building full-fledged apps, native apps that matched the look and feel of Windows. Native apps are still shipped on MacOS or iOS, but I feel that the \u201cera\u201d is long gone on Windows 11/10 and is not coming back unless somebody is building advanced apps.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new apps are mostly based on Edge WebView, and its competitors also prefer to ship web-based apps. Worse, they use the slower Chromium instead of Microsoft Edge (Edge WebView). After ChatGPT\u2019s Chromium Windows app, Claude has also shipped a similar app.\n\nLike ChatGPT, Claude\u2019s app for Windows 11 (and Windows 10) is powered by Electron.\n\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that the Claude AI\u2019s app is using an Electron (Chromium) wrapper. We can tell because there are several files typically found in Electron applications. For example, files like \u201cchrome_100_percent.pak\u201d and \u201cchrome_200_percent.pak\u201d are often part of the Chromium engine.\n\nWe also spotted files like \u201clibEGL.dll,\u201d \u201clibGLESv2.dll,\u201d and \u201cvulkan-1.dll\u201d, which confirms Claude is using Chromium\u2019s rendering engine.\n\nThese are used by Electron to render web content. Electron itself is not necessarily bad, and apps like Notion Ink or Slack also use Electron but deliver a good experience.\n\nIn the case of Claude, it\u2019s simply loading the AI\u2019s website. It doesn\u2019t make sense to use Electron when all it tries to load is the website in a Chromium shell.\n\nAn Electron Chromium wrapper is heavier than using Edge WebView2 (pre-installed in Windows 11). Claude is installing its own Chromium bundle, which is why it could take more than 200 MB of storage space after some use.\n\nThis is more than the new Copilot app, another web wrapper, but it takes less than a megabyte of space on your PC.\n\nThe large size and increased resource consumption come from the fact that it\u2019s shipping its own version of Chromium. This is similar to carrying an entire instance of Chrome inside it, which could contribute to increased RAM usage when you use the app.\n\nThis goes for the ChatGPT app for Windows 11, too.\n\nClaude\u2019s new app for Windows 11 (and Windows 10) is completely free, and anyone, including those with paid subscription ($20) can access it. For some reason, Claude\u2019s app is not available in the Microsoft Store, so you\u2019ll need to download it from the company\u2019s website.\n\nWe absolutely see no reason to use the Electron-based Claude over its webpage unless you want to try the Ctrl+Alt+Space keyboard shortcut to open Claude AI anywhere on Windows in a small flyout.\n\nDo you really need these AI apps on Windows?\n\nIf you want to use ChatGPT or Claude on Windows, we recommend accessing them via your browser unless you really want to use some of the desktop-exclusive features.\n\nClaude offers no advantage over its website except the picture in picture mode, which is also available in ChatGPT (screenshot below).\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT app has another advantage over the website: advanced voice mode on the desktop. This allows you to talk to ChatGPT like a human.\n\nCopilot has a similar feature called \u201cVision,\u201d which is more advanced than ChatGPT\u2019s integration. However, it\u2019s still being tested in Microsoft Edge, and we don\u2019t know when it will ship to everyone.\n\nWith Copilot Vision, you\u2019ll be able talk about the Microsoft Edge screen using your voice in real time."

Western Slope Paranormal is a group of local investigators studying potential hauntings.\n\nThe Elk\u2019s Lodge, Avalon Theater, and The Goat and Cover Tavern are few of the many local haunted stops on the ghost walk. Paranormal Investigator, Nina Carrillo, says activity is often detected using a flash light. During investigations she sets it in an area away from her, and asks questions promoting a response. Often times activity will reply by turning on the light, without anyone touching it.\n\nInvestigators also works with local community members and businesses to address their concerns of paranormal activity. They travel to private residencies and conduct investigations, answering questions and help provide peace of mind.\n\nWhile Halloween wraps up the ghost walks for the season, the organization remains involved with the community by hosting fundraisers and monthly meetings.

When we were there they said about us coming to do The Crown Inn.\n\n\"It was the cellar at The Crown where the staff said they felt like they were being watched and had a nervous feeling.\n\n(Image: Supplied) \"Often when they have to go to the back of the cellar and they're walking back through and they are going up the step, they feel like someone is behind them. They swear they can hear footsteps.\"\n\nThe session saw Sarah and her team attempt to communicate with the spirits that were lurking in the Carlisle pub and investigate the cellar which gave all involved an 'uneasy' feeling.\n\nShe said: \"As soon as we arrived I was very aware of a gentleman who had a lot of facial hair and a slim build near the men's toilets. We really felt that he was going to communicate with us but we didn't get much from him.\n\n\"We set up the automatic writing planchette but nothing came through. We did have K2s going off which pick off electromagnetic fields and a few noises.\n\n\"Then we went to the cellar and I think all of us felt uneasy down there. We did a bit of calling out down there and the REM pod went off a few times which also picks up electromagnetic fields.\n\n\"Nothing much really happened but we are hoping that when we go back over the evidence it could be different.\"\n\nSarah was also keen to thank the staff members from The Crown Inn who took part in the investigation.\n\nShe said: \"Everybody said they enjoyed it and had a great night.\n\n\"The staff were very brave and they were really into it and enjoying it.\""

It is newsworthy when archeologists and paleontologists find a new location that contains fossils, but what about the first fossil discovery?\n\nChrissy: The earliest recorded discovery of a remnant of dinosaur history was in 1676 when Robert Plot found a huge thigh bone in England. Back in the early 17th century, dinosaurs weren't something that were part of public common knowledge, so these finds were either thought to belong to huge humans or mythical creatures.\n\nJasmine: It wasn't until the early 1800's that it was suspected that giant animals once roamed the earth and not giant humans. Gideon Mantell found a gigantic fossil while digging in the Sussex quarry which turned out to be one of the first known lguanodon teeth to ever be found. This was a key turning point in how scientists dug for and classified fossils.\n\nChrissy: A quest for paleontology supremacy brought forth the discovery of many new dinosaur genre during the American Gilded Age of the 19th Century. \"The Bone Wars\", a fierce and underhanded competition between Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, saw the use of bribery, theft, destruction of bones, funding tampering, and public attacks in scientific publications that went on to publicly ruin both men financially and in reputation. Their losses brought forth gains for the Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, and Triceratops.\n\nJasmine: In the mid 1800's the word \"dinosaur\" was first coined by Sir Richard Owen, an English biologist and paleontologist. He recognized these giant ancient animals as the order of Dinosauria and began the modern era of dinosaur research and classification.\n\nChrissy: You've been listening to The Sound of Science on WNIJ, where you learn something new every day."

        "article_content": "Generative AI is as trendy as it has ever been.\n\nThis year, research into AI was awarded Nobel Prizes, and the largest tech companies in the world pumped AI into as many products as possible. The U.S. government promoted AI as a driver in creating a clean-energy economy and a strategic pillar for federal spending. But what\u2019s next for 2025?\n\nThe trend of generative AI in the last few months of 2024 points to a greater push for adoption from tech companies. Meanwhile, the results as to whether AI products and processes see ROI for enterprise software buyers are mixed. While it\u2019s difficult to foresee how AI will continue to shape the tech industry, experts have offered predictions based on current trends.\n\nRespondents to an IEEE study in September rated AI as one of the top three areas of technology that will be most critical in 2025 in 58% of cases. Conversely, nearly all respondents (91%) agree that 2025 will see \u201ca generative AI reckoning\u201d regarding what the technology can or should do. Expectations for generative AI are high, but the success of projects leveraging it remains uncertain.\n\n1. AI agents will be the next buzzword\n\nBased on my research and observations, the use of AI agents will surge in 2025.\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads. As with generative AI, the definition of an agent\u2019s capabilities is unclear. IBM defines it as an AI that can reason through complex problems, such as OpenAI o1. However, not all products billed as AI agents can reason that way.\n\nRegardless of their capabilities, AI agents and their use cases will likely be at the forefront of generative AI marketing in 2025. AI \u201cagents\u201d could be the next stage of evolution for this year\u2019s AI \u201ccopilots.\u201d AI agents could spend time working through multi-stage jobs independently while their human counterpart handles another task.\n\n2. AI will both help and hurt security teams\n\nBoth cybersecurity attackers and defenders will continue to take advantage of AI in 2025. 2024 has already seen the proliferation of generative AI security products. These products can write code, detect threats, answer thorny questions, or serve as a \u201crubber duck\u201d for brainstorming.\n\nBut generative AI may present information that is inaccurate. Security professionals may spend as much time double-checking the output as they would if they had performed the work themselves. Failing to review such information can lead to broken code and even more security issues.\n\n\u201cAs AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini become deeply integrated into business operations, the risk of accidental data exposure skyrockets with new data privacy challenges,\u201d Jeremy Fuchs, cyber security evangelist at Check Point Software Technologies, said in an email to TechRepublic. \u201cIn 2025, organizations must move swiftly to implement strict controls and governance over AI usage, ensuring the benefits of these technologies don\u2019t come at the cost of data privacy and security.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI models are susceptible to malicious actors like any other software, particularly via jailbreak attacks.\n\n\u201cAI\u2019s growing role in cyber crime is undeniable,\u201d Fuchs explained. \u201cBy 2025, AI will not only enhance the scale of attacks but also their sophistication. Phishing attacks will be harder to detect, with AI continuously learning and adapting.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI can make conventional methods of identifying phishing emails \u2014 poor grammar or out-of-the-blue messages \u2014 obsolete. Disinformation security will become more important as AI-generated videos, audio, and text proliferate. As a result, security teams must adapt to both using and defending against generative AI \u2014 just as they have adapted to other significant changes in business technology, such as the large-scale migration to the cloud.\n\n3. Businesses will evaluate whether AI delivers ROI\n\n\u201cThe pendulum has swung from \u2018new AI innovation at any cost\u2019 to a resounding imperative to prove ROI in board rooms across the world,\u201d Uzi Dvir, global CIO at digital adoption platform company WalkMe, said in an email. \u201cSimilarly, employees are asking themselves if it\u2019s worth the time and effort to figure out how to use these new technologies for their specific roles.\u201d\n\nOrganizations struggle to determine whether generative AI adds value and to what use cases it can make the most difference. Organizations that adopt AI often face high costs and unclear goals. It can be difficult to quantify the benefits of generative AI use, where those benefits manifest, and what to compare them to.\n\nThis challenge is a side effect of the integration of generative AI into many other applications. It makes some decision-makers wonder whether generative AI add-ons truly boost the value of those applications. AI tiers can be costly, and over the next year, more companies are expected to rigorously test \u2014 and sometimes discard \u2014 the features that don\u2019t deliver results.\n\nMany companies that are incorporating generative AI at a large scale are seeing success. At its Q3 earnings call, Google attributed this result to its AI infrastructure and products such as AI Overviews. However, Meta reported that AI may significantly increase capital expenditures, even as user numbers decline.\n\nSEE: Google Cloud is previewing its sixth generation of the AI accelerator Trillium.\n\n4. AI will make a major impact on scientific research\n\nAlong with impacting enterprise productivity, contemporary AI has seen significant movement in science.\n\nFour of 2024\u2019s Nobel Prize winners used AI:\n\nDemis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for predicting the structure of proteins with AlphaFold2.\n\nJohn J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the Nobel Prize for Physics for their decades-spanning work developing neural networks.\n\nThe White House held a summit on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 about the use of AI in life sciences, highlighting how AI enables solutions to complex challenges in ways that impact the world. This trend is likely to continue into next year as generative AI models grow and mature.\n\n5. The environmental tools made with AI won\u2019t offset its energy toll\n\nEnergy efficiency is another buzzword in AI.\n\nBut for every use case in which AI can help predict weather patterns or optimize energy use, there is another story about the environmental cost of building the data centers needed to run generative AI. Such construction requires massive amounts of electricity and water \u2014 and rising global temperatures only compound the problem. It\u2019s unlikely an equilibrium will be reached in this large-scale problem.\n\nFor businesses, though, expect to see companies touting dubious and genuine claims of energy savings and environmental friendliness around AI. Consider the resource use attached to your organization\u2019s AI strategy.\n\nWhat are the most popular generative AI products?\n\nThe most well-known generative AI products are:\n\nChatGPT, the OpenAI chatbot\n\nGoogle Gemini\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nGPT-4, the large language model behind ChatGPT\n\nDALL-E 3, an image generator\n\nWhat is the most advanced generative AI?\n\nVarious tests have been proposed as potential criteria for determining the most advanced generative AI. Some organizations rate their models on human educational benchmarks, such as the International Mathematics Olympiad or Codeforce competitions.\n\nOther evaluations, such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding, were explicitly created for generative AI. Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra, China Mobile\u2019s Jiutian, and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o sit at the top of the MMLU leaderboard today."
