        "article_content": "Do you fondly remember playing 8-bit adventures on the NES and original Sega consoles? Titles like Contra, Ninja Gaiden, and Mega Man 2, all from the late \u201880s, provided a unique gaming experience that\u2019s hard to replicate today with modern technology. Hard, sure, but it\u2019s possible\u2014as we\u2019ve now witnessed firsthand with the release of UFO 50.\n\n\n\nThe collection\u2014presented as a lost collection from a forgotten developer of the era\u2014features an assortment of single- and multiplayer games across multiple genres, from platformers to roguelikes, with even a few in-depth RPGs mixed in. All are created with an 8-bit retro style that harkens back to the days of gaming in your living room after school. You can beat some of the games in mere minutes, then move on to the next; others, however, require a few hours and multiple playthroughs. They\u2019re all unique, many of them are memorable, and some deserve no more than a single run-through.\n\nWhen we sifted through the Steam user reviews, we found an overwhelmingly positive reception from the gaming community. Most people love the indie retro collection and cannot praise the fun factor enough. As you\u2019ll see below, nostalgia plays a significant role in many of the reviews. Numerous players gave a thumbs up because it felt like playing a game from their childhood, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling young again and enjoying your hobby!\n\nBut a few couldn\u2019t get past many titles, which lack the quality-of-life features in modern gaming, or--they say--feel outdated and unnecessarily complex just for nostalgia\u2019s sake. Despite the positive reviews, the negative ones prove highly negative. Many curse out the game and its developers; they shout from the rooftops about how unfun they thought most of the retro titles were to play.\n\nSurprisingly, we didn\u2019t find many meme reviews, just plenty of positive or negative reviews to help you better understand the game. Here is UFO 50, as told by Steam reviews!\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\n.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

        "article_content": "Where to Stream: The Man Who Loved UFOs\n\n\n\nPowered by Reelgood\n\nTruth and fiction are about equally strange in director Diego Lerman\u2019s The Man Who Loved UFOs (now on Netflix), an Argentinian film about a real-life oily TV journalist who ventured to the sticks in the mid-\u201980s and stirred up nationwide interest in some alleged UFO sightings, which makes it a rather unusual BOATS (Based On A True Story) movie. Leonardo Sbaraglia plays Jose de Zer, whose sensational approach to \u201cstrange phenomena,\u201d for Americans like myself, is reminiscent of Geraldo Rivera\u2019s famed live-broadcast failure to find a damn thing inside Al Capone\u2019s vault besides dirt and rocks \u2013 except Geraldo didn\u2019t make shit up out of whole cloth like Jose did.\n\nTHE MAN WHO LOVED UFOS: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nThe Gist: Right off the bat, we get a sense of what kind of journalist Jose is: He interviews Buenos Aires stage and TV star La Monica (Monica Ayos) with his pants at his ankles. I guess it\u2019s allowed, since they occasionally schtup each other. But his lack of journalistic boundaries and professionalism in this instance is nothing compared to his pending enterprise \u2013 a pending enterprise that\u2019s perhaps inspired by a strange occurrence where he seems to witness a strange light in the sky, then collapses, convulsing and foaming at the mouth. While unconscious, he dreams of the time he fought in the Six-Day War and ended up lost alone in a vast desert for hours. In this particular version of the story, he at one point looks up toward the blistering sun and sees a vast disc-shaped object that enshrouds him in a shadow; whether this actually happened or is just added-value dream-nonsense is left up for our interpretation.\n\nWhile in the hospital, reps from La Candelaria, a rural town in the state of Cordoba, pitch him a serendipitous story: Some weirdness happened in the mountains that might make for a good story on news program Notidiario. Lights in the sky, awestruck locals, scorched ground, stuff like that. So Jose grabs his trusty cameraman Chango (Sergio Prina) and they trek out to the mountains, where they assemble a goofy piece about the phenomenon, which includes a bunch of sketchy speculation and includes drecky lines from Jose like \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d and \u201cdraw your own conclusions.\u201d Classic.\n\nWhether Jose actually believes it or not isn\u2019t made clear. But he is certain that it\u2019ll draw viewership, so he used-car-salesman hard-pitches the story to his skeptical, reluctant bosses as \u201cwhat has not been proven yet, but everyone believes,\u201d gets the piece on the air, then drinks in celebration with those very same bosses when the ratings spike. So of course, he\u2019s sent right back out to investigate further, and that\u2019s when he starts planting artifacts, \u201ccasting\u201d locals to do \u201cinterviews\u201d about UFO sightings and interpreting random \u201cfindings\u201d as evidence of alien visitors \u2013 and telling his daughter Marti (Renata Lerman, director Diego Lerman\u2019s daughter), who\u2019s getting bullied at school because of her famous-slash-infamous father\u2019s dopey quasi-journalism, that his stories are absolutely true, but he\u2019s just reenacting the truth. Does he believe his own bullshit? Yes, no, I don\u2019t know. I mean, that\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? What do you think? Draw your own conclusions!\n\nNetflix\n\nWhat Movies Will It Remind You Of?: It\u2019s called The Mystery of Al Capone\u2019s Vaults. It\u2019s the highest-rated syndicated special ever. Don\u2019t watch it \u2013 the buildup is lousy and the payoff is even worse. Total dud. Two thumbs down!\n\nPerformance Worth Watching: I liked Sbaraglia\u2019s amusing take on an essentially impenetrable personality who\u2019s caught in a nether-zone between delusion and reality. His best moments aren\u2019t when Jose\u2019s grandstanding, though \u2013 Sbaraglia\u2019s interactions with Renata Lerman, whose character functions as her father\u2019s conscience.\n\nMemorable Dialogue: Jose pauses for a moment of self-reflection with his trusted compadre Chango:\n\nJose: Listen. Do you think I\u2019m a\u2026 Chango: A phony? Jose: No. I know I\u2019m a phony.\n\nSex and Skin: A randy commingling between Jose and Moni backstage at her goofy talk show.\n\nOur Take: The primary dramatic thrust of The Man Who Loved UFOs is the push-and-pull within Jose: Was his \u201cencounter\u201d early in the film real, or just the effects of, say, a stroke or panic attack? He fakes his stories, but does he truly believe extraterrestrials have visited Earth? Is he after the truth, or just attention, fame and ratings? There are no simple, easy answers to these questions. Part of the film\u2019s allure is the slippery mystery of a man at its center. He\u2019s a fascinating figure, but he doesn\u2019t seem to truly know himself. So should we even try to understand him?\n\nDespite all this, Jose still feels like a lightweight character leading a movie that he can\u2019t carry for its heavy run time of 107 minutes. It takes a while for the narrative to rev up, and even once it gets going, its RPMs are low; this is definitely a movie that could be focused and sharpened dramatically and comedically with another pass or two in the editing room. It\u2019s also provincial, and likely lacks appeal outside Argentina, where Jose de Zer is a cultural footnote \u2013 although a bit where Jose\u2019s \u201cinterviews\u201d keep being interrupted by a bleating baby goat is funny, I otherwise struggled to connect with the comedy due to lack of context.\n\nWhether Diego Lerman is trying to say something about the current state of journalism and \u201cfake news\u201d is lost in the shuffle as he tries to play fancifully with his main character, trying to toe the line between silly and serious, in a quest to find Jose the Human amidst the absurd folly of Jose the Legend. Is he more clown than man? Draw your own conclusions.\n\nOur Call: Despite some game performances and a high-ceiling true story as its basis, The Man Who Loved UFOs never quite comes together. Argentinians familiar with the subject may get more traction with it, but the rest of us would be wise to SKIP IT.\n\nJohn Serba is a freelance writer and film critic based in Grand Rapids, Michigan."

        "article_content": "Another New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nRIO RANCHO, N.M. \u2013 Another New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nThe portable classrooms at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary are the new home of the National UFO Historical Records Archive. It\u2019s the largest collection of UFO sighting documents in the country, and maybe the world.\n\nNow, thanks to a partnership with Rio Rancho Public Schools, the amateur collectors who kept all these records safe over the years are finally making them available to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally overwhelming. People don\u2019t have any conception until they come here how much material that we\u2019re talking about. And it really, I think, makes people pause and realize there\u2019s a lot more to this UFO subject than I ever thought,\u201d said David Marler, executive director of the National UFO Historical Records Center.\n\nMarler knows the idea of a UFO records archive probably sounds silly to some folks, but he says that skepticism is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t care what your take is on the UFO subject. In fact, we welcome differing opinions, differing perspectives,\u201d said Marler.\n\nThe National UFO Historical Records Center is a nonprofit organizing hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents, news clippings, photos, videos and more evidence from across the globe all under one roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional historical archive dedicated to a non-traditional subject. We want serious research to be conducted here in the hopes ultimately of maybe gaining a better insight into this mystery that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for 75 plus years,\u201d said Marler.\n\nHe says there are countless connections to be discovered now that all these case files are together.\n\n\u201cSome organizations interviewed witnesses that the other did not, and vice versa, and sometimes there\u2019s new insights provided by one investigative organization that was never obtained by this one,\u201d said Marler. \u201cThe more minds, the more set of eyeballs we have looking at the data as with any subject, the better we\u2019re going to be if we truly want to try to understand what we\u2019re dealing with when we talk about UFOs.\u201d\n\nMarler\u2019s collection \u2013 which used to live inside his Rio Rancho home \u2013 is largely a collection of other collections sent in from fellow UFO archivists. With all this extra space donated by Rio Rancho Public Schools, Marler says they\u2019re ready for more.\n\n\u201cWe have about 10 to 12 other collections that are also in the queue,\u201d Marler said. \u201cTwo individuals I know in Ohio have stated, \u2018You\u2019re already in my will. If anything happens to me, my material is coming to Rio Rancho.'\u201d\n\nWhether or not you believe in aliens, Marler says the overwhelming amount of documentation is worth preserving.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important because it is an element of history, it is an element of our culture. So that\u2019s really how we try to view it,\u201d said Marler. \u201cIf we can\u2019t define the answers to the UFO mystery, maybe in 40, 50, 60, years someone might, but they can only do that by looking at the data.\u201d\n\nWhile this is a public archive, it\u2019s a not a free for all. Marler says you\u2019ll have to submit a request on their website to set up a time to come and visit. The idea is that you\u2019ll have full access to everything inside.\n\nBut why would Rio Rancho Public Schools get involved with something like this.\n\n\u201cOur students find the subject matter of UFO investigation very intriguing. And so we want to do is we want to use that as a catalyst in order to get students involved in other types of learning,\u201d said RRPS Chief Operating Officer Michael Baker. \u201cSo we think that the parents, as long as the students are learning, we\u2019re not trying to persuade thinking one way or another, we think we\u2019re going to see some really good benefits from this area.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials say the partnership is expected to last at least five years.\n\nAnother New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect."

        "article_content": "At first not many were using Google's NotebookLM to take notes. But it's been receiving more attention since it added a feature letting users create an audio summary of files in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice. Zacharie Scheurer/dpa\n\nA previously little known Google-created AI research and note-taking tool has \u201creally taken off\u201d after it added an audio feature which turned notes into podcast-like audio and the results went viral, one of its product managers has said.\n\nNotebookLM was first released last year as an AI tool to help users interact with their documents \u2013 allowing them to upload a range of files and get summaries and explanations based on that content.\n\nBut the app has begun receiving more mainstream public attention in recent weeks after it added a feature called Audio Overviews, which enabled users to create an audio summary of their upload files, but in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice.\n\nVarious results from using the tool quickly circulated online and brought new users to the app.\n\nNow Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs and one of the people leading the build of NotebookLM, says users are hungry for more editing control over the type of Audio Overviews they can create with the tool.\n\n\u201cThis is such an exciting time, because since we\u2019ve launched it everyone on Twitter and Reddit and even in our Discord is saying \u2018I want the knobs\u2019, particularly for more voices, or \u2018I want to change the length\u2019,\u201d she told the PA news agency.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to change everything, and we\u2019re definitely going to address this. We\u2019re shipping features quickly to give people more control, but we\u2019re trying to be thoughtful about which controls we ship first.\u201d\n\nAn update to NotebookLM has since rolled out, allowing users to tweak which topics or areas from their source notes they would like covered specifically.\n\nMs Martin added: \u201cI always get asked the question \u2018who is the tool for\u2019 or \u2018who is your target audience?\u2019 and most of the time I\u2019ve thought about it in the same way, which is; what is the person\u2019s profession? How are they applying this to their everyday life?.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we were very, very fortunate in that when we launched Notebook as Project Tailwind last year, we just launched the tool with none of those assumptions to try to find out how people would use it.\u201d\n\nShe said this lack of a specific target audience has helped show that the app could be applicable for anyone who \u201cworks on a computer\u201d, particularly when it came to the audio summaries, and the team building the app were already hearing stories of people listening to the Audio Overviews like a podcast to help them digest their notes.\n\n\u201cSpecifically for the audio, I think one of our key insights is that there are a lot of jobs that require you to digest a lot of information \u2013 and not just jobs \u2013 learners, students of all ages, educators\u2026 basically, if you\u2019re working on a computer, this is the sort of thing you could probably find utility in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of people that the way they use it is to listen to the audio first and then write their own questions down, and that had me thinking what a magical harmony between people, technology, information, knowledge, and I think we\u2019re just at the starting line of what this can do.\u201d\n\nNotebookLM has not had the high-profile launch of Google\u2019s flagship AI assistant, Gemini, which powers NotebookLM, but Ms Martin said the newfound fame the note-taking tool had found meant this \u201ctrue experimental product for Google\u201d was getting a more serious product road-map.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ll say in terms of how we\u2019re approaching the continuing rollout is that I think we\u2019ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they\u2019re using it every day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that the way we want to keep pushing forward is to really stabilise the experience, and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to try to connect this to everyday people and make it really relevant.\n\n\u201cSo I think that while the feature work that we\u2019re doing is exciting, I think now is the right time to also start addressing how do we make it so much easier to use.\n\n\u201cBecause for better or worse, that\u2019s not where a lot of our attention has been, but now that we have a lot more interest, a lot more users, let\u2019s make it a lot easier.\u201d"

She ultimately sought the help of a counselor. It was not until her most recent pregnancy that she also started to use an AI chatbot on the fem-tech app Soula, which she said helped with reducing depressive symptoms and reassuring her about her mental health.\n\n\"It tells me: 'Welcome back, LeRonika. Your reactions are natural,'\" said Francis, who is based in New Iberia, Louisiana.\n\nThe AI chatbot called \"Dua\" also sent her some videos that she could watch about self-hugging, a practice that could reduce stress levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I feel like Dua is there more than anything. It really showed me: OK, this is what you could do. Make sure you make time for yourself, too, because that's important as well,\" said Francis.\n\nSoula was co-founded by Natallia Miranchuk and Andrei Kulik, who conceptualized a 24/7 AI doula that could close the gap in mental health support for mothers during pregnancy and postpartum periods. Rather than replacing medical providers, apps such as Soula aim to increase broader access to maternal healthcare. Healthcare providers said that these apps could also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system, where wait times can be long and workers face burnout.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with OB/GYN doctors and doulas, who largely welcomed the rise in AI chatbots because they can make information more accessible to patients.\n\nAccording to data obtained from Sensor Tower, Soula now has more than 35,000 downloads. The startup has fundraised over $750,000 and is backed by investors such as Andrey Mikhaylyuk, the former vice president of product at Flo Health, a period tracking app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranchuk told BI that her experiences as a single mother of two and her work as a former maternity photographer inspired her to develop a supportive app for women. Initially conceptualized as a hub to connect doulas worldwide to those in need, the generative AI boom shifted the startup's focus to integrating a chatbot that could serve more populations.\n\n\"Women are shy to ask questions, even in the community, because they have the feeling that maybe 'as a mom, I should have known that, but I don't.' And she doesn't know where to go,\" Miranchuk said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe ease of customizing ChatGPT has spurred a wave of new AI-based chatbots like Soula. According to Sensor Tower, the companion apps Character.ai, Talkie, and Paradot have more than 73 million collective downloads, soaring more than 130% between 2023 and 2024. AI therapy apps such as Wysa and Woebot received over 1 million downloads, the data said.\n\nCorenia Smith, director of the Birth Justice Collaborative in Minnesota, said that while popularizing tools like chatbots can help broaden healthcare access, it is important to avoid a \"one size fits all\" and ensure that AI can reflect the communities it serves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are cultural practices that exist and have existed for thousands of years that people still use,\" Smith said. \"A human could talk about all their experience and what they've seen and give referrals. When you reach that limitation with an AI, it has to have the ability to hand over care or make a referral in a way where people don't feel dropped.\"\n\nThe role of a doula\n\nThe AI chatbot Dua aims to function like a doula, providing mothers with information about the pregnancy experience during a time of transition.\n\nDoulas are trained professionals who can provide non-medical, continuous physical, emotional, and information support for women before, during, and after childbirth, helping to reduce mental health-related morbidity for the mother and reduce infant mortality rates.\n\nAccess to doulas can be costly. While there's Medicaid coverage for doulas in several states, not all private health insurance plans cover these expenses. Long wait times and socioeconomic inequality also contribute to increased levels of stress and lack of healthcare usage among mothers and pregnant people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Traditionally, it's been something that's been available only to folks with a lot of money and a lot of resources. The people that benefit the most from doula care are those that might not trust the healthcare system,\" said Dr. Devon Rupley, an attending physician and OB/GYN specialist at NYC Health. \"That tends to be people of color who've had previously negative experiences with racism and bias that can really harm their experience in the healthcare system generally.\"\n\nRupley added that using an AI healthcare app to address basic questions can allow patients to spend higher-quality time with doctors by asking high-level questions and discussing their healthcare issues.\n\nDua is the Soula app's built-in AI chatbot. Soula\n\nHow to design an empathetic AI chatbot\n\nSoula enlisted real-life doulas to help train its chatbot and strike the right tone.\n\n\"We can't create it to be as personable as talking to a real-life person, but we can try to create that as much as possible,\" said Lexi Pacheco, a doula from Arizona who worked to help refine the dialogue in Soula's chatbot Dua. For $22 per hour, she helped improve the chatbot by using it \"hand-in-hand\" during her pregnancies, adding in her expertise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile asking questions on Google could yield more informational responses, Pacheco said mothers would want something that provided \"more of that reassurance that Google wouldn't.\"\n\nFor Armani Grant, a Soula user who became pregnant at 18, Google felt overwhelming. The chatbot allowed her to ask questions that she wouldn't feel comfortable asking her mother.\n\nPacheco said many women she's worked with reported similar experiences.\n\n\"They might even feel incompetent to ask the question, which no woman should ever feel, but with my history of working with people, they definitely tend to revert to: I'm sorry, I'm asking this question for some reason, and that might just be because of the societal pressure that more medicalized doctors have put on people that they don't give the time and day to us,\" Pacheco said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app isn't meant to completely replace a doula. Moreover, retention rates of AI healthcare chatbots can be low, said Johannes Eichstaedt, a computational social scientist and assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University. The high dropout rates for healthcare apps are \"an elephant in the room,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Pacheco said AI bots can help \"calm nerves\" and fill the gaps when patients feel they are \"bothering\" their healthcare providers.\n\n\"AI isn't like a healthcare provider to give you guidance, but it's supposed to be there to give you a little bit more comfort,\" Pacheco said."

        "date": "10h",
        "source": "Popular Science",
        "article_content": "For the first time, physicists have observed a \u201cblack hole triple\u201d in space. This new system is about 8,000 light years away from Earth and is made up of a central black hole that is in the act of consuming a small star spiraling very close to it. Surprisingly, a second star appears to also be circling the central black hole, but much further away. The discovery is described in a study published October 23 in the journal Nature.\n\nHitting a triple\n\nMost of the black holes that scientists have detected appear to be part of a pair called a binary system. These systems are made up of the black hole and a secondary object like a star, much denser neutron star, or another black hole. The binary system then spirals around each other and are drawn together by the black hole\u2019s gravity.\n\nFor this new black hole triple, there is an additional object orbiting the central black hole. The closer star orbits the black hole about every 6.5 days. The authors estimate that the more far-off companion orbits the black hole every 70,000 years.\n\n[Related: The hunt for the first stars in the universe.]\n\nThat a black hole appears to have a gravitational hold on an object that is so far away is raising some questions about the origins of this black hole itself. Scientists believe that black holes form from a supernova\u2013the violent explosion of a dying star. During a supernova, a star releases a huge amount of energy and light in one final burst before it collapses into an invisible black hole.\n\nIf this newly-observed black hole resulted from a typical supernova, the energy it would have released before it ultimately collapsed would have kicked away any more loosely bound objects orbiting on its outskirts. In theory, that second outer star shouldn\u2019t still be hanging around.\n\nThe team believes that the black hole formed through a more gentle process instead\u2013direct collapse. During direct collapse, a star simply caves in on itself and forms a black hole without that last dramatic burst. A gentle origin like this wouldn\u2019t really disturb any loosely bound, faraway objects.\n\nSince the new triple system includes a very far-off star, the system\u2019s black hole was potentially born through that gentler direct collapse. While astronomers have been observing violent supernovae for centuries, this new triple system may be the first evidence of a black hole that formed from this more gentle process.\n\n\u201cWe think most black holes form from violent explosions of stars, but this discovery helps call that into question,\u201d study co-author and MIT physicist Kevin Burdge said in a statement. \u201cThis system is super exciting for black hole evolution, and it also raises questions of whether there are more triples out there.\u201d\n\nChance discovery\n\nThis discovery also came about almost by chance. The physicists found it while looking through a repository of astronomical observations taken by telescopes in space and around the world called Aladin Lite. They used Aladin Lite to search for images of the same part of the sky, taken by different telescopes tuned to various wavelengths of energy and light.\n\nOriginally, they were looking within the Milky Way galaxy for signs of new black holes. Out of curiosity, Burdge reviewed an image of V404 Cygni, a black hole roughly 8,000 light years from Earth. In 1992, V404 Cygni became one of the very first objects in space to be confirmed as a black. Since then, it has been documented in over 1,300 scientific papers and is one of our most well-studied black holes. However, none of these studies reported this strange triple system.\n\n[Related: 1.5 billion cosmic objects dazzle in the largest infrared Milky Way map ever created.]\n\nWhile looking at optical images of V404 Cygni, Burdge saw what looked like two blobs of light that were close to one another. The first blob was the black hole and an inner star orbiting close by. That star is so close to the hole that it is releasing some of its material onto the black hole itself and giving off visible light. However, that second blob of light was most likely coming from a very distant star that had not been observed before.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can see two separate stars over this much distance actually means that the stars have to be really very far apart,\u201d said Burdge.\n\nCalculations found that the outer star is 3,500 astronomical units (AU) away from the black hole. One AU is the distance between Earth and the sun. The outer star is thus 3,500 times further away from the black hole as we are to the sun, or 100 times greater than the distance between Pluto and the sun.\n\nThe team then questioned whether the outer star was linked to both the black hole and its inner star. To find an answer, the team looked to Gaia, the satellite that has been tracking the motions of all the stars in the galaxy for a decade. They analyzed the motions of the inner and outer stars over the past 10 years of Gaia data and found that the stars moved in tandem compared to some of the nearby stars. According to their calculations, the odds of this kind of tandem motion are about one in 10 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not a coincidence or accident,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing two stars that are following each other because they\u2019re attached by this weak string of gravity. So this has to be a triple system.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go fly a (space) kite\n\nThe team then wondered how this system could have formed in the first place. The violent explosion of a typical supernova would have kicked that outstar away a very long time ago.\n\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re pulling a kite, and instead of a strong string, you\u2019re pulling with a spider web,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cIf you tugged too hard, the web would break and you\u2019d lose the kite. Gravity is like this barely bound string that\u2019s really weak, and if you do anything dramatic to the inner binary, you\u2019re going to lose the outer star.\u201d\n\nTo test out this kite string theory, Burdge carried out computer simulations to see how this kind of triple system could have evolved and kept the outer star.\n\n[Related: Biggest black hole jets ever seen span 140 Milky Way galaxies.]\n\nAt the beginning of each simulation, he introduced three stars. The third star was the black hole, before it became a black hole. He then ran tens of thousands of simulations. Each simulation had a slightly different scenario for how the third star may have become a black hole and affected the motions of the other two stars. For example, he simulated a supernova and changed the amount of energy and the direction all of that energy traveled in. He also simulated scenarios of direct collapse, where the third star caved in on itself to form a black hole, without sending off any energy.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of simulations show that the easiest way to make this triple work is through direct collapse,\u201d Burdge says.\n\nThis extra outer star also revealed the system\u2019s age. The team observed that the outer star is in the process of becoming a red giant, a phase occurring at the end of a star\u2019s life. They believe that the outerstar is about 4 billion years old, based on this transition. Since the neighboring stars are born around the same time, the team believes that this black hole triple is also 4 billion years old.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been able to do this before for an old black hole,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cNow we know V404 Cygni is part of a triple, it could have formed from direct collapse, and it formed about 4 billion years ago, thanks to this discovery.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Avast One Gold for Mac MSRP $179.99 Score Details \u201cAvast One for Mac offers powerful, free antivirus software with virus scans and browser blocking.\u201d Pros Excellent malware protection record\n\nUser-friendly app\n\nCustomizable plans\n\n24/7 live support\n\nFree app includes a VPN Cons Big price increases on renewal\n\nFree VPN has a 5GB/month cap\n\nAvast is an antivirus software developer that supports macOS, and the Avast One package includes extra cybersecurity features that go beyond simple malware scans. Antivirus, ransomware protection, malware blocking, and more are available in free and paid subscription plans.\n\nA few months ago, I reviewed Avast One for Windows and found it to be a good solution. However, the Mac is a very different computer with unique hardware and software, so I tested Avast One for Mac to find out if it\u2019s a good fit for Apple\u2019s system and one of the best antivirus apps for your Mac.\n\nSpecs\n\nAvast One Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 5 (individual), 30 (family) Support Chat, email Price $180 Free version? Yes\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nAvast One\u2019s website describes its free tier as Basic, but the documentation refers to it as Avast One Essential. Either way, it\u2019s powerful antivirus software that protects your Mac for free. You get a malware scanner and browser protection to block malicious downloads. A free VPN is included but the monthly data is restricted to 5GB. Avast One offers one of the best free Mac antivirus apps available.\n\nIf you subscribe, more features are unlocked, and you can pick from three price tiers and a few variations. Avast One Silver starts at $36 annually with a choice of more protection, privacy, or performance features. Renewal costs are significantly higher than the first year, jumping to $80 in year two and beyond. You can get all three feature packs at once with the $60 Avast One Gold ($130 renewal).\n\nAvast One comes in family plans as well. For $84/$180, Avast One Silver Family increases the number of supported devices from the standard five to a generous 30, enough for everyone to enjoy protection. Avast One Gold Family costs $114/$280 to cover 30 devices.\n\nThe top tier is Avast One Platinum for $120/$300, a relatively minor increase from Avast One Gold Family that adds identity protection, dark web monitoring, and $2 million in identity theft insurance.\n\nDesign\n\nInstalling Avast One was simple, and much easier than my experience with McAfee\u2019s antivirus for Mac. After downloading the installer, a Finder window opened with a message to double-click it. After agreeing to the terms of use and allowing the required permissions, the installer placed itself in the trash and launched Avast One for setup.\n\nI started with the free version, Avast One Essential, initially skipping the sign-in option. The app guided me to enable Avast access in System Settings, opening the appropriate tabs along the way. After a few clicks, everything was ready in about a minute.\n\nI got a friendly message saying \u201cEverything looks good,\u201d but lacking enough details to convince me. I scrolled down to the shortcuts and found an option to run a system scan. The app updated its virus data, checked my browser caches, and scanned for malware. In the final step, it suggested file cleanup, giving me an option to upgrade to use this feature. I declined and moved to the next shortcut, the VPN.\n\nAfter allowing a pop-up approval request from macOS, the free VPN was switched on. It\u2019s capped at 5GB per month, which isn\u2019t enough for daily use, but could be useful for occasional checks or vacation planning.\n\nThe free app shows all the features in the explore tab, but some are locked until I subscribe. Still, plenty are available in Avast One Essential. The system scan checks for malware and includes a VPN, which is capped at 5GB per month.\n\nThe account tab shows my subscription level \u2014 currently none \u2014 and has subsections to set preferences, browse help documents, check the community forums, get support, or uninstall the app. It\u2019s refreshing to see an easy way to uninstall since removing antivirus software is sometimes difficult.\n\nFeatures\n\nAvast for Mac enjoys a near-perfect malware protection record in ongoing evaluations from the independent security research lab AV-Test. In fact, there were only two instances when Avast fell below a perfect six out of six.\n\nIn September 2020, a minor miss dropped AV-Test\u2019s rating to 5.5. The more notable flaw was from six years ago when Avast for Mac failed in 3.7% of the 241 malware tests performed in December 2018.\n\nEvery other quarterly test since December 2017 has been perfect. That\u2019s an impressive protection record that\u2018s almost as good as market leaders Bitdefender and Norton.\n\nWhile I trust AV-Test\u2019s results, I still wanted to spot-check for myself. I visited Wicar\u2019s malware test website to see how good the free web blocker was. Avast One Essential recognized all 13 browser exploits and malware downloads, blocking the danger at every turn.\n\nI tried again with the VPN switched off, and each threat was blocked without using any monthly data to safeguard my browsing. The free app is very good, a generous gift to the often overlooked Mac community.\n\nSwitching the VPN back on, I loaded BrowserLeaks website to check if my IP address was visible. The IP address and location shown were different from mine, so Avast\u2019s free VPN did its job.\n\nWith my Avast One Essential testing complete, I upgraded to Avast One Gold to continue with the subscriber version. That removed all locks on the explore tab, so I used the disk cleaner to free up over 4GB of app caches, trash, and log files.\n\nThere are plenty of extras that help with privacy, protection, and cleaning my Mac. The most important paid features are the uncapped VPN with an option to choose a server in another country to avoid geoblocking and live chat support.\n\nSupport\n\nAs an Avast One Gold subscriber, I requested priority support on the website via live chat. At first, I got a chatbot that misunderstood my question about how Avast One works. A multiple-choice selection let me switch to a live agent who immediately took over. After being speedy at first, the second response was much slower, and I had to repeat what I told the chatbot.\n\nIt was a bit frustrating, as if the agent didn\u2019t understand my question. I asked for another agent but they tried again to answer. After my second request to transfer, I was told to hold.\n\nUnfortunately, no one else was available, so I tried simplifying my question. That worked, and I got the answer I expected \u2014 Avast One protects my browser from malware and also scans my computer. I also asked some VPN questions and received prompt and accurate replies.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, suddenly the answers came quickly and with higher quality. I suspect the misunderstanding was a side effect of trying to help too many customers at once. That\u2019s the nature of live support, and it will always vary.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with Avast\u2019s support via live chat.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nAccording to Avast\u2019s privacy policy, Avast One\u2019s free app might show targeted ads. In my brief test, I didn\u2019t see any, but I quickly switched to a paid plan to complete the review.\n\nThe end-user license agreement allows Avast to send you promotional offers to upgrade to a higher-priced subscription. After three months on Avast\u2019s mailing list, I haven\u2019t noticed many emails, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be concerned about.\n\nHowever, Avast has had some privacy issues in the past. Google removed the Avast browser extension in 2019 for spying on Chrome users.\n\nAfter five years of behaving kindly, Avast has well-rated security extensions in the Chrome Web Store. I think it\u2019s safe to let those worries fade away.\n\nAvast One protects your Mac and MacBook\n\nIf you like the sound of Avast One\u2019s subscription plans but want to save money, check our guide to the best antivirus deals. Sometimes Avast has sales that cut first-year costs even lower. Still, the costs will skyrocket to more than double the first year when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nAvast\u2019s parent company, Gen Digital, also owns Norton Security. Norton 360 for Mac has a better subscription package at lower prices, so that\u2019s a better choice if you\u2019re paying for protection.\n\nAvast One Basic (Essential) is a nice, free antivirus that could provide everything you need. It includes prevention and protection just as powerful as what\u2019s in the paid version. If you want more, our guide to the best antivirus software breaks down features and costs to help you make an informed purchase."
