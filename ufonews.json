FOX 5 New York\n\nManhattan Alien Abduction: 35 years later\n\nOne of the most famous \u2014 or infamous \u2014 alleged close encounters in the city is now the subject of \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction\u201d on Netflix, with Linda Napolitano\u2019s claims the subject of as much attention as they were doubt.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNapolitano, then 41, lived with her husband and two sons in an apartment near the Brooklyn Bridge at the time of the alleged abduction 35 years ago.\n\nThe native New Yorker said that on the night of Nov. 30, 1989 she was lifted out through her apartment wall in a beam of light, soared above the East River into the sky over Manhattan, and into a clam-like alien spaceship that appeared to contain volcanic fire.\n\nNapolitano shared her story with Budd Hopkins, a ufologist who was in the midst of documenting a case study centered around what he believed to be a credible individual.\n\nManhattan resident Linda Napolitano claimed she was abducted by aliens in 1989. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe alleged abductee\u2019s hypnotic regression in the days after the event is shown in the docuseries.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cOh I feel like electricity just went through me,\u201d Napolitano says in one exchange with her eyes closed and Hopkins leaning over her, head in his hand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone in the room,\u201d the allegedly hypnotized Napolitano says in the footage.\n\nNapolitano\u2019s alleged alien encounter was featured in the Netflix documentary series \u201cThe Manhattan Alien Abduction.\u201d Courtesy of Netflix\n\nShe then describes being lifted through her solid door, floated in the air in her nightgown, and drawn into a fiery clam.\n\nInterview footage, both contemporary and from the early 90s, show witness accounts of varying credibility and veracity. Many critics later poked holes in her claims.\n\nThe Mysterious \u2018Near Miss\u2019\n\nA commercial plane had a \u201cnear miss\u201d with a cylindrical object off the coast of New York that has yet to be identified or explained, according to Congressional testimony from Pentagon representatives from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAn airline crew reported to the Federal Aviation Administration that their commercial plane \u2014 from an unnamed airline \u2014 had a \u201cnear miss with a \u2018cylindrical object\u2019 while over the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d\n\nThis undated encounter was just one of more than 20 reports made over the past year that have stumped AARO investigators, with agency director Jon Kosloski describing them as \u201ctrue anomalies.\u201d\n\nKosloski revealed to a congressional oversight committee that the agency received 757 reports of sightings from May 1, 2023 and June 1 of this year.\n\nThe \u201cclose call\u201d off the coast of New York is considered one of 21 anomalous cases that require further investigation, according to the agency.\n\nJohn Lennon\u2019s close encounter\n\n\u201cImagine\u201d that: John Lennon reported seeing a UFO in New York on Aug. 23, 1974.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe famed singer-songwriter said in an interview after the event that he had seen an unique aircraft zooming around the East River from his apartment.\n\n\u201cUp there, I saw a UFO,\u201d Lennon said to an interviewer, pointing to his penthouse apartment that overlooks the water.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd it went down the river, turned right at the United Nations, turned left, and turned down the river.\n\nJohn Lennon claimed to have seen a UFO in New York City in 1974. Photo by Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a helicopter, and it wasn\u2019t a balloon, and it was so near,\u201d Lennon said, animatedly to the interviewer.\n\nLennon described the craft as being \u201csilent\u201d and \u201cdark.\u201d He said it was round, black or gray in the middle, with blinking lights that looked like \u201clight bulbs\u201d circumscribed on the sides, and was completed with a red light on its top.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLennon tried to take photos of the craft \u2014 none of which came out legibly \u2014 and even called the cops, who said they had received other calls about an object flying through the sky, according to The New Daily.\n\nLennon also commemorated the occurrence in the liner notes of his album \u201cWalls and Bridges,\u201d writing, \u201cOn the 23rd Aug. 1974 at 9 o\u2019clock I saw a U.F.O.\u201d\n\nLatest mystery\n\nEarlier this week, a local news station aired video that incidentally showed a mysterious orb appearing to zoom down the Hudson River.\n\nThe blue orb was caught on camera during a helicopter news report. FOX 5 New York\n\nA local report on congestion pricing aired a random four-second clip of the lower Manhattan skyline, the Hudson River and parts of New Jersey.\n\n\n\nIn that clip, a mysterious blue orb can be seen apparently zooming down the Hudson River and past the camera.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAvi Loeb, a theoretical physicist, cosmologist and Harvard professor, believes the apparent orb is a trick of the lights.\n\n\u201cThis is most likely an optical artifact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera, namely a bright spot from the reflection of sunlight as the camera gradually changes its orientation relative to the sun and the ground,\u201d Loeb tells The Post.\n\nOthers believe that it was a physical object merely affected by the speed of the helicopter and the angle of the camera."

            "source": "TechCrunch",
            "article_content": "Anthropic is proposing a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data resides.\n\nCalled the Model Context Protocol, or MCP for short, Anthropic says the standard, which it open sourced today, could help AI models produce better, more relevant responses to queries.\n\nMCP lets models \u2014 any models, not just Anthropic\u2019s \u2014 draw data from sources like business tools and software to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments.\n\n\u201cAs AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post. \u201cYet even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data \u2014 trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale.\u201d\n\nMCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications (e.g., chatbots). Developers can expose data through \u201cMCP servers\u201d and build \u201cMCP clients\u201d \u2014 for instance, apps and workflows \u2014 that connect to those servers on command.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick demo using the Claude desktop app, where we\u2019ve configured MCP:\n\n\n\nWatch Claude connect directly to GitHub, create a new repo, and make a PR through a simple MCP integration.\n\n\n\nOnce MCP was set up in Claude desktop, building this integration took less than an hour. pic.twitter.com/xseX89Z2PD \u2014 Alex Albert (@alexalbert__) November 25, 2024\n\nAnthropic says that companies, including Block and Apollo, have already integrated MCP into their systems, while dev tooling firms, including Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph, are adding MCP support to their platforms.\n\n\u201cInstead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cAs the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and data sets, replacing today\u2019s fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.\u201d\n\nDevelopers can start building with MCP connectors now, and subscribers to Anthropic\u2019s Claude Enterprise plan can connect the company\u2019s Claude chatbot to their internal systems via MCP servers. Anthropic has shared prebuilt MCP servers for enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub, and says that it\u2019ll soon provide toolkits for deploying production MCP servers that can serve entire organizations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cWe invite [developers] to build the future of context-aware AI together.\u201d\n\nMCP sounds like a good idea in theory. But it\u2019s far from clear that it\u2019ll gain much traction, particularly among rivals like OpenAI, which would surely prefer that customers and ecosystem partners use their data-connecting approaches and specifications.\n\nIn fact, OpenAI recently brought a data-connecting feature to ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot platform, that lets ChatGPT read code in dev-focused coding apps \u2014 similar to the use cases MCP drives. OpenAI has said that it plans to bring the capability, called Work with Apps, to other types of apps in the future, but it\u2019s pursuing implementations with close partners rather than open sourcing the underlying tech.\n\nIt also remains to be seen whether MCP is as beneficial and performant as Anthropic claims it to be. The company says, for example, that MCP can enable an AI bot to \u201cbetter retrieve relevant information to further understand the context around a coding task,\u201d but the company offers no benchmarks to back up this assertion."

            "article_content": "\u2018The Activated Man\u2019 Exclusive Clip Features Tony Todd In His Final Lead Role\n\nJust when this year felt like it couldn\u2019t get any worse, we lost genre icon Tony Todd unexpectedly. The Candyman himself shaped the horror genre with each of his iconic performances, and that legacy extends into now, with the upcoming release of Nicholas Gyeney\u2019s supernatural thriller The Activated Man. The film marks Todd\u2019s final lead role, and we have an exclusive clip featuring the icon below.\n\nRead the full synopsis below:\n\nOrs Gabriel is an everyman who loses his beloved dog, Louis. His grief spurs disturbing visions that cause him to wonder if he\u2019s dealing with the usual highs and lows of a painful loss, or if darker forces are preying on his mind.\n\nIn our exclusive clip, Tony Todd discusses the world of mediums and psychics with Gabriel.\n\nWatch now:\n\nTodd stars in the film with fellow genre icons Sean Young (Blade Runner) and four-time Jason Voorhees, Kane Hodder. Jamie Costa, Andrew Keegan (10 Things I Hate About You), Vladimir Kulich (Vikings), Sab Shimono (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III), and Ivana Rojas (Hulu\u2019s This Fool) also star in the film, with Scott Brown appearing as the villainous \u2018Fedora Man.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Activated Man embarked on its festival run almost one year ago,\u201d said Gyeney. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to be able to share our special film with audiences throughout North America this December. Not only will our film appeal to fans of horror and the paranormal, we believe it also will resonate with those dealing with loss and grief through spirituality.\u201d\n\nTo honor the late Tony Todd, the December 12 premiere will serve as both a night to celebrate the release, and to bid farewell to the star. Two special opening-day screenings in Los Angeles on Friday, December 13 will be fan events with Gyeney and Kane Hodder in attendance to meet fans and give out free exclusive The Activated Man t-shirts designed by popular t-shirt brand Rucking Fotten.\n\nAfter its exclusive premiere, The Activated Man will have a limited theatrical run starting December 13, 2024. It also comes to digital and cable on demand on December 13, 2024."

            "article_content": "Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya has reiterated that his team know what they want, hoping that a win against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday night could achieve them straight qualification to the latter stages of the tournament.\n\nThe Spanish international has been one of Arsenal\u2019s standout players in a challenging start to the season, saving his side with game-defining saves in some important games.\n\nRaya took the number one spot from Aaron Ramsdale back in September 2023 and hasn\u2019t looked back, becoming a stalwart under Mikel Arteta. Ramsdale has since made the move over to relegation contenders Southampton, while Norberto Neto and Charlie Setford have been brought in as cover for the former Brentford \u2018keeper.\n\n\"I think it's about adaptation. Everything has a process. I know that at the beginning of last season, there was a lot. There was a lot of controversy outside. Since January of this year, it has changed completely. I became more confident. After the summer I felt I was in the right place. It was clear from the performances I was giving.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old has impressed many with his impeccable shot-stopping abilities, denying forwards with one-handed saves, acrobatic efforts and paranormal movements.\n\nHis denial of Ollie Watkins earlier in the season at Villa Park won the Premier League\u2019s \u2018Save of the Month\u2019 award, preventing the England international from close range.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s something that you work on. Like I said before you adapt to a new set of circumstances and a new environment. With the players, it was a matter of time before I could show what kind of goalie I was.\u201d\n\nHowever, tomorrow night sees Raya paired up against one of Europe\u2019s most in-form forwards at the moment. Former Coventry City danger man Viktor Gy\u00f6keres has gone on a scintillating goalscoring riot, scoring 21 goals in all competitions for Sporting this season.\n\n\u201cWe know he is a world-class player and we know his strengths when playing from the back. We will do everything possible to give him no chances and try to keep the goal clean, which is always a great motivation for any goalkeeper.\u201d\n\nRaya is similarly aware of Sporting\u2019s abilities, even without the Swedish bagsman. The Portuguese outfit are top of their league and despite losing their manager, Ruben Amorim, to Manchester United, Joao Pereira seems to have swiftly handled the quick transition over the international break period.\n\n\"It will be a difficult game and we are aware that they have scored a lot of goals in recent games,\u201d Raya said. \u201cBut we are focused on our football and we will get the three points. We know that there has been a change of coach, with the departure of Ruben Amorim, but we have studied them well.\"\n\nThe Spaniard also provided his verdict on the new Champions League format and his desire to make the final stages of the tournament. Arsenal impressed many last season but fell at the quarter-final stage, losing 1-0 in the second leg to Bayern Munich, courtesy of Joshua Kimmich\u2019s second-half header.\n\n(Photo by Silas Schueller/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI only had one season in the Champions League before. This season is different. Every three points is important in this competition. We know what we want, which is to qualify straight away. The Champions League is the best competition and we\u2019re really happy to be here.\u201d\n\nRaya\u2019s stellar performances have drawn comparisons to some of the best goalkeepers in the world, namely Thibaut Courtois for his spider-like attributes and outstanding reach. The 29-year-old has been amongst the top in the Premier League, winning the Golden Glove last season and achieving three clean sheets in the league so far.\n\n\n\nThe former Brentford man was quick to negate claims that he is one of the best at the moment, suggesting clearly that Real Madrid\u2019s Courtois \u2018is the best goalkeeper in the world right now\u2019."

            "article_content": "Flagstaff\u2019s Lowell Observatory recently opened the long-awaited Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center. Hundreds of visitors flocked to the new exhibits, which aim to connect people to the universe in unexpected ways. You can feel the texture of Saturn\u2019s rings, jam to the music of interstellar space, and even smell moondust.\n\nA brass band ushers in the ribbon cutting ceremony. Three years of construction and $53 million led up to this moment. Despite gray skies and a few flakes of snow, a large crowd is on hand to give a resounding cheer as the doors officially open.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Lowell Observatory's sole trustee, William Lowell Putman, cuts the red ribbon to officially open the doors to the Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nLowell Observatory has been an active research facility for more than a century (it\u2019s famous for the discovery of Pluto in 1930) but executive director Amanda Bosh says bringing in the public is part of their mission, too.\n\n\"It\u2019s not enough to just learn things about the universe,\" Bosh says. \"If you don\u2019t spread that out and tell everybody else about it, then it doesn\u2019t benefit people as much as it could, so that is a big part of who we are and what we do.\"\n\nFor Bosh, it\u2019s about expanding perspectives: \"Connecting to the night sky connects us to who we are, how we came to be humans.\"\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Exhibits in the Stardust gallery at Lowell Observatory's new Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center.\n\nThat theme is clear in the new Stardust gallery\u2019s interactive exhibits. One family creates a hip hop mix out of the sounds of space, while nearby Haley Johnson uses a touchscreen to design a space mission to Saturn\u2019s largest moon Titan, exclaiming in delight when the activity is finished, \"I did it! I completed my research!\"\n\nFor some in the crowd, Lowell has always been a treasured part of the community. Sandra and Saylor Darling are newlyweds who celebrated their engagement here on Mars Hill.\n\n\"It's so beautiful,\" Sandra says of the new discovery center.\n\n\"This is making me so proud,\" Saylor adds. \"We're going to invite all our friends back.\"\n\nThey each sniff a silver tube that offers a whiff of the hydrocarbons found in moondust, and have wildly different reactions: \"It's almost pleasant,\" Sandra says, while Saylor interrupts: \"I think it's horrid.\"\n\nSamantha Christensen of Lowell Observatory led the design of the new exhibits. \"Everyone learns in a different way, so the more senses we can engage, we figure, the better,\" she says.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Kids play in the children's gallery, which has quieter areas with puzzles and games as well as interactive exhibits and a slide.\n\nShe gestures to the new children\u2019s gallery, where joyful chaos reigns as kids make water vapor rings, toss parachutes into wind tunnels, and launch model rockets. One girl dissolves into giggles when her rocket falls to pieces during launch. Christensen says the hands-on activities teach the scientific process: \"It's an opportunity to fail,\" she says, \"but fail in a fun way.\"\n\nTwelve-year-old Metta Kuehn says the rocket launching is one of her favorite activities: \"You pressurize it,\" she explains, \"and then you hit a button and the rocket shoots. It's really loud but really fun.\"\n\nKuehn has big dreams for her future: she wants to be the first person on Mars.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Opening weekend included live theater performances, a one-person show about the importance of imagination in science.\n\nAnd the kids here may be just starting out with a passion for science, but some grownups in the crowd are coming from illustrious careers. Famed comet hunter David Levy says he first saw Lowell in 1967 before it had a visitor center.\n\n\"Coming here today is like being wrapped in a cloud of passion and love for the night sky,\" Levy says. \"I\u2019ve been happy as a clam all day.\"\n\nAs night falls, visitors make their way to the open-air planetarium on the building\u2019s roof. It\u2019s just like any planetarium except the starry skies are real, not a projection.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Visitors enter the Stardust gallery, which has exhibits that engage nearly all the senses, including smell.\n\nLowell\u2019s historian Kevin Schindler says this is his favorite part: \"Seeing people come up here every night, and listening to them ooh and aah\u2014even if there\u2019s no program or anything, just looking up and seeing the night sky, or seeing the Milky Way in the night sky and being stunned by it.\"\n\nSchindler says they\u2019re all making their own discoveries, just as astronomers have done on this spot for more than a century.\n\n\"The need to explore and to look up and wonder, that\u2019s part of us,\" he says.\n\nA gasp rises from the crowd as they learn a bright star overhead is the planet Saturn. It\u2019s what every scientist and educator at Lowell was waiting for: that moment of awe."

            "article_content": "article\n\nAsteroid 2006 WB will zoom by Earth on Tuesday, and astronomers say it\u2019s one of nearly 40,000 near-Earth objects (NEO), which is not even the most exciting.\n\nLowell Observatory astronomer and asteroid expert Nick Moskovitz said we know little about this asteroid coming by so close to Thanksgiving . This is because new NEOs are frequently discovered as technology has improved, not because the threat to Earth is growing.\n\n\"The frequency of these things is it's gotten to the point where I just can't keep up. And it's a testament to really the capabilities of telescopic surveys that are out there scanning the night sky every night looking for new objects, and they're getting really good at that,\" he said.\n\nEARTH\u2019S QUASI-MOON ASTEROID KAMO'OALEWA LIKELY BLASTED OUT OF THIS GIANT MOON CRATER\n\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s Near Earth Object Coordination Centre recently highlighted notable NEOs making astronomically close passes of Earth this fall , including 2006 WB.\n\nThere are nearly 40,000 NEOs, and more than 2,300 were discovered in 2024 alone.\n\nImage 1 of 3 \u25bc The Lowell Observatory's Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center in Flagstaff, Arizona. (Abe Snider // Lowell Observatory)\n\n2006 WB is estimated to have a diameter of about 100 meters (380 feet) and is expected to reach as close as a little more than twice the distance from Earth to the Moon on Nov. 26. Another asteroid, 2010 WS, zoomed by closer to Earth last week, and their size estimates overlap.\n\n\"The uncertainty associated with the size of these objects, neither one of these objects is well studied. We don't know much about them. We have large error bars associated with their actual size,\" Moskovitz said.\n\nAsteroid 2006 WM is considered a stadium-sized object, but even that is an estimate. According to NASA's NEO database, it could be larger, over 500 feet, or smaller.\n\nLarge NEOs pass by Earth all the time, which sounds like bad news, but it\u2019s fine. No, really, it is.\n\n\"A lot of these close encounters are not known until they're actually happening, right? That's because the objects are discovered when they're easiest to see, and they're easiest to see when they're closest to us,\" he said.\n\nAs technology has improved, so has finding and tracking NEOs entering Earth\u2019s neighborhood. The ESA said October was a banner month for NEO discoveries, with more than 450 new objects identified, the most for any month this year.\n\nRecently, small asteroids have been discovered just hours before impacting Earth. This is especially exciting because as these asteroids break up over Earth, scientists are tracking them down to the ground. Moskovitz said this is kind of nature's version of a sample return mission.\n\nASTEROID BREAKS UP OVER PHILIPPINES HOURS AFTER DETECTION SERVING AS REMINDER OF BIGGER THREATS TO EARTH\n\n\"You don't need to send $1 billion spacecraft to go get samples off the surface and bring it home . But instead, if you're watching and have the right tool set up to observe these events, you can see these impacts happening with some frequency,\" he said.\n\nAnother sigh of relief for Earthlings is that close-approach tracking will only improve as technology does.\n\n\"We're really in this sort of interesting sort of sea change in astronomy where our ability to collect data is outstripping our ability to analyze it,\" Moskovitz said. \"We can collect more gigabytes of data than we know what to do with.\"\n\nMoskovitz said asteroid discovery could have an additional lead time when the Vera Rubin Observatory \u2019s 8-meter telescope in Chile comes online. The U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science-funded observatory is expected to begin operations next year.\n\nLowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona , is also working to peel back the study of astronomy to the public.\n\nThe observatory's Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center opened in November. It is a first-of-its-kind art and science center open to all ages.\n\n\"The really special thing that we bring to it is that we are an active research institute where there are a dozen astronomers doing research right now, and we're trying to convey that to the public that comes into the door to share with them what the state of the art in astronomy is,\" Moskovitz said.\n\nGet the latest updates on this story at FOXWeather.com\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "A recent customer survey by Rockwell Automation shows that improving product quality is considered to be the top accelerant for manufacturing\u2019s digital transition. In addition, survey respondents said the number one area of impact for artificial intelligence (AI) is in closed-loop quality control.\n\nAt Automation Fair 2024, Amanda Thompson, Rockwell Automation product manager for FactoryTalk Analytics VisionAI, held a session highlighting the newest edition of VisionAI that was released in September 2024. This new release of VisionAI addresses the quality and AI capabilities ranked so highly by Rockwell Automation\u2019s customers.\n\nThompson explained that, while VisionAI does leverage machine vision technology, it\u2019s more than a machine vision system. \u201cThis is a quality inspection platform designed to help you understand the quality of the product you're producing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt not only tells you if a part or product is good or bad, it also tells you why.\u201d\n\nShe added that the system can support vision inspection at line speeds up to 500-600 parts per minute, depending on the application, to read barcodes, classify parts for identification and sorting, detect defects on surfaces, perform presence/absence detection and read/verify text.\n\nBeyond inspection, VisionAI also provides traceability so that users can see the images highlighted by the system as defective to drive comparisons with acceptable images and provide proof of specific defects. \u201cVisionAI features root cause analysis capabilities that will tell you why an item failed, and it provides notifications so that detected issues can be addressed immediately,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nIn keeping with Rockwell Automation\u2019s direction of developing AI-powered technologies that depend on end user domain expertise to refine them, Thompson pointed out that VisionAI is a no-code platform designed for operations and quality control personnel and \u201crelies on your expertise to provide the information needed for the system to make good quality decisions.\u201d\n\nVisionAI architecture and operation\n\nThe architecture of VisionAI stretches from the cloud to the edge, incorporating embedded analytics, data storage, and application programming interfaces for integrations with manufacturing execution and enterprise resource planning systems. The cloud hosts the AI engine and remote access features for monitoring, management, and deployment of VisionAI's edge functionalities. At the edge are local hardware such as edge computers, human machine interfaces, PLC integration and the vision system cameras, lenses and lighting.\n\nThompson noted that VisionAI currently works with Basler cameras but support for more third-party vision systems will be announced in 2025.\n\nExplaining how VisionAI works, Thompson said the first step is for the user to \u201cdefine the type of inspection they want VisionAI to run. Then they can start capturing images and labeling them as good or bad. The number of images needed to train the system will depend on the type of inspection.\u201d\n\nShe added that VisionAI provides a chart for image training that shows the user when enough images have been supplied to successfully train the model. A training report generated by VisionAI shows the model accuracy as it\u2019s developed to indicate if you\u2019ve labeled images incorrectly and allows users to correct them to improve accuracy before deployment.\n\nOnce the cloud-based model has been trained, it\u2019s then deployed to the edge where up to eight cameras can be supported on one system, with live camera feed capabilities available on site and via remote access.\n\n\u201cThe defect carousel feature shows failed images, which lets users double-click on the images to learn more about the failure reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cVisionAI also aggregates data across systems and time periods so that the system\u2019s dashboard supports comparison of batches, stations, production days and other factors to support specific troubleshooting needs.\u201d\n\nQuality reports are generated directly by VisionAI so that every stakeholder receives the same report.\n\nThompson added that VisionAI\u2019s remote access also lets users label images so that they can train and deploy models even if they are not on site. \u201cPlus, version control allows users to see when models were changed so that if a new model doesn\u2019t perform as expected, you can revert back to a previously deployed model,\u201d she said.\n\nIndustry applications\n\nThompson noted several different industry applications suitable for VisionAI, including:\n\nPackaging. VisionAI can do numerous packaging inspections, such as checking a bottle for defects, checking the expiration date and time stamps on labels, and assessing a cap to see if it\u2019s twisted correctly or leaking. Thompson pointed out that all of these inspections can be done at the same time with VisionAI to provide one quality result for the product. She added that VisionAI works on a recipe concept. \u201cIf you are running different shampoo brands on a line and you want to run a slightly different set of inspections, you can create an inspection recipe per product or SKU,\u201d she said.\n\nFood and Beverage. VisionAI can identify issues even on complex backgrounds. For example, it can be used to inspect cereal as it passes on a conveyor to verify correct shape and color and to flag imperfections or foreign objects. It can also assess the placement of toppings on a product to identify issues like gaps in topping placement on bagels or doughnuts.\n\nAutomotive. Applications here can include presence/absence of required labels, verification of correct label placement, identification of wrinkles/bunching on car seat covers and note the specific area on the seat where these wrinkles are located for ease of physical assessment."
