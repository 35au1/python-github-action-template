            "article_content": "He has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansjurgen Kohler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (Cenap), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says Kohler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office Cenap.\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" Kohler says.\n\nAccording to its director, Cenap has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, Kohler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines). Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa\n\nConspiracy theorists\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, Kohler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

Could this be true or is it a new type of plane? Or something else?\" It showcased a black and spherical UFO-like spaceship with people in white hazmat suits surrounding it.\n\nVideo: Did a spaceship land in Kuwait?\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062b\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0631\u0643\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u0636\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u064a\u062a.\n\n\u0645\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u064a \u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d \u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u0627\u0626\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0639 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u061f \u0627\u0648 \u0627\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0626 \u0622\u062e\u0631\u061f pic.twitter.com/Md03VhaBVU \u2014 Joseph Chedid (@Josephbchedid) January 2, 2025\n\nAccording to several users on X, the video appears to have been made using AI (artificial intelligence) and had nothing to do with Kuwait, but instead, it was first released on Dec. 31, 2024, claiming that the spaceship was found in the US, specifically Arizona.\n\nThe video posted on December 31 was titled, \"UFO crash in Arizona.\" One social media user replied, \"This is AI. The reflections are wrong, and the size of the craft changes sizes.\"\n\nAI is only becoming better when it comes to generating images, to the point that in some cases a non-trained eye could easily fall for its authenticity, leading to false news and other legal issues, like the spaceship video in question.\n\nJust recently, a picture of a Temu warehouse in China catching fire went viral across social media only to find out that it was created using X's Grok AI tool. Fact-checking website Snopes launched an investigation into the matter due to the Temu logo looking inauthentic compared to its official lettering and icons."

In his article \u201cThings we learned about LLMs in 2024,\u201d he simultaneously susses out how much happened in 2024 and why it\u2019s confusing. For example, we\u2019re all told to aggressively use genAI or risk falling behind, but we\u2019re awash in AI-generated \u201cslop\u201d that no one really wants to read. He also points out that LLMs, although marketed as the easy path to AI riches for all who master them, are actually \u201cchainsaws disguised as kitchen knives.\u201d He explains that \u201cthey look deceptively simple to use \u2026 but in reality you need a huge depth of both understanding and experience to make the most of them and avoid their many pitfalls.\u201d\n\nIf anything, this quagmire got worse in 2024. Incredibly smart people are building incredibly sophisticated systems that leave most developers incredibly frustrated by how to use them effectively. \u201cThe default LLM chat UI is like taking brand-new computer users,\u201d Willison argues, \u201cdropping them into a Linux terminal and expecting them to figure it all out.\u201d It\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s getting worse, not better.\n\nSmall wonder that the biggest AI flops of 2024, as captured by MIT Technology Review, largely relate to our collective inability to turn AI into applications that normal people want to use. Even basic things, like Apple\u2019s attempt to summarize my incoming text messages, are more confusing than useful. Some of this stems from the inability to trust AI to deliver consistent results, but much of it derives from the fact that we keep loading developers up with AI primitives (similar to cloud primitives like storage, networking, and compute) that force them to do the heavy lifting of turning those foundational building blocks into applications."

            "article_content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) is diving further into the PC industry, debuting its new Snapdragon X chip for mid-range laptops and desktops. The chip, which the company says will be available in PCs beginning this month, is the fourth in Qualcomm\u2019s line of Snapdragon X processors behind its Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus, and high-powered Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nThe company says its Arm-based Snapdragon X, which is built using a 4-nanometer process, packs eight CPU cores and offers 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second). TOPS is a general way to measure AI workload performance. Thanks to that, the Snapdragon X falls under Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Copilot+PC umbrella of AI PCs, which means it\u2019s capable of running Microsoft\u2019s onboard AI apps including Recall and Click to Do.\n\nAI PCs are a category of PCs that can natively run certain AI applications without having to rely on cloud processing. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t use cloud computing at times, but rather that they can handle AI apps that would take non-AI PCs far longer, such as photo editing or text summarization.\n\nQualcomm is lining up the Snapdragon X against Intel\u2019s (INTC) Core 5 120U processor, which is also used to power mid-range PCs. Overall, the company says its Snapdragon X offers better performance per watt than the competing Intel chip and is better suited for AI tasks.\n\nBut on-device AI isn\u2019t something most customers need at the moment. Especially since apps like ChatGPT need to connect to the web to provide answers to users\u2019 queries. In fact, it\u2019s the Snapdragon X\u2019s battery life that will likely draw users\u2019 attention.\n\nAccording to Qualcomm, a Snapdragon X-equipped test PC lasted 106% longer while streaming Netflix than an Intel Core 5-powered notebook. Battery life has been a persistent problem for Intel-based systems for years.\n\nIn fact, Apple (AAPL) significantly boosted the battery life of its MacBook laptops after ditching Intel as its primary chip partner and switching to its own homegrown Arm-based (ARM) processors.\n\nIntel isn\u2019t sitting idly by though. The company has already debuted its second-generation Core Ultra chips, which it says can compete with Qualcomm\u2019s offerings.\n\nQualcomm has debuted its new Snapdragon X chip for laptops and mini-desktop PCs, challenging market leader Intel. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nQualcomm also announced it is bringing its Snapdragon chips to desktop PCs. Don\u2019t expect them to start cropping up in giant, glowing gaming PCs though. Instead, Qualcomm says its processors will be available in super-compact desktops, otherwise known as mini-PCs.\n\nThe company's decision to expand deeper into the laptop and desktop business is part of its broader strategy to move beyond the slowing smartphone industry, which is its primary breadwinner.\n\nQualcomm's move also stands as a stark threat to Intel. While the company still maintains 76.1% market share, according to Mercury Research data published by Tom\u2019s Hardware, AMD (AMD) has been gaining on its longtime rival. Add in Qualcomm and its promise of better battery life and AI capabilities, and you\u2019ve got a potentially dangerous situation for Intel.\n\nMore troubling is the fact that Intel\u2019s Client Computing Group (CCG), the segment that includes sales of chips for consumers and enterprise users, is its biggest breadwinner. In Q3, CCG pulled in $7.3 billion of the company\u2019s $13.3 billion in total revenue. Intel\u2019s Data Center and AI and Network and Edge segments brought in $3.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\n\nSuffice it to say, any competitors cutting into Intel\u2019s most important business segment pose a risk to its moneymaker, something the company can\u2019t afford as it continues to navigate a difficult turnaround that\u2019s cost former CEO Pat Gelsinger his job.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

            "article_content": "Ranking All 10 Entries of the 50th MMFF\n\nCEBU, Philippines \u2014 The ten entries of the 50th Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) remind moviegoers that cinema is not just about entertainment, it\u2019s about telling stories that reflect the pressing issues of our times -- a fitting takeaway from the festival\u2019s golden anniversary.\n\nFrom the struggles of a soldier grappling with PTSD, an OFW discovering her family\u2019s misuse of her hard-earned remittances, and the tensions between two families over their patriarch, to the bold reimagination of a Philippines untouched by colonization, these films serve as cultural time capsules that capture the essence of what the Philippines was thinking in 2024.\n\nWhile all these entries have cinematic value and strong relevance, some stand out more than others based on the execution of their concepts. Here\u2019s our ranking of all ten MMFF films from least to best:\n\n10. Topakk\n\nPTSD is a central theme in \u201cTopakk\u201d, as Arjo Atayde\u2019s character, a former soldier confronting his trauma, helps Julia Montes flee a brutal drug cartel. Unfortunately, the thinly written script squanders the potential to make its characters engaging on the big screen.\n\nThe ensemble cast, led by Atayde, Montes, and Sid Lucero, shows clear dedication to their meticulously executed action choreography. However, this effort is undermined by distant camerawork that fails to engage with the intensity of the gritty action.\n\nWhile \u201cTopakk\u201d is a welcome revival of the Philippine action genre, its lack of engaging characters and questionably shot action scenes leaves it as a missed opportunity of what could\u2019ve been a compelling story of mental health in an action backdrop. Two stars out of five.\n\n9. Hold Me Close\n\nProcessing trauma and learning that avoiding pain does more harm than good is what makes the chemistry between Julia Barretto and Carlo Aquino shine in \u201cHold Me Close\u201d, an odd yet intriguing tale of larger-than-life Filipinos in Japan.\n\nThe unusual plot, which has Barretto\u2019s character Lynlyn able to feel if someone can bring them joy or harm by touch, may alienate some viewers, and a lack of precise explanation of why the leads are in Japan leaves questions unanswered.\n\nBut the film\u2019s thoughtful exploration of its themes makes it worth the watch for patient viewers who want something lighthearted. Three stars out of five.\n\n8. Espantaho\n\nTwo feuding families, bound by the legacy of a late patriarch with a looming supernatural entity on the loose, form the core of \u201cEspantaho\u201d, which would have fared better as a family drama with paranormal elements rather than a straight-up horror.\n\nWhile the scares fall flat, the compelling performances of Judy Ann Santos, Lorna Tolentino, and Chanda Romero stand out, as do the themes of family conflict and land disputes, making this a quintessential MMFF entry. Just don\u2019t expect to be spooked as its jump scares barely make an impact. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n7. My Future You\n\n\u201cMy Future You\u201d surprises with its substance, weaving real-life tragedies like a 1990s boat-sinking accident and Typhoon Ondoy into its narrative. These events shape the characters played by Francine Diaz and Seth Fedelin, who portray star-crossed lovers separated by a 15-year time gap as they learn that these events happen for a reason.\n\nThe infectious chemistry of FranSeth makes this a strong film debut for the love team, enhancing the story's charm and quirks. However, the significant age gap between the characters risks venturing into uncomfortable territory. Despite this, the film\u2019s heartfelt moments make it an endearing watch. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n6. Strange Frequencies: Taiwan Killer Hospital\n\nThe found footage genre may feel oversaturated, but \u201cStrange Frequencies: Taiwan Killier Hospital\u201d revitalizes its appeal, in ways that \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d once showcased by delivering a genuinely chilling experience.\n\nWith realistic performances from Jane De Leon, Alexa Miro, and Enrique Gil, the film is elevated by its timely critique of the dangers of \u201cclout-chasing\u201d for social media engagement. This underrated MMFF gem effectively combines horror with sharp social commentary, leaving viewers on edge in Black Mirror-like fashion. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n5. Isang Himala\n\n\u201cIsang Himala\u201d could have benefited from a tighter pace in its second act, but its character-driven journey of a regular woman-turned-messianic figure in a poor town captivates with operatic musical numbers that expose the emotional truths of each character.\n\nFeaturing live-recorded performances by an ensemble cast led by Aicelle Santos, the film modernizes the timeless 1982 classic starring Nora Aunor that powerfully reminds viewers that miracles come from within us, and that blind faith and cult-like deviation have consequences. Three and a half stars out of five.\n\n4. Uninvited\n\nDrawing inspiration from a 1990s rape-torture-murder case of two college students where a former mayor was found guilty as the mastermind, \u201cUninvited\u201d offers a scathing critique of the unchecked power of the elite and their crimes.\n\nOut of the star-studded cast, which doubles down the film\u2019s opulent appeal, three performances shine the brightest: Aga Muhlach delivers a chilling turn as the evil billionaire Gilly; Vilma Santos offers a humanistic portrayal of Eva, a grieving mother consumed by revenge; and Gabby Padilla adds emotional depth as her late daughter, whose tragic fate anchors the narrative.\n\nWhile the film could\u2019ve developed its concept further, \u201cUninvited\u201d still delivers a satisfying revenge narrative of a mother taking justice into her own hands Four stars out of five.\n\n3. The Kingdom\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom\u201d delivers on its ambitious premise, imagining an alternate Philippines called Kalayaan which was never colonized.\n\nVic Sotto stars as the nation\u2019s monarch, Lakan Makisig, alongside his children Dayang Matimyas (Christine Reyes), Dayang Lualhati (Sue Ramirez), and Magat Bagwis (Sid Lucero) \u2014 all vying as potential heirs to the throne.\n\nFar from a utopia, Kalayaan mirrors the real-life Philippines\u2019 struggles with poverty and corruption. These societal issues are explored through the lens of Piolo Pascual\u2019s character, Sulo, whose perspective challenges Lualhati to broaden her worldview.\n\nWith detailed world-building and insightful execution of its political landscape, \u201cThe Kingdom\u201d captivates as an epic that has the potential to expand as a franchise. Four stars out of five.\n\n2. And the Breadwinner Is\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd the Breadwinner Is\u2026\u201d is Vice Ganda\u2019s most grounded and mature work to date. While it retains the comedian\u2019s signature comedic flair from past films, it also leans heavily into heartfelt drama reminiscent of 2016\u2019s \u201cDie Beautiful\u201d, also helmed by Jun Lana.\n\nVice portrays Bambi with empathy and care, creating a character that resonates as a breadwinner often taken for granted by family. The script skillfully portrays the family\u2019s flaws without fully demonizing them, presenting a realistic dynamic of a Filipino family.\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to see Vice's acting range which is amplified by Lana\u2019s character-driven direction. Most characters feel authentic, and their situations are relatable, reflecting challenges many viewers might face in real life.\n\n\u201cBreadwinner\u201d shows potential for future collaborations between Vice and Lana, echoing Vice\u2019s earlier projects with the late Wenn V. Deramas. Four stars out of five.\n\n1. Green Bones\n\n\u201cGreen Bones\u201d challenges viewers to move beyond preconceived notions and see the humanity in others through its poignant story of a prisoner and a guard.\n\nDennis Trillo and Ruru Madrid deliver award-winning performances as Domingo and Xavier respectively, bringing depth and emotional nuance to their roles that enriches the narrative.\n\nThis film feels particularly relevant in today\u2019s social climate, where people are often quick to judge without considering the backstories that shape who they are today.\n\nUnder Zig Dulay\u2019s empathetic direction and with a heartfelt script by Ricky Lee and Anj Antienza, \u201cGreen Bones\u201d deservedly won Best Picture at the MMFF Gabi ng Parangal. It may well set a standard for future Filipino dramas on how to capture audiences with a compelling, meaningful story. Four stars out of five. \u2014 (FREEMAN)"

            "article_content": "It has come to my attention that world leaders like JD Vance and Steve Bannon are avid and enthusiastic readers of a computer engineer named Curtis Yarvin. He has written mostly about politics but also about technology and current affairs.\n\nWhat might be most alarming to some that our future vice president is taking Yarvin\u2019s work as an influence, is that his writings are largely composed of anti-democratic and pro-authoritarian themes, along with some inclusion of racism (he claimed that some races are more suited for slavery; I invite you to guess what race he thinks that is).\n\nYou see, Yarvin is one of the founders of something called the \u201cDark Enlightenment\u201d movement, which \u201cargues\u201d against democracy and against egalitarianism \u2013 a school of thought that people have equal intrinsic value and are deserving of equal rights.\n\nThe reason I placed \u201cargues\u201d in quotes is because Yarvin\u2019s writings do not fall under the category of rigorous political philosophy. They are often written in a style that is purposefully and pretentiously difficult to understand that makes it nearly impossible to extract comprehensible arguments.\n\nInstead of concrete arguments, Yarvin\u2019s writings are mostly composed of unsubstantiated claims and obscure references that he doesn\u2019t explain to make it perfectly clear to his audience how well-read he is.\n\nDespite fashioning himself as a political theorist, he is far from a competent one. Here\u2019s a small sample where he is explaining that his \u201cdeep-right\u201d movement must involve authoritarianism:\n\n\u201cThe deep right knows that all government is absolute. Because of this, the deep right is only interested in paths to absolute power.\u201d\n\nWhy would all governments be absolute? If his primary reason for thinking that his deep-right movement should seek to bring about an authoritarian regime rests on this dubious assumption, then it\u2019s already completely undermotivated. He doesn\u2019t explain why a government like ours isn\u2019t a straightforward counterexample.\n\n\u201cIt treats all other paths as traps, since they are by definition dead ends.\u201d\n\nWhat definition? Why must they be dead ends? He doesn\u2019t explain or argue for any of this.\n\n\u201cThe more attractive the first steps into a trap, the deadlier the trap in the end\u2014and political traps can last decades.\u201d\n\nWhy would we believe that the attractiveness of the steps into a trap correlates with the deadliness of the trap? Again, there are no arguments to be found. This small passage is highly representative of Yarvin\u2019s writings in general: a lot of bold, eye-catching claims, and very few reasons provided to actually believe them. In most cases, philosophy of this kind is better categorized as bad poetry, not as a means to systematically examine theories and concepts or a means to form rational beliefs about them.\n\nThis is precisely where people like JD Vance and Steve Bannon have gone wrong. They have confused bad poetry that mentions the Dark Enlightenment, for reasons to believe in the goals of the Dark Enlightenment.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cIdealism is not Great\u201d, he attempts to \u201cargue\u201d that Idealism, and not religion, is to blame for the violence and destruction that has gone along with religious systems. The entire thing relies on him merely presupposing that this is the case, and a fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication of the concept of platonic universals (Idealism): a philosophical theory that identifies properties like \u201credness\u201d as abstract entities whose nature can be instantiated by concrete objects like apples.\n\n\u201cAn Idealist is a person who believes that universals exist independently. Specifically, in the modern sense, your Idealist believes in concepts such as Democracy, the Environment, Peace, Freedom, Human Rights, Equality, Justice, etc., etc. What do these concepts have in common?[\u2026]they are impossible to define precisely. It\u2019s fairly clear that they have no meaning at all. For example, John Rawls wrote a whole book called A Theory Of Justice which purports to be a rigorous rational derivation of the New Deal regime.\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect demonstration of his being well read enough to mention the concepts of academic disciplines but not educated enough to use them correctly. Subscribing to the theory of platonic realism has no bearing at all on political leanings or really, anything of practical concern at all.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with Rawls. Rawls\u2019 work does not deal at all with the general nature of properties. Instead, he attempts to explore the nature of Justice. Contrary to what Yarvin claims, he does indeed define it and it does not depend at all on Rawls being a Platonic Realist.\n\n\u201cA little while ago I explained that religion, if we define it as a system of belief involving anthropomorphic paranormal entities, cannot directly affect reality.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Opinion Columnists | Gavin Newsom is gaslighting Californians about homelessness and gas prices\n\nGavin Newsom is gaslighting Californians about homelessness and gas prices Opinion Columnists | Gavin Newsom is Democrats\u2019 potential 2028 frontrunner, but can he win?\n\nGavin Newsom is Democrats\u2019 potential 2028 frontrunner, but can he win?

Let\u2019s be as charitable as possible and say that he thinks that by defining religion as such, it becomes a platonic form, which itself could not have causal efficacy in the world. Why does this need to be expressed? A system of belief can certainly affect reality. My parent\u2019s adherence to the system of belief that tells them that God wants them to attend mass, directly causes them to attend mass.\n\nThis is nonsensical junk food for pseudointellectuals. If we were to someday depart from democracy, these idiotic ramblings should play no part in it at all. And yet, it is reportedly informing people in our highest offices.\n\nThere is a reason peer-review exists and it\u2019s not to stop the radical ideas of \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d that go against the system \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanism that filters out unrigorous nonsense like this so that we don\u2019t have to waste time on it. There are plenty of academics who have published legitimate attacks on the merits of democracy and egalitarianism. It\u2019s a good thing that JD Vance and Steve Bannon want to read about political philosophy, but why look to a computer scientist for answers?\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.

            "article_content": "Stephen King\u2019s favourite horror character from his books\n\nTo hit a debut novel out of the park like Stephen King did with Carrie in 1974 is to instantly establish yourself as one of the premier writers of the day. However, perhaps more impressive than simply getting a good book out to the public is that it was a uniquely poised piece of horror fiction.\n\nThe celebrated genre may be one of the most ardently mythologised, with fandoms strong enough to make Taylor Swift blush, but it isn\u2019t always the most marketable to a widespread audience. Stephen King changed all that, and his books became some of the most successful novels ever written. And, as cinema exploded into a new phase in the latter parts of the 20th century, King\u2019s books would be routinely leant on for inspiration.\n\nFew authors can boast as many movie adaptations as King\u2019s 65. The writer has given the cinematic world classics like The Shining and The Shawshank Redemption as well as It and Stand By Me, a range of stories that not only celebrate the unique talent of King but the widespread range of characters within them. The narrative may be what attract most filmmakers to his work, but it is the characters within them that make those movies unforgettable.\n\nWhen asked to pick out his favourite character from his oeuvre, King was quick to land on his favourite. Naturally, it came from one of his scarier books, but still, that\u2019s about the only thing one might have predicted. Many would have thought The Shining protagonist Jack Torrance would be number one, especially considering his issues with Stanley Kubrick over his portrayal. You might also be persuaded into thinking that Pennywise, the demon clown from It might be the writer\u2019s favourite.\n\nHowever, the character King called his favourite to write during a keynote speech at George Washington University was Annie Wilkes from Misery. The picture was directed by Rob Reiner, who had previously directed King\u2019s novella The Body into the definitive coming-of-age classic Stand By Me four years earlier, with stars James Caan and Kathy Bates playing a writer and one of his obsessed fans, respectively.\n\nBates steals the show as Annie Wilkes, the maniacal fan in question who not only engineers the near-fatal crash that leaves Caan in her carer but then proceeds to begin the battle of wits to try and keep him in her home. The movie and the book operate as a brutal reflection on fan culture, which may well have been drawn from King\u2019s heightened experiences of a new life under the spotlight as more and more of his books became global hits and cinematic spectacles.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Wilkes would become his favourite character. Not only is King\u2019s character an irredeemable villain, but she is able to deliver this terror through a less than usual presence. Previously, King\u2019s monsters would be either animalistic, paranormal or twisted men. Here, with a woman as the lead character, he was able to change the narrative entirely.\n\nThe movie would not only become a commercial success but also achieve the only Oscar that has been given for a Stephen King adaptation as Bates picked up \u2018Best Actress\u2019 in 1991, giving Wilkes a slightly more questionably vulnerable spin. While King would likely resist picking favourites too often, for the most part, it is easy to see how Wilkes may win out every time he is asked."

            "article_content": "When Jin Yi (Jeanie) Tan told the school children she was supervising for a science outreach programme \u2018you can collect anything you want\u2019, she didn\u2019t expect one to bring in goose droppings. She also wasn\u2019t expecting the programme to lead them to a new cytotoxic peptide.\n\nTan, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Brian Murphy\u2019s lab from the University of Illinois Chicago, US, leads a team of researchers in an outreach collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, one of the city\u2019s oldest youth development organisations. With 21 locations, and 20,000 young members, the clubs provide resources and support to aid members\u2019 personal and professional development. So far the team has worked with two local branches: the Bartlett J McCartin club and the James R Jordan club, the latter of which is named after Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan\u2019s late father.\n\nThe 14-week after-school programme, termed the Chicago antibiotic discovery lab, offers middle school students (aged 11\u201313 ) from underrepresented communities, a hands-on learning experience searching for potential antibiotics in their own neighbourhoods . Funded by the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant that Tan received for her PhD, the programme teaches the fundamentals of microbiology research, from sample collection to laboratory analysis. Students are also introduced to environmental issues, engineering, robotics and related careers. \u2018We\u2019ve done four different cohorts of this programme, constantly tweaking stuff to make things better,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018One of our strengths is that the programme is very small, allowing us to give one-to-one mentoring and tailor the work to the students\u2019 interests.\u2019\n\nSemi-automated\n\nTan\u2019s PhD project focusses on finding new antibiotics to combat multi-drug resistance by harnessing antimicrobial toxins secreted by other bacteria. She has developed a pipeline for screening bioactive compounds from the natural environment, \u2018integrating things like robotics, bioassays and bioinformatics to create a streamlined workflow\u2019, she explains. This approach simplifies the initial stages of microbial drug discovery by allowing steps to be carried out in a semi-automated manner, making it safe and accessible enough to be taught to middle school students. \u2018The researchers were very good at mentoring the students \u2026 [the students] were constantly supervised and because of the robotics, had no interaction with hazardous bacteria,\u2019 adds Jonathon Rodriguez, the technology program manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.\n\nThe mentor team encourages students to carry out each stage of the process autonomously \u2013 instilling a sense of ownership over their results. While some students collect samples from lake water or flowers, others get more creative, swabbing everything from air conditioning filters to playground slides. \u2018The kids are always collecting the weirdest stuff t hey can find,\u2019 says Tan.\n\nStudents then program a robot to isolate the bacterial colonies grown from their samples and test the ability of each one to prevent the growth of multi-drug resistant bacteria. \u2018At first when they look at the environmental bacteria plates, they are really grossed out,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018But after five minutes, they\u2019ll be looking really closely? Like \u201cwait, what\u2019s this one? Why is this one pink?\u201d It\u2019s exciting for them to be able to understand microbiology and that they can produce medicines.\u2019\n\nTan successfully isolated a new anti-bacterial compound from Pseudomonas idahonensis, a bacterium cultured from the goose dropping sample. It turned out to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that they named orfamide N . Using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis she elucidated the structure of the new bioactive molecule. It comprises 10 mixed D- and L-amino acids and a distinct lipid tail, which sets it apart from other known orfamides and is thought to contribute to its biological activity. While the peptide demonstrated minimal antibacterial activity, it showed cytotoxicity in bioassays against human cancer cell lines, warranting further investigation in its application for cancer therapy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really happy and grateful that I was able to merge two big interests of mine and showed that this can happen. Biomedical research and Stem outreach can lead to a publication ,\u2019 says Tan. The research, published in the journal ACS Omega, lists the the student who collected the goose dropping sample as a co-author, underscoring their integral role in this discovery. \u2018The student was really excited about it,\u2019 adds Rodriguez.\n\nAs the project continues into its third year, the team hopes its approach can serve as a model for university\u2013community partnerships elsewhere. \u2018There is often a disconnect between a university and the neighbouring communities it should serve,\u2019 says Murphy. \u2018Both teams are learning about one another and building trust, and that barrier that typically exists between university and community is being systematically broken down.\u2019"

            "article_content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Sunday said that the company is currently losing money on its $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan because people are using it more than the company expected.\n\n\u201cI personally chose the price,\u201d Altman wrote in a series of posts on X, \u201cand thought we would make some money.\u201d\n\nChatGPT Pro, launched late last year, grants access to an upgraded version of OpenAI\u2019s o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model, o1 pro mode, and lifts rate limits on several of the company\u2019s other tools, including its Sora video generator.\n\nChatGPT Pro\u2019s price point wasn\u2019t a slam dunk at launch. It\u2019s $2,400 per year, and the value proposition of o1 pro mode in particular remains murky. But judging by Altman\u2019s posts, it seems that users who have bitten the bullet are making the most of it \u2014 at OpenAI\u2019s expense.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time OpenAI has priced a product somewhat arbitrarily. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Altman said that the original premium plan for OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, didn\u2019t have a pricing study.\n\n\u201cI believe we tested two prices, $20 and $42,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cPeople thought $42 was a little too much. They were happy to pay $20. We picked $20. Probably it was late December of 2022 or early January. It was not a rigorous \u2018hire someone and do a pricing study\u2019 thing.\u201d\n\nOpenAI isn\u2019t profitable, despite having raised around $20 billion since its founding. The company reportedly expected losses of about $5 billion on revenue of $3.7 billion last year.\n\nExpenditures like staffing, office rent, and AI training infrastructure are to blame. ChatGPT was at one point costing OpenAI an estimated $700,000 per day.\n\nRecently, OpenAI admitted it needs \u201cmore capital than it imagined\u201d as it prepares to undergo a corporate restructuring to attract new investments. To reach profitability, OpenAI is said to be considering increasing the price of its various subscription tiers. Altman also hinted in the Bloomberg interview that OpenAI may explore usage-based pricing for certain services.\n\nOpenAI optimistically projects that its revenue will reach $11.6 billion this year and $100 billion in 2029, matching the current annual sales of Nestl\u00e9."

Altman said the post was inspired by a recent interview he gave to Bloomberg, which was published on Sunday as well.\n\n\"Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and beyond the call of duty that I'm not even sure how to describe it,\" Altman wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAltman was fired as OpenAI's CEO on November 17, 2023. The company's board said in a statement that it was removing Altman because he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board\" but did not elaborate further.\n\nAltman returned as CEO on November 22, 2023, after nearly all of OpenAI's staff threatened to quit if he wasn't reinstated.\n\nIn his blog post, Altman said \"there were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work\" to help him and OpenAI when he was ousted, but Conway and Chesky \"stood out from all others.\"\n\nAD\n\n\"I've of course heard stories about Ron's ability and tenaciousness for years and I've spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice,\" Altman wrote.\n\n\"But there's nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do,\" he continued. \"I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done.\"\n\nConway and Chesky, Altman wrote, gave him \"great advice\" and \"stopped me from making several mistakes.\" The pair also tapped on their vast networks to assist him, Altman added.\n\nAD\n\n\"I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did,\" Altman wrote. \"But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Conway and Chesky did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nConway and Chesky are longtime friends of Altman and were one of the first people he called after OpenAI fired him.\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam & Greg or all the builders in OpenAI. \u2014 Ron Conway (@RonConway) November 18, 2023\n\nConway was also one of Altman's guest speakers when the latter taught a class on startups at Stanford University in 2014.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAltman and Chesky's friendship, meanwhile, goes back more than a decade. Altman mentored Chesky when Airbnb was a part of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator.\n\nWhen Altman was fired from OpenAI, he briefly considered launching another AI startup but was discouraged by Conway and Chesky, The New York Times reported in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"You should be willing to fight back at least a little more,\" Chesky told Altman, per The Times.\n\nOpenAI's board, Conway later told Time magazine, had fired Altman for \"nitpicky, unfireable, not even close to fireable offenses.\"\n\nThe billionaire venture capitalist had spoken to the magazine as part of a profile on Altman that was published in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"It is reckless and irresponsible for a board to fire a founder over emotional reasons,\" Conway told the outlet."

            "article_content": "The big picture: A debate surrounding Northeastern's computer science curriculum highlights the ongoing challenges in higher education about how to best prepare students for rapidly evolving technical fields. While Python is currently popular in the industry, the choice of programming language for teaching should be based on pedagogical merit rather than current trends, writes one student.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The Huntington News, Derek Kaplan, a fourth-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University, presented a compelling argument about the future of computer science education at his institution. The piece comes in response to Northeastern's announcement of a complete overhaul of its computer science curriculum.\n\nKaplan makes the case that the rapidly evolving nature of the tech industry requires a focus on timeless principles rather than current trends and that an effective curriculum should emphasize fundamental principles that are widely applicable, enabling students to easily adapt to new technologies in their future careers. \"A curriculum focused on current industry trends risks becoming obsolete before students even graduate,\" he noted.\n\nNortheastern's current curriculum, particularly the \"Fundies\" courses, focuses on systematic program design and problem-solving skills. These courses teach a design recipe that provides a consistent formula for tackling unfamiliar problems, training students to reason about code \"rather than to mindlessly write it,\" he said.\n\nThe \"point of Fundies is \u2026 to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language\u2026 A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language.\"\n\nHowever, the proposed changes to the curriculum have raised concerns. The plan is to phase out core courses like Fundies 1, Fundies 2, and Object-Oriented Design in favor of new courses primarily teaching Python, which Kaplan sees as potentially misguided.\n\nRacket, the language currently used in introductory courses, was chosen for its teaching-oriented features, which Python lacks. Kaplan also views as problematic the decision to allow students to place out of new courses with AP Computer Science credit, as AP courses do not teach the same systematic design skills as Northeastern's current introductory courses.\n\nThese changes suggest a shift away from systematic program design as a central aspect of the curriculum, which could leave students ill-prepared for advanced coursework and future careers. The Object-Oriented Design course, while challenging for many students, teaches essential skills such as working with code written by others and managing large software projects.\n\nKaplan also questions the motivations behind the curriculum change, suggesting that it may be driven by a desire to make the core curriculum easier and reduce the number of students withdrawing from certain courses.\n\n\"I know one professor who has been telling students that the college wants to reduce the number of students who withdraw from Fundies 2 and Object-Oriented Design. While this is an understandable sentiment, it would be a mistake to remove the most important parts of the curriculum to do so.\"\n\nFinally, he notes that experienced teaching assistants could provide valuable input into the curriculum revision process. Their unique perspective, having both taken the courses and helped other students succeed, could help ensure that core principles are not compromised while allowing for beneficial changes.\n\n\"As a former teaching assistant, or TA, for Object-Oriented Design, I have seen many students struggle through the class. But I have also seen those same students become better programmers because of what they learn in that class.\""

While she said she doesn\u2019t have to worry about clothing choices for a boy, she previously admitted to putting rules on her son\u2019s social media use.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have never allowed Jackson to have any type of social media presence whatsoever outside of what I share of him on my stuff because I don\u2019t want him to build some type of following, see a paycheck that comes in that looks like that, and then turn 16 years old, start working at Chick-Fil-A, and the paycheck looks very, very different,\u201d she said on the November 7 episode of the Coffee Convos podcast.\n\nLindsie is Todd\u2019s oldest daughter from his first marriage to Teresa Terry. She has become estranged from the family following the investigation into Todd and his wife Julie Chrisley\u2018s bank and tax fraud that led to their 2022 conviction and combined 19 years in prison.\n\nSavannah Chrisley, Todd\u2019s daughter with Julie, has accused Lindsie of helping investigators in the criminal case against her parents. Lindsie has denied this.\n\nIn April 2024, Savannah answered fan questions on Instagram, where she was asked why Lindsie didn\u2019t attend Todd and Julie\u2019s appeal hearing. \u201cI told her that she was not wanted, that my dad did not want her there, and that he didn\u2019t care to have a relationship with her,\u201d she stated.\n\nLindsie opened up about the situation on her Southern Tea podcast on April 19, 2024, saying, \u201cI do feel that it was in the best interest for me and everyone else. My sister privately let the message get to us that she did not want us present at the hearing. And it was shared with me that if we were there, there would be issues and that we would be asked to leave.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jin Yi (Jeanie) Tan told the school children she was supervising for a science outreach programme \u2018you can collect anything you want\u2019, she didn\u2019t expect one to bring in goose droppings. She also wasn\u2019t expecting the programme to lead them to a new cytotoxic peptide.\n\nTan, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Brian Murphy\u2019s lab from the University of Illinois Chicago, US, leads a team of researchers in an outreach collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, one of the city\u2019s oldest youth development organisations. With 21 locations, and 20,000 young members, the clubs provide resources and support to aid members\u2019 personal and professional development. So far the team has worked with two local branches: the Bartlett J McCartin club and the James R Jordan club, the latter of which is named after Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan\u2019s late father.\n\nThe 14-week after-school programme, termed the Chicago antibiotic discovery lab, offers middle school students (aged 11\u201313 ) from underrepresented communities, a hands-on learning experience searching for potential antibiotics in their own neighbourhoods . Funded by the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant that Tan received for her PhD, the programme teaches the fundamentals of microbiology research, from sample collection to laboratory analysis. Students are also introduced to environmental issues, engineering, robotics and related careers. \u2018We\u2019ve done four different cohorts of this programme, constantly tweaking stuff to make things better,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018One of our strengths is that the programme is very small, allowing us to give one-to-one mentoring and tailor the work to the students\u2019 interests.\u2019\n\nSemi-automated\n\nTan\u2019s PhD project focusses on finding new antibiotics to combat multi-drug resistance by harnessing antimicrobial toxins secreted by other bacteria. She has developed a pipeline for screening bioactive compounds from the natural environment, \u2018integrating things like robotics, bioassays and bioinformatics to create a streamlined workflow\u2019, she explains. This approach simplifies the initial stages of microbial drug discovery by allowing steps to be carried out in a semi-automated manner, making it safe and accessible enough to be taught to middle school students. \u2018The researchers were very good at mentoring the students \u2026 [the students] were constantly supervised and because of the robotics, had no interaction with hazardous bacteria,\u2019 adds Jonathon Rodriguez, the technology program manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.\n\nThe mentor team encourages students to carry out each stage of the process autonomously \u2013 instilling a sense of ownership over their results. While some students collect samples from lake water or flowers, others get more creative, swabbing everything from air conditioning filters to playground slides. \u2018The kids are always collecting the weirdest stuff t hey can find,\u2019 says Tan.\n\nStudents then program a robot to isolate the bacterial colonies grown from their samples and test the ability of each one to prevent the growth of multi-drug resistant bacteria. \u2018At first when they look at the environmental bacteria plates, they are really grossed out,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018But after five minutes, they\u2019ll be looking really closely? Like \u201cwait, what\u2019s this one? Why is this one pink?\u201d It\u2019s exciting for them to be able to understand microbiology and that they can produce medicines.\u2019\n\nTan successfully isolated a new anti-bacterial compound from Pseudomonas idahonensis, a bacterium cultured from the goose dropping sample. It turned out to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that they named orfamide N . Using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis she elucidated the structure of the new bioactive molecule. It comprises 10 mixed D- and L-amino acids and a distinct lipid tail, which sets it apart from other known orfamides and is thought to contribute to its biological activity. While the peptide demonstrated minimal antibacterial activity, it showed cytotoxicity in bioassays against human cancer cell lines, warranting further investigation in its application for cancer therapy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really happy and grateful that I was able to merge two big interests of mine and showed that this can happen. Biomedical research and Stem outreach can lead to a publication ,\u2019 says Tan. The research, published in the journal ACS Omega, lists the the student who collected the goose dropping sample as a co-author, underscoring their integral role in this discovery. \u2018The student was really excited about it,\u2019 adds Rodriguez.\n\nAs the project continues into its third year, the team hopes its approach can serve as a model for university\u2013community partnerships elsewhere. \u2018There is often a disconnect between a university and the neighbouring communities it should serve,\u2019 says Murphy. \u2018Both teams are learning about one another and building trust, and that barrier that typically exists between university and community is being systematically broken down.\u2019"

            "article_content": "Pinned\n\nDrivers headed toward the Lincoln Tunnel in Weehawken, N.J., on the first day of congestion pricing on Sunday.\n\nCongestion pricing arrived in New York City exactly one second after midnight on Sunday.\n\nAnd despite the freezing temperatures, a crowd of about 100 people gathered at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 60th Street in Manhattan to mark the occasion.\n\nIt was mainly supporters who showed up to clap and chant, \u201cPay that toll! Pay that toll!\u201d But one opponent tried to drown them out by banging a cowbell. And the exchanges grew a bit testy at times across the congestion pricing divide.\n\nThe tolling program, the first of its kind in the nation, finally became reality on New York streets after decades of battles over efforts to unclog some of the most traffic-saturated streets in the world. In the weeks leading up to its start, the program survived multiple legal challenges seeking to derail it at the last minute, including from the State of New Jersey.\n\nIt will most likely be some time, however, before it becomes clear whether congestion pricing works, or whether it can withstand continuing attempts to overturn it by a broad array of opponents, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, who takes office later this month.\n\nNoel Hidalgo, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, was among the first drivers to pay the toll. As he drove his Mini Cooper across the threshold, toll supporters cheered and clapped from the curb.\n\nAnother driver posted a photo on social media of a silver car with metal cans dangling from the rear bumper. \u201cJust tolled\u201d was written on the rear windshield.\n\nMost passenger cars are now being charged $9 once a day at detection points set up along the borders of the new tolling zone, from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan.\n\nImage Congestion pricing scanners above First Avenue at East 60th Street in Midtown Manhattan on Sunday morning. Drivers will be tolled via E-ZPass or license plate readers. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nShortly after noon, about 12 hours after tolling began, transportation leaders declared that the plan had rolled out without a hitch, but cautioned that the tolling system was complicated and that it was too soon to know how it was faring.\n\n\u201cWe will start to know specific numbers and have some comparatives within a few days, and we\u2019re going to share that information publicly,\u201d said Janno Lieber, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency overseeing the program.\n\nSo far, the M.T.A. does not intend to make any adjustments to the program, Mr. Lieber said.\n\nTraffic data for the congestion zone was mixed on Day 1. The average travel speed initially inched upward 3 percent to 15.1 miles per hour at 8 a.m. Sunday, compared with 14.6 m.p.h. at the same time on the first Sunday in January last year, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics firm. But by noon, the travel speed had fallen to 13 m.p.h., slightly slower than in 2024.\n\nImage The congestion pricing zone extends from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nStill, the real test for the tolling program will come during the workweek. The M.T.A. said it had chosen to introduce the program on a Sunday to be able to work out any kinks while traffic was sparse. Light snow was forecast for the region on Monday, which could affect commuter data if fewer people choose to drive.\n\nOn a typical weekday, at least half a million vehicles enter the congestion pricing zone, a metric that officials will be tracking \u201cvery, very closely,\u201d Mr. Lieber said.\n\nManoj Bhandari\u2019s car will no longer be among them. Though he normally drives into his Midtown office at least twice a week from New Jersey, he said he would now only take the train. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive for me and it\u2019s expensive for everybody,\u201d said Mr. Bhandari, 54, who was parked outside the Lincoln Tunnel on Sunday. \u201cWe won\u2019t be using our car anymore.\u201d\n\nTransportation officials have projected that congestion pricing will reduce the number of vehicles entering the congestion zone by at least 13 percent.\n\nOther drivers seemed to accept that there was no way around the new tolls. Oscar Velasquez, 54, a carpenter who lives on Long Island, said he was going to have to pay more now to haul his tools to jobs around the city. \u201cOne of these days, they\u2019re going to charge you for walking,\u201d Mr. Velasquez said as he idled on West 66th Street in his Chevy pickup truck.\n\nThe tolls are expected to help generate $15 billion to pay for crucial repairs and improvements to New York\u2019s aging subway system, buses and two commuter rail lines. The work includes modernizing subway signals, making stations more accessible for riders with disabilities and expanding the city\u2019s electric bus fleet.\n\nThose upgrades could improve the commute for Emily Rose Prats, 36, of Brooklyn, who supports congestion pricing. She has spinal degradation and standing for long periods can cause her great discomfort, so she has avoided the subway and the bus, which can be unreliable.\n\n\u201cThe improvements from congestion pricing are supposed to be an upgrade to the signals, which will mean faster trains, shorter headways, shorter commutes, less wait times,\u201d Ms. Prats said. \u201cAll of that is something that will help me be able to take advantage of a public amenity that we pay for.\u201d\n\nCongestion pricing is being introduced in New York at a time when traffic has surged on city streets since nearly disappearing five years ago in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. New York was named the world\u2019s most congested city, beating out London, Paris and Mexico City, in a 2023 traffic scorecard compiled by INRIX.\n\nThough congestion policy has successfully reduced traffic in other global cities, including London, Stockholm and Singapore, it has never gotten far in this country. Besides New York, a handful of other cities, like Washington and San Francisco, have explored the concept.\n\nThe program has been unpopular in the polls, and some transit experts noted that neither Mayor Eric Adams nor Gov. Kathy Hochul had commented on the start of congestion pricing by Sunday afternoon even though it will have a major impact on the city and state.\n\nMr. Adams has supported the plan while expressing reservations about it, and is running for re-election this year. Ms. Hochul paused the program in June over concerns that it would hurt the city\u2019s recovery and brought it back in November with a 40 percent reduction in the tolls, down to $9 from $15.\n\nThe tolls will increase to $12 by 2028, and to $15 by 2031. The new plan is set to generate about $500 million per year during its first three years, and then $700 million when fees first go up, then close to $1 billion when the original toll is restored. The money will be used to secure $15 billion through bond financing, which would be paid back with tolling revenue.\n\nImage Revenue from the tolling plan will be used to finance crucial improvements and upgrades to New York City\u2019s aging public transit system.

Dave Sanders for The New York Times\n\nMr. Lieber of the M.T.A. said that officials did not expect New Yorkers to change their behavior overnight.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to have to adjust to this as more and more people become aware of it and start to factor it into their planning,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a coffee shop near Lincoln Center, Terry Kotnour, a retired consultant, praised congestion pricing. \u201cThat\u2019s the cost of living here,\u201d said Mr. Kotnour, 82, who gave up his car long ago. \u201cWe have fairly good mass transit, so use it instead.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Kevin Chau, 27, a software engineer from Queens who rides Citi Bike, said that he hoped Manhattan would become safer for cyclists. \u201cLess cars on the road means it\u2019s less dangerous for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many critics, including suburban commuters, said the program will do little to reduce traffic while punishing drivers who live outside Manhattan.\n\nOn the same day that congestion pricing began, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also began to charge drivers higher fees to travel between New Jersey and New York on bridges and tunnels, which it controls. (The rate is now $16.06 for passenger vehicles during peak hours, up by 68 cents from the previous fee.)\n\nImage Empty lanes at the New Jersey entrance of the Holland Tunnel.

Her husband had dropped her off at 61st Street, one block north of the tolling zone. \u201cI walked the rest of the way here,\u201d she said.\n\nReporting was contributed by Wesley Parnell , Bernard Mokam , Nate Schweber , Olivia Bensimon , Anusha Bayya , Camille Baker , Sean Piccoli and Emma Fitzsimmons ."

This multichannel programmatic solution now empowers connected TV (CTV) and digital-out-of-home (DOOH) media owners to drive higher revenue through smarter, automated ad auctions.\n\nEX.CO logo (PRNewsfoto/EX.CO)\n\nThe expansion follows 12 months of extensive research and development, during which EX.CO refined its technology to address the unique challenges of CTV and DOOH environments and introduce a transformative programmatic approach that raises the bar for the industry. Fragmented technologies, broken programmatic pipes, and outdated auction dynamics that plague these channels have caused significant inefficiencies and missed revenue opportunities for media owners. EX.CO's Ad Server tackles these pain points, offering a more intelligent, unified solution that maximizes revenue potential.\n\n\"We discovered that the programmatic bid stream, originally designed for the web, presents significant complexities when applied in other environments,\" said Tom Pachys, co-founder and CEO at EX.CO. \"To solve this, our ad server leverages cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms that dynamically optimize auctions in real-time, reflecting a new generation of unified auction technology. This ensures media owners achieve the best outcomes without relying on outdated, rule-based or manual decision-making, delivering a smarter and more efficient approach tailored for CTV and DOOH.\"\n\nThe EX.CO Ad Server is powered by the company's proprietary, machine learning-driven yield engine\u2014originally developed for its award-winning online video platform (OVP). This advanced technology processes vast amounts of data to identify and select the highest-performing demand sources while adapting pricing dynamically to maximize results. Already proven successful with top-tier publishers, the ad server is currently being tested with select CTV and DOOH clients, ensuring it meets the unique demands of these evolving channels.\n\nThe EX.CO Ad Server simplifies ad sales with automation, increases fill rates, and maximizes revenue by analyzing dozens of data dimensions for each auction and modifying CPMs in real-time. Additionally, it ensures that all programmatic pipes function at their full potential, optimizing revenue opportunities in CTV and DOOH auctions. This adaptability makes it a game-changer for media owners looking to scale in CTV and/or DOOH.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The year 2024 featured the continuation, escalation, or reignition of wars across the globe, from Myanmar in Southeast Asia to wars across the Levant.\n\n2024 saw the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the escalation of the war in Ukraine, the sudden reignition of the Syrian civil war, the continuation of the Myanmar civil war, the escalation of the Sudanese civil war, the continuation of the war in Gaza, and the conflict in the Red Sea involving the Houthis.\n\nThe year concluded with several conflicts and other powder kegs set to erupt. Here are the three places where conflict is most likely to erupt or escalate in 2025:\n\nSyria\n\nA Syrian fighter walks on an area at the top of Mount Qasioun in Damascus, Syria, on Saturday, Dec. 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Leo Correa)\n\nFew analysts predicted the dramatic jihadist offensive on Nov. 27 that ended 10 days later with the toppling of Bashar Assad\u2019s government, four years after he was widely viewed as having won the Syrian civil war. Thousands took to the streets to celebrate, inaugurating a new era in Syria.\n\nThe newfound peace is unlikely to last and hasn\u2019t actually been fully achieved. Turkish-backed rebels joined in on the offensive and immediately began fighting the United States-backed Kurdish troops in the north.\n\nThe coalition that toppled Assad was diverse. Nearly all of them fought each other as much as they had Assad, and most of them had irreconcilable differences. Marxist U.S.-backed Kurds, al Qaeda\u2019s former branch in Syria, assorted Islamist jihadist groups, progressive democratic rebels, Turkey, Turkish proxies, Druze militias, the Islamic State, and Israel now all dominate Syria. With the removal of their one common enemy, 2025 will decide whether this fragile coalition can hold.\n\nThe offensive that toppled the Assad government was led by the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, a rebrand and merger of several Islamist jihadist groups, led by the Al Nusra Front \u2014 al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria. Its commander, Abu Mohammad al Julani, was originally sent to Syria in 2011 by ISIS (then ISI) Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to establish the group\u2019s wing there. Julani has rebranded himself as a moderate, insisting that his new government will be democratic and respect minorities.\n\nEven if Julani is genuine, HTS boasts thousands of foreign fighters who traveled to Syria to fight for jihad. The initial offensive witnessed war crimes committed against Syrian Arab Army troops, including the beheading of prisoners of war. Reports have emerged of some fighters attacking and looting Christian and Alawite villages. The jihadist fighters could grow unruly over the moderate turn of HTS and start an insurgency of their own.\n\nThe three most likely fault lines that could see the eruption of a large conflict are the Kurds versus Turkey and its proxies, jihadist fighters against the more moderate rebels, and an insurgency from Alawites and former Ba\u2019athist members versus the new government.\n\nThe collapse of the Assad government and, with it, extensive patronage from Russia and Iran could also open up a vacuum to be filled by ISIS.\n\nThe fall of Assad ended the first phase of the Syrian civil war. 2025 will decide whether the fall marks the end of the war in general or merely the beginning of a new phase.\n\nYemen\n\nHouthi fighters march during a rally of support for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and against the U.S. strikes on Yemen outside Sanaa on Monday, Jan. 22, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nWhile 2024 was marked by the defeat and humiliation of Iran and its \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d the Houthis in Yemen were a clear exception. An armada of over 20 nations failed to stop the group\u2019s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, with the Houthis even expanding operations to hit Israel directly with a ballistic missile.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that Israel will shift its attention to the Houthis following the degradation of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran after the Oct. 7 massacre. In a video statement on Dec. 22 after a ballistic missile strike on Tel Aviv from Yemen, he warned, \u201cJust as we acted forcefully against the terrorist arms of Iran\u2019s evil axis, so we will act against the Houthis.\u201d\n\nIsrael launched several rounds of airstrikes against Yemen in 2024, largely hitting fuel and port infrastructure in the capital of Sanaa. Netanyahu\u2019s indication that Israel will expand operations could indicate further airstrikes in 2025 despite the difficulty involved.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 could also take advantage of the weakening of Iran and its proxies to restart major hostilities against the Houthis in 2025. The U.S.-led coalition could also expand operations to make more of an effort in degrading Houthi military capabilities.\n\nWith Hamas and Hezbollah significantly degraded and Iran not at the peak of its powers, 2025 is likely to see the post-Oct. 7 wars shift to Yemen.\n\nBalochistan \u2013 Iran and Pakistan\n\nBalochistan is a little-known region spanning eastern Iran, western Pakistan, and southern Afghanistan. It is inhabited by the Baloch people, a unique nomadic ethno-linguistic group. Iran and Pakistan have struggled with insurgencies from the group for decades, embittered over a sense of disenfranchisement.\n\nThe insurgency has been led by the Balochistan Liberation Army, but the primarily Sunni Balochistan has also served as a stronghold for ISIS, al Qaeda, and other jihadist groups in recent years. Militants have targeted Iranian and Pakistani military personnel, civilian infrastructure, nonethnic Balochs living in the region, foreign diplomats, and Shiites, and in recent years, they have expanded to attacking Chinese contract workers. The attacks on Chinese contract workers were particularly alarming for the Pakistani government, as it threatened to demolish a $60 billion Chinese investment project.\n\nChatham House noted a distinct shift in the Balochistan insurgency in 2023, noting better organization and effectiveness. This can largely be credited to an influx of educated middle-class professionals, who have increased the popular appeal of the insurgency. It has also expanded beyond radical militants, with an accompanying civil society movement with even wider popular appeal.\n\nThe recent inclusion of women in the typically male-dominated movement has also increased its popularity. In April 2022, a Baloch woman with a graduate degree in medicine killed three Chinese students at the University of Karachi in a suicide bombing attack.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe increased effectiveness of the insurgency has resulted in a change in strategy from the Iranian and Pakistani governments. Accusations of harboring Baloch militants to attack the other country peaked in January when the two countries exchanged missile and air strikes. Seemingly at the brink of war, the two countries suddenly reversed course to cooperate against the insurgency instead. The security forces of the two countries have begun conducting joint operations to fight Baloch militants.\n\nPakistan declared an anti-insurgency operation in June 2024. Fighting has continued throughout the year, but the increasing effectiveness of the insurgency, the participation of Iran, and the heavy-handedness of the military\u2019s tactics could exacerbate the situation. Several factors point toward the likelihood that the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan and Iran could reach new levels of violence in 2025, causing further problems for the embattled governments of the two countries."

The Nifty Midcap Select fell 2.00 per cent to 12,749.90, while the banking sector indices also faced significant losses with Nifty Bank down 1.61 per cent at 50,167.95 and Nifty Financial Services declining 1.35 per cent to 23,415.20.\n\nMarket breadth remained heavily negative with 3,223 stocks declining against 734 advances on the BSE. The number of stocks hitting lower circuit at 365 significantly outnumbered those touching upper circuit at 228. Despite the broad market weakness, 159 stocks managed to hit their 52-week highs, while 67 touched their 52-week lows.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals emerged as the top gainer on the NSE, rising 0.91 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank and Titan with modest gains of 0.15 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively. The major losers included Tata Steel (-4.18 per cent), BPCL (-3.46 per cent), Adani Enterprises (-3.22 per cent), Kotak Bank (-3.10 per cent), and Trent (-3.05 per cent).\n\nThe market sentiment was affected by news of two HMPV cases detected in Karnataka, both involving infants. The Union Health Ministry confirmed that the cases were identified through routine surveillance, with both patients admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, for bronchopneumonia. Neither patient had any international travel history.\n\nWhile the Health Ministry maintained that the HMPV strain is already in global circulation and that there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses, the news appeared to trigger concerns among investors, leading to broad-based selling across sectors.\n\nThe market reaction comes despite the Ministry\u2019s assurance of preparedness and ongoing monitoring through the ICMR and IDSP network, with support from the WHO in tracking the situation in China."

            "article_content": "Only 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n\u2013 To hear US President-elect Donald Trump tell it, he is about to take over a nation ravaged by crisis, a desolate hellscape of crime, chaos and economic hardship. \u201cOur country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the world!\u201d he declared on social media last week.\n\nBut by many traditional metrics, the America that Trump will inherit from President Joe Biden when he takes the oath for a second time, two weeks from Jan 6, is actually in better shape than that bequeathed to any newly elected president since Mr George W. Bush came into office in 2001.\n\nFor the first time since that transition 24 years ago, there will be no US troops at war overseas on Inauguration Day. New data reported in the past few days indicates that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been.\n\nThe manufacturing sector has more jobs than under any president since Mr Bush. Drug overdose deaths have fallen for the first time in years. Even inflation, the scourge of the Biden presidency, has returned closer to normal, although prices remain higher than they were four years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is inheriting an economy that is about as good as it ever gets,\u201d said Mr Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.\u201d\n\nThose positive trends were not enough to swing a sour electorate behind US Vice-President Kamala Harris in the November election, reflecting a substantial gap between what statistics say and what ordinary Americans appear to feel about the state of the country. And the US clearly faces some major challenges that will confront Trump as he retakes power.\n\nThe terrorist attack that killed 15 people in New Orleans early on New Year\u2019s Day, carried out by an American man who said he had joined the ISIS extremist group, served as a reminder that the group \u2013 which Trump likes to boast he defeated during his previous term \u2013 remains a threat and an inspiration to radicalised lone wolves. The wars in Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip are daunting challenges even without US troops engaged in combat there.\n\nThanks in part to Covid-19 relief spending by both Trump and Mr Biden, the national debt has ballooned so much that it now represents a larger share of the economy than it has in generations, other than during the pandemic itself. Families remain pressed by the cost of living, including housing, healthcare and college tuition. The cost of petrol , while down from its peak, is still about 70 US cents per gallon higher than when Mr Biden took office.\n\nMoreover, Americans remain as divided as they have been in many years \u2013 politically, ideologically, economically, racially and culturally. As healthy as the country may be economically and otherwise, a variety of scholars, surveys and other indicators suggest the US is struggling to come together behind a common view of its national identity, either at home or abroad.\n\nIndeed, many Americans do not perceive the country to be doing as well as the data suggests, either because they do not see it in their own lives, they do not trust the statistics or they accept the dystopian view promoted by Trump and amplified by a fragmented, choose-your-own-news media and online ecosphere.\n\nOnly 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. In another Gallup survey in September, 52 per cent of Americans said they and their own family were worse off than four years ago, a higher proportion than felt that way in the presidential election years of 1984, 1992, 2004, 2012 or 2020.\n\nIt was in Trump\u2019s political interest, of course, to encourage that sentiment and appeal to it during 2024 \u2019s campaign. He was hardly the first challenger to emphasise the negative to defeat an incumbent president.\n\nDwight Eisenhower disparaged the state of the country when he first ran for president in 1952, much to the irritation of president Harry S. Truman, only to have John F. Kennedy do the same to him when running in 1960.\n\nKennedy hammered away at a \u201cmissile gap\u201d with the Soviet Union that did not exist, then after winning declared that the US was in \u201cits hour of maximum danger\u201d, in contrast to Eisenhower\u2019s view of his security record.\n\n\u201cThis is a contrast you oftentimes find,\u201d said historian Michael Beschloss, who has written nine books on the American presidency. \u201cCandidates who are running against incumbent presidents or sitting governments make it sound much worse than it is.\u201d\n\nStill, few have been as extreme in their negative descriptions as Trump, or as resistant to fact-checking. He has suggested falsely that immigration, crime and inflation are out of control, attributed the New Orleans incident to lax border policies even though the attacker was an American born in Texas and as recently as Jan 4 called the country \u201ca total mess\u201d.\n\nYet Trump is moving back into the White House with an enviable hand to play, one that other presidents would have dearly loved on their opening day. President Ronald Reagan inherited double-digit inflation and an unemployment rate twice as high as today. President Barack Obama inherited two foreign wars and an epic financial crisis. Mr Biden inherited a devastating pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stepping into an improving situation,\u201d Dr William J. Antholis, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Centre of Public Affairs, which has studied presidential transitions, said of Trump.\n\nDr Antholis compared the situation with then President Bill Clinton\u2019s arrival in 1993, when he took over a growing economy and a new post-Cold War order. While the country had already begun recovering from recession during the 1992 election, many voters did not yet feel it and punished President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the economy had turned just before the election, and kept moving in the right direction when Clinton took over,\u201d Dr Antholis recalled.\n\nMuch as it did for the first Mr Bush\u2019s team, the disconnect between macro trends and individual perceptions proved enormously frustrating to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, who failed to persuade voters during the 2024 election that the country was doing better than commonly believed. Rattling off statistics and boasting about the success of \u201cBidenomics\u201d did not resonate with voters who did not see it the same way.\n\n\u201cOf course, not everyone is enjoying good economic times, as many low-middle income households are struggling financially, and the nation has mounting fiscal challenges,\u201d Mr Zandi said. \u201cBut taking the economy in its totality, it rarely performs better than it is now as President Trump takes office.\u201d\n\nMr Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the latest reports demonstrated that Mr Biden\u2019s policies are working and argued that Republicans should not seek to repeal them once they take control of the presidency and both houses of Congress.\n\n\u201cAfter inheriting an economy in free fall and skyrocketing violent crime, President Biden is proud to hand his successor the best-performing economy on earth, the lowest violent crime rates in over 50 years, and the lowest border crossings in over four years,\u201d Mr Bates said.\n\nMs Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump, responded by citing the election: \u201cAmericans delivered an overwhelming Election Day rebuke of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s abysmal track record: communities being overrun with millions of unvetted migrants who walked over Biden\u2019s open border, lower real wages, and declining trust in increasingly politicised law enforcement agencies that are unable to even publish accurate crime data.\u201d\n\nTrump does not have to share a positive view of the situation to benefit from it. When he takes office on Jan 20, absent the unexpected, he will not face the sort of major immediate action-forcing crisis that, say, Mr Obama did in needing to rescue the economy from the brink of another Great Depression.\n\nTrump instead will have more latitude to pursue favoured policies such as mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally or tariffs on foreign imported goods. And if past is prologue, he may eventually begin extolling the state of the economy to claim successes for his policies.\n\nHe has already taken credit for recent increases in stock prices even before assuming office. He has a demonstrated skill for self-promotion that eluded Mr Biden, enabling him to persuade many Americans that the economy during his first term was even better than it actually was.\n\nAt the same time, with unemployment, crime, border crossings and even inflation already pretty low, it may be difficult for Trump to improve on them significantly. Trump obliquely seemed to acknowledge as much when he noted in a post-election interview with Time magazine that he may not be able to live up to his campaign pledge to lower grocery prices. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Trump faces the risk that the economy goes in the other direction. Some specialists have warned that a tariff-driven trade war with major economic partners could, for instance, reignite inflation.\n\nDr N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard University and chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under the second Mr Bush, recalled that even his former boss faced significant challenges when he took office in 2001 as the economy was already heading into a relatively mild recession following the bust of the dot-com boom.\n\n\u201cThere are no similar storm clouds on the horizon right now,\u201d Dr Mankiw said. \u201cThat is certainly lucky for Trump. On the other hand, all presidents must deal with unexpected shocks to the economy. We just don\u2019t know yet what kind of shocks President Trump will have to handle.\u201d NYTIMES\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

Under the guidance of Lead Architect Pattabi Rama Rao Thumati, this mission-critical project revolutionized how partners access and consume financial data, setting new standards for system availability and real-time data processing in enterprise environments.\n\nThe project faced significant challenges from the outset. The existing system required regular maintenance windows that resulted in frequent downtimes, disrupting partner access to crucial financial data. With partners directly accessing SAP Finance Master Data, system maintenance windows on weekly, monthly, and quarterly bases had become a significant operational bottleneck, impacting business continuity and decision-making capabilities across the organization.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation was Pattabi's innovative approach to system architecture. Taking full responsibility for the technical solution, he designed and implemented a sophisticated architecture leveraging Cosmos DB and a custom SAP Master Data API.

            "article_content": "HERE_AWS\n\nHERE and AWS\n\nLas Vegas, CES 2025 \u2013 HERE Technologies (HERE) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced their new collaboration and cloud infrastructure agreement, to provide a scalable and streamlined solution for automakers\u2019 development of location-aware software. This collaboration will advance Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) development and combining AWS technologies with HERE mapping solutions will help accelerate the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Automated Driving (AD), and new digital car experiences.\n\nLocation technology plays a pivotal role in the advanced software powering the vehicles of today and will continue to grow in importance for SDVs moving forward. For example, live mapping location technology that is rich in detail and quality is often required to power numerous functions across the digital cabin and vehicle, from navigation and location-based services to electrified drivetrains, and ADAS and AD capabilities. These data-intensive operations can be supported seamlessly and scaled easily with AWS, enabling faster software development times and reducing the time-to-market for new innovations and services.\n\nBuilding a next-generation, AI-powered mapping system in the cloud\n\nFor nearly a decade, HERE has been using AWS for its core cloud infrastructure, data platform, analytics, and the deployment of its proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. AWS\u2019s high-performance and cost effective compute infrastructure has also enabled HERE\u2019s rapid deployment of its unified map architecture. This architecture leverages HERE\u2019s AI and ML models to automate, update, and enhance its IoT sensor data-derived mapmaking that processes hundreds of millions of kilometers of vehicle probe and sensor data every hour. Through this new, expanded collaboration, HERE can offer automakers a comprehensive set of cloud-native tools and technologies that help accelerate development of new automotive innovations, such as improved active safety features and infotainment systems, while delivering industry-leading location technology to better address complex navigation requirements, including multi-stop electric (EV) charging.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith HERE\u2019s live mapping, navigation, and connected mobility services built on the scalable, highly available, and reliable global infrastructure provided by AWS, HERE customers are able to better address high-performance vehicle routing challenges, improve EV driving efficiency and battery range accuracy, and optimize driving routes. These capabilities are enabling HERE\u2019s automotive customers to manage complex data aggregation, testing, and processing workflows to enable new, hands-free driving and digital cabin features, enhancing the overall driving experience.\n\nMaking it easier and more cost-efficient to test new driving technologies\n\nAWS and HERE\u2019s collaboration will advance ADAS and AD development by addressing critical challenges and accelerating innovation. For example, today, HERE launched SceneXtract, a solution that removes the need for manually searching, locating, and converting real-world environments into simulation-ready scenes, which is required for testing and validating the performance of ADAS and AD systems before they can be used in real-world deployments.\n\nUsing the highly accurate and continuously updated map data from HERE HD Live Map along with AWS natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI services, including Amazon Bedrock, automotive developers can now quickly locate and export HERE HD Live Map data into scenes for testing. This new solution reduces the time, effort, and cost required to prepare new simulations for ADAS and AD testing, helping the automotive industry develop and deploy these driving technologies faster and more efficiently. These simulations will help improve ADAS and AD systems, reducing the cognitive load on drivers and enhancing vehicle responsiveness to road conditions.\n\n\u201cLocation technology is at the heart of the automotive industry's software-defined vehicle revolution, and HERE's collaboration with AWS is boosting our ability to deliver game-changing tools that dramatically accelerate this complex transformation for our customers. By fusing HERE\u2019s industry-leading location intelligence with AWS's cloud capabilities and global reach, we're empowering automakers to rapidly evolve their vehicles into cutting-edge software platforms. Our work with AWS enables our customers to leverage our state-of-the-art location technology for faster software development and real-time data analytics throughout the entire SDV lifecycle, propelling the industry into a new era of automotive excellence,\" said Mike Nefkens, CEO at HERE.\n\n\u201cThe future of the auto industry is linked to technological advancement and invention, and our collaboration with HERE is a powerful example of how AWS is accelerating innovation across manufacturing, connected vehicles, and driver experiences,\u201d said Matt Garman, CEO at AWS. \u201cWorking with HERE, we will help automakers pioneer new ways to improve the driving experience by leveraging the global scale, reliability, and AI capabilities of AWS to power AI-driven mapping applications and features.\u201d\n\nEnabling developers to build essential location-based services\n\nHERE\u2019s mapping data and services are also used as the primary location data provider within Amazon Location Service, which enables developers to add geospatial data and location functionality to applications, including dynamic and static maps, places search and geocodes, route planning, and device tracking and geofencing capabilities. These capabilities allow customers to visualize data on a map, recommend routes, use geocoding to convert plain text addresses into geographic coordinates, convert latitude and longitude coordinates into addresses, and monitor and track assets such as fleets of vehicles.\n\nDeveloping transportation and logistics solutions\n\nBeyond the automotive industry, AWS and HERE entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) to build and scale HERE\u2019s new transportation and logistics solutions, using HERE mapping content, location services, analytics and proprietary AI/ML algorithms, on top of compute, storage and database capabilities from AWS. These new solutions will be available through AWS Marketplace and enterprise and independent software vendor (ISV) customers optimize their fulfillment and deliveries, build more efficient supply chains with increased visibility into shipments and assets, and further their sustainability goals. For example, companies are using HERE\u2019s location intelligence on AWS to gain real-time visibility into the shipment of critical equipment to provide accurate estimated times of arrival (ETAs) and ensure the timely delivery of essential products.\n\nAbout HERE\n\nHERE has been a pioneer in mapping and location technology for 40 years. Today, the HERE location platform is recognized as the most complete in the industry, powering location-based products, services and custom maps for organizations and enterprises across the globe. From autonomous driving and seamless logistics to new mobility experiences, HERE allows its partners and customers to innovate while retaining control over their data and safeguarding privacy.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines).

Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

Has solving a century-old paradox now undermined their existence?\n\n\u00a9 William Horton, William Horton Photography\n\nEvery now and then, it is worth pausing for a second and giving thanks to the many, ever so slightly different versions of you that exist in parallel realities. It is these alternative selves that help to keep these universes in balance.\n\nAt least, that is what\u2019s going on if you happen to subscribe to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. First proposed more than 65 years ago, the idea is that reality is constantly splitting off into parallel paths, due to subtle interactions at the level of quantum particles. Though it may boggle the mind, it also smooths over some devilishly tricky problems in physics and, for that reason, plenty of clear-eyed physicists believe it to be true.\n\nBut now this strange idea might be facing a huge challenge, thanks to physicists Sandu Popescu and Daniel Collins at the University of Bristol, UK. They initially set out to solve a 100-year-old puzzle in quantum theory, but ended up undermining the idea of parallel universes. \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially demolished one of the arguments for it,\u201d says Collins.\n\nIt might sound like a destabilising development, but it may actually prove to be a shot in the arm for quantum theory. Already, Popescu and Collins\u2019s work is helping to resolve other long-standing quantum paradoxes and, in the eyes of some theorists, it points to a fresh way of thinking about the cosmos as a singular quantum reality built from the inside out. \u201cThis is something deep and new. I think it could become really important,\u201d says Nicolas Gisin, who researches\u2026"
