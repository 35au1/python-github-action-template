        "article_content": "Many a horror franchise has been temporarily goosed by an injection of sci-fi \u2014 even the slasher at the center of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d series went into orbit in the 2001 \u201cJason X\u201d \u2014 but that element doesn\u2019t do a lot to distinguish \u201cV/H/S/Beyond.\u201d This seventh entry in the ersatz found-footage omnibus series should be another reliable draw for genre platform Shudder, where it begins streaming Oct. 4. And the ongoing overall enterprise continues to have value as a launching pad for up-and-coming talents. But despite its new thematic wrinkle, the five segments here feel familiar in ideas and unmemorable in execution. It\u2019s a middling addition to a variably inspired anthology brand that will no doubt trundle on through more installments yet.\n\nThe wraparound device, directed by Canadian documentarian Jay Cheel, mingles interviews with real-life UFO enthusiasts and skeptics, also throwing in passing mentions of highlights in the history of alleged abductions, plus clips from popular representations (including vintage drive-in camp \u201cEarth vs. the Flying Saucers\u201d). There\u2019s also a fictive element in discussing a man\u2019s disappearance from his family\u2019s home, leaving behind VHS tapes of a supposed \u201calien encounter\u201d that we finally see at the film\u2019s end.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe first three regular sequences are a little too alike, in that they all escalate quickly to frenzied, bloody action confused by the found-footage subgenre\u2019s usual hectic first-person camerawork. In Jordan Downey\u2019s \u201cStork,\u201d a squad of police raid a dilapidated house amid rampant baby kidnappings. Before finding what they\u2019re looking for, they must battle adults who\u2019ve basically turned into fast-moving zombies. Virit Pal\u2019s \u201cDream Girl\u201d has two paparazzi (Syandeep Sengupta and Rohan Joshi) sneaking onto a Mumbai film set, then into the trailer of \u201csuperstar Tara\u201d (Namrata Sheth) to snap some \u201ccandids.\u201d Alas, they discover a little too much about her, leading to another gory melee. Justin Martinez\u2019s \u201cLive and Let Dive\u201d finds skittish Zach (Bobby Slaski) coerced into skydiving with friends to mark his 30th birthday. Unfortunately, their plane gets caught between an alien spaceship and pursuing government aircraft, with the survivors facing related new perils once they\u2019ve crash-landed in an orchard below.\n\nEach is a bit better than the last, but these splattery scenarios nonetheless feel like the same thing in different settings \u2014 preliminary jitters, then carnage and monsters \u2014 only somewhat alleviated by the novelty of \u201cStork\u201d\u2019s surreal climactic attic tableau, \u201cGirl\u201d\u2019s Bollywood musical number, or \u201cDive\u201d\u2019s alarming creature design.\n\nThere is definitely a shift in approach with siblings Christian and Justin Long\u2019s \u201cFur Babies,\u201d but this more comedic miniature is also the collection\u2019s worst episode. Libby Letlow plays the gratingly chirpy proprietress for \u201cDoggy Dreamhouse,\u201d a canine boarding facility some animal rights activists suspect of being abusive. But when they send members incognito to spy on her, it turns out her harshest \u201ctraining\u201d is largely reserved for two-legged captives. Though it eventually tips towards silliness of a \u201cIsland of Dr. Moreau\u201d-esque stripe, the intended satire here of both simpering pet pamperers and PETA-style fanatics is painfully broad.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s actor Kate Siegel\u2019s latest collaboration with spouse Mike Flanagan, this one her first as director, while he is the writer. (They previously co-wrote the screenplay for his very good 2016 feature \u201cHush,\u201d in which she starred.) That definitely ups the expectations for \u201cStowaway,\u201d a slow burn with Alanah Pearce as Halley, a woman interviewing locals around \u201cknown UFO hotspot\u201d the Mohave Desert for a documentary \u2014 though whether she\u2019s sincerely interested or secretly ridiculing them, we\u2019re not sure.\n\nFlanagan\u2019s script offers this \u201cV/H/S\u201d entry\u2019s only stab at character nuance by hinting that our heroine arrived at this isolated place and task by having already burned every other bridge in her life. In any case, camping out one night, she investigates unusual lights in the distance, ultimately entering some kind of alien craft. But just what happens to her there is so murkily visualized (in sharpest contrast to the arguably over-sharp bodycam imagery in \u201cStork\u201d) that the segment just kind of floats off into fuzzy obscurity. Intriguing and frustrating in the general realm of \u201cSkinamarink\u201d\u2019s twilight-zone dread, it requires patience yet doesn\u2019t quite go anywhere definite enough to reward that effort fully.\n\nThe found-footage format can grow repetitious fast, and too much of \u201cBeyond\u201d degenerates into chaotic chase/attack set-pieces that feel interchangeable in their shaky cams and barely coherent action. The energy is high \u2026 but high energy can get monotonous, too. Actors running around screaming aren\u2019t all that effective (or convincing, as supposedly \u201creal\u201d people filming themselves) sans sufficient setup in terms of character involvement, ominous atmosphere or narrative engagement. While the individual conceits here are workable enough \u2014 even if two of them really have no connection to the ostensible UFO theme \u2014 nearly all head toward variations on the same shrill bloodbath, suggesting future \u201cV/H/S\u201d chapters might do better to re-focus on inventive writing rather than simply providing disparate excuses for gory mayhem.\n\nThat said, this competent if mostly forgettable effort\u2019s strongest elements are in exactly that department. Though their handiwork is often glimpsed too briefly, special makeup effects designer Patrick Magee and VFX supervisor Justin Martinez (both credited for the entire feature) contribute some vividly icky, grotesque images."

        "article_content": "Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, \u2018CTRL\u2019 revolves around Nella Awasthi, a popular content creator whose social media relationship with her boyfriend, Joe Mascarenhas, comes to an end after she catches him cheating on her. Subsequently, Nella installs an AI app named CTRL that helps her erase Joe from her digital life. However, unbeknownst to her, the app takes rapid control over every aspect of her life, blurring the lines between reality and the virtual world.\n\nThe Netflix thriller presents a cerebral film that latches on to growing concerns within the modernizing digital world. With data, social media, and personal privacy colliding within the screenlife drama\u2019s plot, a grave and chilling account is presented with unflinching authenticity. It asks valid questions about individual awareness, the practices of the dark web, and how invasive technology can be when left unchecked and employed as a commodity. Therefore, the film\u2019s basis seems tied to prescient issues of the contemporary world and the reality faced by everyone with access to the internet. But is that really the case?\n\nCTRL Sheds Light on the Dark Side of Social Media\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is a fictional story penned by director Vikramaditya Motwane and co-writers Avinash Sampath and Sumukhi Suresh. The movie explores the pitfalls of social media culture through a gripping thriller storyline, punctuating it with incisive forays into the internet\u2019s toxic elements. While the story begins in a relatively happy place, it takes a slow descent into the issues plaguing ordinary people in relation to their digital interactions. Probing questions about authenticity are posed as the protagonist, Nella, finds herself living a lie in front of the camera but leading a completely different one offscreen. Additionally, the darkest aspects of the narrative come to the fore when an invasive AI begins exploiting the insecurities of human emotions through its own agendas.\n\nThe movie mainly examines the exploitative nature of social media and how memory, human emotion, and feelings can often get tied in a virtual setting, which often has no borders on its privacy. As people yearn for more, Nella finds herself catering to their needs by becoming the face of perfection but lacking the imperfections needed to sell reality. Director Vikramaditya stated that the film revolves around the concept of sharing oneself with the world without understanding the consequences that come from it. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2013 how much sharing is too much sharing and the dopamine hits likes and favourites give you. It\u2019s about how much you end up doing for social media. It\u2019s like a doomsday scenario and it\u2019s not impossible to believe this.\u201d\n\nCTRL is a Topical Thriller About the Commodification of Human Experience\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 derives most of its central tension from the battle between human free will and an authoritarian AI app that wants to dictate everything for its users. There is an Orwellian fantasy lurking in its premise. Parallels can be seen with how rapidly modernizing internet practices attempt to take away control from people\u2019s lives, particularly in the manner in which it preys on insecurities. It serves as the burning question of the film. Even Ananya Pandey, who plays Nella, chimed in on the topical concern by emphasizing how it can be particularly damaging for mostly the younger generation, who find themselves victim to a lot of seedy online elements and the mental challenges they pose at times.\n\nMemory also plays a major role in \u2018CTRL.\u2019 With most people\u2019s lives today stored in digital archives, a person\u2019s memories can be attached to their social media avatar. In the movie, this becomes a central topic and one that was inspired by other films. During the development process, the scriptwriters discussed the enduring legacy of \u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019 as a key influence, particularly in the manner in which it explores erasing a loved one from one\u2019s life. The same concept rears its head throughout the Netflix screenlife thriller. The director also revealed that the Spike Jonze-directed science fiction movie, \u2018Her,\u2019 had some influence over the writing. However, he hailed the Michel Gondry directorial as a masterpiece, even if it does not touch upon the topic of AI.\n\nThe Ctrl App is a Fictional AI Service With an Invasive Protocol\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is built around the futuristic service provided by the titular AI app that Nella installs on her laptop, which eventually takes control over her life. It is a made-up application conceived by the scriptwriters Vikramaditya Motwane, Avinash Sampath, and Sumukhi Suresh. While it is not based on any real-life apps, Vikramaditya stated that it would serve as an interesting reflection of how AI has become a major hot-button issue in today\u2019s society. \u201cGiven the conversations about AI, we realized that there was a lot more that we could say about social media, data and privacy in the guide of a straightforward thriller,\u201d the director said. As such, some vague parallels can be drawn between the CTRL app and chatbot AIs like ChatGPT, especially how it is capable of mimicking natural human dialogue.\n\nHowever, in terms of the app\u2019s personalized aspects, digital assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa have more similarities. The story focuses primarily on the CTRL app\u2019s invasive nature and how it eventually takes over Nella\u2019s life and dictates every aspect, including her schedule and emotional needs. In many ways, it also provides an outlet for people to alleviate their loneliness, which is a prime concern in the case of Nella, who goes through a very public breakup and finds herself ostracized on the internet. It speaks to a greater issue converging on modern society, specifically in the domain of ethics, and whether human insecurities might be harnessed to the advantages of AI services like CTRL. Still, for the time being, it is a fictional service with no ties to reality.\n\nRead More: CTRL Ending, Explained: Why Does Nella Give Up?"

        "article_content": "EndlessAI has officially launched Lloyd, a groundbreaking AI assistant that brings real-time video analysis to smartphones without the need for additional hardware. Available now on the iOS App Store, Lloyd leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s upcoming Gemini to provide users with immediate insights about the world around them. Since launching just several weeks ago, Lloyd has organically amassed tens of thousands of users, and it appears their AI video assistant might represent the next evolution of generative AI.\n\nBreaking the video barrier in AI\n\nOne of the significant challenges in scaling generative AI has been the computational cost associated with processing video data. Traditional LLMs require immense computing power to ingest and analyze video frames, making real-time applications impractical. EndlessAI is on a mission to \u201ccrack the code\u201d by developing proprietary algorithms and patented processes that aim to optimize video data for LLMs efficiently.\n\n\u201cLLMs require very extensive computing power to understand visual data. With a 1080p video running 86,400 frames per hour, seamless, real-time video analysis has been out of reach. EndlessAI empowers existing LLMs, including the ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude families to ingest and understand complex, real-time video with utmost efficiency,\u201d said Roi Ginat, co-founder and CEO of EndlessAI.\n\nLloyd\u2019s real-world applications\n\nLloyd stands out by enabling smartphones to \u201csee\u201d the real world, not just static images. Users can interact with Lloyd in various innovative ways:\n\nHome Assistance : Child-proof a room or get home decor advice about your living room.\n\n: Child-proof a room or get home decor advice about your living room. DIY Fixes : Fix a leaky sink or a misaligned bicycle wheel without professional help.\n\n: Fix a leaky sink or a misaligned bicycle wheel without professional help.

Creative Content : Compose TikTok posts based on your surroundings or ask questions about what\u2019s on TV.\n\n: Compose TikTok posts based on your surroundings or ask questions about what\u2019s on TV. Everyday Convenience: Find misplaced items like glasses in a cluttered space or translate signage, menus and more.\n\nLloyd\u2019s can also be used for pure entertainment \u2014 as the founders are already seeing these use cases. Lloyd can craft personalized bedtime stories; by taking a panoramic video of a child\u2019s room and specifying a hero or theme, \u201cLloyd will tell them a mesmerizing story where the elements of the room come alive. Pick a new hero or a new theme or a new room every night. The kids want another story? No problem; how about two more!\u201d\n\nNo additional hardware required\n\nUnlike other visual AI assistants that necessitate hardware purchases, Lloyd operates entirely through existing smartphones. This approach eliminates the need for consumers to invest in additional gadgets that may quickly become obsolete.\n\n\u201cSome of our competitors seem to be taking the opposite approach of building their own smartphones or other smart devices to get better AI features. That approach no longer makes sense: why would anyone want to purchase a separate device to get what was meant to be better AI features that Lloyd has now leapfrogged?\u201d said Thomas Pompidou, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of EndlessAI. \u201cRather than requiring users to buy new phones or other hardware and be limited to their modest AI capabilities, Lloyd leverages smartphones connected to the Cloud to provide a vastly superior experience.\u201d\n\nPrivacy and data security\n\nEndlessAI emphasizes robust privacy measures in processing live video and audio inputs. The company employs secure login protocols, data encryption in transit and at rest, and strict access controls. Data retention policies ensure that user data is not held beyond the necessary time to fulfill its intended purpose.\n\n\u201cEndlessAI is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to data protection and privacy,\u201d added Ginat. \u201cExtensive guardrails with regards to content adequacy are also provided by the own guardrails of the LLM operators; OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, etc. all have processes and training in place to prevent inappropriate and privacy-breaching content.\u201d\n\nAn evolving platform\n\nAs LLMs continue to advance, Lloyd is designed to improve alongside them. The assistant functions on an over-the-top (OTT) basis, optimizing the input data ingested by LLMs. This means that as models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and others evolve, Lloyd\u2019s capabilities will automatically enhance.\n\n\u201cWe are a force multiplier for ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, etc. and are poised to significantly expand their market opportunity and we make them immediately viable at scale for video analytics use cases. As a result, as LLMs get better, Lloyd gets better. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Pompidou explained.\n\nFuture developments and B2B opportunities\n\nEndlessAI plans to introduce new features to Lloyd, including specialized \u201cPowers\u201d like a \u201cTour Guide\u201d mode that uses precise geolocation for contextual information and an \u201cAction Mode\u201d for sports and fitness advice. The company is also preparing to launch an API for businesses, enabling enterprises to incorporate real-time video analysis into their processes at scale.\n\n\u201cIntegrating video at scale in those solutions opens very extensive new opportunities but faces extensive Accuracy, Speed and Cost challenges,\u201d said Ginat. \u201cIt will allow enterprises, businesses, AI scale-ups and developers to build and operate highly scalable Generative AI solutions tailored to their unique needs.\u201d\n\nBehind EndlessAI\n\nFounded over a decade ago, EndlessAI has been at the forefront of video analysis and communication technology. The leadership team brings together expertise from software development, venture capital, marketing, and AI specialization:\n\nRoi Ginat , co-founder and CEO: 28 years of software development experience.

Jim Justice said in a release. An accompanying digital passport allows visitors to check in at haunted locations, earning points for prizes along the way.\n\nThe launch of the West Virginia Paranormal Trail follows the recent announcement of Haunted Ohio: 24 Must-Visit Places by TourismOhio, the tourism arm of the Ohio Department of Development. The Lafayette Hotel and the Hackett Hotel in Marietta are on the trail. Nearby on the list are Hocking Hills State Park in Logan and The Ridges at Ohio University at Athens.\n\n\u201cThe haunted and paranormal stuff is so popular,\u201d said Mark Lewis, president and CEO of the Greater Parkersburg Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLewis cited the popularity of the annual Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, where the Silver Bridge collapsed in 1967, killing 46 people. According to folklore, the cryptid Mothman is tied to the collapse.\n\nThe Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant also is on the Paranormal Trail.\n\nIt\u2019s late in the tourist season, but not too late to promote the Paranormal Trail and the local attractions, Lewis said. A goal of the trail and its promotion, among others, is to increase room stays, he said.\n\n\u201cWe think we can bring in people for the haunted tours and the Paranormal Trail,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel is ranked in the Top 10 most-haunted hotels in North America, Adra Johnson, who runs the ghost tours and investigations at the hotel, said. She also is involved with the separate Susan Sheppard\u2019s Haunted Parkersburg ghost tour.\n\nAttractions applied to be on the Paranormal Trail, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to be on it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nApparitions at the hotel include the specters of children playing tag in the halls, unexplained knocks on the door and hotel builder William Chancellor smoking a cigar, believers believe.\n\nThe Paranormal Trail has already generated interest, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten several phone calls already,\u201d she said.\n\nActivities are held year round at the hotel and are popular, Johnson said. Appalachian ParaCon, a paranormal convention, will be held Oct. 18, 2025, at the hotel, Johnson said.\n\nLewis will propose two more local attractions to be added to the trail, the Riverview Cemetery in the 1300 block of Juliana Street in Parkersburg and the Silver Tunnel on the North Bend Rail Trail, a 1,376-foot tunnel near Cairo.\n\n\u201cI think the Silver Tunnel is more well known for paranormal activity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe weeping woman statue overlooking the graves of the Jackson family is located at Riverview Cemetery where many notable citizens in Parkersburg\u2019s history are buried.\n\n\u201cRecent trends have shown us that travelers are increasingly interested in spooky and unique destinations,\u201d West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said. \u201cWest Virginia has quite a few spots with haunted histories, so we created the Paranormal Trail to tap into the thriving market for themed tours and attractions. Whether learning about local legends or touring notoriously haunted attractions, it appeals to travelers interested in spooky sightings, mystery and local lore.\u201d\n\nOther landmarks on the Paranormal Trail are the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, Lake Shawnee Abandoned Amusement Park, Harpers Ferry, the Hotel Morgan in Morgantown, the Flatwoods Monster Museum in Flatwoods, Old Hospital on College Hill in Williamson, the Historic Glen Ferris Inn in Glen Ferris, the Shepherdstown Mystery Walk, the Haunted Haymond, the Elk River Trail between Ivydale and Duck and the West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville.\n\nInformation about the trail and how to earn points by visiting the site is at wvtourism.com/paranormal.\n\nTravelers can register online to participate in Paranormal Trail and receive the digital passport by email or text. Visitors check in to spooky spots around the state to earn points for an official Paranormal Trail sticker, a beanie and a limited-edition print by artist Liz Pavlovic of West Virginia.\n\nJess Mancini can be reached at jmancini@newsandsentinel.com."

(KSLA) - ArkLaTex Artistry\u2019s Brittney Hazelton speaks to Nathan Treme about the Highland Paranormal Society game publishing company he began in 2018 and his music.\n\nShreveport native, Nathan Treme created the locally based \u2018Highland Paranormal Society\u2019 game publishing company, designing miniature and easy-to-learn tabletop roleplay games. Some of his games can even be printed from home.\n\nHow did Highland Paranormal Society start?\n\nNathan explains he found a punk-rock sort of subculture of people just making their versions of Dungeons and Dragons. He got very into it and started making his games in 2018.\n\n\u201cI like Dungeons and Dragons. I was playing that for a while. I got into that, and kinda like everything I get into I do kinda a deep dive and find what the underground version of that, that is being made. There is so many awesome roleplaying games that are being made, you know? Just by people who grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons and then they just came up with their own version of it. Or when it went from one version to another, they didn\u2019t really like the changes, so they just kinda focus in on the thing they like and end up making their own game,\u201d explains Treme.\n\nShreveport's Highland Paranormal Society game publisher and musician, Nathan Treme speaks to ArkLaTex Artistry's Brittney Hazelton. (Nathan Treme)\n\nHe started to get a good response to what he was putting out into the world, some of the games even allow you to bring over your characters from other games. Some of his games include Tunnel Goons, which is his most well-known game, In the Light of a Ghost Star, a Sci-Fi roleplay game, and games like Dogtooth Valley, which push the limit of how minimal you can make a game, being only a business card in size.\n\nShreveport's Highland Paranormal Society game publisher and musician, Nathan Treme speaks to ArkLaTex Artistry's Brittney Hazelton. (Nathan Treme)\n\n\u201cSometimes I call my games, and say they are like DnD if you are not good at math,\u201d jokes Treme.\n\nTreme has also hosted game jam events, challenging others to make their own games based off his game Tunnel Goons, which he says has over 150 games made based on it. Additionally, Treme\u2019s Highland Paranormal Society has a very successful Patreon, with 640 members subscribed, where he publishes games and other content for his fans. His Patreon\u2019s monthly subscriptions range from just $2 Paranormal Investigator, $5 Paranormal Researcher, and $10 Paranormal Entity. Those who are Paranormal Entities even get random miniature games mailed out to them sometimes.\n\nShreveport's Highland Paranormal Society game publisher and musician, Nathan Treme speaks to ArkLaTex Artistry's Brittney Hazelton. (Nathan Treme)\n\nSome of Treme\u2019s games have also been published by outside publishers, including a book of many of his games called The Haunted Almanac through a game publisher named Games Omnivorous.\n\n\u201cThey contacted me about a kind of a collection of over a two-year period of stuff I put out on Patreon. So, I gave them all of that stuff and they had this really amazing designer kind of lay it all out in this beautiful kinda-hard cover book. And that, I think there is maybe a few copies left in some stores, but that is about to sell out of its third printing,\u201d says Treme. \" They did such a good job making all my weird little-sized games.\u201d\n\nShreveport's Highland Paranormal Society game publisher and musician, Nathan Treme speaks to ArkLaTex Artistry's Brittney Hazelton. (Nathan Treme)\n\nHe has also collaborated a few times with other game designers, mostly ones on Discord, but Treme says there are cool people designing games in the area.\n\n\u201cKinda the cool thing about tabletop roleplay games is even if you are playing it, you are in some way a game designer already. If you are the dungeon master, you are doing some game design just preparing the session,\u201d says Treme. \u201cIts a hobby that there is not that much of a barrier between player and creator.\u201d\n\nShreveport's Highland Paranormal Society game publisher and musician, Nathan Treme speaks to ArkLaTex Artistry's Brittney Hazelton. (Nathan Treme)\n\nSee one of his games, Pilgrims of the Nighted Path, played by Youtuber channel, Funhaus:\n\nTreme is not only a game developer, but also a visual artist and active musician who is in several different bands and projects, even previously performing at SBC Zombie Walk before.\n\n\u201cThat was more my solo stuff, very synthesizer and drum machine based. I\u2019m usually using a vocard through my voice, so I got kind of a robot voice going on. Definitely, a sort of heavy synth wave kind of sound is what I\u2019m usually going for,\u201d says Treme.\n\nNathan Treme is both an electronica-style musician/DJ but is also a rapper. He is in multiple bands locally, including under his own name Nate Treme, Blood Punch, and the Mutant Dad.\n\nTreme has been in Blood Punch for a long time with his best friend Raven, and they would do rap and hip-hop. It started out because they were obsessed with Waka Flocka Flame.\n\nIn recent years, he and his brother, a guitar player, started Mutant Dad. The project consists of taking synthwave and mashing it together with some sick guitar riffs.\n\nHow does he come up with songs?\n\n\u201cOnce I kinda get the rhythm going, sometimes it\u2019s just about playing around with synthesizers, you know, just nerding out with the sound until I get a sound that I really like. Or if I am using samples, I love sample-based music as well, finding a sample, some kind of sound and using it in a new way, I think that is really fun,\u201d says Treme.\n\nWhen it comes to samples, he has a sampler who cuts samples in different ways he can\u2019t always control, but he enjoys the unpredictableness.\n\n\u201cI like riding the line between, where it is almost just noise but then it kind of, I don\u2019t know, it melds into this rhythm coming through and it turns into a song,\u201d explains Treme.\n\nHe even does this unpredictable mixing in his live music sometimes.\n\n\u201cSometimes I do sets that are very much just making a bunch of noise then I\u2019m like trying to bring it all together into something. I\u2019m kind of making it up as I go. I like doing that a lot,\u201d explains Treme.\n\nCopyright 2024 KSLA. All rights reserved."

Web scraping is a fundamental task for gathering leads and analyzing competitors, providing valuable insights into market trends and strategies. Vision-based scraping takes things a step further, allowing you to examine visual content and gain a deeper understanding of branding and design elements. Additionally, social media scraping extends your reach to platforms like LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube, offering a comprehensive view of online interactions, trends, and consumer sentiment.\n\nUse web scraping for lead generation and competitor analysis\n\nUse vision-based scraping to gain insights into branding and visual content\n\nExtend your reach with social media scraping on platforms like LinkedIn, X, and YouTube\n\nBuilding an AI Agent (No-Code)\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of AI coding :\n\nDiverse Use Cases\n\nThe applications of no-code AI agents are virtually limitless. In the realm of competitor analysis, agents can collect data on market trends, pricing strategies, and product offerings, providing valuable insights to help you stay ahead of the curve. Lead generation becomes more targeted and efficient as agents identify potential prospects based on specific criteria, saving time and resources. Content idea generation is another area where AI agents excel, analyzing social media trends, influencer activities, and user engagement to help you create relevant and compelling content that resonates with your target audience.\n\nEssential Tools and Platforms\n\nTo build and optimize your AI agents, several tools and platforms are essential.

        "article_content": "Managing email on a daily basis is the bane of many people\u2019s lives but efficiently managing your email inbox is more critical than ever. With an endless stream of messages flooding in, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and struggle to prioritize important communications. Fortunately, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and workflow automation have made it possible to create a powerful AI agent that can automate your email management without requiring any coding skills. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an AI agent that can categorize and label incoming emails based on predefined criteria, ultimately enhancing your productivity and ensuring that you can focus on the most critical messages.\n\nGetting Started with Workflow Automation\n\nThe first step in creating your AI email management agent is to select a workflow automation tool that seamlessly integrates with your Gmail account. There are several popular options available, such as Zapier, IFTTT, or Automate.io, each offering a user-friendly interface and a wide range of integrations. Once you\u2019ve chosen your preferred tool, you\u2019ll need to set up an email trigger that will activate whenever a new email arrives in your inbox. To establish a secure connection between your Gmail account and the automation tool, you\u2019ll need to use your Google Cloud credentials. This crucial step ensures a smooth and secure flow of data, allowing your AI agent to process incoming emails effectively.\n\nChoose a workflow automation tool that integrates with Gmail\n\nthat integrates with Gmail Set up an email trigger to activate when new emails arrive\n\nto activate when new emails arrive Use Google Cloud credentials for secure integration\n\nConfiguring the Gmail API\n\nWith your workflow automation tool in place, the next step is to set up the Gmail API, which will allow your AI agent to access and manage your emails securely. This process involves creating an OAuth consent screen, which will enable users to grant permission for your AI agent to interact with their Gmail accounts. You\u2019ll need to generate an OAuth client ID and secret, which will be used to authenticate your AI agent and ensure secure communication between the agent and Gmail.

        "article_content": "A hot jobs report combined with still-dovish Fedspeak lifted the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nSoftware leaders ServiceNow (NOW 3.04%), Snowflake (SNOW 3.85%), and UiPath (PATH 4.52%) rallied on Friday, up 3.1%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, in the day's trading.\n\nThere wasn't any company-specific news today on these three enterprise software leaders. However, today's solid jobs report, in combination with still-dovish commentary from Federal Reserve officials, sent each stock soaring.\n\nSoftware stocks to benefit from a soft landing\n\nThe past few years of rising interest rates have generally been difficult for software stocks. While ServiceNow has impressively managed to buck the trend and recover strongly after 2022's downturn, Snowflake and UiPath are still down 62% and 76% over the past three years, respectively.\n\nNOW data by YCharts\n\nInterest rates have had a lot to do with it. When the post-pandemic inflation took off and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, it hit software stocks in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, rapidly raising interest rates caused companies, fearing a downturn, to pull back on software spending, especially since there had been a huge amount of software adoption during the pandemic. Second, rising rates also disproportionally hurt software stock valuations, as software stocks tended to trade at very high multiples of earnings or sales. Rising rates lower the present value of earnings far out in the future, which hurt high-multiple stocks like software. So, software stocks were hit by a \"double whammy\" of slowing growth and sharply discounted valuations.\n\nWhat could reverse the trend? Well, a \"soft landing\" in which inflation and interest rates come down without a recession would be the ideal scenario. Increased confidence and hiring could spur more software \"seat\" subscriptions or, in the case of Snowflake's pay-as-you-go model, more consumption of computing. Meanwhile, lower interest rates would lift valuations.\n\nInflation has been coming down recently, which spurred the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points last month on Sept. 18. Yet while some had thought lower inflation might go hand in hand with a slowing economy, today's September jobs report blew away expectations, with 254,000 jobs added, far above the 150,000 forecast and up from a revised 159,000 jobs added in August.\n\nSolid job growth and lower interest rates is the ideal environment for stocks generally, but especially the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nOf course, the hot jobs report could mean that inflation may not be subdued yet, and could keep rates high. But Federal Reserve governor Austan Goolsbee, appearing on Bloomberg TV today, said the strong jobs report doesn't mean inflation is going up. He still sees inflation getting back to the Fed's 2% target and also declared no change in the outlook for continued interest rate cuts over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe next issue for software: AI disruption\n\nWhile the interest rate and economic picture looks terrific for software stocks now, there are still a few issues to consider. First, while interest rates are likely to get back to a \"neutral\" rate soon, they aren't likely going all the way back to pandemic-era low levels. So, one shouldn't expect software companies to reattain the inflated valuations they saw in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the AI revolution has the potential to benefit or disrupt certain software companies. ServiceNow has done quite well as it serves at the nexus of companies' private on-premises data and the outside cloud, and can therefore serve as a manager of enterprises' AI while also incorporating outside LLMs. Interestingly, UiPath and Snowflake are more cloud-based, and while they have been posting growth, they haven't been benefiting as much from AI -- at least not yet.\n\nSo while the interest rate picture is getting much better for software, investors will have to be choosy on which stocks will have AI as a value-add and which might see increased competition from the AI revolution."

        "article_content": "Shares of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) gained 27.3% in September, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The business intelligence software company, known for reinvesting its cash reserves in Bitcoin, generally trended upward along with the leading cryptocurrency. It also accelerated in mid-September, when the company said it would borrow another $700 million to refinance old debt and buy even more Bitcoin. And that's not all -- MicroStrategy's stock surged again when the new debt was expanded to $1.01 billion a few days later.\n\nMicroStrategy's continued Bitcoin-buying spree boosted the stock\n\nBitcoin prices rose 10.6% in September, boosted by a strengthening American economy. Crypto investors also expect the digital currency to take off fairly soon as a result of Bitcoin halving its mining rewards in April. Late 2024 or the first half of 2025 would be a reasonable starting point for the fourth halving-based price surge, based on market data from the first three halvings.\n\nWith 252,220 Bitcoins under its belt as of Sept. 19, MicroStrategy's digital currency reserve is worth roughly $15.6 billion today. That's the largest corporate Bitcoin position in the world according to Bitcoin Treasuries. It's no surprise to see this company's stock following the market trends of Bitcoin's price chart.\n\nThe massive Bitcoin position includes 7,420 new coins, bought with the portion of MicroStrategy's fresh debt that wasn't used to pay down an older batch of senior debt notes. Investors loved this upsized refinancing and the addition of more Bitcoin, judging by MicroStrategy's soaring stock. Share prices increased by 18.7% that week.\n\nDoes MicroStrategy's software business even matter anymore?\n\nMicroStrategy's stock was a fairly accurate proxy for Bitcoin investments from 2020 to early 2024. The software company separated from Bitcoin's price trends in February this year, as investors embraced its all-in approach to the Bitcoin opportunity. The price surge in March involved another debt-based Bitcoin purchase, underscoring MicroStrategy's commitment to its Bitcoin strategy.\n\nI mean, it's all about the digital Benjamins these days. The software business is profitable and service subscription sales increased 21% year over year in the second quarter. But Bitcoin is the power that moves the needle for MicroStrategy investors anyhow.\n\nFor example, MicroStrategy introduced a plethora of new features to its ONE software suite on Oct. 1, boosting the package's generative artificial intelligence (AI) powers and data analytics capability. Market makers yawned and dropped MicroStrategy's stock price 5% lower that day.\n\nSo MicroStrategy may be the stock for you if you expect Bitcoin to keep rising and want to invest in that trend via a standard stock. Or maybe you expect the company to finance massive long-term improvements to its software business from its rising Bitcoin reserves. Either way, MicroStrategy has become a pretty direct bet on Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency bears should look elsewhere. September's market action only strengthened that argument again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.
