So it gave them a sense of mission and purpose.\n\n\"There are still bad aliens, often these are called 'Reptilians'.\n\n\"So there are the bad aliens, and then there are the good aliens.\n\n\"And most, in fact all of the Starseeds I met said that they were on the side of the good aliens.\n\n\"They said they came from planets such as Sirius, or Lyra, Pleiades was a common one, Arcturus.\n\n\"These are quite distant stars from our solar system, we don't really know what's on there, and we have no real knowledge of what these planets are, so you can sort of speculate as to what is there.\n\n\"They were part of something much more important than what they may be doing in their everyday life.\n\n\"They actually had something far more exciting going on in their life, which was being a starseed.\"\n\nSTARSEED CULT CONTROVERSY\n\nIn some cases, notable influencers in the starseed space have been accused of using their worldview to \"brainwash\" people.\n\nIn an article for Vice in 2016, Leigh Alexander recounted her experience with Unicole Unicron, who is the leader of UNICULT.\n\nUnicole also runs a TikTok with over 120,000 followers, in which she makes content based around her experiences as an alien.\n\nUnicole describes UNICULT as a way to help others see the light after her suicide attempt made her realise that she is the belief that she is an incarnation of a divine being of light helped her heal.\n\nShe decided to join the group, which required her to give a drop of her blood as part of an initiation.\n\nOne of the most revealing parts of the article is the internal structure that holds starseeds together, including Unicole, blind faith.\n\nLeigh pointed that in Unicole's world, belief is all it takes to make something real.\n\nLeigh wrote: \"Her music videos only have a few thousand views, a liberal interpretation of pop stardom, but the more I read about UNICULT, the more I realized that that\u2019s kind of the point\u2014belief makes real, Unicole Unicron reminds us.\n\n\"If she says she is a pop star, she is a pop star.\"\n\nRolling Stone reported in 2021 that Unicole was allegedly offering members religious exemption from taking the Covid vaccine.\n\nThe publication labelled her as \"anti-vax\".\n\n9 Starseeds go on blind faith to make things real, Leigh says of her experience with UNICULT Credit: Getty\n\n9 Starseeds would relate the galactic war they fight to something like Star Wars, Dr Susannah says Credit: Getty\n\n9 Dr Susannah (pictured) has done extensive work with Starseeds, who spoke to her about feeling alienated from the wider culture Credit: Exeter University\n\nTOM THE ALIEN\n\nIn June 2024, Kelly Tyler went on This Morning and claimed that she is a starseed who healed from long term sickness, after she swapped souls with a \u2018walk in alien\u2019 when she was just a child.\n\nShe says she's been able to \"astral travel\" and can leave her earthly body on command, transporting herself to a galaxy far, far away, where she meets up with blue aliens.\n\nKelly told the programme: \"When I was a child I wasn't born as a starseed. I was a very sensitive child... I was quite an ill child, and also the world was too sensitive for me.\n\n\"I would be at the bottom of my garden, with a bug box looking at stuff rather than interacting with people because it felt too much.\"\n\nShe went onto recount how she first came into contact with a spiritual entity, who she calls \"Tom\".\n\n\"I developed a relationship, or had contact, with this being from at age of seven at the bottom of my garden.\n\n\"He appeared as a light and then started to show himself more, and we just used to have this really comforting telepathic relationship.\n\n\"About a year later I developed whooping cough and I got really really ill, to the fact that I lost all my weight, and the doctors said she's not gonna make it.\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\n\"At that time, myself and this being exchanged souls.\n\n\"It's not a possession of somebody taking over, it's a mutual agreement that we decided to exchange souls.\n\n\"I don't have any real emotional memory of being pre-eight years old, and my personality ,and my physicality changed.\n\n\"I went from actually being not that clever to being able to do stuff.\n\n\"I ended up passing an entrance exam for a private school...my social skills improved and I became less shy and introverted.\n\n\"Lots of significant changes happened, and nobody can really understand why.\"\n\nA WIDER PURPOSE\n\nDr Susannah went onto add that starseeds are seeking a wider purpose: \"They were all motivated by a sense that they were seeking something larger than themselves, some sort of wider mission, something else that would account for these various feelings that they had.\n\n\"They didn't quite fit in, they weren't really like everyone else.\n\n\"Partly it was driven by a sense of alienation from their wider culture, that these were people who for various reasons felt like they didn't really fit in with mainstream American culture.\"\n\nBut another expert insists that despite starseed's apparent intentions to search for a larger purpose, they have to do this from the shadows.\n\nFermi Paradox \u2013 what is it? Here's what you need to know... The Fermi Paradox isn't strict evidence for alien life \u2013 but more of a thought experiment\n\nIt's a famous contradiction posed by physicist Enrico Fermi\n\nFermi suggested that the enormous size of the universe \u2013 and the billions of Sun-like stars in the galaxy, and their planets \u2013 makes it highly likely that there is intelligent life out there\n\nSome of these civilisations may have developed interstellar travel\n\nBut Fermi also noted that there's a significant lack of evidence for life on other planets\n\nThe chances of aliens being able to reach us are high, but there's no evidence that aliens ever have\n\nThis paradox has baffled scientists for decades\n\nGeorge Lizos, a psychic healer and spiritual teacher, said this group in society are usually \"people pleasers\".\n\nHe told The Sun: \"They tend to be people pleasers, because the whole collective purpose of star people is to create peace on Earth.\n\n\"And they are here to bring forth new frequencies, new technologies, new ideas for the purpose of expanding human consciousness, but at the same time to create peace.\"\n\nGeorge, who does not identify as a starseed, added: \"They are eager to help in whatever way they can.\n\n\"That being said, because they are highly sensitive, they are not very comfortable being in the spotlight. They'd much rather work behind the scenes to create powerful change.\n\n\"They are also very focused on accomplishing tasks and working rather than forming relationships.\n\n\"On their home planet, they form relationships in different ways, so they are not used to the way we procreate for example.\n\n\"They may also seem a little bit distant as a result of that.\n\n\"Once they realise I am here to help, in a conscious way, then that essentially overpowers their anxieties or their feeling of alienation.\"\n\n9 Kelly Tyler claims she is an alien who has been sent from outer space Credit: ITV\n\n9 Some starseeds believe themselves to be involved in a galactic war that we don't have access to on Earth Credit: Getty"

            "article_content": "Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai outlined the 2025 strategy, emphasizing consumer-focused AI, rapid development of agentic apps, a Chrome AI prototype called Project Mariner, and upgrades to Gemini and Project Astra, signaling a shift toward AI apps as the user interface for search.\n\nAlthough Pichai did not say Google is de-emphasizing the Google Search box, he did emphasize that 2025 will increase the focus on AI apps as the main point of contact between users and how they interact with Google.\n\nFor example, Project Mariner is a Chrome AI extension that can do things like take a top ten restaurants list from TripAdvisor and drop it into Google Maps.\n\nThis focus on AI shows that Google is in transition toward an AI-based user experiences that represent a larger interpretation of what Search means, a search experience that goes far beyond textual question and answering.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Future Hinges On AI\n\nGoogle CEO, Sundar Pichai, outlined a vision for 2025 that emphasizes an urgency to go back to its roots as a company that innovates quickly, what Pichai referred to as being \u201cscrappy\u201d which means being tough and resourceful, able to accomplish a lot in a quick amount of time (and fewer resources). Most importantly he emphasized solving real-world problems.\n\nHe also prioritizes \u201cbuilding big, new business\u201d which could mean creating new business opportunities with AI, reflecting a strong focus on AI as the engine for innovation in 2025.\n\nGemini App\n\nPichai also cited Gemini App as a central focus for 2025, commenting that they\u2019re experiencing growth with Gemini and that scaling broader adoption of Gemini will be a focus in 2025. This aligns with the observation that Google is increasingly focusing on a Search-adjacent approach to consumer focused AI products and services.\n\nWhat this means for SEO is that we really need to start thinking in terms of a bigger picture of what Search means. Perhaps 2025 will be, after over 15 years of Google\u2019s departure from the ten blue links paradigm, that the SEO community thinks deeper about what search means when it\u2019s multimodal.\n\nPichai was quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cWith the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months\u2026 But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well. \u2026Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year.\u201d\n\nAI Products Will \u201cEvolve Massively\u201d\n\nThe co-founder of Google Deep Mind was quoted as saying that Google was going to \u201cturbo charge\u201d the Gemini app, saying that:\n\n\u201c\u2026the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two.\u201d\n\nThat means that the Gemini app is going to gain more functionalities in a bid to make it more ubiquitous as the interface between potential website visitors and Google Search, a significant departure from interfacing with the search box.\n\nThis is something that publishers and SEOs need to think really hard about as we enter 2025. Google is focusing on increasing user adoption of the Gemini app. If that happens then that will mean more people interfacing with that instead of the Google Search box.\n\nUniversal Assistant (Project Astra)\n\nAnother thing that the SEO industry seriously needs to consider is Google\u2019s universal assistant that\u2019s code-named Project Astra. The Deep Mind co-founder is reported to have discussed their Universal Assistant, which what Project Astra is referred as.\n\nHe\u2019s quoted as saying that it can:\n\n\u201c\u2026seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device.\u201d\n\nWhat that word \u201cdomain\u201d means is that it can function across any subject, like answering questions about healthcare, directions, entertainment, over any topic. The part about modality is a reference to text, voice, images, and video.\n\nThis is a serious situation for SEO. Google\u2019s new Deep Research agentic search is an example of a disruptive technology that may have a negative impact on the web ecosystem.\n\nOne of the Google Deep Mind researchers cited as working on Project Astra is also listed as a co-inventor on a patent about controlling interactive AI agents through multi-modal inputs.\n\nThe patent is titled, Controlling Interactive Agents Using Multi-Modal Inputs. The description of the invention is:\n\n\u201cMethods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for controlling agents. In particular, an interactive agent can be controlled based on multi-modal inputs that include both an observation image and a natural language text sequence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just one of dozens of researchers cited as having worked on Project Astra. Astra is another one of the projects that Google is working on that replaces the traditional search box as people\u2019s point of contact for interacting with web data.\n\nTakeaway About Google\u2019s Plans For 2025\n\nThe takeaway from all this is that publishers and SEOs need to take a break from focusing solely on the search box and give some time to considering what\u2019s going on in multimodal AI. In 2025, AI is not just AI Overviews. AI is Gemini, it\u2019s new features coming to Gemini and possibly the release of features developed from Project Astra, a multimodal universal agent. Agentic Search is already here in the form of Gemini Deep Research. All of these are a departure from the traditional search box as the point of contact between users, Google and websites.\n\nRead the report on CNBC\n\nGoogle CEO Pichai tells employees to gear up for big 2025: \u2018The stakes are high\u2019\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Rokas Tenys"

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize health care, and vision care stands at the forefront of this technological transformation. Modern AI applications offer new possibilities for detecting, monitoring, and treating various eye conditions. These innovations make eye care more accessible and efficient while improving diagnostic accuracy.\n\n1. Early detection of eye conditions\n\nAI-powered screening tools now detect early signs of common eye conditions before they become serious problems. Using advanced image recognition technology, these systems analyze retinal scans and other eye imaging with remarkable precision.\n\nThese tools particularly excel at identifying conditions like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration during routine screenings. Early detection allows for prompt intervention, often preventing or minimizing vision loss that might otherwise occur.\n\n2. Personalized vision correction\n\nAI algorithms now help create highly personalized vision correction solutions. By analyzing multiple data points about an individual\u2019s eye structure, visual habits, and lifestyle factors, AI systems recommend more precise prescriptions for glasses and contact lenses.\n\nThese personalized approaches consider factors like digital device usage, work environment, and daily activities to optimize vision correction for specific needs. This results in better visual comfort and reduced eye strain throughout the day.\n\n3. Real-time vision assistance\n\nAI-powered applications and devices provide real-time assistance for people with visual impairments. These tools can describe surroundings, read text aloud, and identify objects or faces, significantly improving daily independence for those with vision challenges.\n\nAdvanced computer vision algorithms help these assistive technologies become more accurate and responsive over time, learning from user interactions to provide better support. This technology particularly benefits those with progressive vision conditions.\n\n4. Treatment monitoring and adjustment\n\nAI systems excel at monitoring treatment progress and suggesting adjustments to eye care plans. These tools track changes in vision over time, helping eye care professionals make more informed decisions about treatment modifications.\n\nThe technology analyzes patterns in vision changes, medication responses, and lifestyle factors to optimize treatment strategies. This data-driven approach leads to better outcomes and more efficient use of treatment resources.\n\n5. Digital eye strain prevention\n\nAs digital device usage increases, AI applications help prevent and manage digital eye strain. Smart systems monitor screen time, viewing distances, and environmental factors to provide personalized recommendations for maintaining eye health.\n\nThese applications can adjust screen brightness and contrast, remind users to take breaks, and suggest optimal viewing positions based on individual habits and needs. This proactive approach helps preserve vision health in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThe role of data in vision care\n\nAI systems continually learn from vast amounts of eye health data, improving their ability to detect patterns and predict potential issues. This growing knowledge base enhances the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment recommendations.\n\nPrivacy-protected data sharing between eye care providers helps these systems become more sophisticated, leading to better understanding of various eye conditions and more effective treatment approaches.\n\nIntegration with traditional eye care\n\nAI technology works alongside traditional eye care practices, enhancing rather than replacing the expertise of eye care professionals.

            "article_content": "Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan. Even before it got its anime adaptation, the title of one of this year\u2019s best shows feels like it was destined to be turned into rhythm. Thank god the Japanese band behind the anime\u2019s catchy and propulsive opening had the same idea, one that\u2019s compelled over 32 million views and counting on YouTube alone (and that\u2019s just one of its listings \u2013 there\u2019s another on Netflix\u2019s channel). The bouncy, fast-paced backing track already feels perfectly representative of this animated take on the manga by Yukinobu Tatsu, in a goofy, chaotic and idiosyncratic genre mash-up.\n\nThe show itself, directed by F\u016bga Yamashiro with animation produced by Science Saru, is similarly flexible. A marriage of science fiction and horror, reflections on contemporary urban living and age-old folklore, high school romance and hard-hitting action, there\u2019s a little bit of something for everybody. \"Dandadan\" is the story of Momo Ayase and Ken \u201cOkarun\u201d Takakura, two seemingly opposite classmates at school who are drawn together by a mutual fascination with the paranormal. Momo insists that ghosts and spirits are real, while Ken (whom Momo later nicknames Okarun) believes in aliens.\n\nNeither believe the other at first, before each land themselves into an encounter with those very things. Momo is abducted by aliens, Okarun is possessed by Turbo Granny, a spirit haunting a tunnel (and yes, Turbo Granny is the actual name of a spirit from Japanese urban legend). Both survive the experience, but gain strange new powers as a result, and use those to solve various hauntings and other abductions throughout this 12-episode run (with more to come next year). Not only that, but the two have to begin a search: during his possession by Turbo Granny, Okarun\u2019s balls got stolen.\n\nTurbo Granny in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAs well as the general mayhem that emerges it\u2019s fun seeing how each episode of \"Dandadan\" highlights its different building blocks: One episode might be more ghostly, the next leaning more into sci-fi, with some surprisingly long stretches dedicated to fleshing out the budding romance between Momo and Okarun. In action-oriented anime, romance is usually an afterthought, but in \"Dandadan\" it's one of the driving forces of the story \u2013 including arcs about communication and anxiety that are surprisingly sincere and generous about these feelings, while giving a lot of space for characters to figure out some tangled emotions.\n\nRelated The 12 biggest moments in animation in 2023\n\nIt\u2019s the balancing act to the rest of the show\u2019s sometimes willfully juvenile humor, which actually never tips into insufferable, just silly (though this is perhaps underselling how deranged the first couple of episodes are). The show has been a standout this year in part because of its sense of unpredictability as well as its sincere investment in its romance, and its eye-catching visual approach, which is perhaps not as experimental as the studio\u2019s other work has been (though one standout episode has an astonishing first person conceit), but it\u2019s consistently beautiful.\n\nThose \"Dandadan\" main titles\n\nDirected by Abel Gongora of \"Scott Pilgrim Takes Off\" fame, the viral opening credits encompass all of these sides to the show. The backing song \u2013 performed by a band called Creepy Nuts, oddly appropriate for this \u2013 first kicks things off with wild and energetic rapping before settling into a gentler, poppy hook, almost reflective of the tonal swings in the show that follows. It\u2019s also just an earworm, perhaps even surpassing Gongora\u2019s last efforts as director on the opening for Science Saru\u2019s \"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!!\" which also went viral in its day.\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun.\n\nThe animation itself complements these change-ups beautifully \u2013 shifting art styles as it moves from the quickfire montage of detailed, goofy expressions hinting at the main cast\u2019s personalities to the more heavily stylized touches, as the camera zooms out until the person in frame becomes a shape amidst a block color background. Interspersed throughout are some paintings of the various spirits and aliens, silhouetted against the block colors which within the show itself become strongly associated with them: each spiritual or alien encounter leading to the following scenes being taken over by that single block color. It\u2019s not just a hint at the show\u2019s own style, but a reference to its influences; many have noted that much of the opening refers back to that of the original \"Ultraman,\" the monsters from which have inspired a lot of those in \"Dandadan.\" This wild minute-and-a-half eventually settles into a hint at something more tender as the two main characters lean on each other and look at the stars.\n\nMomo in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun. There\u2019s giant crabs, guys running so fast they turn into a mess of jagged lines, there\u2019s a maneki-neko doll running around, there\u2019s dancing (modeled on moves from a Rihanna video, as pointed out by some eagle-eyed fans).\n\nIt speaks to something which has felt missing from a lot of television in recent years, as so many opening sequences have gotten tied up in feeling prestigious, leading down the same road of moody and atmospheric music over a montage of animated statues. Even the animated smash hit \"Arcane,\" which is more eclectic than even \"Dandadan\" in its visual approach, fell into this same trap as it relented to these prestige TV trends.\n\n\"Dandadan\u2019s\" opening, for all the influences it proudly presents, doesn\u2019t feel so anonymous. It has personality and energy, no anxiety about not being taken seriously. Admittedly, though on average they trend to being more, well, animated than a lot of TV main titles, anime opening and ending credits tend to follow their own medium's tropes. Think images of hands reaching out the sun, the protagonist running . . . somewhere, the cast falling out of the sky. You can get generic versions of these too; there\u2019s no ironclad rule, and Gongora\u2019s work on \"Dandadan\" (and \"Eizouken\") feel idiosyncratic within that space too.\n\nWhy not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?\n\nStill, they\u2019re at the pinnacle of a format which can sometimes feel like an afterthought, as television gets absorbed more and more into an age of \u201cSkip Intro\u201d buttons and streamers attempting to push you through to the next episode as soon as possible. It should be said that there are notable recent exceptions: think \"Peacemaker,\" \"Pachinko\" (I promise, I\u2019m not just naming intros with dance routines), \"Severance\" or \"Succession\" (there you go). These are shows with different priorities, yes, and anime like \"Dandadan\" is looking toward pop sensibilities rather than HBO\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s not TV\u201d mindset, something many treat as aspirational. But openings like this (and like \"Peacemaker\") are part of the fun, a chance to capture the show in microcosm, and chasing trends feels like it diminishes that chance.\n\nPerhaps this is all part of my wider problem with streaming, the expectation to get everything at once, ravenously consume it, and click to the next thing, rather than have fun with the ritual of television, of seeing something on a weekly basis and growing familiar with it. I can\u2019t get \"Dandadan\" out of my head, so I\u2019ll be coming back. Why not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?"

            "article_content": "In September, 2011, I drove to Plains, Georgia, with Gerald Rafshoon, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s former media adviser. Rafshoon had asked me to write a play about the 1978 Camp David summit between Carter, President Anwar Sadat, of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister. They were three pious men. Sadat called himself \u201cthe first man of Islam.\u201d He plotted against the British and was charged with complicity in an assassination of a pro-British minister, and had come to the Presidency only through the death of the charismatic leader of the Arab world, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Begin was an Orthodox Jew\u2014the first non-secular leader of Israel and the founder of the Likud Party\u2014and had lost his parents in the Holocaust. He had also been the head of a terrorist organization, the Irgun, and was responsible for the deaths of more than ninety people in the bombing of the King David Hotel, in Jerusalem, in 1946. Carter, an evangelical Christian, had had little prior political experience other than a single term as the governor of Georgia. These men spent thirteen days secluded near Maryland\u2019s Catoctin Mountain and produced a peace treaty that has endured for forty years. It was Jimmy Carter\u2019s signature accomplishment and one that has never been matched in the region, despite decades of strenuous attempts.\n\nThe Carters lived in a ranch house on the edge of town. We met in the front room, where Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, sat on a couch upholstered in a blue print that matched the curtains. Behind them was a painting that Carter had made of the same room, with its grandfather clock, rocking chairs, and roll-top desk. It looked like an illustration from the children\u2019s book \u201cGoodnight Moon.\u201d Not depicted were two matching elliptical machines that faced the television. Carter was eighty-six at the time. He wore khaki pants, short athletic socks, and a blue shirt that almost disappeared against the couch. His silver belt buckle was a horseshoe enclosing the initials J.C. He had not shaved, and his white stubble made his face more wintry than usual. I was just beginning my research, and I didn\u2019t yet know who the characters in the play should be, beyond Carter, Sadat, and Begin.\n\nRafshoon introduced me by saying that I had recently published an article in The New Yorker about Scientology. \u201cOh, I read that,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI found it most intriguing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when did you start reading The New Yorker?\u201d Rosalynn asked.\n\n\u201cI read it every week!\u201d he protested.\n\nRosalynn rolled her eyes. It was as if she had leapt onstage. Dramatically, I needed someone who could talk to Carter with the unvarnished candor and the unsparing insight that comes from a lifetime spent together. Rosalynn was born in Plains, and her family lived next door to the house where the Carter family then lived, though she and Jimmy didn\u2019t become romantically involved until 1945, when he came home for the summer from the United States Naval Academy, in Annapolis. After their first date, he told his mother that he was going to marry Rosalynn. They were wed the following year, after his graduation. He was twenty-one and she was eighteen.\n\nCarter owned a stand of pines, which were being harvested, so we rode out in a Secret Service Tahoe to watch the trees being cut, trimmed, and loaded onto a flatbed truck. The agent driving the car was new and unfamiliar with the back roads. Carter was testy and snapped at him when he missed a turn. I felt sympathy for the agent, who had signed up to protect his country and found himself driving down on a dirt road, answering to an impatient old man who had once been the most powerful figure in the world and had since become the closest approximation in public life to an American saint. Along the way, Carter gave us a drive-by tour of his childhood home, which is now a historic site, the Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm, in the small community of Archery, three miles west of Plains, where his family moved when he was four. \u201cThis is where I learned blacksmithing. This is the barn where I used to corral mules,\u201d he said, not bothering to get out of the car. There was a dirt tennis court that his father had built. \u201cI could beat every kid in town, but I never beat my father,\u201d Carter told us.\n\nThe Carters were the only white family in Archery, and his playmates were the children of Black tenant farmers. The lessons he drew from his background in southern Georgia would define his political career. He lost his first run for governor, in 1966, to Lester Maddox, one of the most racist figures in modern Georgia history. That defeat sent him into a spiritual crisis, and he later credited his experience of being \u201cborn again\u201d for getting him through this bleak period. In his gubernatorial inaugural address, in 1971, Carter said, \u201cI say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over.\u201d In the South at that time, the declaration was a landmark, and it got him on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nCarter made a point of showing me the family cemetery\u2014a dirt patch surrounded by a hurricane fence. His people had been in the area since the early nineteenth century, and the tombstones were worn and covered in lichen. He was clearly proud of how tidy the ground was, having cleared it himself, nearly stepping on a rattlesnake in the process.\n\nWe passed a deserted farmhouse that Carter said was haunted. \u201cBy what?\u201d I asked. \u201cHaints,\u201d Carter said, using an old Southern term for ghosts. He said that, as a boy, when he was working in town or staying late at school after dark, he was terrified of walking past the house. Several times, he thought he saw a haint in the window, \u201ca woman with a lamp.\u201d There was a legend that a woman who once lived there kept her daughter in the attic, he told me. \u201cMaybe that was her.\u201d\n\nWhen we got back to the house, the Carters decided that we should all go into town for dinner\u2014i.e., lunch\u2014at Mom\u2019s Kitchen. The Carters rode in the Tahoe, and Rafshoon and I drove with Mary Prince, an African American woman who had worked for the Carters for decades. Prince had been convicted of murder following the shooting of a man outside a bar in Lumpkin, Georgia, in 1970. When the Carters lived in the Governor\u2019s Mansion, she was assigned there as a trusty prisoner, and worked as a nanny to their daughter, Amy. During Carter\u2019s Presidency, he arranged to be designated as Prince\u2019s parole officer, so that she could work in the White House. She was eventually declared innocent of the murder and was granted a full pardon.\n\nMom\u2019s turned out to be an all-you-can-eat buffet serving fried chicken, meat loaf, and collard greens. We talked a bit about politics and the 2012 election. Carter had his differences with President Barack Obama but thought that he would be re\u00eblected. Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, had just jumped into the race as an early favorite. Carter thought he had no chance of winning, but, if he did, \u201cit may be a disaster for the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Rosalynn observed, \u201cwe thought the same about Reagan.\u201d\n\nI was still intrigued by Carter\u2019s paranormal experiences, so I asked him about a time in the nineteen-sixties when he said he saw a U.F.O. He was the head of several Lions Clubs in Georgia, and had gone to make a speech at a club in another town. \u201cThere were about twenty-five other men standing outside,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was a light over the trees, at first no bigger than a star, then like a moon, then it hovered over the trees. It was big and round. Then it moved away.\u201d\n\nI said that I had once seen something similar, while driving through Alabama. An astronomer friend had said it was a \u201cnoctilucent cloud,\u201d a mysterious phenomenon which, at the time, was common enough to have acquired a name but still defied understanding. It was shaped like a perfect globe and appeared solid, like a hovering moon, until it slowly dissolved.\n\n\u201cSomething else strange did happen, while I was President,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe had a plane go down in Zaire with some important documents. We searched for it. We adjusted our satellites to comb through the area, without success. Finally, my director of intelligence, Stansfield Turner, said he knew of a psychic in California. Apparently, he spoke to her, and she wrote down some co\u00f6rdinates. And we programmed that into the satellite, and, the next time it passed over, there was the plane.\u201d \u201cThat tells me a lot about the intelligence community,\u201d I said. \u201cIndeed,\u201d Carter said. \u201cOne of our few successes.\u201d\n\nIn 1973, when Carter was still governor, he and Rosalynn journeyed to Israel. It was both a spiritual and a political pilgrimage. Golda Meir was the Prime Minister, and, as a courtesy, she accorded the Georgia governor and his wife an old Mercedes and a driver to ferry them around the Holy Land. The trip to Israel fortified Carter\u2019s international portfolio and awarded him credibility among American Jews, a critical Democratic constituency for the improbable race that he was considering. The Carters also visited several Jewish settlements on the West Bank, which he concluded posed a significant obstacle to peace. He was profoundly moved by Israel\u2019s struggle, and on his first day in the Oval Office, in January, 1977, he stunned his Vice-President, Walter Mondale, by saying that his first priority was to bring peace to the Middle East. Carter later told me that he believed God had put him into the Presidency for that very reason."

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "By Melissa Tribelhorn\n\nCEO/Executive Director, NWABR\n\nAs the Executive Director of the Northwest Association for Biomedical Research (NWABR), I have the privilege of working at the intersection of scientific discovery, ethics, and public trust. In the Pacific Northwest, we are home to some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge research institutions, where innovation and ethical responsibility go hand in hand. Nowhere is this more evident than in the burgeoning field of AI-driven tools in healthcare and biomedical research.\n\nWe recently hosted a panel on science and innovation. The October 7, 2024, NWABR event focused on addressing clinical research and the path to drug discovery. This pivotal half-day session of panel dialogues was designed to educate the public, policymakers, and key stakeholders about the essential support required to sustain the biomedical research community.\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force in healthcare, accelerating drug discovery, improving diagnostics, and creating new pathways for personalized medicine. But as with any groundbreaking technology, it brings with it a host of ethical questions and challenges. How do we ensure that AI is used responsibly, transparently, and in a way that promotes health equity? How can we guarantee that the benefits of AI reach all patients, not just those with the most access to advanced care?\n\nAt NWABR, we see AI not only as a tool for advancing the science of discovery but also as a catalyst for fostering greater public trust in biomedical research. The Pacific Northwest\u2019s research community was built on a foundation of integrity, transparency, and a deep commitment to ethical research. As AI reshapes the landscape of medicine, we remain committed to upholding these values, ensuring that this technology is developed and used in ways that prioritize patient welfare and public trust.\n\nBuilding Trust Through Ethical AI\n\nOne of the most critical questions surrounding AI in healthcare is: how do we ensure the technology works for everyone? AI models often rely on vast amounts of data to make predictions, but without diverse, representative datasets, these models can inadvertently reinforce existing health disparities. For AI to truly drive health equity, it must be trained on data that reflects the diversity of the populations it serves. This is a key point of emphasis in our work at NWABR, where we promote ethical standards that demand inclusivity in research practices.\n\nWhen AI tools are used for diagnostics, such as detecting early signs of diseases like cancer or diabetic retinopathy, we must ensure they are accurate across all demographic groups. A model that works well for one population but fails for another does not serve the core mission of improving public health. It is essential that AI is developed with transparency and a commitment to addressing potential biases.\n\nCollaboration: A Key to Ethical Innovation\n\nTo navigate these challenges, NWABR fosters collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders. We believe that by working together, we can create AI solutions that are both innovative and equitable. This collaboration extends beyond the scientific community to include patients and the public, whose voices are crucial in shaping the ethical use of new technologies.\n\nAt NWABR, we are dedicated to educating the public about the ethical use of AI in healthcare. Through open dialogue, we strive to demystify the technology and build a shared understanding of its potential\u2014and its limitations. By bringing transparency to the forefront of these discussions, we help bridge the gap between scientific innovation and public trust.\n\nA Future of Ethical Innovation\n\nThe future of AI in healthcare is incredibly promising. It has the potential to revolutionize how we treat diseases, improve patient outcomes, and address some of the most pressing health challenges of our time. But as we move forward, we must do so with care. AI\u2019s power to shape the future of healthcare is immense, but it must be guided by a commitment to ethical conduct, transparency, and inclusivity.\n\nAt NWABR, we envision a future where the public not only trusts AI-driven innovations but recognizes their essential role in improving health outcomes for all. We will continue to lead the charge in promoting the ethical use of AI in biomedical research, ensuring that this transformative technology is developed with the highest standards of integrity.\n\nThrough ongoing collaboration, education, and a steadfast commitment to ethical principles, we can ensure that AI-driven healthcare fulfills its promise\u2014advancing science while upholding the values that define our biomedical community.\n\nFor more info about the NWABR, click here.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE : Sponsored Posts like this are paid, \u201cNative Advertisements\u201d that help businesses and organizations improve their internet presence and all-important SEO.

            "article_content": "A new artificial intelligence (AI) model has just achieved human-level results on a test designed to measure \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d.\n\nOn December 20, OpenAI\u2019s o3 system scored 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, well above the previous AI best score of 55% and on par with the average human score. It also scored well on a very difficult mathematics test.\n\nCreating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is the stated goal of all the major AI research labs. At first glance, OpenAI appears to have at least made a significant step towards this goal.\n\nWhile scepticism remains, many AI researchers and developers feel something just changed. For many, the prospect of AGI now seems more real, urgent and closer than anticipated. Are they right?\n\nGeneralisation and intelligence\n\nTo understand what the o3 result means, you need to understand what the ARC-AGI test is all about. In technical terms, it\u2019s a test of an AI system\u2019s \u201csample efficiency\u201d in adapting to something new \u2013 how many examples of a novel situation the system needs to see to figure out how it works.\n\nAn AI system like ChatGPT (GPT-4) is not very sample efficient. It was \u201ctrained\u201d on millions of examples of human text, constructing probabilistic \u201crules\u201d about which combinations of words are most likely.\n\nThe result is pretty good at common tasks. It is bad at uncommon tasks, because it has less data (fewer samples) about those tasks.\n\nUntil AI systems can learn from small numbers of examples and adapt with more sample efficiency, they will only be used for very repetitive jobs and ones where the occasional failure is tolerable.\n\nThe ability to accurately solve previously unknown or novel problems from limited samples of data is known as the capacity to generalise. It is widely considered a necessary, even fundamental, element of intelligence.\n\nGrids and patterns\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark tests for sample efficient adaptation using little grid square problems like the one below. The AI needs to figure out the pattern that turns the grid on the left into the grid on the right.\n\nEach question gives three examples to learn from. The AI system then needs to figure out the rules that \u201cgeneralise\u201d from the three examples to the fourth.\n\nThese are a lot like the IQ tests sometimes you might remember from school.\n\nWeak rules and adaptation\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how OpenAI has done it, but the results suggest the o3 model is highly adaptable. From just a few examples, it finds rules that can be generalised.\n\nTo figure out a pattern, we shouldn\u2019t make any unnecessary assumptions, or be more specific than we really have to be. In theory, if you can identify the \u201cweakest\u201d rules that do what you want, then you have maximised your ability to adapt to new situations.\n\nWhat do we mean by the weakest rules? The technical definition is complicated, but weaker rules are usually ones that can be described in simpler statements.\n\nIn the example above, a plain English expression of the rule might be something like: \u201cAny shape with a protruding line will move to the end of that line and \u2018cover up\u2019 any other shapes it overlaps with.\u201d\n\nSearching chains of thought?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know how OpenAI achieved this result just yet, it seems unlikely they deliberately optimised the o3 system to find weak rules. However, to succeed at the ARC-AGI tasks it must be finding them.\n\nWe do know that OpenAI started with a general-purpose version of the o3 model (which differs from most other models, because it can spend more time \u201cthinking\u201d about difficult questions) and then trained it specifically for the ARC-AGI test.\n\nFrench AI researcher Francois Chollet, who designed the benchmark, believes o3 searches through different \u201cchains of thought\u201d describing steps to solve the task. It would then choose the \u201cbest\u201d according to some loosely defined rule, or \u201cheuristic\u201d.\n\nThis would be \u201cnot dissimilar\u201d to how Google\u2019s AlphaGo system searched through different possible sequences of moves to beat the world Go champion.\n\nYou can think of these chains of thought like programs that fit the examples. Of course, if it is like the Go-playing AI, then it needs a heuristic, or loose rule, to decide which program is best.\n\nThere could be thousands of different seemingly equally valid programs generated. That heuristic could be \u201cchoose the weakest\u201d or \u201cchoose the simplest\u201d.\n\nHowever, if it is like AlphaGo then they simply had an AI create a heuristic. This was the process for AlphaGo. Google trained a model to rate different sequences of moves as better or worse than others.\n\nWhat we still don\u2019t know\n\nThe question then is, is this really closer to AGI? If that is how o3 works, then the underlying model might not be much better than previous models.\n\nThe concepts the model learns from language might not be any more suitable for generalisation than before. Instead, we may just be seeing a more generalisable \u201cchain of thought\u201d found through the extra steps of training a heuristic specialised to this test. The proof, as always, will be in the pudding.\n\nAlmost everything about o3 remains unknown. OpenAI has limited disclosure to a few media presentations and early testing to a handful of researchers, laboratories and AI safety institutions.\n\nTruly understanding the potential of o3 will require extensive work, including evaluations, an understanding of the distribution of its capacities, how often it fails and how often it succeeds.\n\nWhen o3 is finally released, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of whether it is approximately as adaptable as an average human.\n\nIf so, it could have a huge, revolutionary, economic impact, ushering in a new era of self-improving accelerated intelligence. We will require new benchmarks for AGI itself and serious consideration of how it ought to be governed.\n\nIf not, then this will still be an impressive result. However, everyday life will remain much the same.\n\nMichael Timothy Bennett, PhD Student, School of Computing, Australian National University and Elija Perrier, Research Fellow, Stanford Center for Responsible Quantum Technology, Stanford University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "OpenAI has outlined plans to revamp its structure, saying it would create a public benefit corporation to make it easier to \"raise more capital than we'd imagined,\" and remove the restrictions imposed on the startup by its current nonprofit parent.\n\nThe acknowledgement and detailed rationale behind its high-profile restructuring confirmed a Reuters report in September, which sparked debate among corporate watchdogs and tech moguls including Elon Musk.\n\nAt issue were the implications such a move might have on whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and how the company would strike a balance between making a profit and generating social and public good as it develops AI.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the ChatGPT maker's existing for-profit arm would become a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC) - a structure designed to consider the interests of society in addition to shareholder value.\n\nOpenAI has been looking to make changes to attract further investment, as the expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses human intelligence, heats up.\n\nIts latest $6.6 billion funding round at a valuation of $157 billion was contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker could upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors within two years, Reuters reported in October.\n\nThe nonprofit, meanwhile, will have a \"significant interest\" in the PBC in the form of shares as determined by independent financial advisers, OpenAI said in a blog post, adding that it would be one of the \"best resourced nonprofits in history.\"\n\nOpenAI started in 2015 as a research-focused nonprofit but created a for-profit unit four years later to secure funding for the high costs of AI development.\n\nIts unusual structure gave control of the for-profit unit to the nonprofit and was in focus last year when Sam Altman was fired as CEO only to return days later after employees rebelled.\n\n\"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness,\" the Microsoft-backed startup said.\n\n\"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\"\n\nIts plans to create a PBC would align the startup with rivals such as Anthropic and the Musk-owned xAI, which use a similar structure and recently raised billions in funding.\n\nAnthropic garnered another $4 billion investment from existing investor Amazon.com last month, while xAI raised around $6 billion in equity financing earlier in December.\n\n\"The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business,'\" DA Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.\n\n\"This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,\" Luria said, although he added that the move did \"not necessitate OpenAI going public.\"\n\nThe startup could, however, face some hurdles in the plan.\n\nMusk, an OpenAI co-founder who later left and is now one of the startup's most vocal critics, is trying to stop the plan and in August sued OpenAI and Altman.\n\nMusk alleges that OpenAI violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI.\n\nOpenAI earlier this month asked a federal judge to reject Musk's request and published a trove of messages with Musk to argue that he initially backed for-profit status for OpenAI before walking away from the company after failing to gain a majority equity stake and full control.\n\nMeta Platforms is also urging California's attorney general to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nBecoming a benefit corporation does not guarantee in and of itself that a company will put its stated mission above profit, as that status legally requires only that the company's board \"balance\" its mission and profit-making concerns, said Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane Law School.\n\n\"The only reason to choose benefit form over any other corporate form is the declaration to the public,\" she said. \"It doesn't actually have any real enforcement power behind it,\" she said.\n\nIn practice, it is the shareholders who own a controlling stake in the company who dictate how closely a public benefit company sticks to its mission, Lipton said."

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

            "article_content": "For anyone living under a social media rock, #vanlife has become one of the biggest viral trends of the last few years.\n\nTaking off during the pandemic, on TikTok the hashtag has been viewed more than 12 billion times, with a further 15 million posts on Instagram.\n\nThe nomadic way of life is popular with (mainly) young people, and preceded the 'underconsumption core' lifestyle.\n\nGolden sunsets, expansive beaches, fairy lights and romantic filters; living out of a van is as Instagram aesthetic as it gets (on the surface).\n\nBut what about living out of an electric car? Could that be the most eco and luxury van life possible? Or is the reality just a photo opportunity but a holiday to avoid?\n\nThis is Money\u2019s Freda Lewis-Stempel took a new Tesla Model Y with its own specially designed 'Air Mattress' and \u2018Camp Mode\u2019 to one of the remotest islands in the UK to find out....\n\nCan you really sleep in a Tesla? This is Money's Motoring Reporter Freda Lewis-Stempel puts the electric car version of the #vanlife trend to a very remote test....\n\nHow the Model Y is designed for 'van life' glamping?\n\nIt makes sense to first explain how Tesla has taken the American \u2018van life\u2019 idea and added special features to the Model Y SUV to make it double up as a home on wheels.\n\nTesla Air Mattress: This \u00a3200 blow-up mattress has been designed to fit the rear of the car perfectly when the back seats are folded down. Penned on tracing paper, it has the cutouts in precisely the correct places in order for it to sit flush to the floor around wheel arches and arm rests.\n\nIt pumps up almost instantly when connected to the car's 12V outlet in the boot.\n\nJust roll the air mattress out, plug the air pump into the 12V, slot the air pump nozzle into the air mattress intake, turn the air pump on and watch it inflate.\n\nAt this point you can decide to go full glamping \u2018boujee\u2019 and bring a sheet, pillows and duvet like we did, or you can go more pop-up tent style and just use a sleeping bag and inflatable pillow.\n\nTesla has a specially shaped Air Mattress for its Model Y SUV that inflates to turn the car into a bed for the night\n\nTesla's Camp Mode is another sleeping-friendly feature that keeps the cabin at the perfect temperature overnight to make sure you don't get too hot or cold\n\nCamp Mode: Sort of genius from Tesla, Camp Mode maintains the optimum temperature and airflow within the cabin while you sleep so you don\u2019t wake up freezing cold or boiling hot in the middle of the night.\n\nIt also maintains the lighting setup you want or even music or a podcast if that helps you sleep.\n\nThere's even a Camp Profile which remembers your preferences and sets them automatically when you want to conk out for the night.\n\nTo enter Camp Mode, just tap the temperature menu icon on the bottom of the screen and select Camp (or use the Tesla app).\n\nSentry Mode, auto lock and the Model Y\u2019s alarm system are all disabled with Camp Mode so the alarm doesn\u2019t go off every time you exist - just remember to lock the car yourself while you sleep!\n\nWhy Scotland? Scotland is popular for wild camping because of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, which gives everyone the right to access Scotland's outdoor spaces. You can park and camp by the side of the road as long as you aren't blocking access or parked dangerously. The Outdoor Access Code does stipulate you should camp away from roads, but campervans frequently park in larger lay-bys. As some of the most remote and dramatic countryside in the UK, especially on the islands, Scotland is also a brilliant place to put EV charging and range anxiety to the test too.\n\nDay 1/night 1: Regrettable decision? It can only get better...\n\nMy plucky school friend and I left London at around 5.30pm to drive up to the Peak District.\n\nIt was all going swimmingly, cruising up the M6 in the warm, extremely comfortable and smooth Model Y.\n\nThough I tend to find Teslas a bit clinical (or 'spaceship-y', as my friend said) for long journeys, their performance is undeniably strong.\n\nThe space, comfort, and how Teslas hold their range makes driving for hours minimum effort, and the Y was no different.\n\nDeciding to charge at the Superchargers near Stoke-on-Trent - because we didn't know how much range Camp Mode would use overnight - we snuck in the back door of a restaurant nearby to use the loo to brush our teeth and get ready for 'bed\u2019.\n\nThere were a few funny looks as we set the air mattress up for the night at the Superchargers (so we didn\u2019t have to figure it out for the first time in the middle of nowhere in the pitch-black Peaks), but it was very easy to set up.\n\nWhile the Y finished charging, we used the Theatre function - which has Netflix, YouTube, Hulu etc - to watch the different Christmas adverts on the touchscreen; Waitrose\u2019s \u2018who dunnit\u2019 was of course the clear winner.\n\nThanks to Tesla's Theatre suite we could watch all the Christmas adverts on YouTube while the car charged\n\nBrushing your teeth and washing your face in a restaurant loo near a Tesla Supercharger is the glamorous reality of Tesla living\n\nThen we drove off in search of our sleeping spot in the wild for the night.\n\nWe\u2019d pre-selected a place using the Park4night app, but driving up to a lay-by under a remote bridge and encountering just one guy and his camper van we got the heebie-jeebies and decided to find an alternative.\n\nThe only other option nearby was a lay-by/field gate entrance, and (after accidentally driving through someone\u2019s farmyard) we decided this was the best of two rather unappealing options, as it was already almost midnight.\n\nOff to bed (a bed that was as steep as Everest because the parking spot was on a sharp incline) I awoke just over four hours later at 4.55am.\n\nMy friend had seemingly disappeared. In a bleary state, I thought she'd been abducted, but thankfully she\u2019d just moved to the front seat to try and sleep.\n\nTurning the headlights on, we had a near heart attack (my second in 10 minutes) when they picked up a Land Rover Discovery that had silently turned up sometime between 12.40 and 4.55am.\n\nConvincing ourselves we weren\u2019t going to end up as front page horror story news, we tried to get back to sleep.\n\nIt was at this point we learnt two valuable EV glamping lessons: never park on an incline and an overinflated Air Mattress is, as I ruefully summarised, like sleeping on a slab of rock.\n\nWaking up in Leek in Staffordshire wasn't the most picturesque first wake up in the Tesla I'd envisioned as the beautiful countryside was hidden in fog and we'd had 4 hours of sleep each\n\nI failed to fall back to sleep, but my friend did, so I watched a very cold and wet dawn creep in through the windows and panoramic sunroof.\n\nI also watched two other cars come and go \u2013 one of which was a hunter\u2019s van containing three Hound of the Baskervilles-sized hunting dogs.\n\nIn the end, my friend and I ended up getting four hours sleep each.\n\nIt wasn't a great way to kick-off but thanks to the Camp Mode we were at least nice and warm. And, as only a year before we'd spent a night in the Peaks in minus five degrees on top a Jeep Wrangler in a Tentbox, we knew how absolutely brutal car 'glamping' really can be in cold weather.\n\nGoing for a brisk wake-up walk around 8am, we packed down the Air Mattress and set off for our pre-Scotland charging and feed stop at Tebay.\n\nDay 2/night 2: How much difference a day can make\n\nThe Tebay pit stop seriously perked us both up.\n\nThe car had a full charge on the Superchargers - we were charging to 100 per cent, which isn't as good for the battery as charging to 80 per cent but it's sensible for wilderness camping to have maximum range - while I managed a nap.\n\nThe nap was followed by a shower (you swap your car key for the shower key at Tebay and it\u2019s free to use), and we both scoffed full English breakfasts.\n\nThen it was back into the car for another three hours of driving up to Edinburgh for an afternoon 'city break'.\n\nThe roads were opening up and the scenery became road trip goals - in my opinion the best motorway driving in the UK is the Cumbria-Borders stretch - and everything was looking up.\n\nEdinburgh was a chance to get some steps and movement in, and a bit of big city excitement before the total and utter isolation that the next sleeping spot would bring.\n\nWe'd pre-planned to sleep in a very remote valley between Edinburgh and the Ardrossan ferry terminal where we had a 9am ferry to catch the next morning.\n\nI wanted to try Edinburgh public charging because it has a bad reputation, and although I did manage to find a charger, for a capital city Edinburgh charging has some way to go\n\nWe drove for about three hours to walk around Edinburgh and find some hot food before our next lay-by camp\n\nI also wanted to test Edinburgh's EV charging infrastructure because it has a bad reputation for being underprovided.\n\nIn reality this is unfortunately true - considering it\u2019s the capital of Scotland the charging options are pretty slim.\n\nWe weren\u2019t fussy and didn\u2019t mind what speed we charged, but that didn't really help. There weren't many chargers and almost all of them were in use.\n\nAnd unlike London, Edinburgh doesn't have lots of lamppost chargers, so all the on-street chargers are taken by residents.\n\nWe did, however, find one fast charger near George Street, so we walked around Edinburgh and had some hot food while the Model Y slow charged back up to 100 per cent.\n\nAt around 6pm we drove off to find our next Park4night place.\n\nThe second night camping location was the stuff of Instagram posts - although murky weather the remote Scottish hills were beautiful and it felt safe which led to a great nights' sleep\n\nThe Model Y has massive windows and a huge panoramic roof so you get 360 views when you wake up\n\nThis time we wanted the spot to be as isolated as possible, and we found it; a single-track road about 30 minutes from the coast without a soul in sight. Not a star, not an animal \u2013 nothing. And it felt so much safer.\n\nI should explain that my school friend and I both grew up in very remote parts of Herefordshire and Shropshire so having no-one around feels safer to us than having people nearby, but over people might entirely disagree with this logic.\n\nFeeling far more secure than night one allowed us to relax into our bedtime camping 'routine' (i.e. cleaning our teeth with water from a bottle).\n\nAnd we got the bed blowing-up level right this time, which meant the Air Mattress went from being a slab of rock to incredibly comfortable.\n\nWhile we could use the Tesla Model Y's Theatre mode again, part of the relaxation of camping is winding down reading a book\n\nThen we got the Camp Mode temperature perfect, read our books and drifted off to sleep in our very cosy hotel on wheels. We slept like logs.\n\nI woke about 6am to a glorious stormy Scottish dawn sky, and an empty valley of mountains.\n\nIt was everything I\u2019d thought Tesla living would be. And the night became an amusing memory.\n\nDay three/night three: Tesla living on the Isle of Arran - as good as glamping gets\n\nScotland has 'right-to-access' laws so it's much easier to camp in a car in Scotland than England. A place as remote as the Isle of Arran is a real test for glamping in an EV\n\nStarting off at 7.20am to drive 20 minutes for an ultra-rapid top-up before we boarded the Ardrossan car ferry, we pulled up at the InstaVolt chargers outside Stevenston McDonalds. Who doesn't love a retail park and a Maccies hash brown before 8am?\n\nThe loos gave us the chance to brush our teeth and clean our faces while the car went from around 80 to 100 per cent charge - after all, glamping is all about glamour.\n\nThe Model Y Long Range AWD has a range of 373 miles which gives you around 330/340 real world range.\n\nWe didn't actually need to be at 100 per cent before going across to the Isle of Arran - which is only 56 miles in circumference - but, while there are a few chargers in the 'capital' of Arran (Brodrick), ZapMap said they only take RFID cards so we played it very over safe.\n\nWe put the car on some Instavolt ultra-rapid chargers near the ferry port before we boarded\n\nWhile living out of a Tesla you have to find food and washing facilities wherever you can, and sometimes it's McDonalds or nothing (even at 8am)\n\nSentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app\n\nBoarding the Ardrossan ferry, we were in excellent EV company with the four cars nearest us all being EVs. Clearly range anxiety isn't a thing in the Scottish Isles.\n\nDuring the 55 minute crossing, Sentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app in general.\n\nI felt very smug knowing that the none of the many car alarms going off belonged to the Model Y because the Tesla app hadn't alerted me to any issues.\n\nWe also had far too much fun watching ourselves on the Sentry Mode cameras disembarking the ferry as we sat waiting for the cars in front to drive off.\n\nFor the rest of the day we drove around Arran, enjoying the freedom of the car and lack of time restraints, like hotel check-ins, and simply let nature lead us. We went for a walk, swam in the very cold sea, and watched the wildlife - Arran is famous for its seals.\n\nThe Isle of Arran only has four public chargers and you can only get a ferry to the mainland: There are three in Brodrick and one near Blackwaterfoot so you can really test range anxiety\n\nDriving around the Isle of Arran with no check-in times to abide by we could enjoy the scenery and outdoor pursuits to our own schedule\n\nTesla's cabin pre-conditioning feature on the app was also a godsend for when we wanted to come back to a warm car and heated seats and steering wheel after a freezing dip.\n\nWhile our day activities were quite messy, the Tesla and its vegan seats were very easy to keep clean.\n\nAs a living in a car goes it was remarkably easy to stay tidy and the vast storage throughout meant we were never short of space for our stuff.\n\nThe Model Y has 854 litres of boot space as well as a 117-litre frunk: more than enough space for all our 'glamping' stuff and the front trunk became a designated space for wet swimming costumes, towels and muddy boats.\n\nThe hooks above the passenger doors were also useful to hang our clothes to dry.\n\nThe Tesla has lots of space, and it was very easy to keep clean. Even if we left the bed in place, we still had plenty of space for our bags and the frunk meant we could separate wet clothes\n\nAlthough the Model Y has bi-directional charging (where you can power appliances from the car), we didn't take a kettle or camping chairs mainly because, without an awning or a settled camping spot, sitting outside in the bracing Scottish winter wind didn't seem very appealing.\n\nWhile the car means you can go anywhere, anytime, playing everything by ear also has its downfalls: We drove to get dinner at 6pm on the far side of the island only to be told the restaurant was fully-booked.\n\nAlthough we did eventually manage to have a very early dinner at a hotel near Brodrick, the Tesla glamping lesson of the day here would be to at least pre-book your meal reservations, especially if it's out of season.\n\nParked up against the sea, Tesla camping on the Isle of Arran is truly an amazing experience\n\nDuring the afternoon, we'd driven from the north west of Arran across to the north east and had passed many a lovely, big, isolated lay-by, noting a few that we'd be happy to park for the night in (frankly we were spoilt for choice on Arran).\n\nAmusingly (or mildly concerningly depending how you look at it), I'd turned to my friend as I eyed up one particular lay-by (the one we ended up choosing) and said; 'I'll never look at a lay-by the same way again'. She said she'd been thinking the exact same thing.\n\nIn the space of a few nights, Tesla camping had changed us - we'd become discerning connoisseurs of lay-bys. I will forever look at scenic lay-by and think 'that looks like a very nice place to spend the night in an EV'.\n\nIn the end, we chose one glorious lay-by near the sea, and with our glamping night routine down to a T, we settled in for our last sleep.\n\nWe watched Netflix's Nobody Wants This from our Air Mattress bed, thoroughly enjoying the Model Y mobile cinema offered to modern day EV nomads, and the brooding backdrop of the dark Scottish hills.\n\nWaiting to board the ferry back to mainland UK: Is Tesla glamping for the fainthearted? No. But is it a fantastic adventure? Yes.\n\nIt felt sad to say goodbye to our house on wheels on the drive home as we'd become quite attached\n\nThe next morning, after we had one last cold sea swim before boarding the ferry to begin our drive back to London, we both agreed we'd happily spend another three nights sleeping in the Tesla.\n\nLiving out of one? No. Glamping out of one again? Without a doubt.\n\nJust make sure your friends are up for an adventure and aren't at all precious..."

And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments.

            "article_content": "In What Ways Does AI Contribute to Startup Scalability?\n\nUnlock the secrets of how AI accelerates startup growth with in-depth analysis and insights from industry experts. Delve into the transformative power of AI across various business functions, from enhancing customer support to optimizing operational efficiency. This article sheds light on the pivotal role AI plays in driving scalability and innovation in today\u2019s competitive startup landscape.\n\nAI Automates Customer Support\n\nAI technologies contribute to the scalability of startups by automating repetitive tasks and enabling smarter decision-making, freeing up resources to focus on growth and innovation. One great example is the use of AI-powered customer support tools like chatbots.\n\nTake Intercom, for instance. By integrating AI-driven bots, startups can handle thousands of customer queries simultaneously without scaling their human support teams at the same pace. These bots use natural language processing to resolve common issues instantly or route more complex problems to the right person, ensuring efficient service while reducing operational costs.\n\nThis approach not only scales customer interactions as the startup grows but also gathers valuable data from these interactions, providing insights to refine products or services.\n\nChris Raulf, International AI and SEO Expert | Founder & President, Boulder SEO Marketing\n\nAI Revolutionizes Hiring Processes\n\nAI revolutionizes hiring processes, enabling startups to scale teams with unmatched speed and accuracy. It can analyze thousands of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, assess candidates, and predict cultural fit seamlessly. This ensures that scaling a workforce doesn\u2019t compromise the quality or diversity of hires. AI also reduces onboarding times by automating training modules tailored to individual roles effectively. Startups grow faster when talent acquisition becomes an AI-powered strategic advantage.\n\nWhen developing Toggl Hire, AI helped us create smarter candidate assessments tailored to skills. By analyzing test results, the system predicts a candidate\u2019s success probability for specific roles accurately. This reduced hiring times for startups using Toggl Hire, helping them scale teams quicker. The scalability of the tool itself brought exponential growth to our user base globally. It\u2019s proof of how AI-powered innovation fuels business expansion directly.\n\nAlari Aho, CEO and Founder, Toggl Inc\n\nAI Transforms Recruitment at X0PA\n\nAI has completely transformed how we approach scaling in recruitment at X0PA. By tapping into a pool of 250 million profiles worldwide, we enable companies to discover top talent even before a single job post goes live. Our AI doesn\u2019t stop at access-it curates profiles across LinkedIn and all major job boards, delivering a shortlist of only the most relevant candidates. This approach has saved recruiters over 100,000 days of manual effort, letting them focus on meaningful interactions instead of administrative tasks. Scaling with precision, speed, and reach is how we redefine modern recruitment.\n\nNina Alag Suri, CEO, XOPA AI\n\nAI Boosts Productivity and Efficiency\n\nThe biggest contribution of AI integration, whether in startups or established industries, lies in its ability to boost productivity and efficiency. Tasks that once took ten steps can now be completed in 5 or even 3, empowering employees to multitask without compromising focus\u2014a game-changer for startups.\n\nIn our case, integrating an AI chatbot for our real estate MLS website, The Canadian Home, was one of our best and most profitable decisions. As many of our users are first-time homebuyers, they naturally have countless questions. Initially, our customer support team was overwhelmed by the repetitive inquiries, making it hard to manage effectively. The AI chatbot now handles basic questions instantly, filtering out more straightforward queries and allowing our team to focus on more complex issues. This not only boosted efficiency but also increased conversions.\n\nAI is already transforming industries worldwide, and its role will only grow in the future. Adapting to these advancements is not just smart, it\u2019s essential.\n\nRobin Cherian, CEO, The Canadian Home\n\nAI Enhances Fraud Detection\n\nIn my experience, it enhances fraud detection for fintech startups. AI algorithms can quickly identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate potential fraudulent activity. AI-driven fraud detection systems like Feedzai or Kount analyze transactional data to identify suspicious activities. This saves time and resources for startups.\n\nA payments startup scaled safely by using AI to monitor real-time transactions, reducing fraud rates and building customer trust without deploying a large fraud investigation team. According to Feedzai, their technology helped the startup increase revenue by 30% and save $1.5 million in fraud losses within a year.\n\nI would point out that AI technologies help with fraud detection and assist in automating processes for startups. Many administrative tasks can be time-consuming and costly for startups, especially as they grow and onboard more customers or clients. AI-powered chatbots can handle common customer inquiries and support requests without the need for constant manual input from human employees.\n\nKevin Baragona, Founder @ DeepAI, Deep AI\n\nAI Improves Lead Qualification\n\nAI technologies help startups scale by automating repetitive tasks and providing insights that guide smarter decision-making. Startups often face limited resources, and AI allows teams to focus on high-value activities instead of getting stuck in operational bottlenecks.\n\nWe integrated AI into lead qualification. Instead of manually sorting and scoring leads, the AI models analyzed patterns from past sales data to prioritize prospects most likely to convert. This change reduced time spent on low-quality leads by 50 percent and allowed the sales team to focus on building relationships. Within six months, we saw a 30 percent increase in pipeline velocity.\n\nV. Frank Sondors, Founder, Salesforge AI\n\nAI Enhances Content Services\n\nOur development of AI-enhanced content services revealed a crucial insight about startup scaling.\n\nCombining AI efficiency with human expertise revolutionized our production capacity. Our HOTH AI Content Plus service slashed content creation time by 60% while maintaining quality standards. This breakthrough lets startups produce consistent, SEO-optimized content at scale without draining resources.\n\nNumbers tell the scaling story. By integrating AI into our content workflow, we\u2019ve helped startups produce in one month what used to take six months. The freed-up resources let them focus on growth strategies instead of content creation bottlenecks.\n\nSuccess in scaling requires strategic AI adoption. We found that using AI to handle initial drafts while keeping human editors for refinement creates the perfect balance. This model lets startups maintain quality while scaling operations \u2013 a winning formula I\u2019ve seen work across our 200,000+ client base.\n\nMy advice for startups: Start with one core process that directly impacts growth. Let AI handle repetitive tasks while your team focuses on strategy and creativity.\n\nMarc Hardgrove, CEO, The Hoth\n\nAI Empowers Efficient Scaling\n\nAI technologies empower startups to scale efficiently by automating repetitive tasks and delivering data-driven insights that enhance decision-making. For instance, integrating AI-powered chatbots in customer support allows startups to handle thousands of queries simultaneously, reducing the need for large support teams while ensuring 24/7 service. One example is a SaaS startup I worked with that implemented an AI-based lead-scoring system, which prioritized high-quality leads for the sales team. This not only increased conversion rates but also optimized resource allocation, enabling the business to scale its sales operations rapidly without proportionally increasing costs.\n\nJayanti Katariya, CEO, Moon Invoice\n\nAI Streamlines Customer Support\n\nAs someone who specializes in AI, I can say with confidence that AI adoption can really be a game-changer for startups. AI has two main advantages: it\u2019s fast and cost-friendly. Anything that has to do with repetitive tasks can be automated with AI, saving the company tons of time and human effort. At the same time, the teams can then focus on more strategic tasks that require contextual understanding, which AI obviously lacks. This way the work is distributed between humans and AI according to the strengths of both. On top of that, tasks related to data collection and analysis can be performed even better by AI. It does it faster and more accurately because there\u2019s no risk of human error. As a result, a well-executed adoption of AI can significantly speed up operations and improve the quality of work.\n\nOne example of a very common, yet extremely effective AI implementation is AI chatbots. We\u2019ve integrated one on our website as well. It can totally improve your customer service without you needing to put extra hours or effort into it. Your clients have access to real-time support 24/7, which creates a better user journey and increases customer satisfaction, both of which contribute to conversions. The company, at the same time, can focus more on improving the core products and big picture strategizing.\n\nPavlo Tkhir, CTO at Euristiq, Euristiq\n\nAI Automates Feedback Process\n\nAI has been a game-changer for Brokee in scaling our platform effectively. One example is how we\u2019ve integrated AI to automate the feedback process for our technical assessments. Instead of hiring additional team members to manually review every submission, our AI-driven system evaluates candidates\u2019 performance, generates personalized feedback, and even suggests tailored follow-up questions for hiring managers.\n\nThis automation not only ensures consistency and fairness but also allows us to handle significantly more users without compromising quality. By removing the bottleneck of manual evaluation, we\u2019ve been able to onboard more companies and engineers simultaneously, supporting our growth and expanding our impact in the hiring space. AI has made scaling not just possible but seamless.\n\nMaksym Lushpenko, Founder, Brokee\n\nAI Levels the Playing Field\n\nAI technologies have been an amazing tool to level-set startups, especially given their low cost of implementation.\n\nnDash is a bootstrapped company that often competes with brands well-funded by VCs. Integrations like OpenAI\u2019s API have enabled us to offer similar services and features without the added cost of capital.\n\nMachine learning was once accessible only to a few companies and has since been all but commoditized. We can now run powerful computations against large datasets that were all but impossible a few years ago. The biggest challenge is now just identifying implementations of value to content marketers and dreaming up the user interface.\n\nMatt Solar, Cofounder & VP of Marketing, nDash Marketing\n\nAI Transforms Customer Support\n\nIn my role at Windsor Drake, I once worked with a startup struggling to scale its customer support as their user base expanded rapidly. They were overwhelmed with routine Level 1 inquiries, and hiring more staff to keep up was becoming unsustainable. To address this, they integrated an AI-driven chatbot alongside cutting-edge voice AI technology to handle Level 1 customer requests. The voice AI, in particular, delivered human-like interactions that customers found surprisingly natural and well-received.\n\nThe impact was transformative. By automating Level 1 support, the startup freed up significant resources to focus on Level 2 and Level 3 support, where human expertise and problem-solving were crucial. This allowed them to address complex customer issues faster, improve overall service quality, and strengthen client relationships without increasing operational costs.\n\nWhat stood out most was how capital-efficient this solution was. Startups often face tight budgets, and this AI integration allowed them to scale customer service without burning through resources. For software startups especially, where customer satisfaction can make or break growth, leveraging AI for customer support isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s becoming a competitive necessity. The combination of cost-efficiency, scalability, and customer approval makes this a game-changing development that startups should actively explore.\n\nJeff Barrington, Managing Director, Windsor Drake\n\nAI Increases Marketing Scalability\n\nThe integration of AI technologies has dramatically increased the scalability of startups, particularly in marketing. Where previously a five-person team might have been necessary, many tasks can now be efficiently handled by a single individual, thanks to AI-powered tools.\n\nThis shift is particularly impactful for bootstrapped businesses, as it allows them to scale more profitably with less need for large teams or significant investment. AI enables startups to operate lean while still achieving impressive results.\n\nA concrete example from my experience is in email marketing. We used AI tools like Claude.ai to craft highly optimized onboarding sequences aimed at converting sign-ups into active clients. This whole process took about 2 hours, whereas previously this would have taken weeks. The quality of the AI-generated content was exceptional, and it significantly boosted our conversion rate from 30% to 38%.\n\nThis is just one instance of how AI can drive tangible improvements. Similar efficiencies can be found across various marketing functions, from content creation to data analysis and campaign optimization.\n\nStartups can now achieve the output and quality of much larger teams, allowing them to compete more effectively and scale more rapidly without proportional increases in headcount or costs.\n\nTom Van den Heuvel, CMO, wetracked.io\n\nAI Enables Unbelievable Automation\n\nThere is nothing that has improved our ability to scale startups like AI. You can write a Python script for any task, we have MCP setups (Model Context Protocol) that can access apps and programs on your Mac/PC to perform a plethora of tasks. It\u2019s really unbelievable. You just think of what you want automated and AI will make it happen. Sam Altman of OpenAI says we may see the first billionaire solo entrepreneur due to AI. Exciting times.\n\nNader Jaber, Founder, FlyNumber\n\nAI Optimizes Operational Efficiency\n\nThe integration of AI technologies plays a pivotal role in enabling startups to scale by optimizing operational efficiency and fortifying cybersecurity measures. It can also be used to automate routine processes and proactively address potential challenges. For businesses, this means reducing manual workload, improving resource allocation, and ensuring a secure foundation for growth. AI also enhances real-time decision-making by providing actionable insights from data, which is critical for scaling operations effectively without overburdening resources.\n\nAt GO Technology Group, we worked with an industrial manufacturing client in Chicago to implement an AI-enhanced cybersecurity solution that monitored their network 24/7 for anomalies. This allowed the organization to detect and respond to threats in real time, preventing potential breaches and downtime. The integration of AI not only streamlined their security operations but also freed up IT staff to focus on strategic initiatives, demonstrating how AI-powered managed IT services can drive both scalability and resilience in startup environments.\n\nSteve Robinson, Senior Technical Manager, Go Technology Group\n\nAI Drives Adaptive Pricing Models\n\nOne way AI drives scalability is through adaptive pricing models. I\u2019m not strictly talking about automating price changes but using AI to dynamically respond to market conditions, customer behavior, and inventory levels in real time, creating a competitive edge that startups often overlook.\n\nFor example, I worked with a SaaS startup that used AI to analyze customer segments, competitors\u2019 pricing, and seasonal demand patterns. Other than optimizing pricing for revenue, the system adapted to prioritize user acquisition in low-demand periods while maximizing revenue during peak times.\n\nDuring a major product launch, the AI model identified that a slightly lower introductory price for one user segment (freelancers) drove a 25% higher conversion rate while maintaining profitability because of the predicted long-term subscription retention. For larger enterprise clients, the AI suggested bundling features with tiered pricing, increasing adoption by 18% compared to static pricing.\n\nWhen you allow AI to continuously refine pricing, you can reduce churn rates and optimize customer acquisition costs, all without needing a massive pricing team or constant manual analysis. I\u2019d say you must explore adaptive pricing AI early. It\u2019s a strategic lever that can simultaneously improve margins and customer loyalty in ways static strategies simply can\u2019t.\n\nAljay Ambos, Lead SEO & Marketing Consultant, Twixify\n\nRelated Articles"

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Mac mini (M4) AirPods 4 with ANC iPhone 16 iPad mini (7th-generation) MacBook Pro (M4) iPad Pro (M4)\n\nApple took some big swings this year with the Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence. It feels like early days for both of those, though I can\u2019t say either have felt like a genuine success.\n\nAnd yet, there were lots of Apple products peppered throughout the year that live up to the company\u2019s high reputation of quality. As you\u2019ll notice, these definitely fall in line with the more established products in Apple\u2019s ecosystem. But that doesn\u2019t take anything away from just how good these were and how much they impressed our team of reviewers here at Digital Trends.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMac mini (M4)\n\nThe Mac mini has long been an ignored product in Apple\u2019s lineup, despite being the most affordable Mac you can buy. It had used more or less the same design for over a decade, despite the bumps to performance in the Apple Silicon era.\n\nBut in 2024, the Mac mini became impossible to ignore. Not only did the redesign make it more compact, it also received the bump to 16GB as a starting RAM configuration without increasing the price. This is a huge deal for a mini PC that was already so affordable. There\u2019s simply no value in the world of computers quite like the base configuration of the M4 Mac mini right now. It\u2019s not perfect \u2014 the placement of the power button is silly and the storage configuration prices get a bit insane. But as a base, there\u2019s just never been a mini PC or Mac of any kind quite like it.\n\nAirPods 4 with ANC\n\nApple launched the AirPods 4 alongside its new iPhone, but also launched an interesting secondary model, eloquently named AirPods 4 with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation). Originally a feature exclusive to the AirPods Pro, you can now get ANC in AirPods for just $179 compared to the $249 of the AirPods Pro 2. The main difference, however, is that it doesn\u2019t include ear tips. Though the sound quality won\u2019t ever be immersive \u2014 especially for all ears \u2014 if ear tips bother you (or gross you out), this is a great way to go.\n\nIn our review of both pairs of wireless earbuds, we noted that the base AirPods 4 \u201cdo sound better than the previous generation,\u201d and that the ANC model \u201csound even better by nature of the fact that they so successfully remove outside sounds from the sonic canvas.\u201d And to sum things up: \u201cThere is no better ANC in an open-ear earbud.\u201d That\u2019s quite a ringing endorsement from our audio experts.\n\niPhone 16\n\nMuch has been said about the current status of the iPhone and its now very complicated and nuanced lineup. But among all the higher-end options available, our phone reviewers were most impressed by the base iPhone 16. It lacks all the bells and whistles of the Pro and Pro Max models, of course, but for a $799 phone, it\u2019s probably the iPhone most people should be upgrading to this year. The tweaked design, punctuated by the new color options, really make this stand out compared to previous models, too.\n\nOur reviewer, Joe Maring, was really taken aback by the new colors and redesigned camera module on the back, so much so that he says the following: \u201cIt still looks like an iPhone, but there\u2019s enough new here that it feels fresh and exciting in a way the iPhone 16 Pro does not.\u201d The 60Hz refresh rate feels a little old-school, as does the lack of an always-on display.\n\nBut it\u2019s great to see Apple ensure that its most affordable iPhone (outside the iPhone SE) really feels like something new. In 2024, that\u2019s really saying something.\n\niPad mini (7th-generation)\n\nIf there\u2019s one product category that Apple unequivocally owns, it\u2019s the small tablet. There are hardly any players left in the game, and that\u2019s largely because of just how good the $499 iPad mini really is. It\u2019s not trying to replace your MacBook, but it\u2019s the perfect travel companion or couch device. In 2024, that hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 it\u2019s just gotten better.\n\nIn our review, we wrote about just how perfect the form factor is, paired with the silky smooth performance of the A17 Pro chip. Yes, Apple Intelligence features still feel half-baked, but that doesn\u2019t change just how fantastic a device the iPad mini still is, now in its 7th generation.\n\nIt still has some of the problems with the older iPad design, whether that\u2019s the awkward webcam placement, the lack of a headphone jack, and the not-quite-bright-enough display. And yet, it\u2019s a great example of just how good Apple\u2019s refinements to this under-appreciated product category really have become.\n\nMacBook Pro (M4)\n\nBringing the M4 to the MacBook Pro didn\u2019t feel like a revelation. We knew it would happen, and it played out very much how we assumed it would, adding a more powerful Neural Engine and significant boost to CPU and GPU performance over the M3.\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t expect, however, was the other changes Apple had up its sleeve. For the first time since its launch, the M4 MacBook Pro feels like a really good option, so much so that it successfully undercuts the 15-inch MacBook Air. The most important upgrade is the bump to 16GB of RAM, which finally makes this the \u201cPro\u201d device it deserves to be. Add in the option for the really awesome nano-texture display that deflects glare, and you\u2019ve got the makings of a very solid generational upgrade. The M4 Pro and M4 Max continue to startle with how much GPU performance they\u2019re able to scale up, as always, but the improvement to the 14-inch M4 model really were the most impressive this time around.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\n\nSet all the debates aside about the direction of the iPad Pro and the future of how it compares with MacBooks. Taken on its own, the M4 iPad Pro is just an immaculate tech product. Apple made a lot of small tweaks to improve the design this time around, whether it\u2019s changing the position of the webcam for better video calls or just squeezing an insane amount of performance in with the M4.\n\nThrow in the insanely bright and vivid tandem OLED display \u2014 a feature still missing from MacBook Pros \u2014 and you see how much Apple is able to juice up its iPads with breakthrough technology. According to our testing in the review, the new display tech not only improved image quality but also helped with battery life. Our reviewer boldly called it \u201cthe best tablet ever I\u2019ve ever used.\u201d\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t quite arrived, it feels easier than ever to replace a basic laptop or MacBook Air with an iPad Pro, and that\u2019s thanks to just how incredible the hardware is. We\u2019ll keep waiting on the software to catch up, but that doesn\u2019t take anything away from just how good this year\u2019s iPad Pro update was."

            "article_content": "Managing expenses effectively is crucial to maintaining financial integrity. However, the rise in fraudulent expense claims poses a significant challenge for organizations worldwide. Fraudulent activities not only drain resources but also damage trust within the workplace. Detecting such fraud manually can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. This is where machine learning comes into play, offering innovative ways to combat expense fraud efficiently and proactively.\n\nWhat Is Expense Fraud?\n\nExpense fraud refers to the act of submitting false or exaggerated claims for reimbursement. Employees may manipulate receipts, inflate mileage claims, or create fake invoices to gain undeserved compensation. Common examples of expense fraud include:\n\nSubmitting personal expenses as business-related costs.\n\nAltering the amounts on genuine receipts.\n\nCreating entirely fictitious receipts or invoices.\n\nReimbursing duplicate claims for the same expense.\n\nThese fraudulent activities can cost businesses thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually. While traditional audits can uncover some discrepancies, they often miss more sophisticated schemes. This highlights the need for advanced technologies like machine learning to tackle fraud more effectively.\n\nThe Role of Machine Learning in Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning (ML) leverages algorithms that analyze data, learn patterns, and make predictions. Unlike rule-based systems, ML models continuously improve over time as they process new data. In the context of expense fraud detection, machine learning offers the following advantages:\n\nAutomated Data Analysis: ML systems can process vast amounts of expense data in real time, identifying anomalies that may signal fraudulent behavior.\n\nPattern Recognition: By analyzing historical data, machine learning models can detect unusual patterns that deviate from normal expense behaviors.\n\nRisk Scoring: ML algorithms assign risk scores to expense claims, flagging those with high likelihoods of fraud for further review.\n\nAdaptive Learning: As fraud tactics evolve, machine learning models adapt by learning new patterns and identifying emerging threats.\n\nKey Machine Learning Techniques for Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning employs various techniques to identify fraudulent expense claims. Below are some of the most commonly used approaches:\n\nSupervised Learning\n\nSupervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the outcomes (fraudulent or non-fraudulent) are already known. The model learns to classify new expense claims based on the patterns it observes in the training data. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks are commonly used in supervised learning for fraud detection.\n\nUnsupervised Learning\n\nUnlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. This approach is ideal for detecting unknown types of fraud. Techniques like clustering and anomaly detection help group similar data points and identify outliers. For instance, if an employee\u2019s expense claim is significantly higher than their peers\u2019, the system flags it for investigation.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nNatural language processing is used to analyze text-based data, such as descriptions in expense claims. NLP can identify inconsistencies, suspicious keywords, or unusual phrasing that may indicate fraudulent intent.\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\nReinforcement learning involves training models through a reward-based system. In fraud detection, the algorithm receives rewards for accurately identifying fraudulent claims and penalties for false positives or negatives. This iterative process improves the model\u2019s accuracy over time.\n\nBuilding an Effective Machine Learning Framework for Fraud Detection\n\nImplementing a machine learning-based expense fraud detection system requires careful planning and execution. Below are the critical steps:\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nThe first step is gathering expense-related data, such as receipts, invoices, and transaction records. Preprocessing this data is crucial to ensure accuracy and consistency. Steps include:\n\nCleaning and removing duplicate entries.\n\nConverting unstructured data into structured formats.\n\nNormalizing numerical data for better model performance.\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering involves selecting and creating relevant variables (features) that help the model identify fraud. Examples include:\n\nFrequency of claims per employee.\n\nAverage claim amount by department.\n\nExpense categories with unusually high costs.\n\nModel Training and Testing\n\nOnce features are defined, the next step is training machine learning models. A portion of the data is used for training, while the rest is reserved for testing. This ensures that the model performs well on unseen data.\n\nDeployment and Monitoring\n\nAfter successful testing, the model is deployed to monitor expense claims in real-time. Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are essential to maintain effectiveness and adapt to new fraud patterns.\n\nChallenges in Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection\n\nWhile machine learning offers powerful tools for expense fraud detection, it is not without challenges. Some common obstacles include:\n\nData Quality Issues: Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to unreliable model predictions.\n\nHigh False Positives: Over-sensitive models may flag legitimate claims as fraudulent, leading to inefficiencies.\n\nEvolving Fraud Tactics: Fraudsters continuously adapt, requiring models to be updated regularly.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Handling sensitive financial data necessitates strict adherence to data protection regulations.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach involving robust data governance, regular model audits, and input from domain experts.\n\nBenefits of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nDespite the challenges, machine learning brings numerous benefits to expense fraud detection:\n\nEfficiency: Automating fraud detection reduces the manual workload, allowing finance teams to focus on high-priority tasks.\n\nAccuracy: ML models often outperform traditional methods, identifying subtle patterns that humans might miss.\n\nScalability: Machine learning systems can handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for organizations of all sizes.\n\nCost Savings: By preventing fraud, businesses can save significant amounts of money that would otherwise be lost.\n\nReal-World Applications of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMany organizations have successfully implemented machine learning to combat expense fraud. For instance:\n\nCorporate Finance Departments: Large corporations use ML tools to monitor employee expense reports, flagging anomalies in real-time.\n\nExpense Management Software: Companies like Expensify and Concur integrate machine learning algorithms to provide fraud detection features for their clients.\n\nFinancial Institutions: Banks and credit card companies employ ML models to detect suspicious transactions that could indicate fraudulent expense claims.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpense fraud is a pressing issue that requires proactive measures to mitigate its impact on businesses. Machine learning offers a transformative solution, enabling organizations to detect and prevent fraud with unprecedented efficiency.Furthermore, By leveraging techniques like supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, companies can build robust fraud detection systems that evolve alongside emerging threats. Although challenges remain, the benefits of machine learning far outweigh the drawbacks, making it an indispensable tool in the fight against expense fraud. Organizations that invest in this technology not only safeguard their finances but also foster a culture of transparency and trust."

            "article_content": "Once upon a time, cybersecurity was simple: build a wall, lock the door, and hope the bad guys couldn\u2019t pick the lock. But in today\u2019s multi-cloud reality, that door has turned into a revolving one, and the bad guys have VIP passes. Enter Zero Trust, the policy that assumes everyone is a suspect. Sapna Nair, General Manager of Saviynt India, gives us a front-row seat to the challenges, breakthroughs, and the occasional absurdity of building a secure fortress in a borderless digital world.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFrom leveraging AI and machine learning to address visibility gaps to implementing cloud-native solutions for secure identity and access management, she offers a comprehensive guide to overcoming hurdles and achieving Zero Trust success in multi-cloud frameworks.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhat unique challenges do multi-cloud environments pose for companies adopting a zero-trust security model?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nCloud environments are scalable and elastic, which means that resources are ephemeral. Solutions designed for static on-premises IT infrastructures fail to provide full protection. Cloud environments are borderless computing ecosystems in which distributed workforces can access resources from anywhere, making the traditional \"castle and moat\" model of perimeter security insufficient.\n\nWith a Zero Trust approach, the security strategy is \"never trust, always verify.\" Users must verify their identity every time they access a cloud resource. Zero Trust, however, is very difficult to manage in a multi-cloud environment. Each cloud provider has its own security model and IAM construct. Visibility across multiple clouds is very hard to achieve.\n\nHow are you helping clients integrate zero-trust principles with their existing cloud security frameworks?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSaviynt\u2019s Identity Cloud is a cloud-based platform that converges identity security onto a single solution to support Zero Trust initiatives around access control and data protection in hybrid and multi-cloud environments:\n\nIdentity Governance and Administration \u2013 ensures deep visibility into the access every identity has, as well as applying right-sized access across ecosystems by enforcing role and application access controls\n\nPrivileged Access Management \u2013 to provide time-bound, least privileged access for elevated privileges\n\nAdvertisment\n\nApplication Access Governance \u2013 that prevents segregation of duties (SoD) or policy conflicts across environments\n\nExternal Identity Management \u2013 to gain control over external party activities\n\nWhat role does AI and machine learning play in enabling zero-trust architectures within multi-cloud frameworks?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhere activity or settings in one cloud may be deemed acceptable, how other clouds are deployed can impact security across environments. The use of AI and machine learning can greatly speed the detection and remediation of troublesome activities and access that would otherwise be missed. AI/ML continuously learns about the activity taking place within your organization and becomes more accurate over time to quickly identify violations.\n\nAI and machine learning deliver strong capabilities in aggregating and normalizing data from different sources and support continuous compliance by simplifying management for administrators with centralized reporting.\n\nCould you discuss any specific zero-trust solutions or services your company offers that address the challenges of multi-cloud data protection?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSaviynt Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a cloud-native PAM solution built on a converged cloud identity governance platform. It provides a single control plane to manage security and identity across multi-cloud environments and enables cloud admins and DevOps teams access cloud resources on a just-in-time, just-enough access (least privileged access) basis.\n\nWhat strategies or tools do you recommend for organizations struggling with secure identity and access management across different cloud providers?\n\nFind a solution that can centralize data from disparate sources and automate as much of the detection and remediation capabilities as possible. Point solutions often leave gaps in visibility while increasing management complexity and costs. Enabling just-in-time access throughout all environments also limits and prevents excessive access.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAdditionally, leveraging the following cloud security and governance best practices to position your organization to mitigate security risks presented by operating in the cloud:\n\n\u25cf Import fine-grained access permissions and usage activity so you understand who is doing what and who has access to what\n\n\u25cf Classify your data in the cloud based on content, identity, access, and usage\n\n\u25cf Standardize policies for requesting data from specific cloud-based applications\n\n\u25cf Intercept access grants to files or roles, and evaluate new instances against current business policies\n\n\u25cf Leverage continuous controls monitoring for all cloud applications, collaboration, or infrastructure vendors\n\n\u25cf Ensure separation of duties across all cloud providers\n\nHow can companies measure the success of zero-trust implementation in a multi-cloud setup?\n\nThere are several key performance indicators organizations can use to measure success. These can be used to identify and establish trends, and identify where remediation should begin. Among these are:\n\nIncrease or decrease of privileged access violations\n\nPercentage of identities mapped across different cloud platforms\n\nDetection and remediation of duplicate identities, orphan accounts, and service accounts\n\nRemoval of outlier access\n\nNumber of shared service accounts\n\nWhat are the best practices for incident detection and response under a zero-trust framework?\n\nDon\u2019t rely on annual audits but strive to maintain continuous compliance with \u201calways on\u201d monitoring that actively surveys activity and provides alerts for anomalous activities and excessive or abandoned access. Automate as much as possible so security teams can be more proactive in their threat detection and response duties. Streamline policies across all environments, allowing you to simplify security management and better support compliance with internal and external frameworks and regulations.\n\nIn your experience, what are the most common pitfalls organizations face with zero-trust in multi-cloud deployments?\n\nCommon challenges we see include the lack of a centralized security program that provides visibility across all cloud environments and the inability to normalize security policies across vendors. Many organizations also have difficulty integrating existing legacy or on-premises systems with their cloud environments and don\u2019t account for third-party/external access.\n\nRemember, zero-trust is a journey. Begin with an assessment of your current environment compared to where you want to be. Focus on which user accounts and identities, devices, application workloads, and automated services or machine identities are granted access to which resources, when, and how this is accomplished (policies). Then, build out a strategy and team that can help you reach your goal."

            "article_content": "2024 has been a challenging year for China. As its government has tackled economic problems at home, internationally it has handled the complexities of an alliance with Russia. And, while China has continued to play a significant role in the global economy, there are five possible areas that could derail its plans in 2025.\n\n1. Renewed rivalry with the US\n\nThe most obvious concern for Beijing will be the reignition of an ultra-aggressive US policy towards China, after Donald Trump steps into office in January. Trump has already threatened China and several other nations with 60% tariffs, which suggests a continuation of the ongoing trade war that he started during his previous presidency.\n\nA more contentious relationship with the US will pose a significant challenge for China \u2013 but Beijing is not unprepared for it, having learned from the previous US trade war. This can be seen in how Chinese firms such as Huawei have sought to reduce their reliance on US markets and technologies while expanding into other fields.\n\nEqually, China has been more willing to use punitive measures against the US, as was recently demonstrated by its restriction on the export of rare earth elements (used for batteries and catalytic converters). As a result, Beijing is better placed to fight a trade war than it was in 2017.\n\n2. Global technology wars\n\nWhile tariffs will undoubtedly attract the most attention, it\u2019s possible that another battle will be waged over China\u2019s technological development, which poses a notable challenge to US trade supremacy.\n\nTechnology has become an increasingly crucial element in China\u2019s plans, with Beijing looking to grow jobs and production in this sector, in part by increasing its exports. Equally, curtailing this has become a priority for the US, underlined by its efforts to restrict Chinese access to semiconductor technology \u2013 one of the new key battlefronts.\n\nAs well as a contest to gain dominance over key technologies, it is also a competition over setting the standards for technology. This is demonstrated by what has been labelled the \u201cBeijing effect\u201d, whereby China aims to set standards for digital infrastructure in the same way that the EU has for data management and privacy through its GDPR legislation. Such a move could potentially grant China strategic leadership in the tech world.\n\n3. Tariffs from the EU\n\nChina has an equally challenging trade conflict with Europe, in the form of a series of tit-for-tat tariffs \u2013 with Beijing slapping import tariffs on French brandy, for example, in response to EU restrictions on imports of Chinese electric vehicles to EU member states. These come at a time where China has started to make inroads into technologies that were once the preserve of other nations.\n\nA trade war with the EU, coupled with recent discussions about expanding Nato\u2019s role in Asia, could pose a headache for Beijing, especially if this leads to greater alignment between Brussels and Washington. There again, Trump\u2019s established antagonism towards the EU could potentially work in China\u2019s favour, if it means the EU is looking for other partners.\n\n4. Allying with Russia\n\nOn the surface, Russia has become increasingly vital for China as a source of natural resources and markets \u2013 while China is a key source of economic support for Moscow. However, this support has adversely affected China\u2019s relations with European states, some of which have seen Beijing as a facilitator of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nEqually, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war may continue to be a useful distraction for Beijing, keeping US attention away from China.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed peace plan for the Ukraine war, if successful, could allow the US to focus back on China. A resolution of that conflict could even provide an avenue for rapprochement between Washington and Moscow, which would work against Beijing.\n\n5. Conflicts in the Middle East\n\nAn emerging source of concern for China is the severe instability in the Middle East. As with Russia, the region has become a key source of resources and markets for Beijing \u2013 demonstrated by the Zhuhai airshow, where nations from the region were key customers for Chinese arms.\n\nAnother concern for Beijing has been the potential for a regional conflict between Iran and Israel, with the former a key source of oil for China. In the event of an armed conflict, these supplies could be disrupted if not cut off completely, which would create further economic problems for Beijing.\n\nEqually, the reignition of the Syrian civil war has highlighted an area of concern for President Xi Jinping. Chinese Uyghurs (a largely Muslim ethnic group) have been involved in forces overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad, particularly as part of the Turkestan Islamic party (TIP). Some members of the TIP have been threatening to use weapons acquired in Syria in the long-running battle for a separate state in the Xinjiang region of China, where the Uyghurs are based.\n\nIn the past few years, Xi\u2019s forces have rounded up around a million Uyghurs and placed them in detention camps, and enforced a policy of re-education and intensive surveillance which has drawn international criticism for its tactics and authoritarianism.\n\nRead more: Three possible futures for the global economy if Trump brings in new trade tariffs\n\nWhile all these factors suggest China faces a difficult 2025, there are also signs that Beijing is preparing to mitigate them. Not least, China will be studying the sanctions regime deployed by the west against Russia, and which would likely be used against China in the event of a conflict over Taiwan.\n\nUltimately, how 2025 works out for Beijing will be crucial to whether it decides it needs to make new allies, develop new markets, and create new economic strengths in the technology field."

All this and more on the December 30 edition of World Street.\n\nJimmy Carter Dies at 100\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter, aged 100, has passed away, the Carter Center announced Sunday. Carter, who had been in hospice care since February 2023 at his home in Plains, Georgia, died peacefully, surrounded by family. The Nobel laureate, known for his humble beginnings and leadership from 1977 to 1981, spent his later years advocating for global peace and human rights.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nOpenAI Plans for a For-Profit Shift in 2025\n\nOpenAI revealed plans to transition into a public benefit corporation by 2025, enabling more flexible funding and operations. The company stated it needs significant capital to maintain its mission as AI development costs soar. Investors have expressed interest, but OpenAI says conventional equity is essential to meet the scale of financing required.\n\nJeju Air Shares Hit Record Low\n\nJeju Air shares fell 8.4 percent on Monday, hitting a record low of 6,920 won after a deadly crash at Muan International Airport killed 179 people. Earlier in the session, the stock plunged 15.7 percent. Shares of its parent company, AK Holdings, also dropped 12 percent, reaching their lowest level in 16 years. This was the budget airline's first fatal accident since its founding in 2005.\n\nTrump Asks SC to Delay TikTok Ban\n\nDonald Trump has requested the U.S. Supreme Court to pause a law set to ban TikTok or force its sale, arguing for time to pursue a political solution after taking office. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner, must sell the app to a U.S. company by Jan. 19 or face a ban. With over 170 million U.S. users, TikTok is seeking to overturn the law before its deadline.\n\nU.S. Debt Ceiling Could Be Reached by Jan. 14\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the U.S. could hit its debt ceiling as early as Jan. 14. In a letter to lawmakers, Yellen urged swift action to maintain the nation\u2019s credit. She noted a $54 billion reduction in debt on Jan. 2 due to Medicare-related securities redemption, but extraordinary measures may still be needed between Jan. 14 and Jan. 23 to avoid default."

These factors will probably dominate the headlines and there will be a widespread belief that they will have a large economic impact.\n\nIn fact, such things seldom do.\n\nIn 2024, for instance, access to one of the world\u2019s most important shipping routes, namely through the Red Sea, was severely curtailed but the much anticipated disaster for global supply chains failed to happen. Conflict in the Middle East intensified \u2013 but oil prices fell.\n\nMany of the geopolitical risks for 2025 are associated with the return of Donald Trump to the White House. It is now widely believed in both policy circles and the financial markets that there will soon be a US-brokered negotiated peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. From a human point of view that would be wonderful, but would it have a major economic impact?\n\nSince most Western countries are unlikely to re-establish close ties with Russia in the wake of such an agreement, I doubt that there would be the sustained fall in global energy prices that many think might be the result.\n\nOn the opposite tack, a conflict between the US and Iran would be taken to threaten much higher global oil prices, but if this were to materialise, extra supply from Saudi Arabia and the US would counter this influence.\n\nWith regard to geopolitical influences on the world economy, the one big exception is the possibility of a conflict between the US and China over Taiwan. The economic consequences of this would be huge. But most good judges assess the likelihood of this happening in the coming year as fairly low.\n\nThat risk aside, things look set to be ok for the world. Global growth of something like 3pc is a reasonable prospect, similar to what was recorded in 2024. Admittedly, this is low by past standards but it would hardly be a disaster.\n\nUS growth may slow as a result of Trump\u2019s tariffs. While China may also slow in the second half, it should again confound all those people who perennially see it as on the brink of some major economic collapse. One major global feature, and a harbinger of the more distant future, is that India will probably be the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy.\n\nWithin Europe, growth is likely to remain sluggish, with both France and Germany weak. A notable exception is Spain, where growth prospects are good.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "I still can\u2019t quite believe that I\u2019m using an Arm-powered Windows laptop every day. After more than a decade of trying to make Windows on Arm a reality, Microsoft and Qualcomm finally nailed it this year with Copilot Plus PCs. These new laptops have excellent battery life and great performance \u2014 and the app compatibility issues that have plagued Windows on Arm are mostly a thing of the past (as long as you\u2019re not a gamer). Microsoft wanted 2024 to be \u201cthe year of the AI PC,\u201d but I think it was very much the year of Windows on Arm. If 2024 was anything to go by, 2025 is going to be even bigger for Windows on Arm.\n\nMicrosoft set the stage for the 2024 year of Windows on Arm announcements in January at CES with promises of AI PCs and the first big change to Windows keyboards in 30 years. Laptop manufacturers started putting a Copilot key on keyboards early this year, providing quick access to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant. While the Copilot experience on Windows has gone through several confusing revisions, it\u2019s still a key I accidentally press and then get frustrated when a Copilot window appears.\n\nAfter the Copilot key was met with a lukewarm reception, Microsoft reignited the Mac vs. PC war a few months later. Inside Microsoft, confidence had gradually been growing throughout the early months of 2024 that it could finally beat Apple\u2019s MacBook Air after falling behind for years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the company\u2019s new Copilot Plus PC devices at a special event in May, setting the stage for a summer of Windows on Arm laptops from every major OEM.\n\nThe processor is the key\n\nThe key to Windows on Arm\u2019s revival this year was Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processors, which were announced in April. They\u2019ve provided the type of performance and power efficiency only previously available with Apple\u2019s MacBooks and challenged Intel and AMD to do better in the x86 space. After much debate over Microsoft\u2019s MacBook Air-beating benchmarks, the reviews rolled in and showed that Windows on Arm was indeed capable of matching and beating Apple\u2019s MacBook Air. Qualcomm even hired the \u201cI\u2019m a Mac\u201d guy to promote Windows on Arm PCs, showing how confident it was in challenging Apple\u2019s laptop dominance.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best Windows laptops available right now. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm also worked closely with developers to make key apps compatible, and it\u2019s now very rare to run into an app compatibility issue that can\u2019t be solved by a native Arm64 version or Microsoft\u2019s improved emulator. Even Google, which previously shunned Windows Phone, has created Arm64 versions of Chrome and Google Drive to support Microsoft\u2019s efforts. With developers continually providing native versions of their apps, it makes it a lot easier to switch to a Windows on Arm laptop. The only big exception is gaming, where x86 still reigns supreme for compatibility and performance.\n\nIntel didn\u2019t sit still while all this Windows on Arm hype was occurring, nor AMD. Intel struck back with Lunar Lake at IFA in September, delivering impressive performance and battery life improvements. AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen AI chips are also competing directly with Qualcomm, and both AMD and Intel have the key advantage of game compatibility that Windows on Arm is definitely not ready for.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting for an M4-powered MacBook Air, Apple did refresh its cheapest MacBooks in October with a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM. Apple would probably argue it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence, but the unusual change came months after Copilot Plus PCs launched, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM at price points that challenge the MacBook Air. Apple did manage to squeeze its new M4 chip into the MacBook Pro recently, though, showing that Qualcomm has some ground to make up in 2025.\n\nApple and Microsoft have both been focusing on AI-powered features for laptops this year, and the end results have been underwhelming on both sides. While a lot of the initial Copilot Plus PC buzz was around Windows on Arm, Microsoft also rolled out some Windows AI features on these devices in June.\n\nIncomplete Recall\n\nThe flagship feature was supposed to be Recall, a feature that snapshots mostly everything you do on a laptop and then lets you recall moments or scroll through a timeline of how you\u2019ve used your PC. But because Recall was met with privacy and security concerns, undermining Microsoft\u2019s entire Copilot Plus PC marketing effort, Microsoft was forced to delay Recall several times to improve its security. In fact, it has only recently appeared in test versions of Windows.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Microsoft\u2019s stumbles with Recall will mean the company slows down with its Windows AI efforts. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri recently told me that the very future of Windows is about cloud and AI, so expect a lot more of this in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly focusing on Windows AI features like Recall. Image: Microsoft\n\nComing in 2025\n\nNext year will also be a fascinating battle between x86 and Windows on Arm. AMD and Intel are teaming up to fend off Arm-based chips from Qualcomm, and Intel is facing a period of turbulence after ejecting its CEO, facing desktop chip issues, and a wave of layoffs earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see 2025 as the year that Windows on Arm continues to eat into the laptop space. A Dell leak revealed Qualcomm is preparing new chips for 2025, and the chip maker has also been rolling out cheaper Arm-based chips to bring laptop prices down. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll see more of those at CES in January, alongside the usual slew of laptops that set the stage for the year.\n\nThe Dell leak also hinted at Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU plans, which now look set for a CES announcement. Leaks suggest we\u2019ll see RTX 50-series desktop GPUs and even the laptop variants, with OEMs rumored to be preparing new models to show at CES. Given the Windows on Arm gaming situation, a new generation of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs could help generate fresh excitement around x86 laptops throughout 2025.\n\nNvidia might also be planning to help the Windows on Arm effort. The chip maker has long been rumored to be planning to launch Arm PC chips as soon as 2025. Nvidia\u2019s expertise in AI chips and gaming could certainly shake up the Windows laptop world and make Windows on Arm even more enticing."

            "article_content": "2024 has been a landmark year in gaming, offering an exceptional range of titles across genres for every type of player. Whether you're a fan of deep narrative-driven RPGs, high-stakes action, or engaging co-op experiences, this year's releases have been nothing short of stellar.\n\nWith some highly anticipated sequels and breakout new IPs, players were treated to a buffet of exciting and immersive worlds. We've selected seven of the most hyped and celebrated releases of the year, each one a defining experience for both seasoned players and newcomers alike.\n\nImage: Square Enix\n\n1. Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (PS5)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Rebirth, released in 2024, continues the retelling of the iconic RPG saga, picking up where the 2020 Remake left off. As the second part of a trilogy, Rebirth takes Cloud and his allies beyond Midgar into the open world of Gaia, offering an immersive experience for both longtime fans and newcomers.\n\nRebirth expands on familiar characters while introducing fresh twists, keeping even veteran players intrigued. The story explores bold, alternative paths while staying true to the emotional core of the original. The combat system, refined from Remake, blends real-time action with tactical command inputs. The ability to switch between characters mid-battle and seamlessly blend magic, melee attacks, and powerful summons creates a dynamic flow that is both challenging and rewarding.\n\nVisually, Rebirth showcases the PS5's power with stunning environments and lifelike character animations that heighten the emotional impact. Square Enix has crafted a modern RPG masterpiece, balancing nostalgia with innovation, making Rebirth both familiar and fresh for all players.\n\nImage: PlayStation Studios\n\n2. Helldivers 2 (PS5, PC)\n\nSet in a universe inspired by Starship Troopers, Helldivers 2 tasks players with defending humanity against an onslaught of alien threats. The game is built around teamwork, with up to four players joining forces to complete missions across hostile planets.\n\nFriendly fire is always enabled, adding a layer of strategic complexity to the chaotic firefights. Players must coordinate their movements and attacks carefully, lest they accidentally wipe out their own squad in the heat of battle. The game's procedurally generated missions ensure that no two playthroughs are alike, keeping the gameplay fresh and unpredictable. One moment, you might be defending a base from a horde of insect-like aliens and the next moment, you're escorting a convoy through a treacherous wasteland.\n\nCombined with a deep progression system, the variety of mission types gives Helldivers 2 immense replayability. Customisation is another area where the game excels. Players can equip their Helldivers with a wide array of weapons, gadgets, and perks which allow gamers different playstyles and tactical approaches.\n\nWhether you prefer to play as a heavy-hitting tank, a stealthy sniper, or a support role, the game offers plenty of options to tailor your loadout to your preferences.\n\nImage: Atlus\n\n3. Metaphor: ReFantazio (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nFor fans of Atlus' Persona series, Metaphor: ReFantazio was one of the most anticipated titles of 2024, and it did not disappoint. Taking the signature style of the Persona franchise and applying it to a medieval fantasy setting, Metaphor offers a refreshing twist on the traditional JRPG formula while maintaining the depth and character-driven narratives that Atlus is known for.\n\nSet in a world embroiled in political intrigue and mystical forces, Metaphor: ReFantazio follows a group of protagonists as they navigate a series of personal and political conflicts in a sprawling kingdom. Metaphor places a strong emphasis on character development and social dynamics. Players must build relationships with their allies, make difficult moral choices, and uncover the secrets of their pasts while battling powerful enemies in a turn-based combat system.\n\nThe game's combat is where Metaphor sets itself apart from other JRPGs. It introduces a new strategic layer, allowing players to exploit enemy weaknesses while managing elemental affinities and unique abilities. The blend of magic and medieval weaponry gives combat a dynamic feel, keeping each encounter engaging and tactical.\n\nVisually, Metaphor is a feast for the eyes, with its striking character designs and fluid animations. The game's art direction brings its fantasy world to life, combining gothic architecture with lush forests and eerie dungeons.\n\nImage: Capcom\n\n4. Dragon's Dogma 2 (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nDragon's Dogma 2 showcases Capcom's talent for creating immersive, challenging open-world RPGs. Building on the original's cult following, the sequel expands its fantasy world with enhanced visuals, new mechanics, and more freedom to explore.\n\nSet in a vast world of castles, forests, and dungeons, Dragon's Dogma 2 emphasizes player choice and dynamic combat. Players can choose from various 'vocations' like Rogue, Warrior, or Sorcerer, each offering distinct playstyles and deep customisation options. The game's combat system shines, rewarding precision and strategy over simple button-mashing. Players must learn enemy patterns, exploit weaknesses, and use the environment to gain an edge. AI-controlled 'pawn' companions, who adapt to the player's strategies, add further depth to the gameplay.\n\nA standout feature is the 'Dragonsplague' system, where fallen party members may resurrect as enemies under this mysterious force, adding a layer of consequence to battles. With its rich, expansive world and challenging combat, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a must-play for open-world RPG fans, offering both depth and adventure in a beautifully crafted setting.\n\nImage: GameScience\n\n5. Black Myth: Wukong (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated games of 2024, Wukong has quickly captivated players with its breathtaking visuals and action-packed gameplay. Developed by the Chinese studio Game Science, Wukong is inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, bringing the legendary Monkey King, Sun Wukong, to life like never before.\n\nIn Wukong, players assume the role of Sun Wukong, a mythical figure with incredible powers, including shapeshifting and wielding the mystical Ruyi Jingu Bang staff. The game's combat system blends martial arts with mystical abilities, offering players the ability to transform into various creatures to gain new powers, essential for both combat and puzzle-solving. The transformation mechanic adds a unique twist, as players must strategically shift forms to tackle powerful enemies or solve complex puzzles.\n\nThe world of Wukong is visually stunning, showcasing advanced graphics that transport players into a mythical version of ancient China. From lush bamboo forests to ancient temples, every environment is meticulously crafted, immersing players in an atmosphere enhanced by realistic lighting, fluid animations, and a dynamic soundtrack.\n\nRich in lore, the game invites players to explore and uncover the deep narrative tied to Chinese mythology, making it a standout title for action RPG enthusiasts.\n\nImage: Wuthering Waves official website\n\n6. Wuthering Waves (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nWuthering Waves is an open-world action RPG with a post-apocalyptic setting, blending fast-paced combat with deep storytelling. Developed by Kuro Games, it has drawn comparisons to titles like Genshin Impact but stands out with its darker, more mature narrative and complex character progression.\n\nPlayers explore a sprawling world ravaged by catastrophe, uncovering secrets about humanity's downfall while battling powerful enemies using an innovative combat system. Wuthering Waves allows players to switch between characters mid-battle, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles, giving it a fast and tactical feel. The game also features a rich world filled with hidden lore, side quests, and environmental storytelling, making exploration as rewarding as combat.\n\nFor those who enjoy open-world exploration with deep narratives, Wuthering Waves is a standout in 2024.\n\nImage: Zenless Zone Zero official Facebook page\n\n7. Zenless Zone Zero (PC, PS5)\n\nFrom miHoYo, the creators of Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero is a fast-paced urban fantasy action RPG set in the futuristic city of New Eridu. The game follows the aftermath of a supernatural event that has caused chaos, leaving the world overrun by creatures known as Ethereal. Players assume the role of a 'Proxy', a special operative guiding survivors through perilous dungeons called Hollows.\n\nWhat sets Zenless Zone Zero apart is its combo-driven combat system. Players can chain attacks and switch between characters mid-battle, with each character offering a unique fighting style, ranging from martial arts to futuristic weaponry. The real-time action is fast and fluid, complemented by stunning special effects that elevate the intensity of combat.\n\nThe game's urban setting, filled with neon-lit streets and high-tech architecture, creates a stark contrast to the supernatural elements that haunt the world. The vibrant art style and sleek visuals make the city of New Eridu feel both modern and chaotic, giving the game a distinctive identity."

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "From a love letter to the crime novel and a dystopian UK to a taut political thriller, our writers pick this year's most spellbinding reads...\n\nSir Ian Rankin\n\nThe Cracked Mirror\n\nby Chris Brookmyre\n\nYou can always depend on Chris Brookmyre to surprise you \u2013 no two books of his are the same. The Cracked Mirror starts off looking like a homage to Agatha Christie (note the title), with a little old lady investigating minor misdemeanours in a rural village.\n\nBut then we switch to the hard-boiled streets of the USA and a maverick cop with a thirst for violence. Soon the two are thrown together, leading to absurdist flashes and heavy artillery in the English countryside. The twists are outrageous but Brookmyre, the master puppeteer, takes the reader with him.\n\nA love letter to the crime novel and an ingenious reinvention of the same, this is a winner from beginning to end.\n\nMidnight And Blue (Orion \u00a325, 352pp) by Ian Rankin is out now\n\nSir Ian Rankin at the 2024 Edinburgh International Book Festival\n\nCarys Davies\n\nShy Creatures\n\nby Clare Chambers\n\nLike her previous novel Small Pleasures, Clare Chambers\u2019 Shy Creatures is a delight. She is so good at writing about suburban life in the middle of the last century, and her portrait of a particular time and place is as enjoyable as the unravelling of the mystery at the novel\u2019s heart: the discovery of William Tapping, a mute man who has been living hidden from the world for nearly three decades. At the local psychiatric hospital, Tapping comes under the care of thirty-something art therapist Helen Hansford who, when she is not busy having an affair with one of the hospital\u2019s doctors, sets out to unravel Tapping\u2019s past.\n\nChambers\u2019 elegant and precise prose is a joy, and in Helen she conjures with excruciating sharpness the everyday humiliations of being a mistress and the feeling of not being quite at home in changing times \u2013 not to mention the utter awfulness of English food in the 1960s.\n\nClear (Granta \u00a312.99, 160pp) by Carys Davies is out now\n\nClare Mackintosh\n\nDay One\n\nby Abigail Dean\n\nAbigail Dean\u2019s debut, Girl A, was a global bestseller, and she proved she\u2019s no one-trick pony with her follow-up, Day One. It\u2019s a brutal yet beautiful account of a school shooting, and Dean gives us a glimpse into the aftermath of one terrible day told through multiple perspectives, although the primary narrative comes from two troubled voices.\n\nTeenager Marty gradually releases her secrets to us as she relives each hour, while conspiracy theorist Trent is obsessed with finding the truth. The result is a novel that focuses not on the shock factor of the shooting itself, but on the legacy of guilt, lies and grief. A compelling and heartbreaking story that stayed with me long after I turned the final page.\n\nOther People\u2019s Houses (Sphere \u00a316.99, 400pp) by Clare Mackintosh is out February 2025\n\nClare Mackintosh poses on a chaise longue at her home\n\nJoseph O\u2019Connor\n\nThe Garden Against Time\n\nby Olivia Laing\n\nColm Toibin is such a wonderful writer, not so much describing characters as incarnating them on the page, so you believe in them completely and care about them. His novel Long Island was a major 2024 highlight.\n\nAs a student, I wandered into a gig by John Cooper Clarke. I\u2019ve adored his poems and performances ever since. He\u2019s sometimes seen as a punk rock Pam Ayres; others sense Bob Dylan. But he\u2019s a totally original writer, words blazing with sardonic humour and wisdom. His 2024 collection WHAT is brilliant.\n\nMy book of the year is The Garden Against Time by Olivia Laing, a truly remarkable work about gardening, the outdoors, storytelling, mental health, the freedom to be found in nature, and much more besides, written by an author of breathtaking skill.\n\nThe Ghosts Of Rome (Harvill Secker \u00a320, 384pp) by Joseph O\u2019Connor is out January 2025\n\nConn Iggulden\n\nA Stroke Of The Pen\n\nby Terry Pratchett\n\nAs Terry Pratchett began as a novelist, he was also producing short stories for the Western Daily Press under the name \u2018Patrick Kearns\u2019.Those lost stories are collected here. On the theory that a book of the year should be one that gives joy, this is like slipping into a warm bath.\n\nThey are early works, before Discworld. Yet his joy in names is there, in \u2018Even Moor\u2019, \u2018Horace Breezeforth\u2019 and \u2018Constable Biddle\u2019. The voice is his, reminding me of the vast pleasure his books gave. As he once said: \u2018Build a man a fire and he\u2019ll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire and he\u2019ll be warm for the rest of his life.\u2019 This book brings back memories of a warm and funny man taken far too soon.\n\nNero (Penguin Michael Joseph \u00a322, 416pp) by Conn Iggulden is out now\n\nDavid Nicholls\n\nGlorious Exploits\n\nby Ferdia Lennon\n\nFerdia Lennon\u2019s debut Glorious Exploits is about ancient Athenian prisoners of war putting on a play. This might sound inaccessible, but the book is funny, original and very moving. I also loved Richard Flanagan\u2019s combination of history and memoir, Question 7, Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s epic Our Evenings, Kaliane Bradley\u2019s The Ministry Of Time and Samantha Harvey\u2019s Booker-winning Orbital.\n\nYou Are Here (Sceptre \u00a320, 368pp) by David Nicholls is out now\n\nDavid Nicholls, author of One Day, at the Hay Festival 2024\n\nSamantha Harvey\n\nJames\n\nby Percival Everett\n\nNot a very left-field or original choice but James, by Percival Everett, was one of my reading highlights this year. It\u2019s an adventure story whose ironic, almost absurd Voltaire-esque tone invites you to laugh, and leaves the laugh hollow when the register suddenly switches to unbearable violence or loss. It\u2019s multiple books in one, and asks you to be multiple readers.\n\nI also loved Two-Step Devil by Jamie Quatro, a wildly daring book about the relationship between a self-styled \u2018prophet\u2019 living in the American South and a young woman he rescues from sex trafficking. The novel is both epic and tender, utterly contemporary and also timeless. Quatro is inventive with form and voice and always provocative and questioning, as well as upending what we think we know about people, faith, morality and mercy.\n\nOrbital (Vintage \u00a39.99, 160pp) by Samantha Harvey is out now\n\nJohn Boyne\n\nHeart, Be At Peace\n\nby Donal Ryan\n\nDonal Ryan\u2019s Heart, Be At Peace is a worthy sequel to The Spinning Heart, the novel that brought him to the attention of the reading public (and the Booker judges). Returning to the many voices of that book, Ryan describes how Irish small-town life can often be defined by unfulfilled aspirations and complex family relationships. For me, he is the greatest current Irish writer, and this deservedly won at the recent Irish Book Awards.\n\nIn non-fiction, I loved Conor Niland\u2019s The Racket. Ireland\u2019s most successful tennis player recounts his years scrapping for ranking points and the exhilaration of qualifying for all four Grand Slam tournaments. It\u2019s a memoir drenched in passion for his sport, love for the family that supported him and deserved pride in his achievements.\n\nFire (Doubleday \u00a312.99, 176pp) by John Boyne is out now\n\nAlice Feeney\n\nAll The Colours Of The Dark\n\nby Chris Whitaker\n\nAll The Colours Of The Dark is like stepping inside a future classic. From the first page you know you are reading something special, cleverly crafted and beautifully written. Every sentence, every word, has been carefully thought about before earning its place. The story of Patch and Saint is one you won\u2019t forget. It will linger in your heart and mind. Some might say this is an epic crime novel, others a spellbinding love story. I think most would agree it is a masterpiece. If you read only one book this year, make it this one.\n\nBeautiful Ugly (Macmillan \u00a316.99, 320pp) by Alice Feeney is out January 2025\n\nBritish novelist Alice Feeney's new book Beautiful Ugly is out next month\n\nWilliam Boyd\n\nQuestion 7\n\nby Richard Flanagan\n\nRichard Flanagan\u2019s fractured, patchwork memoir, Question 7, is beautifully constructed, mesmerising and quietly powerful. Ostensibly about his memories of his father and his mother, it manages to weave in all manner of subjects: the bombing of Hiroshima, the love affair between Rebecca West and H.G. Wells, Flanagan\u2019s own near-death experience. The disparate parts form an utterly absorbing whole.\n\nHanif Kureishi\u2019s Shattered \u2013 his searing account of the awful accident that left him a tetraplegic \u2013 is a stunning testimonial to his habitual, unflinching honesty and remarkable courage.\n\nJulian Evans\u2019s Undefeatable: Odesa In Love And War is at once a brilliant portrait of the Ukrainian city and the author\u2019s emotional connection with it, and a reminder of the dark consequences of Putin\u2019s insane, hubristic war. An important, moving, humane book.\n\nGabriel\u2019s Moon (Viking \u00a320, 272pp) by William Boyd is out now\n\nNicholas Sparks\n\nImpossible Creatures\n\nby Katherine Rundell\n\nIt\u2019s not often I recommend a children\u2019s book, but Impossible Creatures is one that readers of all ages will enjoy. It follows a boy who teams up with a girl from a secret world populated by mythical beasts, to figure out why they are vanishing. Full of big ideas, exciting action, real emotions (the kind that I like to explore) and beautifully descriptive sentences, this is the sort of book that turns young readers into lifelong ones. It\u2019s also a book adults will delight in, with its timeless charm, largely because it will transform them to their own childhood and remind them why they fell in love with reading in the first place.\n\nCounting Miracles (Sphere \u00a322, 368pp) by Nicholas Sparks is out now\n\nAmerican author Nicholas Sparks poses ahead of his interview on the Kelly Clarkson show\n\nTom Parker Bowles\n\nSteak\n\nby Tim Hayward\n\nSteak is, perhaps, food writer Tim Hayward\u2019s meaty masterpiece. Beautifully written, exhaustively researched and exquisitely designed, it covers everything from hard science, recipes and technique, to the world\u2019s best butchers, restaurants and chefs. Not just a bible for all things beefy, but a paean to the manifold pleasures of the flesh.\n\nBox Office Poison, by film critic Tim Robey, is a history of Hollywood through its flops. But this is so much more than a list of megabucks disasters \u2013 it\u2019s as much a love letter to under-appreciated classics as it is a brilliant evisceration of utter turkeys. Robey is a fine writer, with a profound and passionate knowledge of his subject. In terms of pure enjoyment, this is a box-office smash.\n\nCooking And The Crown (Aster \u00a330, 240pp) by Tom Parker Bowles is out now\n\nElif Shafak\n\nThe Haunted Wood\n\nby Sam Leith\n\nThis history of childhood reading is brilliantly constructed, well-researched and beautifully written, a wonderful book for anyone who believes in the magic of stories. From the tales of Aesop through to Roald Dahl and the present day, Leith shows how many children\u2019s authors were \u2018writing from a wound\u2019, such as J.M. Barrie, who created Peter Pan. The Haunted Wood is a great book with deep knowledge, empathy and wisdom, reminding us that the stories we read as children shaped us and shaped our societies.\n\nThere Are Rivers In The Sky (Penguin \u00a318.99, 512pp) by Elif Shafak is out now\n\nTurkish author Elif Shafak at the Cliveden Literary Festival 2024\n\nVal McDermid\n\nGliff\n\nby Ali Smith\n\nA new book from Ali Smith is always a cause for rejoicing. But after the extraordinary tour de force of the Seasonal Quartet, which became a quintet with Companion Piece, I did wonder what she could do to stand alongside such an achievement.\n\nI needn\u2019t have worried. Gliff was my book of 2024, a year that saw many stand-out novels. It\u2019s set in a fictional universe, a future-adjacent dystopian UK as imagined by Kafka. The title is a Scots dialect word that means a moment in time, a shock of fright, a shimmering trace or a glimpse, and each of these meanings has its place in an atmospheric story.\n\nPast Lying (Little, Brown \u00a39.99, 512pp) by Val McDermid is out now\n\nDan Jones\n\nThe Eagle And The Hart\n\nby Helen Castor\n\nIt has been a golden year for books about the Middle Ages. The best \u2013 indeed, one of the finest historical biographies I have read \u2013 was this book about Richard II and Henry IV. It narrates the tangled tale of two royal cousins \u2013 one born to be king but incapable of doing the job (Richard II, played by Ben Whishaw in TV\u2019s The Hollow Crown), the other born to do the job but cursed by his own actions in seizing England\u2019s crown.\n\nThe Hollow Crown with Ben Wishaw as Richard II\n\nHelen Castor brings this world alive thanks to her deep understanding of the norms of 14th-century England and a priceless human intelligence: her book is both a taut political thriller and an infinitely nuanced character study. Written with equal verve was Juliet Firnhaber-Baker\u2019s House Of Lilies \u2013 a family history of the Capetians, who ruled France from 987 until 1328."

            "article_content": "As the year draws to a close, China has set its sights firmly on the future, with a roadmap laid out during the recently concluded annual Central Economic Work Conference. The focus is clear \u2014 scientific and technological innovation will be the cornerstone of the nation's economic strategy heading into 2025.\n\nThe goal is nothing short of transformative \u2014 to create new quality productive forces and overhaul China's industrial system, building a framework for a modernized, tech-driven economy.\n\nAs a journalist, I find it fascinating to see how the country is positioning itself at the forefront of the next industrial revolution.\n\nWith major technological projects and large-scale demonstrations of new technologies, China is laying the groundwork for fostering new quality productive forces. This initiative, which centers around emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things, promises to dramatically reshape industries across the board.\n\nThe government is keen to foster innovation in emerging sectors, nurturing the industries of the future while ensuring that China maintains its competitive edge in strategic technological areas.\n\nYu Hongjun, former vice-minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, explained that China's push into digital infrastructure is already paying off.\n\nOver the past few years, the country has made major strides in establishing a robust digital economy.\n\nThe widespread adoption of 5G and the development of 6G satellite communication systems have set the stage for what Yu calls a smart, connected economy.\n\nHe said during the World Internet of Things Convention held recently in Beijing that the rise of new IoT, new data and new business models are quietly but powerfully reshaping China's economic landscape. This is the bedrock of the new quality productive forces the country is betting on for long-term success.\n\nAs I dug deeper into the details, I realized the scale of what's unfolding here.\n\nHe Xuming, chairman of the World Internet of Things Convention Executive Committee, said the global digital economy, driven by IoT technologies, is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent. This year, global IoT connections are expected to increase by more than 23 percent to surpass 25 billion.\n\nWhat's even more impressive is that China is leading the charge in IoT infrastructure construction and innovative development in the digital economy.\n\nChina is poised to build over 4.3 million 5G base stations this year, helping to connect over 3 billion IoT devices, said He, adding that the traditional digital economy in China is projected to reach an annual output value of over 70 trillion yuan ($9.59 trillion), growing at a rate of more than 20 percent. With nearly a million companies already operating in the IoT space, the groundwork for China to lead in new quality productive forces is well underway.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing aspect of this push is its potential to trigger the fourth industrial revolution. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said the core of this revolution is the convergence of digital technologies with manufacturing processes. The digitalization of industry, Wei argues, will redefine global production systems, and China, with its advanced manufacturing supply chains and digital leadership, is uniquely positioned to spearhead this transformation.\n\nWei further emphasized that the fourth industrial revolution will not only drive economic growth, but also profoundly impact China's social structure, economic models, and the relationship between humans and nature.\n\nAs I reflect on these developments, it's clear that the shift toward new quality productive forces, driven by AI, IoT and other next-generation technologies, will inevitably position China as a global innovation powerhouse.\n\nThe government's proactive approach to fostering these changes is strategic, forward-thinking and deeply embedded in its broader economic goals for the next few years.\n\nThe story unfolding here isn't just about economic growth \u2014 it's about reshaping the very fabric of industry and society in ways we're only just beginning to comprehend.\n\nAs 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on China to see how it executes this ambitious plan and whether it can truly lead the world into the next industrial revolution."
