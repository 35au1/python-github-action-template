In the No. 2 slot is Washington, with one sighting per 1,093 people, but the state is a serious hotbed for bigfoot appearances. No. 3 is Florida, with one sighting for every 1,444 residents. And, No. 4 is Oregon, with one sighting per 1,156 people. Louisiana has the least sightings in the whole country.\n\nIf by chance you happen to see a UFO, report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, not the U.S. government.

        "article_content": "For the believers and nonbelievers, the Pentagon answered whether UFOs or aliens have ever visited Earth, saying there is no evidence.\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder fielded several questions from reporters on Thursday on topics such as the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the use of B-2 bombers to conduct precision strikes on five military sites controlled by Houthi forces in Yemen, and North Korean soldiers fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine. On top of those subjects, the daily news cycle is filled with nonstop election coverage.\n\nJeff Schogol of Task & Purpose, which provides military news, culture and analysis by members of that community, took the opportunity to go off-topic with Ryder, and asked about one of Earth\u2019s biggest mysteries.\n\n\"Given the news cycle, you could announce anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life, and no one would care,\" Schogol said. \"So\u2026I\u2019m just going to take the shot. What do you got on UFOs, aliens, etc.?\"\n\nPentagon Ufo Report Finds No Alien Evidence: \u2018If Us Won\u2019t Fess Up, Other Nations Will,' Expert Warns\n\nSatellite imagery shows a UFO at night.\n\n\"The truth is out there, Jeff, and the truth is, we have no evidence to indicate extraterrestrial life has visited the planet,\" Ryder said.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\nThe spokesperson\u2019s message was the same that was given months ago on the topic after the coordination of efforts to get to the bottom of whether UFOs, unidentified anomalous phenomena, UAPs, and aliens had been to Earth.\n\nOn July 20, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced the establishment of an All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\n\u2018Ufo Revolution\u2019 Docuseries Shows Uap Flying Over Military Base, \u2018Blows Up Decades Of Conspiracies\u2019: Expert\n\nRecording of a UFO flying by the USS Omaha off the coast of San Diego in July 2019.\n\nAARO\u2019s mission is to synchronize efforts across the DoD and other U.S. federal departments and agencies to \"detect, identify and attribute objects of interest\" in or around military facilities or airspace, which could pose a threat to safety of operations or national security \u2014 this includes anomalous, unidentified space, airborne, submerged and trans medium objects.\n\nThen in November, the DoD set up a website to report government activity related to unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), also known as UFOs.\n\nBut after setting up the AARO and conducting multiple investigations, the DoD claims there is no evidence any UAPs came from out of this world.\n\n\"The aggregate findings of all USG investigations to date have not found even one case of UAP representing off-world technology,\" according to the report, which was released on March 1, and \"authentic sensitive national security programs\" were \"mistaken\" with UFO programs.\n\n\"AARO has no evidence for the USG reverse-engineering narrative provided by interviewees and has been able to disprove the majority of the interviewees\u2019 claims,\" the report says, although \"some claims are still under evaluation.\"\n\nRussian Ufo Engagements, Secret \u2018Tic Tac\u2019 Report And 3 Key Figures Slip Under Radar At Congressional Hearing\n\nRemains of an alleged \"non-human\" on display during a briefing on unidentified flying objects in Mexico City in September 2023.\n\nOther conclusions put forth in the report include the public's general mistrust of the government and \"perceived bureaucratic barriers,\" intense secrecy related to military programs and growing interest in UFOs.\n\nTo put the rapidly growing interest in UFOs into perspective \u2014 a once-considered taboo subject that destroyed careers, like Bob Lazar's after he was essentially forced to hide in exile, had its own Super Bowl commercial.\n\nRyder, at around the same time the report was released, said there was no evidence that any information was \"illegally or inappropriately\" withheld from Congress.\n\nClick To Get The Fox News App\n\n\"What we found was that claims of hidden programs are largely the result of circular reporting by a small group repeating what they heard from others and that many people have sincerely misinterpreted real events for mistaking sensitive U.S. programs as UAP or being extra-terrestrial exploitation,\" he said.\n\nFox News Digital's Chris Eberhart and Louis Casiano contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Pentagon answers question of whether UFOs and aliens have visited Earth"

Most fascinating perhaps is a reported clause in OpenAI's contract with Microsoft that cuts off Microsoft's access to OpenAI's tech if the latter develops so-called artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning an AI system capable of rivaling human thinking. TC has asked OpenAI for comment, but the Times -- which talked with 19 people familiar with the companies' relationship -- says the clause aims to ensure Microsoft can never misuse the technology."

But after seeing \u201cgreat interest\u201d with more than 4,300 people signing up in the first week, according to Gov. Jim Justice, four more check-in spots have been added.\n\nIn north central West Virginia, the Silver Run Tunnel along the North Bend Rail Trail in Ritchie County, which is believed to be haunted by a woman in a white dress, and Cryptid Mountain Miniature Golf in Morgantown have both been added.\n\nSutton in Braxton County picked up a third location, the West Virginia Bigfoot Museum, meaning that you can earn the 3-stop prize just by exploring the town.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s Flatwoods Monster featured in new anime television series\n\nThe fourth new stop is the Hempfield Tunnel in Wheeling, which is believed to be haunted by the souls of those buried beneath its tracks.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see the love the Paranormal Trail is receiving from both in-state residents and travelers near and far,\u201d said West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby in a press release. \u201cThese four new stops give folks even more mysterious locations to explore, just in time for Halloween.

        "article_content": "Archeologists in Denmark have made one of the most notable discoveries in recent history: a group of 50 skeletons found in a burial ground, believed to be from the Viking Era. The skeletal remains could help scientists unearth some of the mysteries around Viking DNA, and provide new answers about this centuries-old civilization.\n\nThe skeletons were reportedly preserved due to favorable conditions near the burial site; they were discovered in mid-October near the village of \u00c5sum, a remote settlement located three miles from Denmark's third-largest city, Odense, on the island of Funen. And scientists are just now getting started on unlocking the puzzles behind these ancient remains.\n\nWhat did the archeologists discover?\n\nA team from Denmark's Museum Odense located the burial site, which covers around 21,500 square feet and \"was used in the 8th and 9th centuries,\" the museum said in a press release. A \"total of 50 inhumation graves and five cremation graves have been found, placing the burial ground among the largest Viking burial sites discovered on the island of Funen.\" The discovery proves that the area was a \"key geographical point for the earliest urban developments\" in what would become modern Denmark. The graves contained men, women and children.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Sign up\n\nSeveral of the skeletons \"belonged to high-status individuals in society, as seen from the grave goods they were buried with,\" said the Museum Odense press release. This includes a woman who was \"buried in a wagon, the upper part of a Viking cart used as a coffin,\" as well as another grave containing a \"fine bronze three-lobed brooch, a single red glass bead that hung on a cord around the deceased's neck, an iron knife, and a small piece of rock crystal.\"\n\nWhat can these skeletons tell us about the Vikings?\n\nThe finding of the graves \"opens a whole new toolbox for scientific discovery,\" Museum Odense curator Michael Borre Lund\u00f8 said to Newsweek. The museum is hoping to perform DNA analysis on the recovered skeletons to see what information can be obtained from their bones.\n\nThis discovery in particular is rare because of the well-preserved nature of the remains. Often \"when we excavate bodies from the Viking age, we are lucky if there are just a few teeth,\" Lund\u00f8 said to CNN. But in this case, the dampness of the region meant that for \"long periods of time the bodies of the Vikings were covered in water, which slows down the decomposition of the bones.\u201d\n\nAs noted in the museum's press release, DNA testing on the skeletons could provide information on the \"general health, diet, and origins of those buried\" in \u00c5sum. DNA imaging \"might even reveal whether the buried Vikings were related, which would be particularly significant, as this has never been examined in similar graves.\" This could \"give us a much better idea of people's ages, sex, what diseases they might have had,\" and more, Lund\u00f8 said to CNN.\n\nScientists are \"really hoping to gain the larger picture,\" conservator Jannie Amsgaard Ebsen said to The Associated Press. \"Who were the people that were living out there? Who did they interact with? It's a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle: all the various puzzle parts will be placed together.\" Archeologists are continuing to dig up some of the area around \u00c5sum, CNN reported. Most of the skeletons themselves have already been removed from the burial site, and are currently awaiting further testing and DNA extraction."

The workflow categorizes incoming messages into four distinct groups: 1. High priority, 2. Customer support, 3. Promotional and 4. Finance/billing.\n\nEach category triggers a set of specific actions, making sure that emails are managed appropriately and efficiently. This intelligent classification system dramatically reduces the need for manual sorting and prioritization, allowing you to focus on responding to the most critical messages first.\n\nAI Agent Email Manager (100% Automated)\n\nHere are more detailed guides from our wide-ranging content that you may find helpful on this topic.\n\nStreamlining High-Priority Email Handling\n\nWhen the system identifies a high-priority email, it springs into action, performing two crucial tasks:\n\n1. Drafting responses: The workflow automatically generates draft responses in Gmail, providing you with a head start on addressing urgent matters.\n\n2.

Content summarization: Each promotional email is concisely summarized, highlighting key points and offers.\n\n2. Action recommendations: The system provides suggestions for further action, such as archiving, following up, or deleting.\n\n3. Manual review option: Unlike other categories, promotional emails don\u2019t receive automatic responses, allowing for human oversight to ensure alignment with marketing strategies.\n\nThis balanced approach helps you stay informed about promotional content without cluttering your inbox or auto-responding to marketing messages.\n\nStreamlining Finance and Billing Processes\n\nFor finance and billing-related emails, the system implements a specialized workflow:\n\n1.

        "article_content": "Earlier today, OnePlus confirmed plans for its next-gen software overhaul based on Android 15, but so far, details of its upcoming flagship have remained tightly under wraps. Well, it seems leaks have other intentions.\n\nOn the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, an image allegedly depicting the OnePlus 13 has been making rounds. Moreover, the material comes from a reliable source (Digital Chat Station), which lends further credibility to the leak.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhen it comes to the design, it seems that OnePlus is playing it close home once again. The camera island at the back appears to have been borrowed from the OnePlus 12. This time around, however, we have a small metallic line linking the camera hump to the right edge of the frame.\n\nAbove the line is a minimalist \u201cH\u201d logo, which is again a clear sign that Hasselblad camera tuning will also be used on the OnePlus 13. The most notable change, however, seems to be flat metallic sides.\n\nOver the past few generations, OnePlus flagships have sided with curved metallic frames, which actually feel a lot more comfortable to hold. The imminent tweak seems like an undesirable change and one that follows in the aesthetic footsteps of Samsung and Apple.\n\nBut what sets the OnePlus 13 apart is the texture on the rear shell, which is apparently inspired by rocks or minerals of some kind, with a familiar matte texture to it. I am quite fond of the surface finish on the OnePlus 12, and the leaked image suggests that the upcoming phone won\u2019t stray too far.\n\nOnePlus recently told Digital Trends that it is experimenting with natural materials like marble to design its phones, and so far, the results have been mighty impressive.\n\nIn addition to a black trim, it seems a pearl-white color option is also on the design table for the OnePlus 13. The company already offers something similar on the OnePlus 12, and my colleague Tushar Mehta liked it so much that he labeled it as \u201cElvis Presley of Android Phones.\u201d\n\nAs far as the innards go, there will be three camera lenses at the back, while the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 silicon will provide the firepower. We are also hearing rumors of a unique localized refresh rate tech for the screen, a larger battery, and some AI boost for the OxygenOS software experience.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems a price hike will also tag along with the long list of generation-over-generation changes. The phone is expected to launch close to the end of October, but that\u2019s likely the release timeline for the Chinese market, while a global debut will commence a few weeks later."
